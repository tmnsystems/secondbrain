## Continuous Integration

The Continuous Integration (CI) system automates the testing, linting, building, and quality checking of the application code. It uses GitHub Actions to run these processes whenever code is pushed to the repository.

### CI Workflows

The CI system includes the following workflows:

1. **ci.yml**: Main CI pipeline that runs on push to feature branches.
2. **pr-validation.yml**: CI pipeline that runs on pull requests.
3. **dependency-updates.yml**: Automated dependency updates.

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Checkout**: Checkout the code from the repository.
2. **Setup**: Set up the environment for the CI process.
3. **Lint**: Run linting to ensure code quality.
4. **Test**: Run tests to ensure code correctness.
5. **Build**: Build the application code.
6. **Security**: Run security checks on the code and dependencies.
7. **Docker**: Build and publish Docker images.

### CI Utilities

The CI system includes the following utilities:

1. **Pipeline Manager**: Tracks the status of the CI pipeline.
2. **Test Runner**: Runs tests in parallel for faster CI.
3. **Code Quality**: Checks code quality metrics.

## Continuous Deployment

The Continuous Deployment (CD) system automates the deployment of the application to different environments. It uses GitHub Actions to deploy the application when the CI pipeline passes.

### CD Workflows

The CD system includes the following workflows:

1. **cd.yml**: Main CD pipeline that runs on push to main branch or on manual trigger.

### CD Pipeline

The CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Checkout**: Checkout the code from the repository.
2. **Setup**: Set up the environment for the CD process.
3. **Build**: Build the application code.
4. **Docker**: Build and publish Docker images.
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the target environment.
6. **Verify**: Verify the deployment was successful.

### Deployment Strategies

The CD system supports the following deployment strategies:

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy to a new environment and switch traffic after verification.
2. **Canary Deployment**: Gradually roll out the new version to a subset of users.
3. **Direct Deployment**: Deploy directly to the target environment.

### CD Utilities

The CD system includes the following utilities:

1. **Deployer**: Handles deployment to different environments.
2. **Environment Manager**: Manages the deployment environments.
3. **Deployment Verifier**: Verifies the deployment was successful.

## Observability Stack

The Observability Stack provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring the application performance. It consists of three main components: logging, metrics, and tracing.

### Logging System

The Logging System provides a centralized logging solution for the application. It uses Winston for logging and supports multiple transports including console, file, and remote logging services.

#### Logging Features

1. **Structured Logging**: Logs are structured as JSON for easier parsing and analysis.
2. **Context Enrichment**: Logs are enriched with context information such as service name, version, and environment.
3. **Log Levels**: Supports different log levels for filtering logs.
4. **Multiple Transports**: Supports multiple destinations for logs including console, file, and remote services.

### Metrics System

The Metrics System provides a way to collect and export metrics from the application. It uses Prometheus for metrics collection and supports custom metrics and HTTP instrumentation.

#### Metrics Features

1. **Custom Metrics**: Supports custom metrics for application-specific monitoring.
2. **HTTP Instrumentation**: Automatically collects metrics for HTTP requests.
3. **Business Metrics**: Supports business-level metrics for monitoring application performance.
4. **Prometheus Integration**: Exports metrics in Prometheus format for integration with Prometheus.

### Tracing System

The Tracing System provides distributed tracing for the application. It uses OpenTelemetry for tracing and supports multiple exporters including Jaeger, OTLP, and Zipkin.

#### Tracing Features

1. **Distributed Tracing**: Supports tracing across multiple services.
2. **Context Propagation**: Propagates trace context across service boundaries.
3. **Span Attributes**: Adds attributes to spans for additional context.
4. **Multiple Exporters**: Supports multiple exporters for trace data.

### Unified Observability Manager

The Unified Observability Manager provides a single interface for all observability components. It combines logging, metrics, and tracing into a single cohesive system.

#### Observability Features

1. **Express Integration**: Provides middleware for Express applications.
2. **Business Events**: Records business events for monitoring business processes.
3. **Error Recording**: Records errors for later analysis.

## Dashboard System

The Dashboard System provides monitoring dashboards and alerting for system health and performance. It uses Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus for metrics, and Alertmanager for alerting.

### Dashboard Components

1. **Dashboard Manager**: Creates and updates dashboards in Grafana.
2. **Alert Manager**: Manages alerts in Alertmanager.
3. **Grafana Service**: Manages Grafana resources including datasources, users, and teams.

### Dashboard Templates

The Dashboard System includes the following dashboard templates:

1. **System Overview**: Overview of all services in the system.
2. **Sample App**: Dashboard for a sample application.

### Alerting

The Dashboard System includes the following alerting features:

1. **Alert Rules**: Rules for triggering alerts based on metrics.
2. **Alert Notification**: Notification channels for alerts including email, Slack, and webhooks.
3. **Alert Silencing**: Silencing alerts for maintenance or known issues.

## Error Tracking System

The Error Tracking System provides error tracking and reporting for application errors. It captures errors, adds context, and reports them to error tracking services.

### Error Tracking Components

1. **Error Tracker**: Captures and tracks errors in the application.
2. **Error Reporter**: Reports errors to different platforms including Sentry, Slack, email, and GitHub.
3. **Error Management System**: Combines error tracking and reporting into a unified system.

### Error Tracking Features

1. **Error Capturing**: Captures errors including unhandled exceptions and rejections.
2. **Breadcrumbs**: Adds breadcrumbs for additional context.
3. **Context Enrichment**: Enriches errors with context information.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Limits the rate of error reporting to prevent overwhelming error tracking services.
5. **Express Integration**: Provides middleware for Express applications.

## Configuration

### CI/CD Configuration

The CI/CD system is configured through GitHub Actions workflow files in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### Monitoring Configuration

The monitoring stack is configured through files in the `config/monitoring/` directory:

1. **prometheus.yml**: Configuration for Prometheus.
2. **alertmanager.yml**: Configuration for Alertmanager.
3. **loki.yml**: Configuration for Loki.
4. **promtail.yml**: Configuration for Promtail.

  }
});

// Capture an exception
errorManagement.captureException(error, {
  level: ErrorLevel.ERROR,
  context: {
    additionalInfo: 'Additional information about the error'
  }
});

// Capture a message
errorManagement.captureMessage('Important message', {
  level: ErrorLevel.INFO
});

// Use in Express
app.use(errorManagement.expressMiddleware());
```

## Troubleshooting

### CI/CD Issues

1. **Workflow Failure**: Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions for details.
2. **Build Failure**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the build script is correct.
3. **Test Failure**: Check the test logs for details on which tests failed.
4. **Deployment Failure**: Check the deployment logs for details on the deployment failure.

### Monitoring Issues

1. **Prometheus Not Scraping**: Check the Prometheus configuration and ensure the targets are up and accessible.
2. **Loki Not Receiving Logs**: Check the Promtail configuration and ensure it's configured to send logs to Loki.
3. **Grafana Not Showing Metrics**: Check the Grafana datasource configuration and ensure Prometheus is configured as a datasource.

### Error Tracking Issues

1. **Errors Not Being Captured**: Ensure the error tracking middleware is added to the Express application.
2. **Errors Not Being Reported**: Check the configuration for the error reporting services and ensure they're correctly configured.
