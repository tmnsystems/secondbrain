# Strategic Insight: CRAFT Framework for Prompt Architecture

## Key Points

- The CRAFT framework provides a structured, repeatable approach to prompt engineering
- Components: Context, Role, Action, Format, Target audience
- Eliminates the need to reinvent prompts for similar tasks
- Ensures consistency across different AI models and agents
- Significantly reduces token usage by being precise and structured

## Master Plan Alignments

This content aligns with the following aspects of the Master Plan:

1. **Agent Behavior Guidelines**: The CRAFT framework directly enhances the existing agent guidelines by providing a structured approach to prompt engineering, improving consistency and effectiveness.

2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: By standardizing prompt structure, CRAFT enables better communication between different specialized agents, supporting the Planner, Executor, Reviewer pattern.

3. **Optimization & Iterative Improvement**: Aligns with "Optimize, Optimize, Optimize" pillar by providing a framework for continuous prompt refinement and improvement.

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on this insight, consider the following additions or modifications to the Master Plan:

1. **Standardize Agent Prompts**: Implement CRAFT framework across all agent prompts in the SecondBrain system to ensure consistency and quality.

2. **Create Prompt Templates**: Develop a library of CRAFT-based prompt templates for common tasks (summarization, analysis, code generation, etc.) to accelerate development.

3. **Add Prompt Testing**: Implement automated testing for prompts to verify they follow the CRAFT framework and produce expected results.

4. **Token Optimization**: Use the CRAFT structure to audit and optimize token usage across all system prompts.

## Action Items

- [ ] Refactor existing prompts in TubeToTask to follow CRAFT framework
- [ ] Create a prompt template library in the strategy_library directory
- [ ] Implement CRAFT validation in the insight reviewer agent
- [ ] Document CRAFT framework in the system documentation

## Verbatim Quotes

> "If you're building AI systems at scale, you need a consistent framework for your prompts. CRAFT gives you that structure without sacrificing flexibility."

> "Context primes the model with relevant information, Role establishes identity and expertise, Action defines the specific task, Format structures the output, and Target audience tailors the content appropriately."

> "By separating these components, you can easily modify one element without rewriting the entire prompt. It's modular prompt engineering."
