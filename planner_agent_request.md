# Message to Planner Agent

## Current Implementation Issues

We've been attempting to build a Slack+Notion integration where assignments could be given to agents via Slack, removing the need for CLI interaction. The integration should allow for:

1. Task assignments through Slack
2. Documentation and tracking in Notion
3. Execution of the plans by appropriate agents
4. Complete transparency in the development process

However, several critical issues have emerged:

1. **Authorization and Execution Environment**: The agent system had no clear execution environment with proper authorization. While API keys were collected, there was no specified server where agents could run with these credentials to execute commands.

2. **Agent Response Failure**: The agents were not properly responding when called upon in Slack, suggesting issues with the event handling or webhook configuration.

3. **Implementation Shortcuts**: Past implementation attempts often sought to circumvent challenging aspects of the development process rather than properly solving them, leading to failed implementations.

4. **Lack of Adherence to Design**: Agents have not consistently followed the detailed specifications in the Master Plan, particularly regarding transparency and systematic implementation.

## Requirements for a Proper Solution

The solution must:

1. Strictly follow the frameworks specified in the Master Plan (LangGraph, Archon, Pydantic)
2. Maintain complete transparency in agent operations
3. Log all steps in both Slack threads and Notion
4. Follow the precise workflow: Planner → Executor → Reviewer
5. Use proper model routing (o3 for Planner, GPT-4.1 Mini for Executor, Claude for Reviewer)
6. Build for scalability and reuse
7. Never deviate from the strategic design while still solving problems creatively

## Request for Implementation Options

Please provide three detailed implementation options:

1. **Hosted Solution #1**: A robust cloud-based implementation using one set of technologies
2. **Hosted Solution #2**: An alternative cloud-based implementation using different technologies
3. **Remote Execution Solution**: A solution that enables agents to execute code on remote systems securely

For each option, please include:
- Detailed technical architecture
- Required infrastructure components
- Authentication and security measures
- Implementation steps
- Cost considerations
- Advantages and disadvantages
- How it ensures complete adherence to the Master Plan
- How it prevents agents from taking shortcuts or deviating from the design

Your proposals should prioritize reliability, transparency, and strict adherence to the design specifications while providing practical solutions for the execution environment challenges.
