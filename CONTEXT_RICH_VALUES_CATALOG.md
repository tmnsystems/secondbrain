# Context-Rich Values Catalog: Tina's Teaching in Full Context

This document preserves the full context of Tina's value statements and teaching approach, capturing the holistic nature of her business philosophy without truncation.

## 1. The Holistic Business-Life Connection

### Full Context Example

```
"is and again with the holistic approach is because your business runs on you and you run on sleep and you trip in and everything else so do pay attention to it do what you can but the other thing was being obsessive about it doesn't do well so it almost seems like i'm being contradictory because we dug into it too much there's a difference with how much weight you give something mentally so i look at it but i don't think about it the rest of time i look at it and go huh maybe i'll try this put it in an experiment and then i'm not thinking about it anymore i don't worry about it so and knowing that you can make adjustments throughout the week like you did that with ester ester was giving you extra time to sleep in right so that was something that you did I do think that macros didn't make a little difference, but that's okay. If it doesn't just pay attention to those things, we don't need to talk about them. If you have any, you just like notice things are bad, rough, whatever, just see if anybody else has any ideas. if I have ideas, that's fine, but I love the business stuff too. But the holistic approach is always just, how are you? How are you taking care of yourself? Are you taking care of yourself? Do you are, you know, that's it. So it's a small conversation, a little bit every week, and I'll ask you that, are you taking care of yourself? How are you doing? Have you been feeling? That's important."
```

### Holistic Value Principles Demonstrated

This extended passage shows several key elements of Tina's values system:

1. **Business-body connection** - She explicitly connects business performance to physical wellbeing ("your business runs on you and you run on sleep")

2. **Balance between awareness and obsession** - Notice how she creates nuance between paying attention to health factors without becoming obsessive

3. **Experimental mindset** - Her approach to problem-solving is experimental rather than dogmatic ("I look at it and go huh maybe I'll try this put it in an experiment")

4. **Adaptation over rigidity** - She values making adjustments that fit your specific situation ("knowing that you can make adjustments throughout the week")

5. **Regular check-ins** - The value of consistent small interventions over dramatic changes ("it's a small conversation, a little bit every week")

6. **Prioritizing care** - She consistently centers the conversation on wellbeing as a foundation for business ("how are you taking care of yourself?")

## 2. Data-Driven Decision Making with Human Context

### Full Context Example

```
"Right it's great because when you when you watch those patterns it gives more certainty so sometimes it can alleviate stress but also like if you have it and just think oh I'm not doing well but the other thing the other potential issue is complacency and apathy about it and just like do the thing and then you realize that there's a pattern of a little less a little less a little less and it's much harder to try to correct what's happening you know when you're not watching it so and it's very it's so much easier to maintain than to catch up."
```

### Data Values Principles Demonstrated

This passage reveals Tina's nuanced approach to using data:

1. **Data creates psychological benefits** - She connects data tracking to reduced stress and increased certainty

2. **Awareness of slow decline** - She warns about the danger of not noticing incremental negative changes

3. **Preventative mindset** - The emphasis on maintenance over recovery ("so much easier to maintain than to catch up")

4. **Balanced perspective** - She acknowledges both positive (certainty) and negative (complacency) potential impacts of data

5. **Forward-looking orientation** - Using data to spot trends before they become problems

## 3. Business Systems Design with Purpose

### Full Context Example

```
"Yes. of everything that you have. So, then the other thing is potentially you might want like kind of like a dashboard workbook. So with Google Sheets, just like Excel, you can pull data in from multiple sheets and documents or because sometimes if you put too much data, they get big, they take too long to open. So pulling from multiple ones might be the thing to do, but either way, whatever, you want to have all the pertinent information in one source as often as possible like a snapshot slash dashboard so that it's very easy for you to be very mindful about where everything is and it's also very easy for you to track and make sure that whoever is responsible for getting the data is doing it because you have one thing to look at and is everything populated. So... Let's see, um, KPIs are, um, how many appointments coming in? how many get canceled would be a good one. So what else are you tracking that matters to you that, you know, a difference in your business?"
```

### Systems Value Principles Demonstrated

This passage shows Tina's approach to business systems design:

1. **Practical efficiency** - She considers technical limitations ("they get big, they take too long to open")

2. **Visibility as a priority** - The importance of having information visible and accessible ("very easy for you to be very mindful")

3. **Accountability integration** - Systems should make accountability clear ("track and make sure that whoever is responsible for getting the data is doing it")

4. **Focus on what matters** - Emphasis on tracking meaningful KPIs over vanity metrics

5. **Business-specific customization** - She asks what specifically matters to the client's business rather than imposing generic metrics

## 4. Balancing Profit and Quality of Life

### Full Context Example

```
"So, is that something that you think about? This is not the season of life, but you want to do it? I just want to understand what all the goals and the values are. are because I love that you guys have put a limit on and understood what happens if you scale up the burden of management. I think her having her company that she does really is a great kind of partnership because understanding that a lot of people just don't take that into account. They don't think about how much work it is to manage that increase. But it's a lot. And everything is a trade-off and sometimes that trade-off is just not worth it."
```

And further in the conversation:

```
"But right now, we're in a good place in our life, and it's pretty simple with just me and the other doctor for her and our manager. If we were to increase or double the size of that doctorable, we would have to increase the number. Scheduler has increased the number of editors, historians. The whole operation becomes more difficult with each doctor and astronaut just made the decision work. Right now, anyway, we're not going to expand..."

"...But, you know, much is that for the amount of work? Because now your operation is just ridiculous. And is that that much money for that amount of work?"

"I mean, I only work on this, what, four hour, five hours a week."

"You have a ceiling that you've installed intentionally. And you're okay with that. And so then the your wealth increase you would want through July or. Delta or other other things and just make sure that this is managed. As well as possible to reduce maybe the time the energy. Maybe increase the profit margins by improving operations, but not increasing business volume."
```

### Life-Profit Balance Value Principles Demonstrated

This extended conversation reveals Tina's nuanced approach to business growth and profit:

1. **Season-appropriate decisions** - Recognition that what's right depends on life stage ("This is not the season of life")

2. **Management burden awareness** - Explicit valuing of the hidden costs of growth ("what happens if you scale up the burden of management")

3. **Trade-off mindset** - The clear articulation that everything involves tradeoffs ("sometimes that trade-off is just not worth it")

4. **Intentional limitation** - Validation of deliberately choosing not to maximize revenue ("You have a ceiling that you've installed intentionally")

5. **Time valuation** - Acknowledgment that time is a scarce resource to be protected ("I only work on this, what, four hour, five hours a week")

6. **Operation efficiency focus** - Suggestion to improve margins through operations rather than volume ("increase the profit margins by improving operations, but not increasing business volume")

## 5. Ethical Client Relationships and Integrity

### Full Context Example

```
"So if you were to think about it, and again, these are accidents or whatever, do you think that there's any kind of follow-up care type of package that falls within your legal ability to offer to them that you would want to do that is just a tiny bit that would encourage them to come back that also might be paid for by insurance and somehow could be connected to, you know, is something that already pays helps them get it paid for and you get money in your pocket and they get a little additional like ethically actual real value. And then it could be something that's just let's increase your odds of making sure that everything's okay for you and that you know how to recognize the signs that I can compare how you work whatever."

[Later in the conversation]

"Right and so it maybe it was there before but they just didn't notice and then it starts nagging long enough that their brain goes oh actually this is bugging me I just didn't realize because a lot of people just don't realize but the attorney's office benefits right because if they if the injury is more significant then higher settlement and they get a higher percentage and then you get more business but ethically we're also helping the person who's busy who really doesn't want to deal with any of this doesn't want to deal with our health issues that might happen."

[And further]

"Because you're giving two authority sources, your attorney and your doctor telling you to do same thing. And as long as you know that you're being ethical about it, meaning there's nobody coming in, you're 100% sure they don't need to be reached out again, in which case you should tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up with this person so that you know you're operating an integrity."
```

### Ethical Business Value Principles Demonstrated

This conversation reveals Tina's approach to ethical business growth:

1. **Win-win-win mindset** - Finding opportunities where all parties genuinely benefit (client, attorney, doctor)

2. **Ethics as non-negotiable** - Repeated emphasis on ethical considerations as central to decision-making

3. **Value creation** - Focus on providing "ethically actual real value" to clients

4. **Systems for integrity** - Building integrity safeguards into systems ("tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up")

5. **Service orientation** - Centered on helping people who might miss important health issues ("a lot of people just don't realize")

6. **Long-term wellness view** - Consideration of long-term client outcomes ("more problems 10, 20, 30 years down the road")

## 6. Strategic Leverage Through Identifying Opportunities

### Full Context Example

```
"So, There's multiple questions in this, but the best way to, well, we're always looking for leverage, and leverage is how do we get more out of what we already have. So there are already people that are coming across your path that have given you authority for whatever reason, lottery doesn't matter, but they have to talk to you, they have to deal with all these limiting parameters, right, they didn't come to you because they're trying to improve their health or whatever."
```

And in another conversation about data analysis:

```
"Because what would be really interesting is to see some historical data over like the past two years month by month plotted to see if there's any kind of variation or any kind of pattern to observe by location."

[Later]

"I don't know. But looking at the data is how it helps us to figure out is there anything that we can really do about it."

"For example, because you are able to move locations easily, just kind of get a satellite office, whatever. If we happen to see that there is some shifting happening, you could do that. I know location that's just exploding right now. but for whatever reason, no doctors are increasing there or it's not increasing at a proportionate rate. And maybe that's only going to be for a short amount of time before somebody gets there. That short amount of time could be a year and half, so it takes you six months to get there. You have a year there kind of dominating the area because nobody else noticed."
```

### Strategic Opportunity Value Principles Demonstrated

This conversation reveals Tina's approach to finding business opportunities:

1. **Leverage identification** - Looking for ways to amplify results from existing resources

2. **Pattern recognition** - Using historical data to identify opportunities others miss

3. **First-mover advantage** - Valuing being first to recognize and act on opportunities

4. **Time windows** - Recognizing that opportunities have limited time frames ("maybe that's only going to be for a short amount of time")

5. **Strategic positioning** - Using data to position the business where opportunity exists

6. **Competitive advantage creation** - Looking for ways to "dominate" an area before others notice

## 7. Relationship-Based Business Connection

### Full Context Example

```
"door to make the meeting see there's lots of little things so I'll ask about it because I just want to make sure because we don't usually have people taking care of us in our business now you have your wife taking care of you but seeing how that correlation is to the business and also she's going through so much right now she needs to be taken care of so that's that's just kind of part of it so it's it was a getting to know you all these things love it all right..."
```

### Relationship Value Principles Demonstrated

This brief passage shows Tina's relationship-centered approach:

1. **Support recognition** - Acknowledging the support structures in someone's life

2. **Reciprocal care** - Noting when someone who provides care needs care themselves

3. **Business-relationship connection** - Seeing how personal relationships affect business

4. **Noticing small signals** - Paying attention to "little things" that indicate someone's state

5. **Care as foundation** - Fundamental view that care underlies business success

## 8. Operational Efficiency Through Delegation and Systems

### Full Context Example

```
"Love that.

So we'll do that.

Amazing job delegating, very, very good.

Now that I think about it, maybe I should just have her since she's actually in the county, maybe she should just put this into a spreadsheet."
```

And in the client's explanation of delegation:

```
"So I do want to put it on her because she's supposed to take everything off Esther's plate, manage the whole business, that part of it. So I did kind of put that in there to send me a little sentence or two every month about what she sees in our numbers, because if my numbers drop off, she's not going to have a job, right? If something has to get cut, Esther's going to come back to work, we're not going to need a manager anymore, you know, we're going to tighten ships. So it's in her best interest as well to like make sure my numbers stay popular."
```

### Operational Efficiency Value Principles Demonstrated

This conversation reveals Tina's approach to delegation and operations:

1. **Appropriate delegation** - Affirming delegation to the right person with right skills

2. **Alignment of incentives** - Noting how the manager's incentives align with business success

3. **Clarity of responsibility** - Ensuring clear ownership of tasks

4. **Continuous improvement** - Looking for ways to enhance existing processes

5. **Streamlined information flow** - Emphasis on getting summarized information ("a little sentence or two")

## 9. Data-Driven Strategic Expansion

### Full Context Example

```
"for you, what would be the human resources that you need, would be the marketing, like draw the whole picture, what would have to happen, what would be the timeline, what would be the cost, is there, are you going to be negative at any point, like are you going to have to output money, probably not, but if you did, what does that look like? And then, so the biggest math is going to be time and energy impact for you because if that, if we can keep that to something you're willing to do, let's say 10 hours a month, whatever that looks like, really do the math to that and the revenue because the numbers are going to tell you you should do it or not. I can just about bet with what I've seen in your schedule that another state, one other state could be like the whole difference of a year, but also what you learn out of it and the additional financial resources that it could give you to maybe put. towards other things, maybe hiring, maybe marketing firms, maybe better software, whatever, I don't really know, like we're really just getting into this. But doing a projection exercise about what it would look like to go into, and I would be strategic about even the projecting state, like I would run the projections across multiple states, get as much data as you can to kind of and figure that out."
```

### Strategic Expansion Value Principles Demonstrated

This detailed guidance reveals Tina's approach to strategic expansion:

1. **Comprehensive planning** - Drawing "the whole picture" before making decisions

2. **Time-energy equation** - Prioritizing the personal impact of business decisions

3. **Multi-scenario analysis** - Running projections across multiple possibilities

4. **Strategic state selection** - Being deliberately strategic about geographic expansion

5. **Learned expertise leverage** - Valuing what you "learn out of it" beyond direct revenue

6. **Opportunity cost awareness** - Considering what additional resources could enable

## 10. Quality of Life Decision-Making Framework

### Full Context Example

```
"it's not a problem for me either. like, I like not moving my calls unless I have vacation or something going on if I vacation, but otherwise stay on track makes it easier for me."
```

And discussing self-care:

```
"I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times a day if that's what it takes."

"I don't work long hours, but I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly."
```

### Quality of Life Value Principles Demonstrated

These passages reveal Tina's approach to sustainable business practices:

1. **Consistency as efficiency** - Recognizing that regular routines create simplicity

2. **Proactive self-care** - Taking measures before burnout happens, not after

3. **Unapologetic rest** - Being willing to prioritize rest without shame or explanation

4. **Investment in support** - Seeing proper help as an investment, not an expense

5. **Thorough training** - Recognizing that proper training is what makes delegation valuable
