# SecondBrain Slack-Notion Integration Implementation Notes

## Current Status (May 8, 2025)
Working on implementing the SecondBrain integration with Slack and Notion following the exact specifications in the instructions. All API keys have been collected and saved to `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/secondbrain_api_keys.env`.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Setting up individual Slack apps for each agent (Planner, Executor, Reviewer, Notion)
2. Creating Notion database structure for task tracking and agent logs
3. Implementing LangGraph workflow with agent routing
4. Developing comprehensive logging system

## API Keys (Stored in environment file)
- Slack: Signing Secret, App Token, Bot Token
- Notion API Key
- OpenAI API Key (for o3 and GPT-4.1 Mini)
- Anthropic API Key (for Claude agents)

## Next Steps
1. Set up Notion database structure first
2. Implement Slack event handling for agent interactions
3. Create LangGraph workflows to connect agents
4. Build end-to-end system for task assignment and tracking

## Notes
- Must maintain complete transparency in agent operations
- Each agent must log its steps in both Slack threads and Notion
- Follow the precise workflow in Master Plan (Planner → Executor → Reviewer)
- Use proper model routing (o3 for Planner, GPT-4.1 Mini for Executor, Claude for Reviewer)
- Build for scalability and reuse
