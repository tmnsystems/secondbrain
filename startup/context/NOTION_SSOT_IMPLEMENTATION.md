### 2. Core Classes

#### NotionClient (`/src/core/notion_client.py`)

The `NotionClient` class provides a wrapper around the official Notion API client with enhanced features like rate limiting, retries, and error handling. It handles:

- API request throttling to respect Notion's rate limits
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Error handling and validation
- Database, page, and block operations

```python
client = NotionClient()
response = client.create_database(
    parent_id="parent_page_id",
    title="Database Title",
    properties=schema
)
```

#### NotionSyncManager (`/src/core/notion_sync_manager.py`)

The `NotionSyncManager` class manages synchronization of data between SecondBrain and Notion, including:

- Queue management for batched operations
- Transaction handling for critical operations
- Priority-based processing
- Retry logic for failed operations

```python
sync_manager = NotionSyncManager()
sync_manager.add_file_catalog_entry(file_entry)
sync_manager.add_drift_entry(drift_entry)
```

#### CLISessionLogger (`/src/cli/cli_session_logger.py`)

The `CLISessionLogger` class provides real-time logging of CLI interactions to Notion, including:

- User messages, system actions, assistant responses, and tool calls
- Session bridging for continuity across compaction events
- Backup logs in the filesystem for redundancy
- Previous context loading at initialization

```python
logger = CLISessionLogger(session_id="cli-session-123")
logger.log_user_message("Help me with the implementation")
logger.log_system_action("LOAD_FILE", {"file": "config.py"})
```

#### DriftDetector (`/src/core/drift_detector.py`)

The `DriftDetector` class monitors strategic alignment of files, including:

- Scanning files for changes
- Calculating drift scores based on strategic intent
- Recording drift entries in Notion
- Component matching based on file paths and content

```python
detector = DriftDetector()
drift_entries = detector.detect_drift("/path/to/repo")
detector.record_drift(drift_entries)
```

#### TechDebtCollector (`/src/core/tech_debt_collector.py`)

The `TechDebtCollector` class collects code quality issues from static analysis tools, including:

- Running ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Running Pylint for Python
- Scanning for TODOs and FIXMEs
- Recording tech debt entries in Notion

```python
collector = TechDebtCollector()
entries = collector.collect_tech_debt("/path/to/repo")
collector.record_tech_debt(entries)
```

#### ScheduledSync (`/scripts/scheduled_sync.py`)

The `ScheduledSync` class manages scheduled synchronization, including:

- Daily full synchronization of all data
- Hourly incremental synchronization of changed data
- Task scheduling with configurable schedules
- Initial synchronization on startup

```python
scheduler = ScheduledSync()
scheduler.schedule_tasks()
scheduler.run_scheduler()
```

## Feature Implementation

### Real-Time Context Persistence

The Notion SSoT implements real-time context persistence through the CLI Session Logger, which:

1. Logs all CLI interactions to Notion AS THEY HAPPEN, not after the fact
2. Creates session bridges between related sessions to maintain continuity
3. Handles compaction events to preserve context during truncation
4. Maintains backup logs in the filesystem for redundancy
5. Loads previous context at session start to restore continuity

The implementation follows the "NEVER TRUNCATE" principle, ensuring that:

- Full surrounding context is always preserved (Â±5 paragraphs minimum)
- Speaker identification and emotional markers are maintained
- Chronological integrity of content is preserved

### Batch Processing with Rate Limits

The Notion API has strict rate limits (3 requests per second, 180 requests per minute), which the implementation handles through:

1. Queue-based batch processing with the `NotionSyncManager`
2. Priority-based processing (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Exponential backoff for rate limit errors
4. Transaction handling for critical operations
5. Persistent queue with checkpoints

The batch processor can be configured with:

```json
{
  "batch_processing": {
    "chunk_size": 10,
    "max_concurrency": 3,
    "priority_levels": ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"],
    "cooldown_period_ms": 1000
  }
}
```

### Strategic Drift Detection

The Drift Board monitors strategic alignment of files through the `DriftDetector`, which:

1. Scans files for changes based on their hash
2. Matches files to their intended components
3. Calculates drift scores based on path and content
4. Records drift entries in Notion with severity levels

The drift detection can be configured with component patterns and keywords:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Notion SSoT": {
      "patterns": ["**/apps/notion-ssot/**"],
      "keywords": ["notion", "ssot", "persistence", "database"],
      "weight": 1.0
    }
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "minor_drift": 25.0,
    "major_drift": 50.0,
    "critical_drift": 75.0
  }
}
```

### Tech Debt Tracking

The Tech-Debt Database collects code quality issues through the `TechDebtCollector`, which:

1. Runs static analysis tools (ESLint, Pylint)
2. Scans for TODOs, FIXMEs, and other manual markers
3. Records issues with severity, file location, and message
4. Tracks the status of issues (open, in progress, fixed, won't fix)

The tech debt collection can be configured with tool settings:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "eslint": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "npx eslint {path} -f json",
      "file_patterns": ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts"],
      "severity_mapping": {
        "2": "Major",
        "1": "Minor",
        "0": "Info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Scheduled Synchronization

The implementation includes scheduled synchronization through the `ScheduledSync` class, which:

1. Runs daily full synchronization of all data
2. Runs hourly incremental synchronization of changed data
3. Manages task scheduling with configurable schedules
4. Performs initial synchronization on startup

The synchronization can be configured with:

```json
{
  "sync": {
    "full": {
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *",
      "max_duration_minutes": 60
    },
    "incremental": {
      "schedule": "0 * * * *",
      "max_duration_minutes": 15
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Context Catalog (BP-05)

The File Catalog Database is synchronized with the Context Catalog system, ensuring that:

1. All files tracked by the Context Catalog are also tracked in Notion
2. File metadata is kept in sync between the two systems
3. Changes in the Context Catalog are reflected in Notion
4. Search capabilities between systems are integrated

### Static Analysis (BP-04)

The Tech-Debt Database is integrated with the Static Analysis system, ensuring that:

1. All issues detected by static analysis tools are recorded in Notion
2. Issues can be tracked, assigned, and resolved through Notion
3. Static analysis configuration is managed through the SSoT
4. Code quality metrics are visualized in Notion

### CLI Session Context

The CLI Sessions Database provides persistence for CLI sessions, ensuring that:

1. All CLI interactions are logged in real-time to Notion
2. Context is preserved during compaction events
3. Related sessions are linked through bidirectional bridges
4. Previous context can be loaded at session start
5. Tools in the CLI can interact with the Notion SSoT
