Hello.
00:00:03 - mark sweet
Hey, okay.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, my daughter needed mom five minutes is on time. What's that?
00:00:14 - mark sweet
Anything within five minutes is on time.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Um, I used to be of the mind if I wasn't early. I was like, now I'm always like pretty much on the nose. Cause I'm like, you know what I could do with those minutes? Instead of waiting for people. And I don't mean like just like work for like other things, everything.
00:00:36 - mark sweet
Now you got you.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, how you doing?
00:00:42 - mark sweet
You've been caught between two different parallels.
00:00:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Related to what?
00:00:50 - mark sweet
Just saying. I want to go and we're going too fast, but I want to do one.
00:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:00 - mark sweet
And I'm picking advice with other law firms.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm not picking advice, but I feel like that is the, that's the months of time by not responding.
00:01:18 - mark sweet
So now I started to like include every partner at their firm and the guy who owns the firm because I can't get a response from them is the last options to sue their client directly and then ask for fees and costs. So I'm basically just building a case or if we have to go down the road, I can show a judge, you know, we've done everything we possibly can. We've literally just wasted time and energy because they're incompetent, which is about as embarrassing as you can possibly get.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dan, how are you?
00:01:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Olaf.
00:01:51 - mark sweet
I had to make one change on the MTV email that I sent to you guys. I said five website, but it's only three website because two hours were. who's and he just didn't pull over for the reason.
00:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Misty Five is pretty good, though, for where we're at in the month.
00:02:09 - mark sweet
It's OK. And I don't mean to be e-or on that one. It's just we've gone a little harder on marketing because next week, I'm not going to say that. large volume.
00:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:02:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's going to start right about now.
00:02:23 - mark sweet
Probably right this week, but, yeah, I mean, I hope I'm wrong. I hope I'm mistaken. hope it isn't that.
00:02:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm already seeing it. I'm already seeing it in traffic and stuff going down.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and we saw it when we were looking at things last week. But it's not a huge dip compared to the rest of the months.
00:02:47 - mark sweet
No. So again, I'm much happier to be in this position than 35. crap. are we doing? But it's not jumping up and down for joy, either.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have we heard anything from Jeremy? Um, the his report.
00:03:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh, Josh, Josh, Yes. Uh, no.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So who follows up with him to see how that's going and one, we can hear something back.
00:03:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Usually he just communicates with Stacy, but he doesn't ever really have to reach out to him. Usually it's just like, Hey, here's, I've hit him up occasionally, but not very often.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Been a couple of weeks since we met with them and I just was wondering because managing those monies. Let me, let me just hit Stacy a real quick.
00:03:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you ever meet with him on the side or no?
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, um, I don't have, I don't want any distractions until this gets done anyway. Let's have to remind myself how to spell liaison because there's two eyes, two eyes. Anyway, what is it? Alrighty then. So, what? What kind of updates we got yet, Dan, were starting to run some ads last week, but it hadn't got approved yet. Did I get to do those get approved?
00:05:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'm basically just buying data at this point. It's gotten some clicks. There was maybe a lead. looked weird. So I'm going to say it's not real. So I actually just performed based on the weird lead. But it's only spent like maybe 200 bucks, you know, popping valiant and two-degrees, right? It's my version of valiant. I can say right now if I was in the valiant account, I could probably tell you how to save tens of thousands of dollars by locking one keyword. But I'm not prepared to do that just yet, so you can continue spending your money. I think I'm right, but I have to prove it.
00:05:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aren't valiant needs like the chief of.
00:06:00 - mark sweet
Once we have, I don't know what do you mean they were? I mean, we've only signed up three cases from this month so far. You know, that final number is, it may not be this month.
00:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:06:17 - mark sweet
I'm sorry, who's speaking?
00:06:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I don't know what their cost per lead is, but their retainers.
00:06:26 - mark sweet
It's all a matter.
00:06:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I actually don't know how many leads they get. Do you mark?
00:06:40 - mark sweet
Sorry, one more time.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many leads, valiant generates?
00:06:46 - mark sweet
I don't know if I can look it up if you need to.
00:06:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking at I never actually looked at it. I'm like, what should I Yeah, I've just never looked at it from that purview. So I'm like, oh.
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Okay, if I'm getting like I probably like figure out at what point I should I could get a lead by month to date 171 leads of that 171 10 so they were at fault injured and not wrapped 16 so they were not at fault injured but already represented 37 so they were not at fault injured and not wrapped in 84 so they were not at fault not injured in representation uh so most of them not good leads yeah mean 37 no fault injured not represented should they directly be those ones are good yeah so that's really your conversion in the conversion rate of their lead to containers really based on those qualify these how many qualified leads were there? 37 but yeah we'll take on the you know Not at all injured and wrapped to see if they want to change someone else, you know, something's.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so how much time does it take you to process those unqualified leads? Man hours?
00:08:12 - mark sweet
I don't know.
00:08:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, they probably don't call them.
00:08:17 - mark sweet
No, they do. Like those are getting sent to us.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, but really? never thought about this. So why would they even call someone that has no injury. I mean, the automation, I mean, I never thought about this.
00:08:38 - mark sweet
So there's no reasons because if the collision just happened, let's say within the last couple of days, they might say they're not injured, but they are actually injured.
00:08:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got it.
00:08:50 - mark sweet
That's interesting. Which definitely, it's not all of them.
00:08:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean, it's a low. Yeah, no.
00:08:56 - mark sweet
So let's see, I'm showing this mode. Yeah, a hundred and fifty four leads are in our system So I'm wondering though How many man hours you spend on the hundred and thirty four non qualified leads because that still has to go into your cost per conversion and retainer I don't have a number because it just goes in the same thing as like monkey goes into it. Yeah Calling calling it goes in through the system as well until we decline for whatever reason I don't think it's any more than monkey No, actually, it's no more than monkey.
00:09:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're spent in a walker lead because it's not a live transfer No, but what's interesting is Right, but like walker doesn't stand probably for it Nowhere near the degree are they sending hey I was in an accident and I'm not injured right there they're screening those out for the most part or if not completely yes not completely so then the question is if 30 making this up right 30 percent of values leaves are unqualified but to your point they can't be unqualified on their face well they can if you look at it and you go hey this doesn't happen a month ago and they're not injured it's unqualified right in in essence 30 percent of theirs are unqualified 30 calls minimum it's probably more like 90 if they call them if they call each one three times but then if you take that number over to monkey and you're like hey they're they have 30 percent of their leaves that are unqualified essentially and then that but that's a hundred call times three, that's, you know, 300, 600 calls. And I don't know that that, I mean, I guess it could add up, right? What's the average? If they're falling out, that's no time at all. If they have a conversation, it's actually probably not that much time. So then it gets into the number that that I've been thinking about, and I was like, don't know how to do it, like, it's like, what is the connection rate to a lead? Like, in a connection rate per vendor? Like, how do you, how do you say that a phone call actually happened? Like, not a call, just a call, like, that a conversation happened. Like, to me, that the connection is supposed to just, they picked up the phone or the phone connected that we can get that data inside of lead plug, but doesn't really need anything. Oh, great. We left a voicemail. That's, that's a connection. but that's really not. So, you know, what is 900 phone calls time-wise and dollar-wise? It's actually probably not that much. But I do see where you could, I mean, you'd have to start tracking it before you did this, but you could say, hey, accident date is more than seven days, and they're not injured, disqualified. But you really can't do that until you look through the data and see that you've never, you don't really find those, which may or may not, I mean, I don't have to go look at it. In theory, it's around. Wouldn't that just be in the right form at all?
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, Yeah, anyway, that would be something that I'm thinking about now and want to look at just so we have an idea of what it costs us and also, if that time feels excessive, what can we do to improve that system to process those leads faster, how can we automate it?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I bet we could do this. bet Eric and I could figure out a way to just apply tag for someone based on that criteria. It doesn't mean anything to anyone except us. I could just make it some tag that has no meaning, just not to throw the intake team off when they see like worldwide. So it could just be a tag, we make up a name, we know what it means, sort of like monkey ring, we just have a code name for it, code name tag, apply that for a month. And at the end of a month, go, how many people have this tag that closed and where did they come from? So we could sort of like, it's this pre-disqualification tag based on, except to define what the criteria is, it a week, accident more than a week, and no injury, so you tell me what that time period is, and then obviously the no injury is no injury, and then we can just see what the data will look like in like a month.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thoughts, Mark?
00:14:36 - mark sweet
I'm wondering if full-on amount of data we're getting from the value would give us enough to do that, or if I have to have him to separate those four criteria out and pass in a different way.
00:14:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know, I was thinking that too, I like, I've got to go look at all these, and I can't see it in my head. I'm like, I don't know that we actually. It's how the in-lead flowy, like I know it goes into solidifies like text, I'm like, I don't know that I, these all have beta vaccine, for instance, like a dedicated state field. Yeah.
00:15:18 - mark sweet
I mean, this is also a big reason why some firms have initial call center that just gets people on the phone and transfers them over to their like the proverbial appointments that are ever. Yeah. I get why.
00:15:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, it becomes a problem that, you know, if you're double the amount of leads, you have double amount of that problem.
00:15:51 - mark sweet
Some of the thing about us are continuing to grow. There's good and bad with a lot of these things. I'm not the biggest fan of third party.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, honestly, like everything it should come down to the numbers, and what numbers matter most is sometimes those numbers are review scores, which matter very much, right? And whether not appointment matters impact review scores. So, but then there's how much does it cost you all the normal numbers. But the one thing that might not be at the top of somebody's mind, which I know is yours, is how does that impact reputation? most of that can be handled by proper vetting, training, and contracts in the metric of the contract being satisfaction. And, payment, um, I don't know, contractual payment being, being around that. So, but, but why do it? I mean, you can hire things. I don't know. It's, it's all, it's the numbers. So if that's a conversation that we want to have, that means we need to first define what are the numbers that matter. Um, then when we look at the numbers that matter, do some quick forecasting and go, is it even more trying, can it make any difference? is the reason for doing it, pros, cons, whatever. So, that's just, I don't know, what, what be the reason for doing it, or even having that conversation in your mind right now.
00:17:48 - mark sweet
Right now, I don't think we should. Um, we have plenty of capacity. It's just a, if we start getting your capacity issue. Yeah, that's when it would be and then obviously the other parts and feel the other reason to do it is say it's a contact rate I mean, that's the only reason you would do this. It's not a conversion rate. It's a contact rate Yeah, because you're dealing with people who are generally gonna be VA's. We're not talking about building up separate call center within our call center Right makes sense. They're talking about people with Their own issues a third party, you don't have control over and you don't know what the hell they're saying But there are definitely companies that do this. It does exist.
00:18:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is not revolutionary Well, no, it's like this is approaching you know the concept of like lead scoring, right? There's no It can be that we could build a lead scoring thing, but First and foremost we were just I mean, I'll set it up I'll set up that tech because it's not gonna hurt anything It's just going to give a different view provided like you said that I have the variables to use. I'm not sure I do If I don't, I can probably get them set up or figure out a way get them set up.
00:19:05 - mark sweet
It's just going to be tagging, but I get what you're saying, and we should probably do that, and valence should be one of the user wants to do it with.
00:19:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm not sure about the accident date. need that date to be in the field in So going to mean this because he divides it up in those four categories as is.
00:19:23 - mark sweet
I'm sure there's a way that we can get him to tag those categories each a little bit separately. We can figure it on the back end.
00:19:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the categories he uses?
00:19:37 - mark sweet
The no fault, no injury, not reps. No fault, injured, not reps.
00:19:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No fault, injured, No fault, injured, reps, are obviously the prime ones.
00:19:56 - mark sweet
No fault, injured, and represented. the ones that we try and get like was they or someone on the record and flip they need to flip although a lot of times those are ones who've already settled and are mad about the settlement and the crappiest ones at fault injured not perhaps and then there's some that just fall into other scenarios like just at fault no injury my cat ate my dog or whatever else happy my dog look we get a little sort of weird crap on a pretty daily basis yeah i you work with the public that's gonna happen um yeah unfortunately mental health is a true issue yeah so every day we get a government is trying to do something to me and they took my kids and blah blah blah um okay
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sorry, I asked the question in the middle of that conversation, but I wanted to write that down. So, he tracks these things, or no?
00:21:13 - mark sweet
He tracks it on his side, yeah.
00:21:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we've got the data, we're just not collecting the data, like he's collecting the data, but it's not getting transferred, or...
00:21:25 - mark sweet
You'll react, because right now it's just going over the general feed.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so with Lidify, or Vflow, one of the two, we definitely have systems to be able to transfer that data fairly simply from him, don't we?
00:21:42 - mark sweet
We should be able to, yes.
00:21:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:21:45 - mark sweet
don't see a reason why we would not be able to do in some form or fashion. I don't know how clean or easy it'll be, but it should exist.
00:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, to be clear, are we going to request that, who's going to request it, one of I'm going to follow up, like, make sure this gets done, because there's definitely good value in that.
00:22:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't, we have to see what he's sending. I'm not even sure if he said it right now, then we're, we just have to parse it. But if he's not sending it, then he needs to send it. So we have to go see what he's sending. And then that'll tell us what the next step is.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so. Are you going to remember to do that?
00:22:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do you need a reminder?
00:22:30 - mark sweet
I'm not texting him right now.
00:22:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What about?
00:22:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so he's collecting all of that. Is he's, he's sending you those people? Do you want them?
00:22:57 - mark sweet
Do you want to call all of those? Yes, that's the question.
00:23:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, and you never know, okay, or we do know, we just don't know because the data is there and we just haven't been looking at it correctly from this purview basically.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, because what we want to see is, is there a worthwhile conversion rate of those unqualified on paper lead sources that your team is actually able to convert and it's a worthy case because if we go through in like 1% of those convert, but it takes however many hours throughout the year to do that, you know, we just run the numbers. Does it still make us a profit? If it makes us a profit, then okay.
00:23:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, then if you could put in leads or whatever, like we start to do it and then we start to track it and then we start looking at the data. I mean, it might be that like, oh, yeah, one of these for every month or, you know, whatever it is. And then it's like, it gets back around to the idea of like, do you, do you start to like, well, Maria, you know, forget everyone's name, but like she's, you know, money on the phone. So she gets score one leads. And then so and so is going to get score two, and the new girl gets score three, then score four goes to whatever, right? So you're not not following up with them. But you're, you're starting to deal with them in a priority sort of way, and then score maybe score one leads get a little more aggressive follow up. Similarly, you could, and you could do the same thing like within the flow. Like, hey, that's a score three leads, and with a score three follow up, right score one. I mean, everyone right now gets treated like a score one lead, mentally, like they get to three calls in an hour, like, probably doesn't need to be that way for everyone. it does. So right now everyone's treated the same and maybe this data tells you not to do that. And maybe it tells you to like, you know what, you don't you don't convert score three leads ever. So you could just like act like they don't exist. Yeah, you're paying for them because that's you know, the deal of the valiant. And it took me that you're analyzing, you look at monkey leads and you go, Hey guys, we started leads going and you know, 30% of your leads, there's no chance they're ever going to convert. So what do we want to do about that? And they're going to say nothing. You're going to say, Okay, do better fellas.
00:25:40 - mark sweet
Or would you have the really, really crap on this go to HU intake? there a time?
00:25:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There go. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, that could definitely be it. It could be that you say if score three, HQ. Yeah, totally. Right. where I flip the script, you're like hey I don't want to do I don't want to do um setters but I know these leads aren't worthy of my front line team yeah yeah who's got a little girl voice in there Denise oh talking to the dogs it's like instant octave rays uh-huh right but everyone does that right is that what is that why does everyone do that with dogs it does seem to get their attention um they do seem appreciate it that's like Denise got this anti-barker thing right and it's like the only the dogs can hear it the dogs ain't And me, I'm like, oh my God. I'm like, what is that sound? And Denise is like, what sound am I, I don't hear that. He's like, she's like, you're not supposed to be able to hear it. I'm like, well, I hear a screeching pitch every time they bark. So I prefer the bark.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:27:21 - mark sweet
those the only two options?
00:27:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that, I don't don't stand there the speaker thing.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's a vibrating bark color. It doesn't actually shock them, but it gets them quiet.
00:27:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:27:46 - mark sweet
got it.
00:27:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We switched to that, actually.
00:27:48 - mark sweet
I haven't heard that. You know, they send over, list the information. So we should be able to do it already.
00:27:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
List the category that you've described or just list.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the criteria. How does he send it? Does he send it like an S spreadsheet?
00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you know, you know, we're parsing it from Xavier.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You can't be sent.
00:28:20 - mark sweet
I'm doing it automatically, it's like we did by state. So.
00:28:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you speak up. I have my volume all the way up and Dan is not quiet.
00:28:30 - mark sweet
Yeah, no. He said, come on.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not complaining, Dan. I'm just saying the despair. It's not you.
00:28:39 - mark sweet
It's me. He said already sending it over with how they are. So I'm asking if we can put like a tag on it, like how we did by state previously, because it should be able to be done. And that'll make it a lot easier to differentiate.
00:28:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I just got to look up. I mean, I can see in my head, I just want to, I got to see how, well, I don't know what we're doing, right, like we weren't, for instance, we were not concerned about state data until a couple of weeks ago. So it was like, oh, we should really, even though it was there, we weren't actually using it, now we're using it. I mean, I know how to do it. If it's, if it's, if he's sending the answers, we can map those fields, whether they exist or not.
00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean we weren't concerned about state data too, a few weeks ago?
00:29:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So until we started working on these dashboards, like, we were, we were looking at it, like they weren't populated and litify. So as Mark started acting, right, there were no states in the beginning. So, when we came in three years ago, even then, it was like he was doing Arizona. But you can, we were using the state data of the matter. So the state data of the lead was never.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
right? Okay. The leads. That's what I'm asking. Sometimes we've been tracking States.
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no, no, no, yeah, we were, but we weren't going like downstream, right? Until we started to look at a police. So I'm saying like, I mean, I want to say that we don't. I mean, I know, I mean, I know I have. I don't know. I haven't looked at the field in there in so long. So whatever. I'll go look at it. Either way, I know I'm in my head. Like, I know how we do it. And then, but unfortunately, it's like, you can't go backwards with, um, with these, uh, when the email parses, because you've got to reparse all the emails and like, good luck. I don't even, I wouldn't even know where to start. Can you send us all those emails again?
00:30:50 - mark sweet
Thanks. Yeah, no, then we know. Yeah, no, no, that's not certating text messages. Exactly.
00:30:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That could go sideways quick.
00:30:58 - mark sweet
Yeah. That's a no. We can only do it moving forward when we're from to respond. While we're from to respond, can we switch gears to the gatekeeping review email?
00:31:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so there is one. So the system that we have set up, when a case, I'm going to say closed, whatever the actual criteria is and letify that tells us, hey, got their check, whatever that one is. When that gets added and litified, then it gets added and leave flowy, and then they get put into testimonials, we'll call it, follow-up system, where it reaches out to them, you know, be a text and email, whatever. Ask them for a review, they come back to a lead flowy page, or it might be on sweet lot for you. And then it asks them to leave a review. Or I think first it asks them, it might be a thumbs up thumbs up. thumbs down kind of thing. So in order to follow the law, right, like you have to take feedback from everyone. So we're doing that. If they thumbs down and leave a bad review, we just don't ask them to go post it somewhere else. If they do leave a good review, then we automatically spawn a Google review for them. And I think we might actually, I don't think we can populate it, but I think we spawn it and then we give them the text to easily cut and paste it so that they can leave the review.
00:32:41 - mark sweet
What's that? How are we spawning theoretically?
00:32:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that deep link? And it basically pops up the Google review window as if they had clicked in to leave a review themselves.
00:32:59 - mark sweet
You know, automatic. If we paste what you want to type.
00:33:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't think I don't think we do that. We might either either we make the text is easily accessible for them as we can um And then some people do it some people leave some people go ahead and follow steps and then but most really just don't Now even like I wouldn't even say a ton of people Use the review system and we can look at it. It's all it's all in the flow But I typically I think Patsy and I get An email like you've gotten a good whatever, right?
00:33:35 - mark sweet
currently get those And I forward it to the team to get them to get that person to leave a review because then they get their $25 or whatever it is Yeah, so those are the the gated system that are sending that but we're not doing that on the intake side What do you mean by like on to leads? Yes, why would you try to get a review from a lead? because reasons you could we could put that system in place for leads and it will work the same way it's just I don't know what they're gonna do we're all about it they said that's what we're missing and that's how we get way way way way way more reviews what that's what I know but I asked okay now that's here's part of the reason we could set that up makes a little bit of sense and I say a little bit sense do you spend some time with some of these clients on them hey you know you go the state bar website or this is the actual type of attorney you need or look you know what you should probably just accept that settlement it's not gonna help you and I've had clients say like I appreciate that thank you like they actually are help like thanks and helpful because we did something more than we can't help you there are for every one of those there's a hundred plus you say FU you suck why can't you help me so I am very hesitant-ish about this but if my new People are pushing us not heavily. Maybe they know something I don't know.
00:35:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, but to your point a second ago, if we use this system and then we have your staff, follow up with the same, you know, indicator, hey, they left a positive review, go get them, believe it or Google, it will work just the same, right? So we get automatically gate them and, you know, sift out the bad and then see what happens.
00:35:29 - mark sweet
Turn it back off.
00:35:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and maybe we'll duplicate it and then leave it so that we have two separate sets of data. this is the lead reviews and this is the client reviews and then that way we can just have it separate them.
00:35:52 - mark sweet
I mean, given a number of people that we're going through every month, the number of reviews we have does not match up. We should have 300 plus five store reviews by now.
00:36:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:36:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, totally, but I don't know I mean other people are definitely buying I get it But again given no, know yeah I'm typing in sweet lures reviews and sweet James comes up above us again and sponsored that it's us We don't know what they're doing Oh, maybe they are buying my key work now, I think they're just buying Like sweet Probably so yeah 125 reviews for a new for location which is good, but I really want to give this thing over 300 So
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, I can hear you thinking about it. Is this something that should be specifically the goals of more reviews and getting reviews on the front end and figuring out how to make that process for leads instead of just matters?
00:37:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Should we turn that into a task to make sure that it's moving a lot Yes, yeah, I know how to do it. We'll duplicate the automation and then No, what I'm asking is what's the best way to make sure it doesn't get forgotten for you? Oh, no, I'll send it. I'll send it to Stacy right now. I just I'm trying to think in my head How do we when do we do it, right?
00:37:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like we have to What we have to wait for the intake call I mean, I you have to wait till they're turned down. I would say Okay.
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. That's, that's, that's, yeah, you in one first, we'll don't want it happening during, right? Which could easily happen. So it's got to be, we need a flag and we need a trigger, right? I would say the trigger is turn down.
00:38:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that a lot right there.
00:38:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then we could just start there and then it could be that, because right now I think to turn down reasons in Lidifier multi-level now, right? the stuff that we, that I did with Isaac. but we don't transfer that to Leploid. Leploid just says, hey, they got turned down to Lidify for one of the myriad of reasons. They're just turned down. So the tag in Leploid would be turned down. And then we could fire it based off the applications that take. I would just start there. And then if we. got into it for whatever reason, whatever, because it's gated, it really can't go sideways. We just want to make sure we're contacted them after they have that dinner.
00:39:13 - mark sweet
Right, because right now it just looks like we're just getting basic reviews.
00:39:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:39:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you send that email to Stacy?
00:39:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I was trying to work out what the tag was, what the trigger was. I was just checking because of what I can do.
00:39:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't send her an email.
00:39:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just flackered. So I'll flackered. We have a method, and she knows that she transcribes it into or translates it into tests.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The only thing I'm trying to get to is making sure that that has actually happened before we move on or the note in here just because brains can literally typing it out. Okay, I will, I will move on then. So Magneto, the last conversation was pitch them, basically reverse pitch them on giving them the same deal that you did with tier 11. Any, that happen?
00:40:25 - mark sweet
Way in their response, they were thinking about it.
00:40:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to hear the update when that happens because a new lead source, I mean, if they're any good would be great. Okay, um, what's great about them is that they it's yours.
00:41:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's not even a lead.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, wait, um, oh, yeah, because, okay, um, so is CMG any from them?
00:41:18 - mark sweet
Uh, sometime this week, I'm just going on top of it. I don't have insanely high hopes to be very frank with you.
00:41:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's really nice people?
00:41:38 - mark sweet
No, so a ton of known forever. He just keeps kind of bouncing around. Um, he was with Scorpion, like when I very, very, very first started firm, uh, worked a whole deal that would have been awesome, but it was very frustrating. Um, there were some of his leads. They had a lot of firms were giving piece back on it to that law firm and then I don't know how they figured it out from there and I don't want to know a lot of details it was kosher by ethics attorneys somehow. I think it was a DC model before the Arizona stuff. Yeah, they were upset because there was no like big case they were looking for the multi million dollar cases and like, of course, yeah, Kind of sucked. And he's just kind of bounced around from from from from after that, but he always in in the marketing space ish. So, you know, we'll see what they come up with together. I don't have insanely high expectations, but we'll see. Like you said, the more stories we got the better and we're now eating cost per case that I could not imagine, you know, three or four years ago. Okay.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, one thing that will help us just be a little bit more clear is that dashboard that Josh is working on, so because the one thing that we've also figured out is that what we think things cost is not right, and for good and for bad at times. So being more accurate will definitely be good. There is a conversation that was started in email regarding channel work that I think needs to not be adhered here, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to move that conversation along with, hold on, let me look at it again, Dan sent it, Dan, are you on signal or no? That's where I was going to go with this.
00:43:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what, I actually had to install the other day, and it's telegram.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's like I installed something the other day I could be I'm not okay let's get you on that yes yeah I was on telegram dudes like are you on telegram like why and then I figured out oh it's cuz you're some Russian dude I'm like what am I just buy I've already made I've already when you get there just either send a link or find us or something and I'm all okay we can give you some answers and then regarding the request of can we make a more compassionate death blog oh the AI yes the were condolences and so sorry for your loss
00:45:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I think I, yeah, I found that to Eric, but Eric's, so Eric was like dealing with putting his stepfather in memory care for like a month, right? So that was like effing his life up.
00:45:16 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:45:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, well, and then it gets worse. Then the dude took a fall a week ago. I mean, to be straight up, I think he might be dead. Like, I think he died. Um, he fell and then that turned into a broken hip and they brought him to the hospital and then they went to go. They were gonna operate on him and then all of a sudden his kidney served failing and Eric took off on Thursday. And was like, I gotta go up there and then Friday, Stacy's like, no dude, he told me they're pulling the plug. And I was like, what? are you shitting me? I haven't heard from him since. So I'm like, I don't want to text him. He's like, hey. Right. He's around right now, but I don't know where he is. So I'm not going to last week, but I'm 90% sure he didn't do it, but I'll find out. know what, I didn't build it, but I can tweak that. I can probably go tweak that prompt that shouldn't be hard.
00:46:21 - mark sweet
But the good news is we're signing up more death cases.
00:46:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, well, yeah, I think we we fix that cracking, though, the new leaves are being tracked properly. don't think we've gone backwards yet.
00:46:40 - mark sweet
I mean, I'm just seeing on the back end, I guess, whatever you want to call it.
00:46:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, so that's a yay for me. I like death cases. Well, yeah, that sounds so wrong. When I first started to kill them when I know you're helping them, but it just does about so long. When I first started this company like him the early 2000s or whatever, right? This dude, he's actually in LA. His name is Matt. Oh, it was Matt Byron, Matt. Salk ended up knowing him. I mean, I'm at this guy first, but his literal quote was he gave me dead people and I was like, wow. Okay, and that for that guy, I forgot about this, we built a whole thing around either amusement park accidents or rollercoaster specific, I forget, and it worked. We actually started getting them. was like, okay.
00:47:52 - mark sweet
I mean, look, this is what, in an ideal world, what I'm looking for are death cases caused by commercial or imputation cases caused by commercial trucks, or brain dead people who need 24 7 care caused by trucks or commercial vehicles or Uber or Lyft.
00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is my commercial vehicles.
00:48:13 - mark sweet
Yeah. Deep pocket defendants basically.
00:48:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Oh, that reminds me, is Isaac still around?
00:48:21 - mark sweet
No.
00:48:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
. Because I don't know. I think I have something out of it, but that's why. Yeah.
00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I asked them. Oh, that's not what I meant.
00:48:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think you ever answered, but. So I still need to go. still want to. I still want to go back and look at the ad third leaves. I mean, I guess I can. I don't know. I'll have to go poke around, but I wanted to know. Decisively. Hey, did they actually get referred out? Right so we had a bunch that were marked as referred out for them But they weren't real referred out because we didn't the referred out at the time didn't really mean that So because then if they did it changes their math like their math wasn't great, but it was still profitable It wasn't you know great, we're still profitable, and then those guys I think I told you this like the last call I have With them they were like well, you know we do these commercial leads for people and I go the what they're like Oh, yeah, we have this tier of just commercial leads. I'm like that probably should have been something you told me about When we first started talking so they had that and I was like, okay I'll get back to you, and then I haven't gone back to them because I was waiting for them refer nothing to be completed But I'm still in slack, so I'll go I guess I'll go put ground You
00:50:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so, Missouri and offices are- You see it the right way.
00:50:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Missouri?
00:50:10 - mark sweet
Missouri.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I've actually lived there, so you can just back up off me.
00:50:18 - mark sweet
Missouri. Say it. know you want to.
00:50:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not everybody that lives there says it like that. What I want to say, Jesus don't want me to say so.
00:50:28 - mark sweet
Oh.
00:50:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Dan missed the call.
00:50:34 - mark sweet
yeah, he missed the call. He would have liked the call. Anyway, yes. Missouri. What about it?
00:50:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, are you going to work on the office situation at all, or just, no?
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Me too. Yes, I will do it.
00:50:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:50:54 - mark sweet
I called the one that you had sent. They don't forward now. So. it's my problem but I will I will find one.
00:51:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is um America good at that kind of research?
00:51:06 - mark sweet
No.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Anybody good at that kind of research? Because you're anti-teen, don't be busy all the time, right?
00:51:14 - mark sweet
Everyone sucks but it's fine. I'll get to figure it out.
00:51:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We need we just need our autonomous AI bots.
00:51:25 - mark sweet
It's okay. have it soon enough.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Hey, I have no bugging me all of a sudden. Okay, let's see. So, um, we Dan has to go in six minutes. The one thing I want to know is if there's any kind of movement on or can we move just the structure of automations for doctors, offices, lead sources, I actually can't really put this lot together. My head based on the notes that I have. But stuff that benefits you and other people in terms of like following up with them.
00:52:16 - mark sweet
so that's a good question. Yeah, how can we better automate follow up without it losing some kind of a human touch.
00:52:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Although for what? What to again?
00:52:29 - mark sweet
Okay, so doctors and clients are different. Yeah, some sort of an automated follow up with doctors offices. So we don't constantly remember, oh, crap, we haven't talked to them in like two or three months or whatever else. Yeah, because there's a large part of top of mind and while I'm jumping on all these calls and everything else and they're great, like, so much I can only do. Yeah, I don't know if that's cloning a different phone number or cloning even my own cell phone, just send text messages, Hey, what's up?
00:52:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've been doing this thing like just even in just normal conversation kind of thing.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I don't know we can do.
00:53:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, like with Lee Ploey?
00:53:05 - mark sweet
I don't know what it would be with.
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you could definitely do with Lee Ploey.
00:53:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, you could do it. Uh, we just have to play around with. pretty sure. I'm pretty sure that you can. Make the text back number, the contact person's number. So like, yeah, I'm pretty sure. Obviously we don't do it because no one wants that. Typically, but yeah, then you could have like, it automatically text them on whatever schedule. And then when they respond, it's going to go to your phone. So it's, it does the initial outreach for you.
00:53:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what we were working with. Fuji and I were looking at HubSpot trying to have kind of a similar conversation last week, just because that's where he ended up. looking at things. But something based off of like last point of contact, last date of contact, but then maybe also last type of contact. So, if the last conversation was they sent a lead, right, the date and they sent a lead, or if the last conversation was we followed up with them haven't heard anything back, then you want to send a different type of message. If the last contact type is you sent us a lead, I want to say thank you for the lead within a certain amount of period. If the last contact type was I sent you a message and I haven't heard back, I want to follow up with, hey, whatever, not thank you for the last thing that you sent or whatever, just want to check in again to see how you're doing, thank you again, whatever. It's a different language, right. So, contact date and contact type would be things that we would need to track and mark. And then a variation of responses that go out making sure that they're ever duplicated. And we're getting to the point, I don't know if AI can do this yet, where it can like kind of craft a message and it knows the rule is, send a message like this, but not identical, never identical. So it doesn't look like it's a can response or whatever.
00:55:17 - mark sweet
But anyway, within this parameter, it's a good idea. Because yeah, no, but oh, Mark actually is like, yeah, he takes us the same thing.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that doesn't look good. Right. Right. So, but we could with ourselves manually go through and get like 24 canned responses that basically say the same thing. we've eyeballed them and approved them and say, okay, these are the 24 where you can use this year. They're not going to think, you know, like, and you can't repeat the message and use some kind of conditional logic, where you can't repeat the message more than once in a, you know, 365 day period, a year, two years, whatever, depending on how many days. we have, but I think that we could come up with a system where we can contact all your resources, all your different doctor's offices, but maybe within the doctor's offices, you have a few different contact points, different receptionists, things like that. I don't know, but that's something I think that we could probably leverage better.
00:56:23 - mark sweet
Because we're around with this monthly subscription service where they get stuff in the mail.
00:56:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:56:30 - mark sweet
So it's either Harry or David, or right now where we just, love hearing people, we found Mexicrate, which had some super fun Mexican candy stuff, which just went over like crazy with.
00:56:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love Harry and David because you can sign like healthy things, but also their quality is good.
00:56:48 - mark sweet
Also, they're just like 76 miles away from me. So a couple of issues, they're expensive. One, two, fruit just tends to sit there. And three, you are not my target audience.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Be front. Number one what I said, that should have been number one your target audience is more important.
00:57:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's the process.
00:57:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:57:10 - mark sweet
Oh, dad.
00:57:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food is doing door dash.
00:57:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uber.
00:57:17 - mark sweet
He's Uber sending gift cards or sending food itself.
00:57:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food itself.
00:57:22 - mark sweet
Yeah, we do that for doctors who are forever so direct case, but I'm trying to think of what we can do instead of just each and every time that costs. Or maybe 25 bucks a month per person. Yeah, subscription basis because we have great ideas are followed through and is good for like two months and then we fall off the face of the earth.
00:57:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what if it sounds everything physical Amazon gift cards, because it feels different to because they come in these little, you know, cute packages. So you still kind of get that that tactical thing and that opening something rather than the box that they open the has our name on it. All right, why do I like that?
00:58:02 - mark sweet
Yeah, that sits in a couch under somewhere else. And then usually, hey, blah, blah, blah, sent x, y, z.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:58:11 - mark sweet
For x, z brought us goodies. So it definitely goes over food is good, but we're between like Harry and David or something else, because I agree with you, Harry and David quality is good. It just be fruit every month, and it's a different fruit, because you're almost in the same thing every single month, because people will be bored of it.
00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Oh, Dan's got to go.
00:58:32 - mark sweet
Bye.
00:58:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bye, Dan.
00:58:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All the reviews. All the reviews, all the things.
00:58:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the good, all the fives are reviews.
00:58:43 - mark sweet
173 of them.
00:58:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, I agree just soon, because I'm talking to 50 and a half an hour, and my little girl, as me can see, needs some chicken breasts, grilled chicken breasts so that I can eat healthy.
00:58:56 - mark sweet
Nice, great thing went over pretty good in our office, but we're going to keep trying to come older. We're just having them sent to like our office because you know, you can do like a one off just to see what the package looks like, see what's inside it, see what it's like.
00:59:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's a good thing to outsource to your team because they'll be excited about shopping and getting the gifts to try.
00:59:13 - mark sweet
Yeah, so we're trying a couple and then America right now is finishing up. We did this last year and went over really well. So we're doing it We're sending out flax to all the doctors that we like or for us stuff. So that they won our award for 2024 chiropractor of the year or whatever it is. So they like that a lot. They like, look, it looks good. People like to put it in their office and hang it up and whatever else, right? Everyone likes awards.

I'm going to show you something real quick and then going to have a share screen. I've been thinking about this for a while. So I have teamwork and teamwork and just notes and it's not mine. It stands. And like I've said before, how. in this hybrid thing has been new to me. We're three years in and we have lots of things that keep us busy. But now I need to change the system so that I can kind of do more of what I'm doing. So this is day one of putting it together. Like I've got this time for the failed lead vendors. need to clean this up. Things are just that we've thought about or thinking about, put it over here. I have to fill out some of the stuff in here that you've told me about what we're working on for future states and I'll categorize this.
01:00:34 - mark sweet
Yeah, but I'm going to put some more details in there.
01:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I know, so what I'll do is I'll keep taking my notes in here because that's helpful. And then I've got, you know, my my fathom stuff too. But what I want to be able to track is like, what are we and actually participating in the conversation. I'm. some stuff that this and it also it's just linear by each week. I can't just quickly go back to it and then I'll keep some stuff in here too. I'll probably separate this out later but also sometimes you send links about different things and I want to go back to it but I normally just keep a billion tabs open. I don't want to do that anymore so I'm working on just kind of creating my own dashboard for what we're doing to keep track of stuff. It's going to be a lot more comprehensive when we get into like the things that I'm working on with these guys and the journals but anyway it's there's not a lot to show you but to show me I'm trying create some more structure because I think that it well I told you I think that we would be more productive if we met a little bit more often but I want to create a framework for actually making that work and putting things forward in a way that is measurable like I can measure how Lorenz and Patrick's stats are improving. We can measure lots of different things, but if we're going to be working on these other little nuanced things, I want to be able to have a jumping off point and a baseline like, this is where we're at right now, you know, November 2024. This is where we're at six months from now, whatever. So I think that this will be easier for you to go, oh, yeah, I can see how that's been moving forward and if it's not something you want to do, great. But especially where you're vacillating between, want to go faster, don't want to do stuff. What this helps do is look at, first of all, where the pace is steady and making a difference. But also, for me, it's always amazing to me despite the financial situation I've been in, it's mostly been because I just took care of other people. no regard to my actual finances and didn't manage it well, you know. But in terms of like, much I make for how little time I spend for the power of the network that I have, which I don't consider myself a networker. I don't go out and meet and greet people. But the quality of the people that I am connected with when I need things, like for me, it's a much smaller scope than it is for you. But all of those things are leverage points. And I when I look at it and take stock and I'm like, I want to go do this, everything is available. And you do have been doing so many things intentionally in the way that you meet and take care of the doctors, doing it more of it, expanding the states, expanding the vendors, automations, AI. started working on why we've been working together, either way that we've, you know, massage and whatnot. that is making a huge impact, but because it's so subtle, right, and because the pace is so it's not explosive, but it's consistent, you just keep building this powerhouse. And the other thing is if you ever do decide and go back to, you just want to sell it and go into something else, right, then you've got kind of a log report that makes sense of like, these are the things that we've implemented, and this is part of the foundation that you can actually see, right, you can't see underneath the building, you can't see the the steel, you can't see the how deep the footers are, you can't see any of that stuff, you have to take somebody's word for it, you can look at okay, I see how you got here, which I think is valuable to. anyway, those are just some of the was I was thinking about I'm putting together for you.
01:05:04 - mark sweet
Yep. Um, yes, sorry, go back to the food. You wrote this in the back of my mind. I understand the cards, but I don't know. People get rid of them really easily against loss or doesn't get the right person.
01:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's not doing cards though. He was doing the right.
01:05:21 - mark sweet
Right. The actual things, but. So we do is we either pick a place where we have America calling us like if they have any dietary issues or something else. And then once we know, we know like for the future, because there's some place they just won't specific food, but it's becoming cumbersome, given how many people there are, and I'm sure for him it's even more. So that's why we're also sort of moving, not away from it, but moving to the subscription model as well, just to try to take one more thing off of our brain pan, but it does keep coming up.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the other things that we did is so. I want him to reach out to everybody, but we've definitely looked at there's there's a very clear like top 10 yeah top 15 top 20, you know in different Handling in different ways So handling everybody to kind of ascend them up to get us more But definitely taking better care of the the ones that send them off. So we're tracking All you know all the cases that each of the people sent which of course it is a lot and sometimes there's different doctors in or Different people in the same office that send over things and so really breaking that down and separating them Which is cumbersome, but that single contact part point Is actually where the stuff comes from so making sure to actually You know give it, but okay. like for example, there will be doctor and an assistant the assistant is the one that Send everything, but it's still from the doctor are so respecting and honoring the doctor by giving thanks to them, you know, giving something to them, but also to the one that's actually sending it over. But this is a more recent development and trying to work out that system.
01:07:16 - mark sweet
So I don't have a question. So it leads me to one question, and it's something I've always gone back and forth with each year. We're preparing 1099, we're preparing these things right, have to give people the end of the year. We know how much we pay each doctor because we have to prepare 1099s. Is it ever good to bring that amount up or leverage that fact in any way, shape or form?
01:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So depends on how you're looking at it. So like the thing that comes to my mind is say, hold on a second because I know actually have a similar conversation with the reason he didn't want to, because he didn't want his assistants knowing what the number was, or... somebody not knowing what the number was and that was a particular thing. But yeah saying you know you you brought us X amount of business or what I like is ambiguity like you're one of our you know top three providers or top five that says nothing it doesn't tell you anything about volume doesn't it and it doesn't even tell you if it's your top three financially or top three because we like you the most you know what I mean like it's totally ambiguous and it's not lying or anything if what you mean and when you say top three is your my favorite or your top three of a particular zip code or your top top three of whatever you know what I mean there's a lot of nuance to the way that languages and what the same thing with the award Like, what does your plaque actually mean to anything, but nothing, but it feels good. It looks good.
01:09:08 - mark sweet
It does. I'm just thinking it's sometimes hard numbers or hard data, and maybe that's just more of discussion I have with some of the larger ones.
01:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the other thing is, depending on what you say to people, you know, it gets back to the great find that somebody, you said this to this company and you said that to that company and they have lunch with each other and be like, Oh, really, you know, so you got to No, it has to be an accurate number.
01:09:33 - mark sweet
can't make up a number.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's not what I'm suggesting, but in the ambiguity, like, you know, have enough specificity to not get yourself in the news.
01:09:46 - mark sweet
Right. Yeah. I don't know, always something to go back and forth on because I think it can be really, really powerful. Okay.
01:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so that is also kind of the benefit of this document that I'm working on is just making sure that we spend a little bit more time on these things. Well, consistently, because I feel like you get these good ideas, but then because we only have one hour and a lot of times it's around leads and vendor, which is really important, some of the other leverage things don't get followed up with consistently enough. And one of the things that we'll be able to do is kind of rank what these would do. And it'll just be clear in my mind too, so I'll be like, can we delegate this thing or a part of this thing to move it forward, that type of thing. but I do, I do have to go because I'm trying to like to talk to you. And I messaged Shona today, check on her and she said she's feeling very motivated. And I didn't ask why, but I was wondering if Or your instance of lists was very helpful.
01:11:02 - mark sweet
I'm imagining it was no because I got direct to an event at Hermes yesterday that I did not want to go to.
01:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So already didn't want to go to to her.
01:11:10 - mark sweet
decided to go to me in a very bad double position and she committed buying something that was like $24,000 but her not having any. So now she's trying to scramble into what she can because this is how she works in her mentality. So that is why she's feeling motivated at the moment. Or she's just lying to you. don't know if you want to.
01:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to stop asking you about some of the stuff. Good luck. Have a great day, Mark. But I do like my checklist and I'm very proud of it. I think you did great. I'm proud of you. Okay.
