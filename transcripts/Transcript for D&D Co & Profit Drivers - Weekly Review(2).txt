00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. Are you there?
00:00:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to join here. So I got the cleaners console. have to go outside with the dogs.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Speaking of, I got a text message and I immediately dropped everything that you get because it was, Hey, here's Hudson's travel details. Everything is blank. Arrival time, blank airport, blank airline blank. I'm like, um.
00:00:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're going pay for those details.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that $3,000 is basically that I paid for him.
00:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She's coming at.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I want these details because my daughter has to go to her dad for Christmas and it's right around that time. I'm like, I really want her to be able to be there. So I'm not to know.
00:00:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. It is helpful.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, right. Um, so how is Dan today?
00:01:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting ready for the cleaners. I'm ready.
00:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I have to do like a whole process, which is now completed.
00:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was you not have them regularly or like what?
00:01:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no. I guess somehow inherited this like the final run through before they show up and then getting the dogs outside and no one's around like and Denise goes to Costco and if the kids are here, they disappear, but they're not here.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Um, all right. So before I get into questions, just anything that stands out in your mind that has happened. Oh, and I mean, you just got off. No, no, you're going to have the infusion stuff called.
00:01:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Kind of mind.
00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything notable happens since our last call?
00:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, you know, I started working on like a different view of another 71, like trying to figure out the path forward. Like, what do we need to do? Like, what are the numbers? because Bobby wanted to do like a VTO, like, uh, Yeah, which we haven't done in years. And he's like, I want to do one. So we talked about that. And then I filled him in and he's like, know, what, where's it really going? go, we're going to sell it. That's the plan. And he's like, when I said probably three years, I said, I had this conversation with going with these guys, I started talking with them, you know, seven, eight years ago, I talked to them again, and then I talked to them again, like I'll probably start talking to them, actually hit them up. And they said, just wait till this year ends and we'll use the data from this year.
00:02:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I've like three, the last three years. Oh, wait, um, The what guys the founder guys said that yeah So like only because one of my questions was um, did you finally get your bookkeeping stuff?
00:03:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, okay? But sorry at that moment. said hey, it's done. Do you want to just wait three weeks? You know to do it in the game where he's like, yeah, let's just do it in January And then you use the trailing three years instead of only 220 and so So when you said end of the year they meant the 2020 for yeah, okay, yeah So and then you know, it's only three weeks, right, so I I started this new Sheep yet again We're gonna done with some of the exams anyway, it's got like revenue total customers returning customers like all this different stuff and And there's it looks like I don't I don't know the reason for this but it looks like even if it looks like you have to have a spread of new customers being around 40 percent and then returning customers being around 60 percent but then you also need those returning customers to have certain volume of orders and that's that's only happened like twice where like that's what it looked like we get the 60 40 but it's like we're not getting returning customer volume like we did before before being 2019 2020 so it was definitely higher and and I don't I haven't figured out why that would be I do know that we don't we never have pride to get people to come back right so we we know when they cancel and stuff and yadda yadda yadda so then Bobby said something and well two things one I was like man this is where cohort dating would probably tell me something I knew like was there a difference in the cohorts during those times well then of course they would have different outcomes because the customer is not a customer so she said something about canceling I forget what he said but I was like oh if I go look at the canceled data which I'm gonna start today I think I think we changed the the categories but so basically we just broke them out to be deeper so before it was like I'm taking a break and now it's I'm taking a break because I don't make that big deal because they're taking a break. So I would just merge those into whatever the one category was before. So the question is, did we, over time, does the cancel reason change? So if you suddenly are getting more people that say, I'm done, well, yeah, of course you're going to get less return customers. They're done. never coming back. or whatever, like, I don't know what it's going to show, but open there's something because I don't try and just figure out how do you get more people to come back. It's got to be related to the cohort. They don't come.
00:06:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You disappeared down.
00:06:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know, I just dropped my phone. They don't, they don't come back because they don't need to come back. And before they came back, then you get into this idea of itself, which I think is what might be what's happening now. Well, is you're building this wave, right? So we've been building a wave the last two years, and then it looks like what happened was we built the wave in 2018, but it really started before that, because those customers didn't all come from 2018. They were already in the exam, they were already taking sections, they were already our customer, we just flipped them into your subscription. So if you say, hey, wave was really like 2000, 2000, 17, 18, 19, and 19 was the peak, well, then it just went 20, 21, 22 was super solid. Like the wave just, it's like, then the wave was rolling and then something went wrong in 23, it went 20, 18, 19, and 20, and 22 something broke. And then we started building another wave. So it's like two things, like how do you keep, make the way bigger, i.e. get more customers overall, and I don't think it necessarily matters. I think you get new customers because the only way to become customers to have them in a new customer. The broken part right now is that they're not returning at a rate that they did pre 2022. It's close, but it's not. The problem is that when you're dealing with a number of a thousand, it's like a thousand times 67, times two, all of sudden it's like, oh yeah, there's your caps. They didn't come back for two more months, and yeah, there's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
00:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But going to just do that, see what it shows, but the fact of the matter is like we meet with the infusion soft today, and then the next time. says, we're putting out two products. I'm like, we can't do anything until like February. So, so we're good. You can't do anything until February, because we're, yeah, because we're going to put out two products. That's the ultimate, that is the test. So what's cool is, the numbers are super solid, like it's 22 new customers a day, period across six years. That's the number. And then it's the target that you want for total subscriptions per day, more like 36. the outcome of the call with Bobby was like, our short term goal is to be 2019. So we have to figure out how to get the numbers working like that, because we did it before. And then how to go, how to push past that. Can we figure out configuring that out? Can we also figure out, oh, this is the way that you push past that? would mean getting more new customers, right? So then you start raising that new customer number, which then affects the total subscriptions per day.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're close right now, that's the thing. Right. So the target is 22 new customers per day.
00:10:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that's the average.
00:10:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what we have right now, right?
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right.
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the target for that?
00:10:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So where we're lacking is the return customer thing affects the... So the target is 22, we have to keep that. And where we're falling down is the total subscriptions per day, would be total subscriptions per day is basically the sum of new customers and returning customers, new subscriptions, subscriptions. That returning subscription number is like 9 or 10, maybe 12. So it gets us to like 32 or 33, but it needs to be 36. So that number needs to be 15, 14, 15, and it's not. So that's the one that needs to be 14, 15 per day. Returning subscriptions.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Subscriptions.
00:11:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's currently at like nine, you said?
00:11:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Yes, a little aside. finally figured out something that gets me, Tina.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It blew my mind.
00:11:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So on a call with Stacy and Eric the other day, we were talking about building some news that were to have the call with the red 13 guys. Stasis on that call, right? you know, I'm like, blah, blah, on that call. Then when I get on with the call with Eric, I'm like, okay, I met with the right 13 today. like, we need to do this. We're talking about this and that. We need to do this. We need to look at it from this perspective and then Stacy was like, and I went on and Eric jumped in here and there. Stacy goes, is that a task? And I'm like, yeah, it's like, what's it called? And I jokingly said, oh, it's like new website builder or something. I'm like, just the transcript in there. Eric will get it. And we laughed and she did that. So she took that check of the transcript and she put it into teamwork. And I, as a sort of joke, took what she put into teamwork, went to chat, she did say, hey, this is a transcript of a meeting we had today. And it's got like Eric Stacy, Dan, or who's talking, Dan outlined a new task. Tell me what it is. And what it spit out was on.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
real.
00:13:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, holy , dude. And then I cut that. go, do you use Chateu to teach? She's like, sometimes I took it and I stuck it into teamwork. And Eric was like, oh my god. It's like, I know. I think I finally figured out Stacy using Chateu to be done.
00:13:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did you know that Fathom you can ask Fathom questions like that also?
00:13:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't get the there. Sometimes their graphics are so house, like their summaries are just so house.
00:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, have you asked it questions?
00:13:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't use Fathom.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't even have them to come. Yeah. So but it does a better job at asking it. Like when you ask questions, like the summary for sure. And you know what is I think still even better as Claude?
00:13:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
just be curious, but it's not GPT does a job chat to you. a matter of fact, because that's GPT's new rollout. I'm like, they're trying to get me to spend more money. because I'm not going to, their new rollout sucks. I think error is left and right. And now it's like, you're out of memory. I've never gotten before.
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, why is this sudden? Oh, dude, I've run into that before, but it filled up so many times. And sometimes it's because it remembers things you don't need it to remember.
00:14:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I know I had to go through a manually delete a bunch.
00:14:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. What was the latest rollout? Like, when did it happen?
00:14:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like three, two or three days ago, put canvas out, which is weird, like opens up this other window where it's editing the text in front of you. And I'm like, why? Why do I need this? Like, I'll just cut and paste it. But supposedly the code using this canvas thing with code apparently is really good, but I don't do that. I did use it for code a little bit yesterday, but it didn't tell me. I did use it to scope out my first AI. Egypt, though.
00:15:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, oh, that is what I really, really, really want to get into. So I'm gonna, I saw Samuel Woods. I, one of the things I'm gonna start doing is I've been taking some of his, because he always just does teasers. He doesn't actually tell how he does anything and take it to Claude. And I'm like, this is what he's working on. So how would it even get to this point? Because I don't want to spend like these people spend hours and hours and hours every day. I'm never going to be that person, but I still want all the power, all tools and all the ability. But that's also kind of my forte is to figure out how to get where this other people are without spending thousands of hours. Anyway, so Claude's gonna start asking me questions. I just have to sit down and answer in order to get to a place where I can have these agents, audio agents, things like that. then so anyway, He made a post today and I saw a copywriter that I used to work with that actually has like was a huge fan, gave me great testimony on all that. Anyway, he said he created an app in two hours and all he did was talk to it and then he sent me a link. I looked at it to show me the app and I'm like, dude, I will pay you for an hour.
00:16:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I want you to tell me everything you know. They're really not. There's no way they're actually really building an app.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know it's not going to be amazing anything but I want to know is what I don't know, right? There's a lot of tools that are available that I haven't touched yet and so and as far as I'm concerned for the most part, nobody works the way that I work. It doesn't mean I'm smarter than them, it just means I'm different and based off of what other people value. So what I want to know is what are the best tools. I'll go use them probably differently. My expectations will be different. My value of them will be different because everybody else like when they're like, Oh, it's amazing. I'm looking at like, it's okay.
00:17:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But, you know, what most of these people are doing is like, Oh, I made this custom GPT, but it has no memory.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's useless.
00:17:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
like big, big deal.
00:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have not been impressed by almost everybody's everything. But I am also certain that I am under utilizing what is already available to me. And so my way of figuring things out is figuring out how other people are using it and just going, Oh, okay, I wouldn't do what you're doing. But if I tweak it this way, you know, which is the same thing you do, right? You're like, Oh, yeah, that's not what I want.
00:17:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it comes down to what you want, right? Like if you want like a team to clone, just go use Delphi done. It'll work like out of the box. You just upload your game over. Don't even around with trying to build your own ship because it just works because I did try to and It's pretty good.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, but I'm I'm still interested in What's better?
00:18:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's unreal. It's unreal. How good it is. We built a whole clone their terminology for the entire section of ISC which is the new exemption for ninja. So we gave it our books books notes audio Transcripts from calls Q&A like all kinds of and The answers that it gives people are so good So on point all we need to do is to teach people how to how to talk to it So like teach people the simple things that we all know like explain to me like I'm a fifth grader But you can see the conversations people are having with it inside your dashboard of Delphi Which makes it even cooler so it's Like, oh my god, this is the only problem with our implementation is everyone's anonymous, because if you want to know like, oh, damn, ask this question, they have to log in again. I'm like, no, we're not doing that. No, great. So I actually got to talk to Dara. I want to talk to him about like, hey, how can we program it like an auto log it? These are way for us to like make that work with Memberry and whatever we're using. But we sat there. We met with Joe, Joe, Bob.
00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even just like a Google integration or something where people are already like, they don't mind signing into that.
00:19:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, well, they have that. But it's, or no, they don't. I don't know. But Joe makes people log in. Like, yeah, I'm not going to make the log in. But we watched this one dude in real time, have a conversation with him. And it was like, it was unreal. The answer is he was giving. And then if we teach people, hey, take the text of the MCQ question that you have a trouble with and give it to it. It will give you the answer. It won't give you the answer that is like the ADC answer, but it will give you the correct answer which you can then go compared to the ADC answers that you have a choice from. And you'll be able to figure out which one was it, but it also, you can also give it your wrong answer and say, tell me why this was wrong. And it will tell you, it's nuts. And what's really crazy is you can give other people's content. So imagine going and just pointing it at Alex Holmose, his YouTube channel. It'll just suck in the entire channel. And then you've got that in there too. And you can credit him or not.
00:20:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's totally up to you. That's crazy.
00:20:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's nuts. It's stupid nuts. Same thing, you could take a transcript of a print up like you're into four books. They're like, you know, you reference them all the time. You're just open about it. Like, hey, a lot of my things are based on principles that I put together from these books. I recommend you read them, also, you can talk to my clone about
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
those books too. I need more time and energy.
00:21:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, pretty cool.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. Um, that's awesome. Okay, hold on, let me go back to this. Oh, so, uh, can I ask you a question that's about stuff I'm doing for a second?
00:21:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, so Maria and I, I don't know, I think I started to message you, so I don't even know if I did, but I don't think I did. There's a, there, okay. There's a theme that we like, um, and it just mostly because it's, it's clean, it's laid out, it's got big, big font, big text, like it's really just, it's probably, I would guess it converts pretty well, mostly just because it's clean and focused and not, um, whatever distracting, but also not simply ugly, but anybody is. Simple. Anyway, we got this. So I'm trying to figure out the simplest stack that allows us to do an order bump, but also have, you know, a good looking but good working, like speedways, speedwise page loading. So the theme is fast. And if we did it on Presidium, we could do that. With high level, it offers order bumps of cells and all those things. the theme has those features as well. But would I want to put the like, this high level, and I assume it would have form code for like maybe embedding an order form on a WordPress page or what I want the sales page to be hosted at high level. So it's got all the order bumps and stuff on it, like.
00:22:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I would use high level.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:22:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If it's just like a straight boom or a high levels ridiculously fast now, is it? Oh, yeah, it loads super fast. Sometimes like form submits are slow, sometimes, but then again, I'm talking about, I'm thinking of form submits where we're actually going out and hitting our servers, might be part of it, because of all that, yeah, so that's so low, I don't understand what you said. was working on yesterday and it was wonderful and slow, then I was like, oh wait, we're actually going out and hitting our app, so that might be what slows it down. Oh no, and the code was messed up because they just fixed it today, so it scribes up. So they, it's really good, yeah, it's good, and then you can, so I mean, my boy, Greg, Greg has a whole Bigma project that's based on high levels CSS frameworks. We call it something, I forget what it's called. And then he's got all the predefined blocks done. So I just go to him and I go, hey, I need a, we call it, flow blocks or something. could get every, a couple of flow e-sides around high level. So I'll just go to him and say, hey, I need a design tool or a sales page design or whatever. And the only thing that you can't manipulate really is like their form, their checkout form, right? It's like, don't bother effing with that. It looks like ClickFunnels. I don't really give a that much, but you can make everything around it custom. You can't really customize the font on there. You probably can, but it's not worth the effort.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, let's see. I'll show you, it's mostly the sales page. You're on your phone, aren't you?
00:24:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, but phones good.
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people will be on their phone. That's... Sure. Let me, I'll just text you the example sites.
00:25:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then you, you know, you build it as a funnel and all that .
00:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So actually now I'm thinking about it. This is just kind of, I mean, there's the thing I told Maria, like there's so many options here that I don't know that it's great. Um, but for people who are like kind of stumbling across and getting from here. So the buyer behavior, I think is a little bit different. I think you've got, and this goes back to gene shorts as levels of awareness, right? think that when somebody has a high level of awareness of what they want, then I think a really linear like funnel type approach works really well because they know what they want. They know what they're looking for. They're going to like, tripwire, right, trip on to you, basically, whether it's just content or whatever. And evaluate you enough to see, hey, do you know what I'm wanting? Can you understand it? Can you teach it to me? Okay, do you have an offer that's reasonable? And do I feel like I trusted you can do that? So just linear, I'm looking for it. I want it. I found it.
00:26:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You've got it. The price is right. I buy.
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's the, you know, I'm learning about this stuff, right? And so you, a page like this, the homepage is just a bunch of content and you're getting familiar with the person. Anyway, there's so many different ways and approaches to it, so, but Maria likes to put a lot of content. will be doing some YouTube videos and then repurposing that content elsewhere. So I think having a home where people can just get familiar, find and follow is good, and where they can look at the different offers. anyway, guess now that I'm thinking about it, just probably more linear would be better. Anyway, bottom line was, high level is faster than I thought it was and better than I thought it was.
00:27:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then I Greg, like we have what I call the experts layout. It's the same thing, it's based off story-brand, so I built it and then so it's like, well, you go look at the homepage of Wolper, that's using an experts layout. So basically it's like, hey, here's your thing, here's your product, here's your stats bar, here's your featured bar, here's your whatever, just imagine that you scroll down, you're looking at different blocks, right? You could construct, you could put in the blocks that matter to you, like if have a podcast. you have channel, you use the stats thing. And then at the bottom, it's like your guide, right, which is the whole, whole story brand thing. You're their guide or you're there, whatever. And then sometimes I get instead of guide, I come up with a term like we're doing a site for my old investor who's got a hot sauce brand that he's doing some with. So it's like, instead of your guy, it's your taste sage is what we came up with for this dude. But it's the same exact layout. And I just go to Greg, I go, hey, I need that sports layout. Here's their here's their thing. I want these blocks. Here's their logo. And then I handed some dude in Africa and it goes through it.
00:28:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Greg, does he just like basically do like a, well, it's Figman said a Photoshop, right? But and then it just so Photoshop days, we'd slice of that into different sections. is in pieces, and then a coder would put that into a theme.
00:29:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, Greg does a figment, and I give it to David, the dude in Africa, and then he builds it. He's a lot of work. It's terrible. the time is like, how much do you want to pay me?
00:29:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:29:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's his name? You know, one of his names is David, so I just don't David.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you have a link to a profile?
00:29:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, because I won't, you're not going to find him. Actually, I found some of the other day. I think I wasn't logged in, and then when I logged in to go hire her or find her again to talk to her, and I searched the exact same phrase that I used to find her in the non-logging version. She didn't come up. Like what the f I eventually found her. thought that was weird. Well, thanks, Upwork.
00:30:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. bookkeeping, hold on. I'm trying to go back to make sure to focus on saying, but, um, Maria, Maria was involved with this Maria, right? It's got her fingerprints all over it. Oh, yeah, for sure.
00:30:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't, I don't, I don't look at anybody, man.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't pay attention to anybody, what anybody's doing. And that's her favorite thing to do is study and digest and look at all these things.
00:30:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
no, no, I mean, she worked with this person.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. You sure? Pretty sure, yeah.
00:30:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
sales page is like stuff that Maria likes, that she.
00:30:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's, Maria studies people like this.
00:30:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Because then she took it and was like, I call it a whatever, cornucopia image. I'm like, okay, whatever. I should tell her that our sales page actually won. amazing.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the one that you did with her.
00:31:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you should. I should. It did win.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this actually, if you go to, I think it's cleanfoodlove.com. Scroll down, see if they're there. This page is so old. I'm trying to think. Yeah, at the very bottom. So like you made those images 10 years ago.
00:31:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's Yeah.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the type of thing that Maria calls a what the not hero.
00:31:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's something.
00:31:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. If you go to the new wolf retail space, it's right there at the top. The ultimate wedding planning.
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that one. No, you click on the master plan.
00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. This is nice. Oh, there. I think was the heck that she called that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that I showed her because I had one too for the course that I started building. That is still the plan. just school. I had finals week.
00:32:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
kinds of things.
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my course is not my priority. It's just kind of a thing that I want to do. But anyway, yeah. Basically showing people that it's all these other things. Yeah. my gosh. Do I have a 200 point assignment this week and a 200 point test? But I have 105% in my class. So I ain't worried about it. Let's see, we'll keep being a lot promotion. Okay, so let's talk down here. Oh, actually, okay, so we're getting like mid-December. Just wanna talk about like your sweet lot plans. Well, kind of everything. So last week, you're like, you're done with woofer period. The only thing is maybe you do your version of the perfect wedding timeline, but no Ariel was MIA again.
00:33:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, not necessarily. And now his sister's, I don't know if she's going into hospice, but she's being moved to a facility and I was like, uh oh, that was yesterday.
00:33:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, he went off the grid for like two months because of a cat, so.
00:33:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, he's done. So I'm gonna flip him to hourly, so I asked him. So it's just the way that things work out. It's just so hilarious, right? So. in trying to solve the issue with fan flow. Right. I've hired those one developers, they sucked. It was terrible. And I was like, I ain't going to work. And then I found the JD funnel guys. Right. I purposefully found someone that knew larval so that Norio could code overlord. So those kinds of building apps or whatever. And then, you know, Norio is a stickler, which I appreciate. And so the other day, he and then he's built some, right? So now he's familiar with how it works. And I like these guys because they're fast, because they're cheap, right? It's a rare instance where they're fast and they're cheap, but it actually works, right? So I like it because it works because it's fast, because it's cheap. So then I went to Norio and I said, now the the quanella or whatever it is, right? got this. We can get all four. Is the code any good? And Noria was like, I am not a fan. I go, OK, that's all well and good. But are they total overlordable? I'm like, do they just need a guiding hand? Like, how bad is it? He's like, I wouldn't hire them for my projects. I go, it's not what I asked. What I asked is, how bad is it? Because it does work. I go, right. And it might not be perfect or whatever. But it doesn't really break. mean, one of those things kind of breaks. But I think it's more so our use case of it. But that's the code that I bought off them, that Noria was now building our version of it. So I was like, hey, man, you just need to tell me, like, and you just code overlord these guys. Because then Noria wants to go hourly, great. He's going to get no hours. But it was his choice. So I'm like, if you can do that, then we'll switch to that in January or whatever. And so I'm waiting for his second response. sent me one response. But I'm pretty sure he's going to be like, yeah, I can, he's already doing it. Like he made them switch to using modules and he like sent them some links and said, hey, it like this. And then they submitted the code. He's like, now you got to tweet this and tweet that. But I mean, these, he's not writing books back to them. It's like three or four sentences. So I'm like, there you go, bro. So if he can code overlord them, then they become the law of all quote, unquote team, he code overlords for his ridiculous hourly rate. And I'm like, okay, you're only going to get like five or six hours a month. So that's going to be like two grand. Don.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:36:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when, when did you have that conversation?
00:36:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We're having it right now via email.
00:36:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:36:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, he already hit me up about switching to hourly a month ago. I was like, I, I, I'm like, yeah, I got it. I was like, I don't care, dude. I'll pay you. I think he's starting to my guess is. I he is emotional. I think he's starting to feel bad about getting what he's getting paid, perhaps. I don't know, that's just a sense I get. And I think he does make money elsewhere. So I was like, yeah. And he's like, you know, I've gotten a lot better. I go, yeah, that's great.
00:37:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good for you. You've gotten better. Like, well, what am I getting? Right.
00:37:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still getting the same, but it was also in the spirit of me paying him less, I think. So he's like, all right, it would be this per hour. If he can code overlord them, which I think he can, then that's what I'm going to do, because I cannot imagine it will cost me more. And even if it does, even if cost me the same, my risk is reduced.
00:37:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:37:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So, okay, so then perfect wedding timeline to go project specific. Are you happy? in the other guy's work on that?
00:38:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or you thought it was done?
00:38:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's done. Okay, so what's your plan with it?
00:38:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, Heather's everything up. So I'm like, part of me is like, I don't know what we're going to do. Like, I think they're just going to destroy the business at this point, collectively. Uh, so it's like, what are we even doing? Like, why? Yeah, I'm like, I don't really care, as you know. Um, but like, Heather just can't help herself. I'm like, you stop emailing. Stop sending these passive aggressive emails. Like, put up or shut the up. Like, what the hell? You should just, if you, if you want to fight, then go to arbitration. Just get all the . Go to arbitration. And if you don't, then shut up.
00:38:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:39:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
just that simple. Jamie Fane's ignorance. I'm like, oh my God, you cannot be this stupid. You're like feigning ignorance. I hate when people do that. It's like a super pet piece. But she's feigning, I don't understand. I'm you're you're pretending like you don't understand. I'm pretty sure you understand that you're negotiating contracts to get yourself more money. Pretty sure you get that because you're doing it and you won't say what's happening. So I'm pretty sure you understand. It's everything in my power to not respond. And I'm like, I'm not responding. I'm not, I've asked them to take me off and they keep putting me back on. like, come on. And it's Heather. like, come on. And then she'll be like, Oh, feel so bad. I'm like, then don't put me on the even you don't feel bad. Also, you know, to be a dick, but it's like, if you were really concerned about what was going to happen to me, you would have never done this.
00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you weren't.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't expect you to be. I do not expect. Thank you to me. So you're lucky in that regard. I'm a big boy. Literally and figuratively.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it's so she's probably coached on how to handle things, especially with the type of people that they've done business with who are known for strong arming other people.
00:40:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who Heather? No, definitely not. It's all emotional. And it's like, she's talking to Joe, but I'm like, Joe's just, yes, singer. He's not going to. He's going to be he's smart. He just nods along. Yeah. it's, I mean, I get it. Pride coming before the fall, right? So here's the pride aspect. And then the next aspect is false. they're gonna know, like, perfect examples. you know, Heather's like, I'm going silent partner. like, you can't go silent partners. You have access to So like two days ago, all their emails stopped going out of active campaign because they reached their send limit, which I didn't even know was a thing. And then Heather's MIA for two days. no email list went out. So no customers were getting passwords. I was like, this is going great. And Eric's like, what are we going to do? like, We're going to do nothing. It's not our problem. It's we're just watching the car. I share it.
00:41:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're not in the car.
00:41:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We're fine. We don't even need to see built.
00:41:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So what does Heather have to do with whether or not you do perfect wedding timeline so that I can understand?
00:41:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I would need to deal with them. Okay. So it's like, I'm not going to do a deal with them because I don't think there's a deal to be had. Now I could go try to figure out how to generate timeline customers on my own, which I'm sort of doing, but I don't even like the whole point of doing it is what it was like this easy back end thing right 90% of their customers buy it so it's like I'm like I can my money back over an extended period of time. And then I thought oh well I can go generate leads which are to prove that I could but I haven't generated a lead to sell them. But that's because we're like routing them back to perfect wedding timeline because now there's like we can't afford to lose the revenue right now she was like freaking out like okay I'm not doing that so don't worry. So that's the thing it's like you're not really willing to commit to this and then I can guarantee you she won't want to go tell this dude to take a hike. But she should. So it's like are they really going to tell what does not take a hike now probably not. And then do I really want to deal with their their. it's just too weird to be around. So like, why would I go deeper?
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, honestly, just because you know that there is is something to be done in that business. feel like just, first of all, you don't you are only there because of that, it wouldn't be something that you'd be drawn to.
00:43:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It fully falls into wasn't my idea.
00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's the big part for me.
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I Oh, whatever.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, Heather. So moving on and just not considering any of that stuff at all anymore.
00:43:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I was gonna kind of look at the what was happening with the leaves I generated bunch of leads and I but I didn't really analyze them. Okay, you have an overarching rule of not my idea that really, really energizes you and resonates with you. So I was literally just going to give the code scenario, like, hey, you can. But he loves it.
00:44:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
say, Dan, I really think that you should just purge it and just literally give it, be gone, no, no cuts.
00:44:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If it's, Noria wanted to turn it into an event and then, oh, wow, got a hawk just flew by like right in front of me, um, that was so crazy. Noria wanted to turn it into an event managing software, which is a good idea. But I'm like, not my idea. So I was, I was going to be like, you know what, dude, you can just have the code. You can leave it on the server. don't care. mean, if I ever shut down the server, you're going to have to move it. And you, you go play with it. You go figure out how to sell it at it.
00:44:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So I'm not going to ask any questions about that anymore. You should just not give it any energy at all.
00:44:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I don't, I really don't want to. And I just got to figure out how to let them like, I'm dreading like a recession. Not now it's the balls in Jamie's court. So she'll write back this voluminous passively aggressive email again. It's like, oh my God, really? So I'm like, I wrote a whole email and I was like, you know what? Well, I'm gonna tell you this. I don't think I told you this.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't tell Heather this.
00:45:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So remember when I talked to the psychic, like the chick, the really great, the really crazy one? And I'm, I probably told you this. Maybe I didn't because when she was saying it, it didn't mean anything to me. So I was like, I don't know what you, that doesn't mean anything to me. I didn't say it to her, but I didn't, my head was like, I don't know what you're talking about. Because she was talking and in my head, I was thinking about the founders, the founders eyes and ninja. But she said, Hey, there's a woman that you can't trust.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I remember you talking about that.
00:45:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, right.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jamie?
00:46:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Well, I was like, that was the only person that popped into my head.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, Oh, now you think it might be Heather?
00:46:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I think it's Jamie.
00:46:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's both of them, but then she specifically said there's something about a contract.
00:46:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, I don't know. She's like, you need to look at the contract or you need to make sure the contract is right. So then I thought she was talking about Red 13. I was like, I don't have a contract with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I don't know where you're talking about.
00:46:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And then she's like, are you going to make sure the car? I go, yeah, yeah. I'm like, I'm not going to do anything. So I never put it together. But lo and behold, when all this throws out Heather's sending me their contract, Jamie can't drink Jamie's cycling money away. And what she said was, don't don't do anything to me. Like, don't do anything and don't do anything before December 20th. So I was writing and emails the other day, I'm like, I'm not sending this. I like, I don't need send this. I even I was like, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait till just December 20th. But yeah, I'm like, Oh my God, she was right. It's, it's Jamie. It's their contract, because that's what's now happening. They're having a contract dispute. And they're disputing the contracts with these two vendors. was like, Holy , she was right.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild. It reminds me of tangent, unrelated, personal, but just interesting, because I was thinking about like dates, like how people know and see things, but it was so 11, 12, 12 years ago, whatever. I going through all my stuff and just thinking like, I'm not going to go dating and looking for a person, but praying and like if I find somebody, like I need you to tell me God who it is and like show me and help me just to be like not set, because single women for four daughters, like most people will go by man to help things, right? Financially, burden-wise, whatever. like, I don't want to do this. But can you just help me like, see what I need to see and just, you know, sabotage, not do stupid things? And it was weird because in my mind, I saw like the calendar between August and September, but that was like, it wasn't that coming there. So it was about a year and a half away. And so I'm not dating, I'm not whatever, but I flirty conversations, but you know, Mormon level flirty. They're not not crazy or anything. And just whatever, entertaining, right? And living my life, not really invested in anything. And about, well, I have to do them out. So yeah, well, about nine months later, this conversation with them. extra changes from being just professional associates, right? And that then, you know, kind of flirting talking with him. And then about nine months into that is when he shows me who he is like what Victor is and like tells me his real name. But at that point, I was already just kind of scared of he scared me.
00:49:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think he scared me.
00:49:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that it so when he when he told me how he felt and let all the walls down, it was September. It was a year and a half from that point. And it was crazy how many times like I kept seeing that in my mind when I'm just like, okay, I just help me focus and not do stupid things. Anyway, so just you're you said December 20th and it just kind of made me think like, well, because I also learned recently that not everybody sees things when they think things, but I see everything that I think about, I visualize everything. So anyway, it's just interesting how thoughts can come, but I've had, I've had that experience with somebody else too when I was 19 with a friend and I, she was just telling me about all these hard things and in my mind I could see summertime and I could see decision she was going to make and how things were going to happen and I told her some stuff and she's like Tina, there's no way you possibly know that. All of it happens, like all of it happened and I was like, but I don't think everybody has, like I don't get it for everybody, I don't get it all the time, it just, it's like it's when it's really needed, but how cool that some people can just be able to tap into that and also I don't try to develop that gift. I've wondered like what would happen if I did try to, but Anyway, it's neat that some people have these, these gifts and interesting and cool that you listen also.
00:51:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then her big thing was like 2025 is your year. was like, okay, everything, she's like everything you've been working on. Everything is leading up to 2025.
00:51:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, really, she's like, I feel like you're selling another 71 next year.
00:51:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, oh, okay.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because, I mean, that would be the ultimate freedom.
00:51:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, Bobby did ask that. If someone came in and offered it to you, would you take it?
00:51:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Yep.
00:51:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
offered the number. Yeah, totally.
00:51:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, well, he would be concerned with that thing. Because would you try to sell him with the business like in this contract? Because he runs it? Oh, yeah. They would need him. Yes.
00:51:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But I just, I went into something. What's it called? It's like, I got it asked around about it. It's like, I never heard of it. The small business, something stock, whatever. So, and I'm like, oh God, I got to look into this. And if it's true, then I can't sell it for five years. But there's this small business stock then where you, if you're a seacorp, and then you issue the stocks, and then a five-year clock starts. the argument is that you should just be a seacorp from the jump and issue these stocks. you knew this, which I've never heard of it, I've never heard of this. And so anyway, so there is the ability to convert to a C and then issue these stocks. They are free from capital gains.
00:52:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, wait, what?
00:52:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? Stay that again? So, I started looking into Like, I came across it the whole Like the whole universe thing, dude. It's just so weird how it can comes into my purview and I go, wait, what's that? And then I looked into it and was like, holy , this is legit. So I got to run it by run it. got to now, the question is, there's a couple questions around it. Like, do we have to start paying ourselves calories through the C Corp? Do we have to, you know, like that? But if you don't, okay, different story. But then I was also like, well, can I convert D&D company to a C Corp? And then what if Jeff paid D&D company? Like, maybe that could work. I don't know. I'm going to find out. No cap gains. Sign me up.
00:53:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Huh. So what we were supposed to do today, I realized like 20 minutes ago.
00:53:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I love it.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had other questions. No, no, I will map out the mind map for mom.
00:54:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
as a visual, like as a flowchart. Well, it's ever-changing. So now we're back to, we open up the conversation. It's funny to say this. We open up the conversation with the distribution software guys on Monday. So we're back talking to them, and then Don sent my proposal to his label to buy the Lansdowne catalog. So I'm like, yeah, send it. So those are on the map now. They were checked, they were like dotted lines a week ago, but now they're a little more solid. And then there was like the distribution software. I was like, oh, we could do X, Z. Mark and Sean were like, wait, go, yeah, we could probably get those guys to give us an idea or hit a web hook, and then it would trigger our stuff, and they'd go, dude, if you can do that. brief build your label will come after us. I was like, okay, well, I'll ask him. And I was like, that's a really good question. Like, really? You guys haven't thought of this? Oops.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's some good timing, because it's funny, because so I had to explain pacing to Chona. And like, basically that a huge part of it is that there are things outside of your control and even your awareness that are happening. And so you feel like it's sick or I'm burned out or I got distracted because these other things came up and you feel like there's something wrong, but you keep showing up and you keep doing what you can do. I'm like, no, there's other things happening. then you get to the point and you realize, if I had tried to push through and make it go faster, this wouldn't have been ready and this wouldn't have happened and this wouldn't have happened. and it's just like that, like you don't have to push anything hard. If you're just going at every day, thinking about it, working on things, being focused and strategic, right? just, I don't know, shiny objects showing up, right? happen like on time, every time, synergistically. And that's what explaining like synergy is that it's basically the concept that everything is related. like you're not aware of them. It's like there's these invisible tethers to you and to other people. And they're all, you know, on their own individual journeys, but you coalesce at just the right time. But you know, there's obviously, well, it's not obvious to everybody, some people to have different thoughts about it. But to me, it feels obvious that there are things happening, that there is something we can't see a force. I would call it God. I think they're spirits and spirit world and Anyway, helping us through these things, but but it's when you compare the conversations about how stuff happened You're like wait a minute. I think that wasn't you. That wasn't me. There was this anyway, but just Pointing because we were talking about like mapping all this stuff out, but then it's evolving and That's what happens like I've been watching all of your stuff for these like seven and a half years and It does that you keep thinking about it. keep working on it. You keep having these conversations and They evolve and it's interesting to how like You at the center of all of it how many people are not consistent They don't Progress because you just you steadily progress like everything It doesn't really go wham-bam just huge things, right, but just kind of steadily just improving the team, the systems, the talent that you have, another 71, what goes through its problems, which is every business has, right? then it comes right back up and a good part of it because of the team.

Oh! It's trying to cut you off. So this is interesting. I was like, I was in this conversation yesterday, was like, I'm to tell Tina this, but my sister's here. picked up the airport yesterday, she's here for like four or five days, so she did a coaching thing.
00:58:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah?
00:58:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's all women, and I was like, oh, would love this. All women coaching, so it's four women, five women, right? Yeah. it was sort of just like, hey, we're going to talk about these things. You know, there wasn't a ton of structure around the content. I want to say they got like nine. It was her and a friend so her friend also isn't her friend is committed to not going back into the corporate corporate world. Right? So she's doing like a coaching thing. Lisa can not get a job. Every job is not panning out.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, maybe this is a sign.
00:59:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, that's exactly like you should have been spending the last year working on this, but you weren't.
00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were off and you should have been doing this. I'm going to tell you that. But that was part of the pace is that she had to learn it because you are not going to tell her. No, no, I don't to hear it. The world had to tell her.
00:59:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Correct. You're correct. So now they're doing it again. So she hit me up the other day and she's like, I need to put up a website real fast. I'm like, buy winch. like two days. I go, oh, I'm not your guy. I'm like, go to go. Go to go, daddy. And what she said, there's issues with it. But I was talking to her yesterday and I was like, here's the problem. You don't really have an offer. not really clear what it is. But obviously these women are in. just that you do seem to have an avatar, right?
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, what happened?
01:00:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, this is all I like, she's like, yeah, it's all on zoom. We just heard some like $900 with six sessions. I go, okay, it should definitely be more. But it can be cheaper now, as long as it's helping you inform what it should be, tell me what happened. So what happened was, at the end, the feedback that they got was like, not the feedback that they were expecting. They all wanted to do it again. They were all like, I was like, dude, this is money. This is money. They all felt like they created this space that allowed them to dare. And they didn't, they were like, it was just so great to me in the room with other women that were like me, like at a professional level. But then also that I didn't know. And then they got like super vulnerable. Some people did. And Lisa was like, we did not expect that. Like, that was not on the agenda. So now they're doing it again. That's which they need the website for.
01:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we should always expect that because she is so open.
01:01:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yep. So they're doing it again. I'm like, this is it. I'm like, now you need to, you need to take the stuff. You can build courses around this. But what I thought was interesting is I'm like, you have the acorn of a community happening, right? like, this, like you're doing it. I'm like, you should, I didn't tell her this. I'm like, they should go to your circle. Like you should use circle for this next time. Bring these women into women in a shared space and then like start bringing in other women, like start reaching out. And this is what zero advertising.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yep. There is this is, there's a movement. It's huge. It is going to be, I told you like several months ago, niche communities. This is what people, they're going to, they're going to go away from the Facebooks and the Instagrams. totally and they're going to yes and they'll be small and intimate and but but effective and people that yeah yep yeah there's power when I want build a community this is what this this is what it is but what I've ended up doing is doing it in in person with like women of faith because that's really what I need first is the the because I've got the professional stuff but yeah everyone they're they're especially women I think it's probably men too I just don't know that they all know it um enough and they were all going but they're lonely and depressed because so many of us are so disconnected now this this autonomy that we have is great but the cost was that we're not in the work communities anymore so we don't have the built-in social network And that's taking a toll.
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, it's a whole aspect that they don't get at all. Yeah. There's a whole generation coming up. That doesn't, that is never going to have it. Like the work friends. It's weird. But yeah, I thought it was interesting that she's now doing it. like, you're actually doing it. To like map out course, map out stuff. give them stuff to go through. But like, you know, it just meat and potatoes. Like don't you know, organize though.
01:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like that will just fall out of her normally. So what she just needs to do is capture what's been happening and then run her transcripts and everything that's been. That's what I told her. Yeah. It's a cloth. do both. I do both side by side. First of all, and I'm probably going to keep doing it. Because. they offer different things. Claude cannot go get me actual APA references with actual pages and in books and things like that, but chat GPT can. But Claude can, Claude thinks better and replicates my voice way better than chat GPT. So anyway, they both have different strings, so I like using them together, but all I do is copy and paste one conversation into the other, so I don't.
01:04:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm doing it. I'm going to do it with the book like chat GPT for some reason cannot help me finish this book. Like, I want it to now go through and be like, okay, want you to look at the whole thing, look for duplicative stuff is the structure really right. Because some of it seems off to me and it keeps working on it. So like, I'm going to get.
01:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
your conversation too long?
01:04:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I give it the PDF and it just chokes on it.
01:04:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's starting to do The same thing that Claude does, if it's too much information, but it won't tell you, Claude will tell you that GPT will just choke on it.
01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what you might need to do is have separate conversations like chapter by chapter. You know what, it was trying to get me to do that, but I'm like, I need you to review the whole book first though. So I'm like, yeah, I got what you're saying though. It wanted to do that. Let's just do step by step. And I'm like, okay, yeah, we can. But what happens if there's duplication?
01:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So did you try building a custom GPT and feed it that way instead?
01:05:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, this was yesterday, so I was like, I gotta figure out another way.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So because the memory is larger on the custom GPTs, you might try that.
01:05:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Yeah, maybe I'll make it a book editor.
01:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or I wonder if you if just optimizing the PDF might do it.
01:05:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's just the volume of text because it's like the books long now.
01:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I've been adding to it, like every minute.
01:06:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
pages? 60 something.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't think that's too much. It might be the data amount, but it might be the pages.
01:06:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I've tried putting it as just text and RTF. I swear to you, the update is broken. Since this update, it couldn't give me a spreadsheet yesterday. I'm like, what is wrong with this? I'm not paying you $200. I'm not upgrading. Right. Never happening.
01:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you are going to try it with Quag?
01:06:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I think I'm done with the book, other than whatever it tells me. I do think there's some structural issues and there's some formatting issues. And I just want to wrap those up and then get marked to go through it one more time. But I came up with some great this week. dude, I was so in the zone. was like, this is what I needed to be doing. I just needed to work on another 71 of this. This is it. This is all I need.
01:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:06:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
