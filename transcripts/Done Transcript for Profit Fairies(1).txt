Yep, I am fully in summer camp mode for sure.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am fully in smoke inhalation mode and my eyes sting and my nose burns, so if I go like this a lot, it's that. The smoke is bad. Okay, we're both wearing black.
00:00:40 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
I'm always in black.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you shiny? I think it's just the light reflecting. Oh, I'm gonna send you a picture. Samantha, I'm so stressed about money.
00:01:39 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
Why?
00:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is going on? I don't have enough. I'm not making enough right now. I'm still not making enough. I haven't got there yet. And I don't have really any significant warm out coming until September, but that's not significant. It's just barely enough. All I have to do is to you. First of all, I'm going send that Emma and Wyatt, her boyfriend, are camping alone tonight, last night, because just nature and therapy.
00:02:11 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
And there's, I love it.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, the, you know, the, the, my religion, everything else. had to always, I had to work really hard to, because I believe all the things that I believe, but, and, and I believe in, you know, we're supposed to supposed to do certain things, whatever. But what I believe most is people have to figure their own stuff out. My kids need to choose the things for themselves. And they all actually do believe in God and have a relationship with them. But I haven't compelled them. And it just, everything is exhausting. Cause I'm always doing opposite of the people that, that I'm with. Um, in business, I do different than everybody else does. the most part, uh, I take a different approach. I take a different pace. You're not as smart, but also, and not as refined and not as polished, but also, with the exception of what I'm going through now, which is largely in part from taking care of everybody else, which I wouldn't undo, and I have no regrets of her. I have more time and more freedom and more money for the amount of time that I work than most of my counterparts, and in spirituality, of all the rebellious kids, we talk, and they still believe in God, and they still have good relationships with them. And my kids know that God loves them. There's nothing they can do that makes him love them less. They're not bad, they're not wicked because they have and they're not married, or because they do drugs. because of anything else like that and so I'm glad about that but I always have to go through this whole process of just like when they ask to do things and I'm like I don't know I don't think you should do that but she wants all these piercings I get let her out piercings she asked how to do this I just anyway it's just sorry I don't know why I mean just even going off with this but her going camping they're not married they're doing all this stuff together but this like what she needed was she needs love and she needs nature she needs independence she needs to be empowered she needs experiences that teach her all of that she needs to know that she can make choices anyway so I'm glad that they're doing this and I they took them like so many shopping trips to go get all the things that they needed but they have I sent it to you a picture of that little setup last night it's so cute. And then this picture, oops, that's not my picture. This is my, I have a better zoomed-in picture. I finally got stuff mapped out with my own words. These are the, the peach and yellow cards are concepts, the green and blue, like underneath them. Those are the assignments, the action items, the tactical stuff for my course. Okay. And I've been having my friend Stephanie help me. She ran a retirement center for like six years until her husband died of COVID. And her son, in front of her son, and she had been working like 80 hours a week. sent her everywhere to train. She ran that place. It was, it just turned it around. Everybody loved her. The clients loved her. the employees left her, unless of course they didn't do their jobs and then they don't last very long, but she ran a tight ship and it was amazing. And so also she comes and she organizes all of my cabinets, she's organized my garage, she takes stuff out the storage, she's got a my garage door opener so she can just come in whenever even if I'm not here, she does cleaning but she's like she's got a super like organized mind OCD a little bit so sometimes it's a little too much. But as we've been going over this she she's also a Tina fan like she's always like I blow her mind and um but but she sees the value in this so I'm getting a little extra validation along with just her support so she's the one writing everything down for me and we're talking it through because I'm like I can't afford to pay her but I'm going to pay her uh to get this done but Also, she's just like, oh, she like every time we go through a new concept, you could just see her wheels turning going. Oh, I see how this works. I see how this would apply even in running a business that's not her own because they're fundamental processes. So that's what I've been doing. That's what I've been working on. And also like mission work. And so I have all these extra conversations during the week with these very old, very loving, very sweet people, very slow, which is good for me because I have to calm myself down and get over my attitude and just be like, like, yeah, you repeated yourself a whole bunch of times and I can't plow through them because, you know, but and I chose so I'm less lonely. I've got her. got like, I'm terrified, but I'm not like, I've never not had enough money. But I'm like, I don't know how this is going to happen. So I sent that for Proposal mark has said nothing left and he's not the kind of person to ignore me He's more than the kind of person to figure out. How do I how do I say yes? How do I how do I help? I'm surprised he's messaging people trying to find clients for me like he's the if he doesn't want to say yes But I realized the one thing that I didn't put in the proposal is how do you get your money back? Like if if it's an actual investment You need to be able to get your money back not just get your not just get your money's worth But your money back and grow your money. So I'm gonna be like, okay You know 10% of my revenue up to like the next 10 years or up to a hundred thousand dollars above and beyond So you'll make 200,000 back So you're repaid plus interest So whichever comes first 200,000 or 10 years And see what he says Yes Because I need a huge influx of money right away to not worry about it. I want to pay Stephanie and know I can keep her all of these things in the house like even if I can't fill her up with time in the business and I can it can easily keep her busy for 10 to 15 hours the rest of it could be you know helping me with the house because I have so many projects like I just want to get rid of a lot of things I need to get rid of I have two storage units I've gone from four kids and in a few months to be down to one so in a four bedroom house there's a lot to be done so anyway that's my plan is to do is to get as hard and fast as I can like I would sell my time to anybody I've got so much energy I've been getting like six hours of sleep and I'm just energized like I'm good I found um amino acids dl fennelanoline I think I told you about it and the phosphatidol serine which I used to not be able to tolerate that I fixed to my gird issues that have been plaguing me for years with just herbs and things like that. And then last night, I slept on my grounding sheet for the first time and my sleep was better. My REM sleep was longer, not my deep sleep, but my restiveness was and how long I slept was better. Oh, my heart rate did way more than it normally does.
00:10:25 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
So that was really good.
00:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I've got energy. My mood is fixed. I am not being scarcity mindset, even though I'm really scared about money, and I'm getting all the help. My developer girl, like we figured out. If you go to Jameswoodmoretraining.com, are you having internet issues?
00:10:52 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
you want me to turn mine off? Yeah, just in case.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So James, wedmoretraining.com and I just happened to look at it. So I noticed him and Ryan Lee was interesting to me. I feel like they're purposely trying to attract women. Ryan's like, yeah, but they are very cartoony type of sketch stuff, but it's non-threatening, also professional, colorful, what I like about James's site is that it takes advantage of parallax, so it really helps focus, but also he's got movement on the page. as you scroll, there's movement and we know that that helps catch the tendon, which helps retain, even if it just adds a few more seconds that you can keep people on the site. So we're kind of modeling after that a little little bit um and I learned something new because he's got this I don't think it's on this page if you go to work with me I think it's on that page there's this um this moving wavy line if you scroll down a little bit wait what what what's the name what's what what's the need this it's at the top though i don't think i'm on the right version of the website i'll give it a jump shot yeah so if you scroll down just a little bit you'll see this wavy line that moves you
00:13:00 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
Just taking a second. Yeah. Oh, I see it.
00:13:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is so cool. Okay. What's cool about that is that is not an image that is not a PNG or anything.
00:13:11 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
It's an SVG and it's all code. Whoa.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't know that. So I asked trapped GPT for O. I said, I want to figure out how I make something like this and it wrote the code for me. And I said, I don't see an image in there. I said, does this require like a JPEG, a GIF or a PNG? And it said, no, this is an SVG and it explained what it is, but it's actually generated by code. The movement is generated by code. The height is generated by code and then you give it the colors. And so first of all, I blew my developer's mind with that because she's not like the highest end Filipino girl for $15 an hour. She's smart, but but also I've never seen this before. I don't know how many people would have seen it before and anyway so that was cool so just learning lots, doing lots, trying to get support and help and not really thinking about Etsy right now I don't know how much time I'll spend in it I'm not going to quit it I'm not paying money for it I do get ideas about what I want to do and I think that there will be you know seasonal kind of stuff I don't know if when it gets colder I'm gonna want to do that because I will have school as long as I can afford it and This kind of work, but anyway, so that's where I'm out with all the things Okay, I Love it.
00:14:47 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
I think that you're not giving up on Etsy because I have a feeling too like that might be a nice little Boost of supplemental and compress in the Christmas time cuz like even it's only what? Sorry, that's what I'm hoping for yeah is I think I'm breaking even. I adjusted all of my pricing again. And I really haven't done much more than that. But what I'm noticing is that that border collie cowgirl writing t-shirts just sells. like literally two days ago, I got a $120 sale, which I net profited, I think, And I was like, okay, that's really interesting because it is like proving I have to sell like five of these things to really see a profit. So it's like five sales day at a two percent conversion would probably bring me in net like almost $1,000 a month. But I'm nowhere near five sales day and I haven't touched it at all. It's just breaking even. Um, so I want to the latest like in idea that I had for it because that stuff keeps working so well is that I really lean in into the Drunk Fairy Godmother storyline where like all the great princesses have animal sidekicks and build out something that's like what is your animal sidekick or like you know already have a favorite animal and then it's just like tons of swag with that particular animal and like with the theme of like the cowgirl writing style think yeah because then it's then there's a reason to follow along there's like a little bit more buy-in and like brand loyalty because there's more of a conversation going on versus just like them buying this random thing um I haven't had time to do anything with that but that feels really good so I'm going to make time because it would be nice to go into Q4 with that done um even if it's just like 10 different animals or like seven different animals yeah um because it could be basic it could be like cows, horses, dogs, chickens, pigs you Lions Yeah, nice like in my experience here, especially like the things my sister She's obsessed with the raccoons and like I've noticed my kids and also the things that I get favorited the most are my dog Social club shirts and my border collie that is chasing a butterfly I've got other dogs chasing butterflies But the border collie is the one that is constantly getting favorited almost everything. Yeah, yep Border collie stuff the blue healer stuff for me too It's funny how how much that gets favorited like if I look through my if I look through my notifications Oh, I might have cleared them all out, but yeah, it's usually at least like I Don't know Two to four likes a day on just the dog stuff Oh Anyway, so I'll turn that with Etsy not giving up just me just ignore and I keep getting like further along with my idea of flushing out there and then work has been, work got really busy and I successfully said screw it I'm gonna do what I can do and just communicate whatever I can't like like I know I'm supposed to do so I've been even in this even in the most ridiculous of busyness I'm only finding myself like maybe signing off at like six so I'm getting myself I'm not working myself dry I'm not working myself to the bone which is totally been my natural propensity in the past um which has been really kind of like good to see and putting like being able to put my foot down and say like this is ridiculous these client requests are out of like out of this world if we really want to do it it's gonna take me time away from you Um, so that has been nice. John got here literally last night at 1 a.m. He was supposed to get your yesterday at 9 a.m. that gnarly storm that that went into Arizona that everyone was like tornadoes are coming. It was just it was just a really bad lightning storm. So his flight got delayed. And they were like, oh, we're working on rebooking it, but then they didn't rebook it and it had him leaving Phoenix landing at his connection in Detroit. And one minute after his landing connection, he was supposed to depart Detroit on his connection. And we were like, this is insanity. So I was on the phone with him and he's freaking out hasn't even left for the airport yet. And I was like, I kept my cool and I was like, listen, honey, I have your login details. I'm going on to your delta account. Oh, look, it offers this. election for you to change your fight at no cost and you get to keep your first class tickets. I'm like why don't you just come a day later and it took some coaxing but like it was just a click of a button and I'm like oh I'm so grateful for technology in these moments because he kept his seats which he'd like paid a ton of miles for to get first class all the way and he was like all freaked out that he was going to lose his first class tickets and spend 24 hours of the traveling and blah blah blah and I was like no no technology has evolved out of this that you're using so that was like such a nice win because he got here and he was so excited and like nothing there were no hiccups with the travel um my parents are giving their dog back to the breeder today which is interesting it's sad but it's good because it's it's a it's a golden retriever it is going to be spas-tastic happy for two years and they're in their 70s and they're not dog trainers and though this dog is highly trainable he's also wicked smart so he's training them and he's like created all these chasing games he's ripped the corners off of all of their oriental rugs that were worth thousands of dollars he's hard to manage on the leash because he jumps up when he gets really excited and my mom can't like that's just not fun yeah he has been harassing Bruce like Bruce literally comes to us to say save me because he doesn't want to hurt stuff he comes and he finds us and he's like his ears are sopping wet and this dog is just jumping all over him and Bruce's face is just like pleading help me like he's such a gentle giant Tina I am so blown away by the patience of that roller like I get and get why they are called the nanny dogs now like Oh yeah, he is such a good nanny. He either creates himself or then when that doesn't work, he has to confine us to get rid of mean, their structure, their physical structure, I wonder how related they are to St. Bernard's, which are also rescued. Like, I wonder, if you think about their face, their body, like everything, like, there's a lot of similarities to them in St. Bernard's. Yeah, and St. Bernard's are so wonderful. Like, I think my mom had one growing up, but so anyways, that's been like a hard thing, but I think it's good because that's gonna take the whole craziness in the house down a big notch or like five notches. But it's, but it's been good to be home. It's been good to like settle in before John got here. I had a routine down. I know, I know what I need to adjust so that I have like playtime and horse time and dog time and worktime. I know what Yeah, that's kind of the bulk of it.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Separant art and Rottweilers both descend from Mastice.
00:23:07 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
No way.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is so cool. Yeah, makes total sense. they're making St. Weilers, but really that's more like basically reading Mastiffs back together.
00:23:20 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
Oh my God.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God. That's so cool though. That makes perfect sense though. Like they are just the horse dogs that were meant for labor and guardianship and just it makes even more sense that you love them because you're a horse girl, you know, like that's that now. Now I want to feel like one of the similarities between Bruce and Dubai and like spirit and things like that. Anyway, sorry, my brain. You know my brain.
00:23:52 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
I know I love your brain.
00:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so why did they get the golden retriever on the front?
00:24:00 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
first place like because because their dog had been put down and um their dog had been put down and my mom did not want to wait because she wanted there to be another like you know loving thing thing to love on yeah and they just really were not my dad wasn't ready and I think it was just the excitement of like a puppy and a new thing to love on why a golden retriever like they're so that's all we've ever had oh I mean they're perfect dogs unless you don't have the energy to take care of them right but that's all my dad had a golden retriever when he was in getting his master's degree when he met my mom that was Josh Josh died when I was five then we got Spencer Spencer died when I was in college no I think right after college he passed away And they got Clio and Clio, they put down last May, so like a year and a half ago and got duffy in June or July. And my dad wasn't ready and my mom was. And he went back to the breeder for some training in December because he got kind of crazy and then they picked him up a week before I got out here. And since we got here, it's just been chaos.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, did you talk them into?
00:25:33 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
No, no, I backed off. mom needed to get there on her own because if we interject, it didn't. Yeah, you can keep cheating.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? I lost you, but I heard a male voice and I don't know what's happening. I what's Okay.
00:25:56 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
Okay. Okay. Okay. sure. I'm Oh ! ! you eating it? Yeah.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you there?
00:26:14 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
I mean, I can't, I can't spot it. Oh . at the bottom of that right here looks like this. It just...
00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Samantha. Samantha.
00:26:50 - Samantha Caplan (Lead Mare Studio)
We don't have heels. don't have don't have
