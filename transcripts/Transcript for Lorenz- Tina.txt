Hello. Hello. How are you?
00:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Good. How are you?
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. I'm busy. got the poem of Mark. Because we had to move our Monday meeting. Why? Because he was traveling.
00:00:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
That's right.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Tuesday, right?
00:00:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yep. Yeah, he's been traveling.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me too. I was in Arizona this weekend and got home like one o'clock in the morning Sunday. Why?
00:00:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Mark was in Arizona on the speaking.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. He's been all over the place. All over the place. Okay. I thought Patrick was supposed to be here too. He is, but apparently it's his birthday and Mark is taking him out for lunch. And also talking to him about stuff. So I just got a last minute thing. Hold on. Most of the cases I need to get and a little fire report requests and not before I forget. Okay, um, so last week we were working on am I the right? I am on the break down. Equals of the cases, and I'm just trying to find, uh-huh, here it is. Oh, good. Wait, yours is updated. I'm like, wait, it looks just like it was last week. Um, so sheet two, that's the rest, but I don't see you have a assignment of who does what.
00:02:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I apologize about that as the last week of the month, I had one person gone out of the office. I'll get done. I'll be done by getting today.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, um, that was most of where our time was going to go. So that kind of cuts us off a little bit in terms of like what we can do. Mentally, I prepare, and I prepare for that particular type of conversation. but, um, I did get something from Mark to ask about. And that is that. Let's see. After settling a case, the attorney will email, send an email to the lean department. And he's not sure. Mary brought this up.
00:03:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
If you're doing it, or if your team does that, we do it together. We would do the, we would do the, the reduction together.
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what is your pace for that happening?
00:03:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I've been trying to do it. Right now we're doing like, we're, we're getting on, we're, we're, we're at the point where we're getting it the same day.
00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, since when? Since last week. Okay. And is there a reason you're doing it with the team instead of just yourself? But I have no opinion about this.
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
don't know anything about How did I'm learning? Yeah, well, usually they have a team has a good idea. They've been in contact with the providers. And so they have a good idea of whether we can get a bigger reduction from those providers or if this is something that has been discussed before.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A good idea about what about the reductions, is that okay?
00:04:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So they've been in contact with the providers during the treatment. And so they have a better idea, have a better appeal, whether the provider is going to be willing to reduce service is going to be in our negotiation.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and let's say they think it is going to be a hard negotiation, then what?
00:05:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Then I decide what we are going to reduce it to. And so sometimes we don't reduce it. We're paying full to save some time for the client. And sometimes if it's the beginning of the month, I'll get on the phone with the provider and try to negotiate that.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, do you not think, and I don't know, again, I'm asking this, but if that is a lever that has an impact on the revenue for street law, that everything should, that you should attempt negotiation for each case with the provider, even if you think they're going to be hard, or even if you think they're not.
00:05:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
We do. That's why we do. We submit all the reduction requests for all the reduction requests to Oscar, who submits them to the providers.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the difference is sometimes you call them, like I think I missed something.
00:06:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Right, yeah, so like if we get some pushback on some of the providers, then we'll call them. If they're, you know, if they're arguing over $200 or something like that, then we have to make call to either settle it so we can get the revenue in. Or, you know, it depends, it really depends on what the client expects and what we want to get out of the case. If it's like a small case, if it's like a case for like $6,000, then usually we have to fight a little bit harder so that the client can go home with some money. Right.
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if it's a policy limit case, then at that point we have a little bit more leeway because we know the fine It's gonna go home so money Okay, got it now You said that this sped up starting last week. What was the Capitalist for Making that change We're just looking at ways to accelerate All right, so let's just we've got this time let's work on this together a little bit So So do you have you have this dark? I'm going to screen share, but I don't need to be able to get into it if you need to. post it in the chat. Get it open.
00:08:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I apologize about that. It's been a stressful week.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything okay?
00:08:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
My wife got rear-ended three weeks ago and she's been bedridden, so I'm kind of pulling double-duty for her.
00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is hard. How old are your kids again?
00:08:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
14 is the oldest, 4 is the youngest.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, even when you've got four teenagers, it's hard. People think that older kids are not as much work. They're a completely different kind of work. They're emotional work, but that's a lot. So I feel for you. And that's okay, we can still use this call. We'll just do this together. All right, so do you have this sheet open?
00:09:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Sorry, I thought you said you were gonna screen share it.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I said I'm not going to. I haven't send you the link in the chat so that if you wanna type something in, you can type it in and does that make sense?
00:09:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I see, yeah. Sure. Okay, I have it.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Speaking of daughters, I was half an hour late to my meeting with Mark because mine came home from lunch and she was crying. and boys are dumb like boys boys you know yeah yeah she'll be okay she just be treated better and I needed to be there for her so but Mark is always very kind he's like take your time no worries and he still hung around special kind of person that dude right there yeah um okay so all right so let's see what kind of first of all do you agree with the order that these things are in given that some of them can probably happen at the same time do you have any improvement of what's in the column or changes or modifications I guess is what I'm asking yeah second I think I need some fresh air, I've been, I've been inside too long today.
00:11:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I think that's that number six, it can be broken down to maybe, two more steps, there's initial chiro and then make sure that it follows up, we need to follow up with the chiro and make sure the client gets an MRI and then once we get the MRI, we need to talk to chiro about whether to refer for pain management or not.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what goes about this one?
00:12:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Refer for MRI.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It. What else?
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, it's I guess it's probably damages number one.
00:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's not even a complete sentence. let's elaborate. How would you write that? I mean, nothing can happen before the introduction call, can it, or do the property damage is taken care during the introduction of all?
00:13:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So they explain to the client that, you know, we can help out a little bit, but that's, you know, we kind of walk them through the property damage process. But ideally, we help them do it themselves, because we don't get any money, we don't get any fees out of that.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm going to go into Patrick's side and just, actually, let me see, I just want to make a note about this. Ugh, that was not my bottle at the desk, insert. There go. That's You can make this a complete sentence. That is done here. Right. Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I'm not sure why I set up for treatment is after distributions. That should be number six.
00:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. right. So we'll just compare next week. Oh, I didn't know where to move down that way. Okay. What else for that? All right, now, let's break it down by who does what on the team.
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Sure. So introduction call, you don't need to put it right here.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:16:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So intro call, I like the CM to do it. But right now I'm training theory on doing intro calls.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how I would like you to fill this out is something like this. Like you can do parentheses, prefer CM to do it currently. This is who does it. This is who I'm training, et cetera, like really let's be detailed in here. I changed my audio setup, by the way. Is everything clear? How's it for you on your end? It's working good. OK. don't know if you deal with allergies, but I do. And every now and I realize I didn't take my medicine today. I'm just really happy that awareness.
00:17:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
And once in a while, did implement as your goal.
00:17:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Daily life for me. then if I don't take care of it, I can't breathe. It's awesome. That body's a lot of work. I'm ready for the resurrection now. Change me over.
00:17:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
How's that work? Is that good?
00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, OK, so who's your case manager? Who's doing it now?
00:17:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Right now, I'm having very for the next week or something very do all of But then we're going to go back to the CMs doing it.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, fine. Here you go. Back to. Thank So you have Jonathan, Jessica, Mike, right? All right, so Jonathan and Jessica both do this, but you're turning the viewer to do it.
00:18:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. And Mike can do it as needs be, but he's on his main role.
00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So who does this the most? Uh, the, the two CM, Jessica and John. Okay. And why are we training theory to do it?
00:18:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Is it because of all your absences and just so have another person or? Yeah. And John is going to be out of the office when his baby is born. And very, you know, she, goal is to eventually become a CM. So I kind of want to show some, some new, uh, some new things that are once in a while.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Great. I'm just going to go ahead and put that all in there because that's helpful. Um, all right. Any other notes to make there?
00:19:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Um, well, that's good.
00:19:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And all right. Walk through the property damage process. Who does that? Is that part of the introduction call?
00:19:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. Yeah. And then if we do need to deal with BDR selves, it would be either Mike or Barry.
00:19:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, I'm going to do this. And explains me what you mean if you have to do property damage.
00:19:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So the client says I really don't feel comfortable dealing with a property damage aspect of it. Can you just do it? Then rather than like get sucked down because they, um, they want. someone to take care of the probability damage, then we'll just do it as kind of like a courtesy. And then at that point, Mike or VRE will be in contact with the adjuster, the case the insurance adjuster and start dealing with the property damage themselves.
00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you know if one or the other is better or same or?
00:20:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
And Mike has more experience, but it's pretty straightforward.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's not.
00:20:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay. It's not very nuanced.
00:20:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Confirming coverages and liability.
00:20:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
That would be Mike and Barry's perspective.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is this you calling the insurance company to confirm that what their person told you is true?
00:21:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, so we don't want to, ideally, we want to confirm early on the case that the defendant is accepting liability, that way, know, we know we can receive a treat on a lean or something like that, and that helps us maximize treatment for the client.
00:21:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That helps me to understand a little bit. And, okay, or is there any other notes on that line? No. Order initial documents such as police reports, hospital records, health insurance liens.
00:21:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Mike, I'm very.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which makes sense because they're your systems, right?
00:22:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does Mike have any aspirations towards case manager?
00:22:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
He is a case manager.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. is. Okay. Also, case manager, I literally have it in my notes that Lorenz, my brain, I still remember everything. And they don't read all my stuff. Okay.
00:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh. Jessica, the team lead because she's, she just has a little more experience than that. right. At this point, trust them equally.
00:22:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Trust who equally Jonathan and Jessica.
00:22:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Jessica and Mike. Oh. Well, they can both do each other's job. Well, Mike doesn't. maybe doesn't have as much of a soft touch with clients, which is why I put him in less client-related tasks.
00:23:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but he has a particular scale with distributions because of that, right?
00:23:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yes, he's very hard-nosed.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's from New York, so... Hey, you're talking about me. That's right. I can't leave it, okay?
00:23:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, wait, what you want to do about it? can't do anything about it.
00:23:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
This is what the boss did.
00:23:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sending dependent insurance inquiry requests or DMV insurance search requests. Mike and Viri?
00:23:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:23:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Order policy limits.
00:24:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
That is usually like, I would put that in parentheses because we don't always do it. And that's, that would be my convenience if we do do it, but Jessica does it too sometimes.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and set up for treatment.
00:24:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
John, Jessica.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Continuing client medical referrals and make sure they go to their appointments.
00:24:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
John and Jessica.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll to MRI.
00:24:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
John and Jessica.
00:24:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talk to Cairo.
00:24:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Usually that's me or John and Jessica.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that is not how it's going to make. I'm preparing the managers.
00:26:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I use, I use Hank to do an initial draft, and then I usually. Go through it. Make some edits and corrections and then the more complicated ones I draft myself.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Negotiating and finalizing sentiments.
00:26:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I mean.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird that it changed the font. We will default. Okay. See, again, that's weird. Dr.
00:27:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Redactions. Me and Mike or me and John. Distributions. Me and Mike or me and John.
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Property damage. So there's nothing at the end of it that. You would call this like maybe that Patrick was thinking of.
00:27:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No. One that we forgot is met pay, met pay demands.
00:28:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where does that come in?
00:28:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Probably underneath ordering final medical records.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's where I was going to put it. right. Med pay.
00:28:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, that they demand.
00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who does that?
00:28:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
The CM. it would be Jess or John.
00:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. Now. One of the things I didn't get to with Patrick. But that I want to do with both of you is estimating that. I know that. This can take a certain level of time depending on the difficulty of the conversation and the difficulty of the person that you're dealing with in order to have this at the insurance company, at the doctor's office, et cetera. But let's try to put a rough amount of time that some of these things should take in terms of the actionable task that could be had, like an introduction call should have an average amount of time. Most of these phone calls, sending emails, whatever, should have an average amount of time that the tasks take. So, pop that a little bit and let's put some stuff down here.
00:29:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay. So, introduction call, I would say 30 minutes. That's, I mean, the property damage, it depends, that's several phone calls. do you want like, like in days, how long it takes to complete on average in days or?
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so let's just get all the details, could take days, how long would each type of call take, how many calls could it take, let's really write it all out.
00:30:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay, so let's start with the client, because the clients are usually in panic when it comes to a property damage, that's their first concern. I would say when we first sign them on, they want us to deal with the people. They probably call about probably five or six times before PDU resolved, and each call takes about 10 minutes. And then there's a PD adjuster. Now before that, there's the, we have to order the police report, usually that's what the holdup is. We try to follow up once a three, five minute phone calls, and then we have to make calls to the shops or toy yards and that is a little bit more time consuming that probably takes four or five ten minute calls. Okay, that's why I hate property damage by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many, how many times does that come up? you think one average in your cases?
00:33:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
It comes up a lot with the Hispanic clients. they don't usually have the confidence to deal with I think, for good reason, they feel like a lot of people have ripped them off. I think that's a, they came to honestly, honestly, I think that's, um, and so I would say about 35% of clients, I wouldn't say it's a majority, but it's a good chunk. Okay.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything else that we want to add to the property damage line?
00:34:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I mean, If we want to get into the nitty-gritty, once in a while we have to, they don't want to accept the property damage settlement, and we have to step in and negotiate a little bit. You know, there's not much to negotiate, it's basically all computerized. But sometimes if I make a phone call, I can push up the offer by a couple thousand dollars or so.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's good. I think what I'm doing as a result of this is creating more line items over here and breaking it up more, and so that we can really just see how it goes, and then what will come out of this is some target for how quickly things should go, maybe an adjustment to the schedule. of what we follow up with and when in order to continue to shave off because really I think if we're going to target me, let me do some math here because I was actually about the same. So I can't do it that way. Well, I think we need to try to shave at least 20 days off of your average close slash resolution date. And I say that because the way that it isn't letify is not correct and I have to get that fixed. But if we can shave and it's already happening and there's a lot in motion that even if we didn't make any other changes, that number would probably keep shrinking because we've already made some changes, so it's going to impact that time. But we want to keep reducing it. And so, within reason, obviously, there's a threshold where now we're cutting corners and we're not doing it well and all of that. that's not what we're looking for. But the more that we break down these processes that have to happen and who's assigned it, the more that we visually look at it and go, you know what, we could probably look at how we do that and see we do it better. Maybe in terms of time blocking and just sitting down and like getting all the phone calls that have to be around policy limits being done, phone calls and emails around initial documents, that type of thing. Because when you stay within like tasks for a while, you get into a state more afloat, whereas some things are so opposite of each other in the nature of them. One might be communicating with people, and the other one might be research and analyzing. If you're task switching from a type of task where you're researching and analyzing versus communicating with a person, there is a mental lag time to transition between one and the other. So if you're constantly switching this type, this type, this type, this type, throughout the day, you're adding a lot of mental lag time throughout the day that could be diminished or just gotten rid of if you just stay in this type of task until you finish what needs to be done for the day and then move to the next type of task and knowing also that there might be sometimes a day when it's easier to get a hold of particular types of people and so making sure that your team is available to be working those types of tasks at that type of time. Does that make sense? And so, breaking all of this down helps us to look at what are the things that we can do to kind of improve efficiency in just the way that we manage tasks throughout the day, even if we're not changing who does the task or the actual process of the task just when and how it happens. Does that make sense? So, we are on confirming coverages and liability. Let's talk about how long that takes.
00:39:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
That one is tricky to assess because some cases like right away and get it within a week. In some cases, it takes like 30 days. We have a case where we have two witnesses. We have a police report put into the defendant's fault, and we still want accept liability because they haven't received a statement from their insurer yet. So that's, I would say the majority of cases, if we're just talking majority, probably two weeks.
00:40:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything else we want to add there? No, that's One more, just on Completing coverage of liability, no, Ordering initial documents such as police reports, records, health insurance lanes. It feels like maybe that should be broken up into different steps because there are different places, different sources that you have to communicate with. I get it as a chunk, like as a main task, I think I'd like to see it broken up as some sub tasks.
00:41:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So police report. Yeah. Possible life is in health insurance. Okay.
00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Please report. Yeah. Let's just break this down. right. All All All All All All All All right. And he talked about it. Any thoughts about it.
00:42:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Police report. it depends what department it is. If it's Phoenix, we can get it in about a couple of weeks, two or three weeks. If it's Tucson, then it's like two or three months.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:43:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:43:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Two songs of that. Hospital records is the same. depends on which hospital it is. But usually, I would say, about three months, that's like following up every week.
00:44:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get the hospital taking a while because there has to be an assessment and I don't know if they come in quickly, but I guess that should probably happen quickly too, right? just go in if they get hurt, otherwise they go see doctors, right?
00:44:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, but it's not a matter of like the It's not a matter of how quickly the reports are made. It's a matter of the records department, how well staff they are. like Banner Hospital only has, well they have a backlog, about a thousand requests and then we have two people in the office for the whole state. Yeah, it's scary. And then for Tucson, yeah, they prioritize for the police reports, they prioritize criminal cases or civil cases. And because there may be minors involved, someone has to physically look at each report for each request and decide whether there's a minor or not. I don't know how Phoenix, Phoenix probably is better staffed. That's probably why they have, they can get them faster, and yeah, that's how it's always been. Tucson has always been still even when I was before this firm, so it's been really managed.

Tax dollars, hard at work, people.
00:45:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
All right, health insurance, liens, health insurance things, depends if it's private or public health insurance, private health insurance. trolley about a month. If it's Medicare. That's the longest. That's usually the longest. That's about three months. Medicaid looking usually get it pretty quick.
00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If we're following up. What's it quick?
00:46:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
What's What's it six weeks?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So for the whole thing we can say like a month to three months.
00:46:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Roughly, what is the percentage of private health care insurance?
00:46:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
What's the percentage Let's say it's about 40% private and 60% government.
00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is good to this might help me with some five report requests. Oh, my sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&B insurance search request.
00:47:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
All right, that's when there's no. That's when there's no police report, like, maybe on a dog bite or something like that, or when it's just word versus word. That that can be done in about 20 minutes. That's it. to send the actual request is pretty quick.
00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, order policy limits if needed.
00:48:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Ten minutes. Probably a 15-minute phone call to the provider that we send them to. Just to build through the case, give them the application information, and give them the insurance information and everything.
00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Continuing client medical referrals and making sure they go to their appointments.
00:48:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I'm not sure how you can quantify that. Because that's just throughout the life of the case. You just keep reviewing it. I would say, so we're accelerating the reviews. We're now, every case gets reviewed twice a month. So that's every two weeks. And I started reviewing, like you just asked, I started reviewing the cases for contact every week.
00:49:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you anything where you did that?
00:49:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I found some things I've felt through the cracks. I was trying be as gentle as I could on my nudging, but I'm not, I'm not a politician. So, but they know me. My team knows me really well.
00:49:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we all need it. all of us will drop the ball on some things all the time or you being so but um we need to be told and and reminded everybody so if you're approachable somebody says hey Lauren's notice you're kind of dropping the ball here you know like it'll happen if we can all help each other um it's good so um felt through cracks and nudged a on it um like what would you what do you find um well i guess the most recent one is uh is uh today or was it today or yesterday as reviewing a case and uh you know the the doctors were being contacted it was being managed but you
00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I was like, uh, we need to contact a client today, not what you have time, not when, you know, at the end of the day, when you think you don't have anything left, you need to contact him like right now.
00:51:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And how was that received?
00:51:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Uh, it was John. So he knows, he knows me, he is used to my bluntness, my, I need you to elaborate though.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was it received like, uh, did he, did he care about it? Like did he know why do you just like, yeah, okay, what up, like, how was it received?
00:51:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
He said, okay, I'll go right now.
00:51:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Not a, you're right, that shouldn't have happened.
00:51:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I think maybe he said something like that. I don't know, wait, we kind of have a short hand, we've been working together.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as before, sweet lawyers, we kind of. Right. So the thing that I just want to make sure is that, so we're setting some kind of new expectations for, because we talked about the customer or the client's perception of how we care about them, right? So it's not just enough that the job gets done, but that they know that we're getting the job done and that we care that it's getting done and that we're following up on it. So I would recommend just touching basis if you don't feel like everybody's on the same page with that and that's a very clear obvious thing, which I don't think is a very clear obvious thing to most people and most businesses. You don't think about things that way. I think that you should have a conversation about, hey, like this is what we're going to be doing. First of all, I'm touching the cases for contact every single week just to look at it and here's what I want to see.
00:52:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I did mention that two weeks ago, or right after our meeting, I told them from now on, going to review cases for contact. Okay. So I know I'm.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Good. And then anything else that showed up in your review for context?
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, today there is one where we had texted and left voice notes. One of the logs of the client said their phone was going to be turned off soon. And so I was like, well, if we know that we should probably contact them through email them. Not just check the box, you know?
00:53:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, very good job. And what did they have to say about that?
00:53:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
They said I am a bad.
00:53:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes sense. Yeah, let's not be robots. Okay, let's actually think about. So this is the thing. Get off autopilot and think about the client's experience. When you look at their case, so this just popped into my head. So I'm just going to go ahead and say it. When we are at the temple, we're looking at names, we need to be mindful of them. You know, just go through the road experience and like we can, I'm sure we do at times, but the purpose is to think about that person that we're serving at that moment. We should be like that in the cases who this person is real. This is just a name in my log, even if I've never spoken to them, but most of you probably have or will. But what is their experience and it matters. So the the lifeblood of street law is the clients. There is no business, there are no jobs for any of you without the clients, but they have gone through something traumatic, even if it's minimally traumatic compared to some of the others. It's traumatic. They have one advocate. It is sweet law. So the doctors, know, maybe an ad doctor is advocating for them. Doctors are pretty burnt out, whatever, but your job literally is their advocate. As an attorney, you are their advocate. That's an important word. and, you know, you don't have a Hippocratic oath like doctors do or whatever, but you would want to have, I think, a culture of we care. So if that's the case and we're looking at it, just think, did we connect? Do they know that we cared? It doesn't take much more effort. You really don't have to do anything different. The only thing that's different is your intention when you manage the case. And so having a conversation with that, and I'll tell you this, Lorenz, between you and me. So I wouldn't say to anybody else in sweet law. So one of the things I asked Heavenly Father was, look, I don't, I just take my kids to school, I'm at home, and all I have is my business. And this isn't really the place I can talk about the gospel and do missionary work. I really want to do missionary work. So how can I make what I do still be a part of your work and your glory? Like how can I participate in that plan? And the message to me was really just like, I teach fundamental concepts of organization and structure and accountability. And if that isn't preparing fertile ground to be able to receive commandments and the gospel and to, you know, to consider values and to consider the way that we show up, all of those things are gospel oriented. Stephen Covey is a businessman and he taught business principles. But if anybody's familiar with general conference talks, they will see them all throughout Stephen Covey's and habits of a highly affected people and highly affected marriages and highly in the eighth habit and all of that, you will see general comfort on getting goosebumps, which is woven throughout there. And nobody's offended by it, because he didn't actually name it. But for sure, those people when when they hear the gospel for the first time, they'll be like, this kind of sounds familiar. These values are familiar to me, like this, caring about people is familiar, this being accountable for what I do is familiar, this showing up regularly and doing what I say I'm going to do, that sounds familiar, you know, and it's not typical in all the world to to have that level in integrity. So you teaching your team to care about the one. You it's an opportunity for you to kind of mix that and it's really not appropriate for me to say But I'm going to do it anyway, because I'll take my risks or that type of conversation and roll with it. So, anyways, there's just something to consider that you as a leader, you have a chance to help people show up better and teach them how to be about the one, even without giving them the reason behind it, and watch them become somebody who's like, need to care about this person. I guarantee you, it's going to show up in the rest of their lives, they'll pay more attention to the one when there's one in front of them, if that makes sense. So anyway, well now I'm glad Patrick's not here.
00:58:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I wasn't not glad, but it's his birthday, but you know, sometimes God does what he does, and there's a reason that we don't even know it, but that's kind of how I want to practice this law, honestly. That's, you know. I want to care. That's why I went to law school. didn't go to law school to make loads of money. That's the way I want to practice the law. I want to be about, I want to be about people, not about, you know, but necessarily bottom line. Although, doesn't matter because then you can't take people here, people.
00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we pay titling like still money gets the job done, get certain types of jobs done. But I think the whole spark, the whole conversation was advocate. That is one of the names of the savior is advocate. And anyway, just, I was just thinking about it and it came out. So that's the thing. We can teach them and remind them we are advocates, which means we have to care for them and we represent them. But how can we do that and then not show up and be like, oh yeah, we're doing the thing, but we're not talking to you about it because whatever, like we're getting the job done, they are the job. Your experience is the job. They are the job. So anyway, what I would like you to do, and you don't have to do it right this minute, but please have it down by next call. Now, I am not upset that you didn't. You've got a lot going on.
01:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Is your wife going to be okay? Well, I don't know. She's been basically bedridden for... She goes to counterpoint-minds, and she's got a herniated disc, and she's pretty bad shape. I think she's going to be fine. It's just no different from the clients that I see every day. just takes time.
01:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would not wish that I was not anybody, and to lose any kind of mobility. So, hot flash this. had one in Phoenix, and I love the heat. Okay, but then... I realize it triggers a hot flash, and I'm sitting there and I'm trying to pack up and go, and I had to lay down, like, pull my shirt up here, pull my pants up as high as they will go and lay on the tile just to get cold as fast as I can. And my fiance is like, what could I do for you? Like, you can't do anything for me. Um, and he's just, he just doesn't know what to do. And I'm so annoyed. And I cried a little bit, which really annoyed me. Because my mind is ready to go. My muscles are ready to go. My health, like, I've got everything. I've done all my work. And I still got shut down. And it was so frustrating. I could not control it. And this happens, you know, your wife, you've got, I'm sure she's like, I've got things to do. I don't want, and women, we don't want to add to anybody's burden. Men don't want to add to anybody's burden. handle it differently. It's the same thing. It's a lot. Speaking of my love, there he goes. Um, so. I hope anyway, I don't I don't I can add you guys to my prayers. I don't know It's been rough month. Yeah, well, have you put her on the prayer rolls? Yeah Well, I will put you on there also just in case you're neglected yourself and gonna send I'll just tell you I've got powerful prayers Because I got a lot of faith so I'm gonna start sending them to you and I I'm sending the biggest giantest hug for all of you and for your kiddos and Okay, it's okay because that's the spirit, but I know the tendency is and I'm learning this as my girls Are older and a little older than your kids and I wanted to give them the best of everything and let them experience Childhood and I robbed them of some Work opportunities and I mean like emotional work. I coddled them too much and I I thought I was doing the best thing, maybe this is a time to call your children up to something bigger because they were saved for this time because of what they're able to do and so maybe you can deputize and delegate in a way that you haven't before and maybe reticent you because we have we have this culture of softness but think about our pioneer children think about what God's people are made of Lorenz and we're not little off-lowers so maybe the time for you to kind of get your little army of heelmen going and clap around your your sweet wife and and down together I have no idea because I don't know anything about your family but words come into my head so I spit them out of my mouth and I don't know if they're helpful but appreciate that be prayers to you you know oh man I'm not really I'm not a crying person Oh, I make it happen to people. Yeah. Welcome. But. Thanks for your kindness. It's love, Lorenz, you're my brother. And I get called to the work that I get called to just like you do. I'm called for the right people, so hang in there and keep serving the best that you can and don't forget to ask for the blessings you need. I am 100% positive that the law of justice is required to be fulfilled and mercy can't rob it. We know that. But when he says asking you shall receive, I'm almost positive that that is a threshold of justice that he wants to give all the blessings, but the laws require that there be a certain amount of faith that is given and shown and demonstrated before more blessings can come. That's why prayers are so important. That's why the volume of prayers are so important. That's why the amount of faith behind them. so important. That's why the temple rolls are so important and why he puts temple rolls on the home page of the LDS tool that so we can get to it so quickly because there is a threshold. He is just waiting to give us. So ask, ask, ask, ask your friends to pray, ask your family to pray. Don't forget to fast and don't tell Mark I went all LDS on you right here.
