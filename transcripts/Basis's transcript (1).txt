00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Dan: Yellow.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Tina Marie: Hello!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Dan: What's up?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Tina Marie: Purple.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Dan: Oh! Say? What.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Tina Marie: How are you today.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Dan: I'm good.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Tina Marie: I said, but I I heard the delay. That's weird. That's a long delay.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Dan: Yeah. That was weird.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Tina Marie: Whoops. Sorry. That's my dad. Alarm.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Tina Marie: Like. Snoozed. Den alarm. It doesn't go off late. It just keeps going.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Tina Marie: Um. Did Mariel go to the studio last week?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Dan: Um. Once or twice. Yeah.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Tina Marie: Nice. How's her preparation going.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Dan: He's. Gotta turn it in. I mean, she sounds good.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Dan: She's got to turn it in. It's video submission. So it goes today or.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Dan: Tomorrow, I think tomorrow. So she's gonna go back to the studio tomorrow.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Tina Marie: Ooh.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Dan: To record it. And then submit it, and then call. Backs are next.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Dan: Week, I believe. So we'll see what happens.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Tina Marie: Yay. Oh, I have good feelings. She's gonna be awesome, because, you know, she's a Ryan.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Dan: She's into it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Tina Marie: Didn't do it. Y'all have some talent up in there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Dan: Yep. Gee!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. Any any fun.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Tina Marie: AI like. Exploration. Wait! Did you get patches.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Dan: I did.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Tina Marie: You try, sleep.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Dan: Uh! I tried it last night. Um.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Dan: I was doing some other stuff first.st So I was like.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Dan: Uh, no, no, like I exhausted those I was like, I'm gonna try this. I'm gonna try that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Dan: Cause the the patches, things that it wasn't going to show up for a while, and then it showed up.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Dan: So I was like, Okay. So.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Dan: I tried one last night. Can't tell. You can't really say anything yet.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Tina Marie: What did you try, though.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dan: But then the problem is, then. Tonight. I have to go stay over at my mom's, so I won't be able to use one, because I won't.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Dan: I'll sleep shitty, anyway. So.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Tina Marie: But what did you buy.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Dan: Sleep, the the.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I don't! I told you I don't even like that one at all. It doesn't do anything for me.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Tina Marie: Well, are you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Dan: I think it did do something. I just don't. I just don't.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Tina Marie: Did it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Dan: Yeah, I think it did. Uh, the problem is that like I was doing these other tests and.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Dan: I don't know what happened. But like.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Dan: 2 out of the last 4 nights. Not last night. When I was trying these other things. So I was trying this.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Dan: Like. Thc drink one night.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Dan: And the 1st night it worked, and I was like Ooh, that worked like there was definitely a difference from like the nights before, where.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Tina Marie: I mean, th, yeah.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Dan: No no deep sleep. No, no, usually it doesn't work for me. Usually it makes it worse.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Dan: So it was like this blend of whatever it was, tac and something else.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Dan: Then the second night the fucking app crashed. So I woke up in the morning. Nothing! No stats, I'm like Oh, my God! Really! So I only had 2 of those. So one was, you know, sort of wasted. Then the next night I had these gummies that I bought.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Dan: So I tried those. App crashed.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Dan: Like you have got to be kidding me. So then I woke up. No stats. Or no, I think.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Dan: I think I didn't do it that then. I tried the gummy the night before, whatever whatever it was, it crashed so 2 of the new things. I tried. The app didn't work, so I got no deets. Somewhere in there the headphones broke.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Dan: So I'm like, I'm not getting the binaural, because I'm trying to do like all right, I'm doing everything the same. The same supplements of binaural beats. And then I'm going to add this thing. So, anyway, last night I had half a headphone, so not binaural.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Dan: And then. The regular sort of.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Dan: Ah, magnesium, or whatever, and the patch. And.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Dan: There was definitely an increase in deep sleep. Um, but.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Dan: Now tonight I'm gonna have to go sleep in my brother's house, and I won't. Do it, because there's no point.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Dan: Cause. I'm like.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Dan: There's gonna be no sleep. So I don't know. I need like. 3 in a row, so I won't be able to do it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Tina Marie: For sure.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Dan: Yeah. So I'll probably. Hit it again on like Saturday.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Dan: And then Saturday, Sunday, Monday, because I know I'll have like 3 clean days. Well, actually, no, Sunday won't be clean, because it's mother's day, and Denise bought all these freaking mimosa ingredients so that one's out the window. I need 3 clean days, Tina, so it'll probably be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay, well, that gets us.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Dan: And then. No, not because then Wednesday's my birthday.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Dan: So that's out the window.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Dan: Yeah, I'm screwed so it seems like, so I'll get Saturday. Maybe.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Tina Marie: Made me feel like.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Dan: Maybe. Yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Tina Marie: This is not.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Dan: But it did. It was like. A lot.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Dan: It was a huge jump. So I was like, oh, that's interesting. But I'm like, is it a 1 off like I don't know.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Dan: We'll find out.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Tina Marie: Well. If you get into exploring more. So. The sleep I it did nothing nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing for me. Not only that, but I like when I started it, I was having issues. And I think it was because I stopped taking something that I've been taking for years. And like, Oh, I'm just gonna see if I cannot do this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Tina Marie: But I didn't know that it solved restless legs for me. I didn't. I just thought I fixed that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Tina Marie: Um, because it used to only be an issue when I worked out. But like apparently it's an issue every night now. And so I had terrible sleep. But it it didn't really do much for me. So then there's um.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Tina Marie: Then we added the one called Eon. And I definitely like eon just.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Tina Marie: Calms, my mind. And I just feel relaxed, not really sleepy, but just chill. It's like a chill pill in a patch.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tina Marie: And so I was able to sleep better. But I had to solve the restless eggs legs issue, so I had to go back to my other medicine, just to even allow the sleep, because. It was like.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tina Marie: I could cry. It didn't. But that level of pain like if I would let myself cry. It was that bad.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Tina Marie: So, then. There's another one called alavita, which is supposed to be like for skin and stuff.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Tina Marie: But then I did some research chatgpt right and like.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Dan: My chief.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Tina Marie: That's the one that we found out. Like, if you put it on the 3rd eye, you know vivid dreams does does not do that for me, and I'm pretty sure my brain just blocks everything, because any pouch I put on my head doesn't really do anything. I have to put it somewhere else. I told my daughter we were laughing at this last night. I'm like.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Tina Marie: Nothing gets absorbed in my head. I have to put it on my tummy because my gut inherits and just like absorbs everything she goes. That's real. Anyway.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: So. If I if I put things on my tummy, then they work good. So then we added, Aloe vida.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Tina Marie: With eon. And then it just happened to be that one night I was aching, and so I was using icewave, which is their pain. One. Well, apparently it helps with relaxation, too.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Tina Marie: And so like. That was the deepest night of sleep. And then I found out on accident that there's this one patch called carnosine, which is supposed to help you.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Tina Marie: Um increase carnosine in your in your body, right.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Dan: Eric, can you.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Tina Marie: And. Carnosine.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Tina Marie: I don't remember what it is, but it's cellular energy and health and function. And so it's supposed to be energizing. But it ended up making me sleepy.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Tina Marie: So. Um. I knew that it helped me have better sleep when I used it for a few nights, but then I didn't use it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: Cause. It's like, well. I want to know, basically.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Tina Marie: That was the one that helped me stay asleep. The longest. So I was telling you like I wake up all the time.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Tina Marie: Alavita and eon help me dream. And sleep deeply.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Tina Marie: But I would still wake up frequently. Carnosine helps me stay asleep for.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Tina Marie: Like an hour at a time, which is. Or 2. It and I never do that like. I don't even remember the last time I could sleep for hours straight without waking up, and having to turn.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Tina Marie: So. Anyway, it's interesting to me. Oh, and if I add 5 htp. To the mix.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Tina Marie: Out!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Tina Marie: Wake up so refreshed. Energized, clean brain I can actually like, Wake up.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Anyway, sleep is a big deal dude like I have to work for it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Dan: Uh! I have no trouble falling asleep like I'm out. Boom. It's less than 5 min. Yeah.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Dan: So it's just that I don't. I was getting like 0 deep sleep.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Dan: And then I don't really dream. I don't know if you need dream sleep, but I don't dream.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Tina Marie: You do. Actually, I didn't.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Dan: But I have been. With my new experiments, including the patch. So I was like, Okay.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Tina Marie: Good. Okay, so this is the thing that I learned. I stopped dreaming years ago.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Dan: That's pretty dangerous. Yeah.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Tina Marie: And what I found out what Dan is that rem sleep? So I always thought deep sleep was the most restorative. One of them is where you. I think it's deep sleep where you put things in the long term memory, and I think it's rem sleep. I have to look this up. But rem sleep, I think, is where you get the repair. I'm not positive. I have to go look it up. But there is a function that is really important that only happens during rem sleep. So if you're not dreaming and remembering dreams.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Tina Marie: You're likely not having rem sleep. Or not, good rem sleep.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: And so if you get back to dreaming, then. Your body function over time should improve.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Dan: Okay, yeah. Alright. What? What's funny is I took uh. The new gummy.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Dan: So I took that not yesterday, the day before, and I was like wrecked yesterday. I'm like, well, we're not taking that one again. I don't know what that thing did to me, but I was. I was wrecked all day. I was like frazzled.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Dan: It's like, Oh, yeah, no. I felt like I got no sleep at all. I was like, Nope. That one's off the list.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Dan: I, although when I took it I was like, I know this is not gonna work. We'll we can.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Dan: Chalk it up to the experiment experiment over.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Let's see.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tina Marie: Hold on! A second. Emotional processing during rem sleep.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Tina Marie: Brain waste, removal. Um.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, mental and physical restoration. And the reason is because during rem sleep. Is when we have muscle paralysis. That's the only time when we sleep.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. And that's why I like people with sleep terrors. There's.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Tina Marie: Things messed up with them because you're not supposed to move when you're in rem sleep. So if you're dreaming. You're not supposed to move.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Tina Marie: There's something broken in those people. It's not fun.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Tina Marie: One time I had a memory, a memory, a missionary. So.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Tina Marie: He had a nightmare. He had night terrors. And he.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Tina Marie: Woke up in the middle of the night, said Sister Springs is gonna kill us because we're late, and like screaming at his, his companion. And so that was funny. I don't know how I scare people like that. But yeah. Anyway.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Dan: Spooky.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Tina Marie: Fun, stuff. Okay. So sleep. Anyway. Um, yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Tina Marie: AI! Any explorations, experiments whatever.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Dan: Um. Mean I used it a bunch.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Tina Marie: Any. Well, what'd you do? What'd you accomplish.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Dan: Uh. I got you can take chat, Gpt, deep research.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Dan: So. Seems like if you give regular chat. Gpt a URL. It doesn't actually go to the URL. I mean, it does. Sometimes it seems like it. It messes it up.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Dan: But if you activate deep research it will go to the Urls. You give it. So.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Dan: I got a prompt. From somebody that was like, Hey.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Dan: Um. Analyze whatever like it's go go find people like.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Dan: Reading the stuff and like finding their pains is basically what it's doing. So it's like a psychoanalysis avatar builder, type thing. So I was like, that's interesting. That's what I was trying to do with my.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Dan: Um. Reddit thing right? So I had to pay the guys to scrape it like, I wonder if I could get this to go read all the.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Dan: Threads on Reddit if I gave it all the subreddits, and I told it. Hey? You can only go like 900 deep.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Dan: Yada! Yada yada. So I ran it, and it did it. It like, went.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Dan: And scraped, not really scraped, but read. Supposedly.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Dan: 3,600 threads. And then start pulling back what they're saying and building the Avatar based avatars. It came up with 4 avatars, and I mean it was eerily accurate, because I already know that's the thing right. I'm like, I know.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Dan: Who they are, and I know what they're saying, because I already did this. But I want to see if this can now do it. Without the input of me going and get it getting it scraped by Shahad or Shahi, whatever his name is.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Dan: So I ran it, and it worked, and I was like holy shit. It worked. Um, and then I've been.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Dan: There's this. Girl on Youtube called top music lawyer.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Dan: And I have no idea if she's a top music lawyer or not. She also posits herself to be an Internet marketer, and her Internet marketing advice is shit tastic. So I'm like, I hope you're a better lawyer than you are, marketer. But.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. It.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Dan: She definitely thinks she's a good marketer, and, like her funnels, are all whack, so. But she did this thing. Where?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Dan: You know, she's doing clickbady stuff like I exposed the this and that. But.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Dan: So she's exposing the terms of services of these music distributors, and like the bag clauses in them. So the. Content is good. The approach I'm like, Okay, I get it. You're going for clickbait, or whatever.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Dan: Um. So she did like every music distributor. And then she did like over like probably the course of 6 months.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Dan: And then she combined that all into one video. And then she had another video that was like the biggest scam.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Dan: In music right now, which was again about terms of service, but specifically about these distributors, adding AI. In the AI.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Dan: Basically your loss of rights. You're signing away your rights. When you distribute with them.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Dan: So I was like, oh, that's interesting. So there were, you know, 975 comments on one and.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Dan: 4, 5, 600 on the other. So I took that prompt, and I rejiggered it, and I said, Hey, I want you to go get the comments off these 2 videos and do the exact same thing. And it did it, and because it's in my memory.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Dan: It also was like it knew. Oh, you're doing this for distro Flowey. And it was like.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Dan: Here's the angle that you can take like. These are the things that people are upset about. About. Distributors. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And I was like, Oh, this is perfect!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Dan: Because I had already written a whole page a copy. And I was like, I just don't know if it's the right angle. Because you're, you know, another, another another. But here you can now position yourself against everything that everyone hates about these other ones, and.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Dan: Position yourself to truly be the artist. Friendly thing like. Oh, look! We took all this into account. You're not gonna have to deal with this. We're never going to give your song to AI. We're never going to do this. These are. These are all the fees. There are no hidden fees. This is how it works, and you know, lean into. We built this because we were you.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Dan: We didn't like what they were doing. So we went and built our own. And it did a ridiculously good job, and it.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Dan: Clearly read all the comments, and I was like holy shit. So.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Dan: Then I ran it for Jeremy. Then I took that prompt. Jeremy sent me some tool that's like 5 ais in one.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Dan: Forget what it's called. But I took that, and I ran it.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Dan: Ran the prompt for him through this multi AI thing. And then what it does is it puts it outputs like an article, basically at the end of it. And I ran it at.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Dan: 4 different entrepreneur. Type.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Dan: Groups on, or threads on Reddit. And his new project is around like, if people needing funding. So then it zeroed in on.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Dan: On threads that had to do with funding. And I mean what it spit out. I was like holy shit like this is.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Dan: Sounds really good. And it, you know, it's quoting people from Reddit. It's like, we're, I see this, this, this, this, this, this and this. And I was like, Okay, that's interesting. Um.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Dan: So yeah, that was probably the the biggest thing that I did.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Dan: And that, and I'll go rewrite the copy with it. Oh, so then I. Yeah, that's what I did. So then, when I did it for me.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Dan: I 1st I reran it on the music marketing group that I had originally scraped, and then I added 2 more. So I ended up doing like? No, I had 4, so I had to do 4 different music things coming at it from the angle of what is their pain? And then.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Dan: It definitely was a. Different message. Sort of it was a different message like I got more out of it than I got from just scraping the one group.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Dan: And then I use that to go rewrite all the copy on. Not all. Certain, specific.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Dan: Areas of fanflowy, and then. Pretty much all of the front page of Mom.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Dan: To align with. Those 4 avatars.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Dan: So we'll see. But.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Tina Marie: Very nice.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Tina Marie: Um! What? Where's going on with your book like? Where's that at now?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Dan: That shit's done, girl.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tina Marie: Then oh.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Dan: It's in the it's in the can. I got it over the dude? The audio book Guy, is. Gonna give me a quote on. So I sent him.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Dan: Videos of Sean and Mark. And I was like, let me know if this is good enough.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Dan: You know, quality and and con and volume. And he wrote back today, dude, they sound great like they should sound good. They work in audio.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Dan: So. He had quoted me 400 bucks to create an audio book.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Dan: From. The book.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Dan: But the book. I had not sent him the book. So I said, All right. It was.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Dan: His quote was basically 22,000 words, and I go. Bro. I don't know how many words there are in here. So.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dan: If you want to. Here's the book.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Dan: If you want to send me the actual cost. And I said, We're not going to do this section, which is the glossary. I'm like we're not going to do the glossary. But everything else.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Dan: So he's got everything he needs. He'll send me back a quote, whatever it is, I'll pay it. Um.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Dan: So then we'll have the audio book done. Which is the 1st immediate upsell, and then then in the book funnel, and then the next upsell was the.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Dan: Hey? Here's here's all. Here's how what we do here. All the ads we run. Here's the copy. Here's how we follow up with them. Just outside the context of fanflowy.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Dan: So it's like you're gonna have to set up a landing page. You're gonna have to do all this stuff. And I'm still trying to figure out like.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Dan: And I kind of think there's a way I just don't know if it's worth it to like. Make them an offer like they can buy it and be like, all right. We'll set you up with fanflowy.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Dan: For free for a month like this basic setup of it. But the problem is.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Dan: They can't use it unless they. Finish the onboarding. I'm like they're never going to finish the onboarding, and it's not worth our time for 97 bucks.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Dan: To try to reach out to them and onboard them.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Dan: So. I don't think we're gonna do that.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tina Marie: So. Uh.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Tina Marie: Where. When you could. Okay, are you going to do anything with the book before it becomes audio? Or that's just you don't want to go live with it in terms of like ads or anything, until it's audio.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Dan: No, so they are starting to distribute it to people. Um just.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Dan: You know, people that they know. Um I the other thing that I did. I think I did this last week was.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Dan: At some point I had come up with the idea. Of.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Dan: Sort of building, the podcast around the book, meaning. You would do episodes.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Dan: That are related to the book. But it's not like reading the book. Right, so.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Dan: I. When the book was done. I I revisited that idea, you know, with Gpt. I was like, Hey, this is what I want to do.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Dan: Um. If you look at now, here's the whole book.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Dan: Go through the book and tell me. How many topics? Right? Not just the 9 steps, but like.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Dan: Topics within a step, because some. Steps are deep.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Dan: Like funnels right like that could be a whole freaking. Episode.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Dan: Just talking about funnels, or whatever, so. I was like, go through the book and then tell me how many things are in here that you think could be like a half hour episode that you could like set up the thing, expand on it, talk for half hour. So it did, and it went through. And it let's say it created like 30 episodes.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Dan: And I was. And I was like, Okay, now I want you to. Come up with the title for each episode, and a short description about what the episode would be about.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Dan: So it did that. So and I was like, Okay, this is interesting. Then I came up with this whole naming convention.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Dan: That's basically like when it's of the book, it's compass series. So it's like.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Dan: Whatever we don't have to get into it. But the idea is that when all the episodes are done. You could create a playlist that organizes them in succession.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Dan: And then say, Hey, you can go. Listen to the Compass series on Youtube. It's all set up as a playlist. And you're basically it's like, it's like a.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Dan: An add on to the book, or if you don't have the book, it's essentially the book. But.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Dan: It's us talking about these things, right? So it's like real world. Discussion of whatever it is.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Dan: And then interspersed throughout, that are. These hero. Journey. Episodes.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Dan: That um that I came up with. So they already recorded, like 3 or 4 of those.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Dan: Um. And then.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Dan: So for those I was like, Okay, I've got the topic. I've got the Episode Guide. I have the description. What the show is about. So then I was like, how are they going to.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Dan: Like they. We need a structure for that. But I don't want it to be like a script. I just want it to be structured, and I want it to be structured in a way that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Dan: If they follow the structure. Purely by following the structure. They're following an educational framework for lack of a better term.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Dan: So. You know, I just put that thought out into the universe like I do, and then didn't really look into it. Just was like, hang on. I gotta do that. I gotta do that.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Dan: And then, when I met with David. On Friday.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Dan: Um. He was. Going through. He went and did this presentation at some event. I forget what it was.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Dan: And so he's, you know. Presentation went real. Well, whatever. And he was like, yeah, I used um.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Dan: He's like I built it all around the the thing that Mackenzie used in the eighties. It's the pyramid principle. Blah blah blah blah. And the second, and then he started explaining, and I was like, Oh, my God! This is it! This is what I need.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Dan: And I'm like, what's this called. And he's he explained it to me, and it's like this. I guess it's just a very.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Dan: Proven structure for doing a presentation. I go, okay, well, that's basically what this podcast is like, I'm, like, No, one knows that. So I took notes on that, and then I got. I found a Pdf. Of the book.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Dan: I put it into Gpt. And I basically created a podcast. Episode. Create, outline, creator.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Dan: So I gave the Gpt. The Csv. Of all the episodes and the titles and the description.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Dan: And then I gave it a knowledge base built around this. Pyramid principle concept, and it's got like a 4 letter.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Dan: Acronym, thing. And then it's designed that.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Dan: If they stick in the title of an episode. It will then go build the outline of that episode with example, scripts.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Dan: That they don't have to use. But just like this is kind of what you would do. You'd go, you'd start here, and then you'd talk about it like this, and then you'd move to this. You talk about that, and then you move to this, and then you recap, and then it's over.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Dan: So I built that, and then I ran it, and I was like, this is sick. Okay.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Dan: It's sick. So.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Dan: They've got that they're supposed to start. Using that I need them to record 2 episodes.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Dan: And then we can.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Tina Marie: Was the yawning.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Dan: I know, and then we can, if they record the 2 episodes that I highlighted. Then we can launch the podcast, because we'll have 4 episodes in a row that are done.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Dan: And then they just need to record one or 2 a week to stay ahead of it. And I think right now there's 30.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Dan: There's between 38 and 40 episodes. But. At any time you could drop in like a hero's journey episode in between.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Dan: So there's 34, or 35 that are on the book. And then there's.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Dan: 5 or 6 that are. Hero's journey uh, or interview, style.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Dan: Which is always a hair's journey.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Tina Marie: Aaron? Is the it.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Dan: Uh. So yeah, so then we could launch the podcast.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Tina Marie: Don't worry.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Dan: So I want the book funnels being built. The 1st upsell is gonna be done, or the bump is gonna be done.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Dan: The upsells defined. I just not totally sure on that yet. And then.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Dan: Then that goes to like a. A coaching, offer, book, a call, page.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Dan: And that's it. Um. But meanwhile, yesterday I started building the spotify cold outreach funnel.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Dan: Which is just another variation of the song submission thing. And uh.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Dan: Oh, God, dang! I'll see if I can get that rolling. Yeah, I know.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Tina Marie: Jeez.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Dan: Okay.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Good.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um trying to follow all of that, and then still, like kind of formulate my questions.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Dan: So.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Tina Marie: You have. You're going to make.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Tina Marie: AI Podcasts. Or you're outlining it, and then you're gonna record them.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Dan: No, no, just the just. The AI outlines it. They record them, live.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Dan: Cause. The problem is that I'm like, I know, they're just gonna sit there and bullshit. But I'm like they need to bullshit.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Dan: Like.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tina Marie: Around it.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Tina Marie: Framework.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Dan: Yeah, you need to. Bullshit around a frame within a framework, and it should be fine.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Dan: Which they did, for they did that with the hero's journey with they had that ahead of time. I'm like, do it like this. But you know it's not scripted. It's just.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Dan: Outlined.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So your.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Tina Marie: Funnel. Or at least a.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Tina Marie: Path. Or a funnel right.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Tina Marie: Would be.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Tina Marie: A, podcast, talking about. Is it the hero's journey of musicians?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Tina Marie: Like? What would the podcast be called.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Dan: Specific bands.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: Specific bands.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Dan: Yeah, so they. The first.st

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Dan: 2 journeys are. So the the beginning of the podcast, is like, Hey, it's us.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Dan: That episode's done. Then the 1st episode after that is.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Dan: Um. Well, we can. Kind of rejigger. This, if we want.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Dan: You either go right into the first.st Compass episode, which is Hey? We wrote this book.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Dan: And blah blah blah blah! So that would be like a call to action to you can go get the book at. You know, mom.com slash book.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Dan: Um.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Dan: And then it's like heroes. Then it's like introducing them. Through their their individual heroes, journeys.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Dan: So it's Prospect Hill, which is Mark and Johnny. And then there's a interview with.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Dan: Jim and Null set. And then there's they did one. I think they did a Lansdowne one, or they the Lansdowne ones.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Dan: I don't think it was done then, but it will be done. But there is a Lansdowne one. So, or a sean one. So Kashawn.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Dan: W. Has done other stuff like prior to Lansdowne. But then, you know, Lansdowne's what he's been doing for. The better part of like the last 15 years.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Dan: And then they did one with. Um! 2 of the bands are on the platform. No. 3 3 of the bands that are on the platform.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay, wait. They already did those.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah. They're all done.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Tina Marie: What's the name of the. Podcast.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Dan: Make our music, podcast.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I like that! When when did your 1st episode go live?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Dan: It hasn't, because there's a gap in the episodes. I need them. They're recording the 2.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Dan: Quote unquote missing episodes this week. Actually today, I think.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And so.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Tina Marie: When the podcast goes live.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: Then what are you doing like? Are you running ads, or just letting it go organic like.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Dan: Hold on!

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Tina Marie: And then where is there a call to action in the podcast?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Dan: Ah! Yeah. So the call to action will be to the bulk.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Dan: Or the and the community. To mom.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Dan: And then the book. Those 2, not Fanflowie Fanflowy will get calls to action when Fan Flowy is in the episode, which is not every episode, but.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Dan: Every, not every hero's journey either, but. So like Null, said, Jim's band is not using fanflow because they're not really playing anymore. But.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Dan: Um. So Fan Flare will be called out in certain episodes.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Dan: But then also, if they go to make our music like fan fluid to surf, Louis, all those things are going to be listed there. Um.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Dan: So, yeah. And then.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Dan: We'll promote it to. The list.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Dan: And then we'll promote it to the community. Right? So. Once the podcast. Episodes are done, check once the book funnels done check right? They can buy the book. Right now, you can't.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Dan: So I need the book funnel to be done. I need the episodes to be done. The mom. Content needs like.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Dan: Some testimonials, and then I'm removing a section for now. Um.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Dan: Then that's done. Then it would be okay.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Dan: The community's done. It's been done. I do have that guy. I have the dude enable and working on something for that. But it's like super basic.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Dan: So then it would be okay. Let's give the book.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Dan: To everyone that Mark has had a phone call with. That has not purchased. Well, let's give the book to everyone that's purchased every customer. Here's the book.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Dan: Join the community. Do your in, do your welcome post, which is what Evelyn and the dude are working on.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Dan: Um.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Dan: Like how to do that, how we want it. And then, so we'll invite.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Dan: Everyone. That's a customer. Friends and family.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Dan: Uh, then then reach out to people that have done a call with mark that didn't purchase and be like, Hey. This wasn't done at the time. But here's a copy of this book.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dan: Also join the community. So we'll get them in there and then then it would be, Hey, we dropped a, then we drop a podcast, episode. So then, that goes in the community 1st episodes out.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Dan: Um. That'll go out to the list that we're we're building inside of the mom. Sub. Account, now.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Dan: And then that's it. Then the machine. Then the machine is on.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Tina Marie: Wonderful. Holy crap that was loud.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. My heart is like.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Dan: No worries.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: What do you call it? Breezing.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Dan: Oops!

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Tina Marie: Can't even. Focus.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Tina Marie: Turn to do, not disturb and turn that volume down. Can't even turn it down, because it's like going to voicemail.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Tina Marie: It's just a stupid spam call. Get off my phone.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Dan: Get out!

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Tina Marie: Seriously, Block.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Dan: Get.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Tina Marie: Get off my lawn. Oh no!

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tina Marie: Um. Hold on a second. I need to go to the let's see. Recap, bye.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Tina Marie: Marketing. It's like, I just dumped my brain.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Tina Marie: See if it'll give me this. Um.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Tina Marie: Because I cannot stitch it all together. In my head.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Tina Marie: Book lines, hold on! Yes, come on. The rest. Complete the book funnel with. Audio book as 1st upsell, distribute book to initial contacts, add coaching, offer as final upsell.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Tina Marie: Release. The make our music podcast with completed episodes. Structure includes compass series, book related. And heroes journey episodes.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Tina Marie: Episodes follow pyramid principle, framework. I'm going to ask questions about that.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: Initial releasing to existing community and email list. Give book to all existing customers. Oh.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Tina Marie: 3, okay. Oh, community building! That's a new section.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Tina Marie: Invite customers to join community, share book with past consultation, calls. Probably clients.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Tina Marie: Drive community engagement through welcome posts, use podcast episodes to fuel, ongoing discussions. Distribution channels are website, copy, rewrite based on avatar analysis.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Tina Marie: Fanflow integration where relevant and spotify cold, outreach funnel. And cross promotion across platforms.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Tina Marie: Sound, right.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Dan: Yep.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Tina Marie: Yoop!

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Dan: There's a method to the madness.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Tina Marie: There is a method to the madness, and it's even extractable.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Tina Marie: I'm I'm distractible, and the phone rings and my heart goes. Um.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Tina Marie: Hold on! A second. Just looking at.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Tina Marie: So. I guess Mvp. Is. Do all of this internally right, and see how it's received in the community. Check out what conversion rates are the prices.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: The feedback, and all of that, and then. Create.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if you're planning on it, but I would assume so because you do this so well with Google ads. But ads or Facebook ads, I guess. To get more.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: Views like Youtube as seem like, would be a great idea.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Dan: Uh.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Tina Marie: To get people to see your podcast.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Dan: Yeah, maybe I mean, like. You know, like.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Dan: It just to me that stuff is. Just.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Dan: Content marketing.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Dan: And it's like. The goal is.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Dan: To get people to buy the high ticket with the onboarding right with the the. Onboarding them under fanflow, but then.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Dan: Also have the community turn into a content marketing thing, too, because. Even if you're in there, and you only bought the book.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Dan: Like you can ask questions. But.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Dan: Almost all the answers could be like, you really need to get on fanflowing. Now, of course, many people won't be able to get on Fanfloyd, because they can't afford it right now, and we can't afford to have people that can't afford it.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Dan: So it's sort of like a sorry gang. Like it's invite only for a reason like.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Dan: We wish we could help everyone, but where it's not ready. To go. Diy.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Dan: I also don't think it's. I mean, part of me thinks it'll never work like that, because, unfortunately, these people need hand holding.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Dan: So over time. Maybe our price can come down for that, because we've streamlined the onboarding so much that it's like, you know what? And we. And we're talking about doing that. We're talking about having downsells that are like. Hey, it's the lowest thing is 7, 750 bucks.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Dan: And it takes you through onboarding. And the 1st 3 steps of the book, which are the most. Important, for, like a newer artist.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Dan: And then for an older, more established artist, they may or may not have made mistakes there which we can help. Plug, or we can just give them the assurance that, like hey, you did it right.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Dan: Or they might be missing one piece like you know what you should have a publishing company. For this reason, like, whether you know it or not.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Dan: And a perfect example is like, I talked to someone yesterday, um! Or I was talking to Salco about someone that he gave the book to. And this girl. Supposedly wrote a song.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Dan: Signed a split sheet, which is like, Hey, when you're with the songwriters you sign a split sheet like this is going to be the royalty split. And then she subsequently.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Tina Marie: It's like, what.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Dan: Sold the song to a movie. And now the other 2 writers are like, Hey, we get the split she signed was like a Nashville split, which is basically 3, rd a 3, rd a 3.rd

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Dan: Although she did a 3, rd she did. She has 1 point more than everyone else, but it really doesn't mean anything. It's not like I don't know what she thought. I don't know if she thought that gave her power or whatever, but it doesn't, unless the split sheet says that. So her issue is that she signed the split sheet. She sold it to Sync.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Dan: Um. Technically.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Dan: They don't get sync rights. But.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Dan: It's like. Technically they don't get it. She didn't know that.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Dan: So they're saying we get synced. She's saying you don't. But if the split sheet had been written correctly, this there would be no argument.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Dan: Because the split sheet would either say, You get sync or you don't get sync. And the split sheet would have said other things like.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Dan: That she probably isn't aware of. They can all sell the song. Not just her.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Dan: One of them could have done it. Unless the split sheet says that so, and then she doesn't have a publishing company. Had she had a publishing company.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Dan: She could have gotten publishing royalties. But now she won't.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Dan: And then. She!

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Dan: I don't know if there's a produce like. So in my scenario. I'm pretty much the producer of every song.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Dan: So I'm not working with a producer. I'm producing it like, I'm the one that's saying, Hey, we're gonna we're gonna this is, gonna be the structure. This is going to be the sound.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Dan: This is going to be the vibe, whatever like. I'm sort of the Rick Rubin right? Also. Now. Whether or not she produced the song I don't know, but let's say she did. Well, she'd get producer royalties, but she's not because she didn't put that in there.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Dan: So there are lots of, and she.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Dan: Very likely doesn't have a label. Has she had a label. She could have maybe worked in recoupment right? So she paid for the song to get produced or recorded.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Dan: And they didn't, so she could have had a recoupment clause in there that says, Yeah, you get your royalties after the label recoups, or whatever there's. Things she could have done.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Dan: So there are other bands. Not that she's seasoned, because clearly she's not, but none of them are. So it's like.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Dan: That that 7 50 level you could bring on a total Newbie. Or a seasoned band that. And you're just.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Dan: You're just. Saying, Okay, I get it. You don't have any money.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Dan: But. So this is the bare minimum we can do it for. So we came up with like 2.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Dan: 2 down cells, essentially. So it's 3 steps, 6 steps.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Dan: And then the regular thing that we're selling is all 9 steps. But for now we're only selling the 9 step version.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Dan: Because I don't know if we'll ever really be able to do those other 2. But they exist.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Dan: And then. We came up with an upsell version, that is, hey? We get you through all.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Dan: We get you through. 6 steps, and then step 7, 8, 9 is.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Dan: Not really like releasing a song. So what we're. Doing with everybody is.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Dan: Now let's promote one of your songs. Right because typically.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Dan: As far as I know, no one's come in and been like I'm releasing a song at the same time. Right? Which would be great. And then that we could really run them through. 7, 8, 9 is write a song.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Dan: Promote a song, or write a song. Get the promotion materials together, release it.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Dan: And then the way it's supposed to work is. We have what's called the continuous release cycle. So when you go through all 9 steps, then you go back to step 7, and you go? 7, 8, 9.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Dan: Then you go back to step 7, you go 7, 8, 9. 7, 8, 9. And you do that every.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Dan: 8 to 12 weeks. So that you're consistently putting our product.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Dan: So the upsell is. Hey!

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Dan: Do you want to write and release a new song as part of this. If so, we will.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Dan: Hold you accountable. And help in whatever way.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Dan: To get a new song written. Produced, released.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Dan: And then that's another. That's 2 grand. So.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Dan: We haven't offered it to anybody yet, but we're going to.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tina Marie: Do you know who you're gonna offer to.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Dan: It's up to Mark. He'll know. He'll know he'll know who's in the right position for it.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Tina Marie: So what have you guys built in terms of like. Ah! Tracking revenue.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Tina Marie: That's been made so far. What what the offers were, what the prices were. The conversations we've had probably a few times now.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Dan: So there's only one price. So there's only been one.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: No, but I thought you said they've sold it at different prices over time.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, no. But in 2025 we were. It's 1 price. It's like the price is, the price is the price. It's 2,500 bucks.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Dan: Um in.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Tina Marie: That I'm asking historically. Like for historical data.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Dan: I don't care. Yeah, it's all. It's all shit.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Tina Marie: You know.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Dan: It's useless. Because because of that.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Dan: So we're. Building. We have the air table thing built.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Dan: To track the calls. But and then that will track the closes, and then that will track the revenue.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Tina Marie: You don't. You don't think it's relevant to know what people were willing and happy to pay for historically.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Dan: No. Nope.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Tina Marie: How.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Dan: Because there was no script. There was no, there was no book, there was no offer like he wasn't selling what we're selling. He was selling. Whatever the hell he could sell.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Dan: So it's like. I don't know what you were selling, but good job.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Dan: But this is what we're selling now. So right now, all you can buy.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Dan: Is what's called the indie navigator, and it's like, Hey, the Indie navigator is. We go through all 9 steps of the book with you. And that's 2,500 bucks, and that's it. Before it was like, you gotta do this.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Dan: And that's why the price was all over the place. And then they also learned. Yeah, that wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth it to just get a thousand bucks.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Dan: To get just anybody, because they've they've got a couple pain in the ass. People.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Dan: That they. Certainly regret.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Dan: Selling to. But whatever. They're still on the platform.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Tina Marie: You were not worth your money.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Dan: Yeah. Exactly, and then they don't want to like release their music. It's like, what are you doing then? Like if you don't want to put your song out. Then what are you doing?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Dan: So anyway, ah. So going forward, it's like it's the same, the same, the same. And then Mark and I like, I think we're on version 3 of the script.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Dan: Um, but it's essentially the same. It's just more honed. And then he has. A guy. I think it's today. I don't know. They were texting me.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Dan: Today or tomorrow. This dude's gonna start. Being on Mark's calls.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Dan: Like shadowing the call.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Dan: And and he might be the 1st sales. Guy. Um. That we bring on.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Dan: So. I don't really know um.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Dan: I I haven't looked at it. But I yesterday I was like, I I gotta get my hand, my head around this, but like. According to Mark, like he's always on the phone so. But like I don't know how many calls are being booked a week.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Dan: Because the tracking is all Wonky. So we built the new tracking and air table.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Dan: But then. High level. For whatever reason or not, really high level, I guess twilio.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Dan: Will not give. Make our music a phone number. Like every time we submit it, they reject it.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Dan: And they're saying we can't confirm the business, and the business is me. And all the information is correct.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Dan: So I'm like, I don't know why. So they rejected it twice. And then Johnny's like you give it a try. So.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Dan: On Wednesday I submitted it. And I think maybe I know why they turned it down. I think.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Dan: That they didn't like the terms. Or where the terms were linked.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Dan: 2 or something. So whatever. So I made some tweaks there. I submitted it, but our tracking will not work until.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Dan: That phone number's on because. If we put everyone in there, we need to send them reminders, and we can't send reminders from that account.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Dan: So right now, all the data is going over there. And if Mark updates things in one account, it should track over to that account. So we'll see on Monday, like how accurate it is.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Dan: And then it's gonna come down to. I'm sure you've never dealt with this. Making sure the sales Guy actually does the thing where he clicks the box like, you know, you have to click that box for this to work right?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Dan: Did you close that person.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Tina Marie: It.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Dan: You have to. Click the close box like we can't do that for you.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Dan: And shockingly. He has not been doing that. Um.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Tina Marie: Shocking!

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Dan: Shocking!

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Tina Marie: Stocking.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Dan: Every Monday. He's like, that's not right, I'm like. But did you do the part. So hopefully. That will be resolved, certainly not by this Monday by, but by the following Monday.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Dan: And then once, if that's all working, then. Then we have to add in a layer of.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Dan: Sort of tracking, but we don't really need to do this right away, but it would be tracking by source. Right? So right now we get an occasional lead through Fan Flowy somehow. And then everything is from rock, rage.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Dan: And then. Cold email, funnel.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Dan: Would be rock, rage, spotify. So brock rage.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Dan: Song. Submission is like. We could call that Facebook ads, because that's what it is. So there's rock rage, Facebook. And then there'd be rock, rage, spotify.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Dan: And then there would be like the book. Which would be, yeah, the book. And then there'd be fan fluid. So you'd start to.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Dan: Go. Okay? Well, what? Show me the metrics? On how many spotify calls were there? What's the close rate on the spotify lead. All that good stuff.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Tina Marie: All of that.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Tina Marie: Yup! I love it. When a plane comes together.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome. Okay? Um.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Dan: And then like, do we ever get to like. Getting Maria to run ads. Only if we have a sales team.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Dan: Because if that. Were to work you'd be flooded with phone calls.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Dan: And it would be like. Yeah. You gotta be ready for that.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Tina Marie: Man. Have you heard the AI salespeople thing now, like there's different ones. But. It's crazy how fast and good they can be.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Dan: No, I haven't seen it at all.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh, dude! You should look into that because they're. So when we 1st heard of there was like this whole, you know. Gap right like when you talk to chat. Gbt.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Tina Marie: But they've got faster models now that respond much quicker. And they sound more natural like there's a tone inflection.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Tina Marie: Um. Yeah.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I mean. Just.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Tina Marie: I'm curious, because you know how many people, and I especially I feel like. Most musicians aren't really going to.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Tina Marie: Pick up. Oh, this is AI. Maybe I don't know. But.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Tina Marie: I wonder!

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Dan: Well, this is all like, you know, zoom face to face.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Tina Marie: Groups for a sales team.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Dan: Yep.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Dan: I mean, ideally, we want to probably hire. Musicians.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Dan: But like. Be the salespeople like.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Dan: Preferably people using the platform. Or people. So the 1st guy is this dude.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Dan: Matt, who I've mentioned before. Who was like a killer, sales guy at.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Dan: Guitar center. And then he got. He got fired like.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Dan: 2 years ago for getting in an argument with a with a customer, because the customer was a Dick. And uh.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Tina Marie: Customers not always right.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Dan: But. Yeah, but he was like the one of the best salespeople at Guitar Center. So I know he can sell.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Dan: And then. So he Andy's a musician. Andy's a.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Dan: Producer, or. At least an engineer. Definitely. He's a producer, too.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Dan: Um. But he's like, Oh, my God! Work from home like really selling like helping other musicians. I'm like, yep.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Dan: So he was all over it, and then another buddy of mine wants to do it. He's. A musician slash salesperson. He's also like a huge music fan.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Dan: So it's like he's nosing around for it. Ah! Try! But.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Dan: We gotta get this dashboard working because there's no point in having them, and then not knowing if they're doing a good job. It's like, what's Matt's closer like? Oh, I have no idea.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um! What's Matt's closer? You have no idea.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Dan: Close rate.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, close rate! I was like.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay. I'm like he's not the closer I thought he was, the closer. I'm so good.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Dan: No, no, he's a closer.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. You can't see the yawn. But the yawn was big.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Dan: I oh, I felt it!

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Tina Marie: I needed oxygen. Um.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, man, it definitely feels like. Structure is there. So in the meantime.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Tina Marie: What have the guys been doing like, I know they. They have their music lives, and they do lots of different things. But.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Tina Marie: Has there been anything, mom related that they've been spending a significant amount of time on building.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Dan: No, so they're all time tracking with my little friend the timer app, because one of the rocks for this quarter was strict strategic delegation.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Dan: I'm like. Whoop!

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Tina Marie: I cannot believe that.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Dan: I'm like, we gotta figure out where you guys are spending your time. Mark's time is like all. Sales, like all.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Dan: Ah sean.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Tina Marie: I can't believe you have them time tracking, and what I've just sorry I'll be quiet. Carry on.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Dan: Sean is Sean and Johnny Johnny's like. High Level.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Dan: Building some building. Not as much because Eric's in there now. But him and Eric do bang on stuff, because we're still getting some things in place.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Dan: And then Sean's like onboarding so. I'm like, all right, Sean, we need to know how much time you're spending on onboarding.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Dan: Knowing that we're going to increase the speed of that by like create finishing this onboarding app that I'm working on. And then Norio just released some code today, like he.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Dan: He! Hooked in AI to go find a bunch of stuff. So then.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Dan: Him, and I mapped out like, Oh, okay. Well. We can do that, then can't we do this? So we, if this 1st bit works that he released today.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Dan: Which he says it does. Then we'll just slowly roll out the AI into other pieces of the onboarding, so like the artist doesn't, they're just approving shit. Are these your links? Yes or no?

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Dan: Yes, great are these, the is the these are the 3 songs that you want to do. So they pick the songs. So the next one is this, they pick the songs. Which songs do you want to be in your back? Catalog what we call the backup?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Dan: Back catalog. Oh, I want these 3 songs. Then the AI is going to take those and go. Hey? I just wrote this synopsis of this song. How does this sound. Does this sound good.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Dan: Or it's gonna ask them to answer some questions about the song. And then it's gonna go write a synopsis of the song. They're going to answer some questions. We already have a version of this. It'll just be better. Answer some questions. Here's your band, Bio. Does that sound good.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Dan: So then they'll just be approving things. And then all that's content for the drip email sequences. And what have you. So that should speed up onboarding. But.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Dan: Right now. Shawn's like. Gets on the phone with them. Meets with them, you know. Blah blah blah blah.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Dan: But to me that's like strategic delegation, for Sean, like Sean should not be doing that. Shawn's time could be. Bent someplace, else um.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Dan: Same thing with Johnny like. I've got the.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Dan: High level dudes that we work with, who are still building apps. I gotta send them a new. Well, they're building the book funnel right now and then. I'm gonna send them another app, and then I think, other than the spotify app. I think we're done.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Dan: We got this new app. And then the spotify app. Then we're done. And then Johnny and Eric and I got to work out all the funnels. Then those guys are on board now to just bill us hourly.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Dan: So we can start kicking them. Hey, this is broken. Hey? Can you go? Look at this, hey? We need this tweaked. And then their billing.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Dan: Sending Stacy and IA bill bi-weekly. I think. Um.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Dan: So then, all of a sudden, Johnny might not need. So Johnny's just there, in case something breaks like during work hours the same thing with Eric like, and then, you know, it's good that they're on the east coast, and we're on the west coast. But Johnny's tracking like, how much? Where? What are you doing in high level? Are you fixing things? Are you.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Dan: What are you doing? And then we can categorize that. And then Jim's not doing anything. Gyms.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Dan: Jim is the podcast master. So Jim does all the podcasts. Hey, we're recording this. And then he edits it. And then he makes. He's making everything like the video for Youtube Youtube shorts, Instagram shorts like, it's all ready. So when he turns over an episode, it's fully edited.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Dan: And then it's got accompanying marketing materials to go with it. And then I've got a guy. The Cavelin's gonna be the community manager. And then the dude that I have is like the community sort of tech.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Dan: So that Guy will be. Hey, we got a new podcast. Episode.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Dan: I want you to go post it on Youtube. Post, this short post, this reel.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Dan: Go make the announcement in the in the group. Because he doesn't want to be seen in the group, and I'm like, that's fine. Whereas Evelyn will be seen.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Tina Marie: Ah, okay. Wait. Sean doesn't want to be seen in the group, but Evelyn will.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Dan: No, no! This, this dude bashal.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Tina Marie: And seen in the group, as like um, just responding to people and answering questions or.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay. How is she doing.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Dan: Which is fine.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Tina Marie: How's school going.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Dan: No, Evelyn will do that. Bashal won't. But bashal's the dude that built the entire. Community with me.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Tina Marie: Got it. Um.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Tina Marie: How? How's Evelyn? Ooh, that's huge. Okay. Sorry. Um, how? How's Evelyn doing in school?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Dan: Beans, list.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Tina Marie: So of course he is. That's awesome.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay, um, any updates on another 71 just trajectory. I guess. Basically.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Dan: Uh so score releases today. So we'll see.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Dan: Um. We had the highest month of revenue ever.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Dan: Last month. Uh, which was unexpected.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Dan: So going into the highest right. So the end of low season was the highest month of revenue ever. But that's because it's.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Dan: It's the new model sort of compounding just through this year. So that sort of means, okay.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Dan: If we have our highest revenue month and month 4. That means people are sticking. We don't need to look into what their stick rate is, because it doesn't mean anything.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Dan: Won't be in anything for at least 10 months. So we're not gonna look into it.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Dan: Um. So that happened.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Dan: Now we have the score release and then busy season basically kicks off today. Would be my guess.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Dan: Ah! We're tracking to be over 5,000 subscribers by the end of August or September, I forget which.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Dan: Uh, Bobby and I are working on. Repositioning Cpa. Exam. To like, go after.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Dan: You know, expand the market, basically. Um.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Dan: So he's meeting with the computers and stuff people. Right after this. I think I don't think I'm going to that. Uh.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Dan: I. I sent everything to the founder Advisor guys last night.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Dan: So all the reports they wanted. I answered all their questions. So that gets that ball rolling. And then I also reached out to this lawyer that Jeff and I were talking to about.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Dan: You know. Fixing the entity, so that in 3 years it's.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Dan: Sellable. Correct all that stuff, copacetic, um. Jeff's like, yep. Sounds good.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Dan: And then I've got uh. We need to get a valuation. So I've got this, the valuation company that heather used, I was like, oh, this is pretty good.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Dan: I reached out to them like, Can you do a. Sellers are discrete sde valuation. They're like Yup.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Dan: So I got them on. I sent that to Lawyer was like, Okay, this is our next step.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Dan: Is, do you think we should do this one or that one? And it's like a 300 buck difference. So if he says one or the other.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Dan: Then Jeff's like, just let me know. So we'll get that done. I have. I have everything they need, because the books are all done. So that's.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Dan: Rolling.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tina Marie: Um. It's just.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. There's not really any questions to to ask. It's just kind of. There right now.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Tina Marie: But. That's good. I'm excited to see how the end of.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Tina Marie: Well, me, I guess. Ends.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Tina Marie: And. Um.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Tina Marie: You. Had a conversation with the founders. Kid, like the bookkeeper, finally finished everything.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Dan: Yep.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Tina Marie: I know you're not selling now. But there was. The last time I checked in. It was a few weeks ago.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Tina Marie: I think you're in conversation. And um.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I don't know what the update is. Where was that at.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Dan: Yeah. Literally sent everything to them last night.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Dan: I like 7.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Dan: Yep.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Dan: So it's all in their hands. I think they've got everything they need. And I was like, Hey, if you got any more questions, let me know.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Tina Marie: It'll be just interesting to see where that conversation lands for. Um, especially because the trajectory just went.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Tina Marie: Way, up.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Dan: Yeah. And I told them, like, Hey.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Dan: Cause. They were asking about the new stuff. And I said, Look, it's really not going to be known for 19 months like the full breadth. Of growth will not be known for 19 months.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Dan: From January second. So it's like one and a half years into the window that we're willing to sell within. And then I also was like, you know what we. We also don't care if we sell this at this rate.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Dan: If we just added a million to the bottom line. Okay. Oops.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Tina Marie: Uh-uh. Uh oops.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Dan: Yeah. Oh! And then one of our competitors went out of business.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Tina Marie: Who.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Dan: Jaeger, the guys that Jeff and I helped. The guys that I scaled to 4 million.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Holy crap!

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Dan: Yeah, they just out of nowhere. Sites down, and then on Reddit.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Dan: I saw I was like, Oh. Jeff. Jeff pointed it out to me a couple weeks ago, but their site was like intermittently up and down.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Dan: And now it's just gone completely.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Dan: And then someone on Reddit was like, Oh, yeah, no. They shut down on March 25.th It's like God. Another one bites the dust.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Dan: So that leak.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Dan: That leaves like. So now, there's really only 3 companies. Because one of our competitors and I had to explain all this to the guys in the email last night. There's this company, Uworld.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Dan: They were the dudes that approached us to acquire us. And then told us that since we didn't have software we weren't valuable, that all we had was customers. I'm like you did not just say that.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Dan: You did not just say, all we have is paying customers. That's that's our detriment.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Dan: So they were like, oh, since the software is not yours, they just start dropping the number like precipitously. And I was like F off um, plus we didn't really give them. I'm like Jeff. You cannot give them like the full under the Hood metrics, which we didn't.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Dan: So then then they pivoted, and they bought, like our adjacent competitor, this guy, Roger.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Dan: Who did not have software at all. So they bought him. And then took forever to sort of merge the 2. It was very weird. They kept.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Dan: They! Oh, branding! And he was still around, and who knows what.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Dan: But then out of nowhere. Last year they bought the number 2 in the space. This company, Wiley. So all of a sudden, the number 2 and the number. Those guys were probably number.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Dan: 3 with us. So we were tied with Roger. So they bought number 2, number 3. They were like Number 5.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Dan: So now, all of a sudden, they hopscotch up to. Whatever. I don't know how they're do. I don't know like I get the idea. But I'm like, you guys are high. If you think you can just buy a customer and.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Dan: Instantly inherent. Their customer base like that's.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Dan: You get the current customer base, but you don't get the future customer base. So whether or not that worked out I don't know, but it just consolidated the industry. And it's like, Oh, okay, great. So now you got Becker Uworld us.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Dan: Yeager's gone. There's 1 other company, Gleim, who, like nobody, talks about.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Dan: So now it's down to the Big 3. And I'm like, Okay. I can work in this environment.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Dan: Right? So then, now go focus on Cpa, exam.com be like. Now we don't. Now there it like it could just increase our.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tina Marie: How. Thanks.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Dan: Um. I never thought about this. It could just increase our visibility purely by the fact that the pack has been thinned.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Dan: There's this, is it.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Dan: Yeah. Now I can't prove that, but.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Tina Marie: So. I mean it. It sounds like because there are a couple of things that you can do to take market share. One of that is just take it, you know.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Dan: I'm sorry.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Tina Marie: Aggressively right, by being better and. Doing more ads and SEO and all that stuff, and the other one is, somebody goes out of business.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Tina Marie: So automatically. It seems like that market share probably just increased, although I don't know how much they would have had. You didn't have a ton. So they and they were probably less than. I don't know.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Dan: Yeah, they were like, 5, yeah, totally. They didn't have a ton.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Tina Marie: Ha! Now um! How do you do an analysis to see what the current market share split is.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Dan: So.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Tina Marie: Is there any way to get an idea of that.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Dan: We would just start surveying again. So I. I'm.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Dan: The surveying data that we had, which was also in the email last night. So initially, we, I just did survey data.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Dan: Hey? Who are you using. So we still we still have that now granted.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Dan: We would need to. Merge some people, so we still have it separated, as like Wiley. But those guys are out there calling themselves you world Wiley, you world, Roger.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Dan: But we now know. Oh, if they say Roger, in 2025, it's really Uworld. If they say Wiley in 2025, it's really Uworld. So we could just do that merge after the fact. And get.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Dan: And then what I found out was. I would always get like 9%.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Dan: Meaning of the if a thousand people. Told us who they were using. We were 9%.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Dan: 9% said they knew us. So that I was like, I think that's our market share, 9%. But then, when I went and looked at the actual customer data against the supposed entire.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Dan: You know, base of. Cpa. Review it. It almost lined up.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Dan: Now in 2025. I don't know that I can. I don't know that this is actually true.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Dan: Because we have people switch from supplement to the full course. I thought.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Dan: Oh, if they buy the full course. Then we are their primary thing. But what's happening is like 10 people a week. Buy the supplement, and then they switch.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Dan: So I still need to figure out like. Through the survey.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Dan: Who is your primary provider which we do ask them. So we ask them, Is it us so? It could be that people bought the supplement. Like. I'll just try it out.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Dan: And but and they are ninja only, and then. They decide. You know what I want it all.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Dan: So we'd have to dig into that. But.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Dan: We're already collecting the data to do that. We just have to go analyze it, which.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Dan: Now that I got gpt so I'm like going back and like. I've got old survey data from years ago that I'm getting Lucy to pull, that I can run through. Gpt to do an analysis that like I've always wanted to do, and I did it manually.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Dan: But it's gonna be so much better now. And then I'll use Gpt. To like redo this webinar.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Dan: So I I took Jason Fullaty and put out a book. And I created a Gpt that builds a webinar based on his framework.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Dan: You just have to answer a bunch of questions, and then it will spit out the entire. The entire outline of the webinar. Okay.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Dan: Apparently he's really good.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Tina Marie: Wait! Ah! Say that one more time.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Dan: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I've never bought anything from him, or I don't know. I know people that know him, and that worked with him, but I never really.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Tina Marie: Maria.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Dan: Oh! Did she.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, huge. Like, tight.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Dan: Oh, okay.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Dan: I'm gonna build the make our music webinar, the fanfloy webinar off of my Philadian Gpt that I built.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Tina Marie: Um! That's awesome. How did you build that.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Dan: Yeah. So I've got.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Dan: This I've I've made like 20 custom Gpts. One of them is.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Dan: A knowledge base extractor. So it's designed to take. The transcript of a book.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Dan: And rip out of it. Everything that matters.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Dan: And then it turns it into a knowledge base, and then I attach that knowledge base to a Gpt that then has. In description and stuff written based on.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Dan: The knowledge base and what I want.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Dan: And that's it, and then it. And then I think that one might have like an exam. I might have made an example, webinar. So you give it like an example based off the the whole thing, and then it looks at that, too. Um. But the initial, like the knowledge base extractor, is like.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Dan: This prompt that I built. I have another one that's awesome. It's called a hyper fidelity. So it just you give it any content, and it just summarizes the shit out of it. And it's like, here's everything in there, and then it checks like, did I get everything? And then it does like a a. 2 step check. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's like Nope, I got it.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Dan: But I use that. I send. Uh, Youtube transcripts through that thing. It's like boop, boop, boop, boop.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Dan: It's insane. The like. Every day I download a video.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Dan: Every day. At least one video.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Tina Marie: Same.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Dan: Boom, and then I run it. I run it through descript, and then I take that. I take the Markdown dump from that, run it through this hyper fidelity thing, and then.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Dan: You know you these Gpts. I can start to like. You know, people prompt chain. I'm gpt chaining. So when I'm I'll go. Oh, hey! Now, give me a markdown of that that I can feed to a gpt about this, and it's like, Here you go.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Dan: It's like cool. Thanks.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Tina Marie: I know um. Why do you run it through descript.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Dan: Uh, it's just drag and drop. So it's super simple.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Tina Marie: So. I built this um.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Tina Marie: And it was also super simple. I did it different ways. I did it with replet. I did it with clogged code. But all it is. So if I got a Youtube Api, it can script transcript of almost any video. There are some settings. I think a user can create when they make.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Dan: Yeah. There are.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Tina Marie: That are not scrapable, but the rest of them do, and then I just take that into. I have a prompt. That gives me like an amazing summary.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Dan: Yep.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Tina Marie: And it's a standalone summary thing, so that it extracts it. Like like it. The part of the prompt is this, is your job right? Like? So the personality.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Dan: Yeah. The role.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Tina Marie: Right, and then the other thing it does is connect it to what I have outlined as my master plan.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Dan: And then the other.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Tina Marie: With prime directives. Right? All the all the guard rails guard rails. That simply say, this is what I'm doing. This is what I'm not doing. Help me with this. Help me not with that.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Tina Marie: So. Then the summary says.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Tina Marie: What does this validate of what I'm already doing. What does this say? That maybe I'm going in the wrong direction, or something new to add or.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Tina Marie: Whatever. But really the only thing that I have to do is go copy the transcript because everything was fetched automatically from my playlists.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Tina Marie: So it looks for the videos on my playlist. Channel creators every day.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Tina Marie: And then. The only thing I haven't been able to get it to do is automate is the scraping.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Tina Marie: I'm describing. The Transcript.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Tina Marie: And then the summary, and then sending it to me and putting it in my folder. That's what I'm working on. But. Anyway. But Chatgbt.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Tina Marie: I have a project that is the summarizer. So all I do is take my summary and just plug it straight into there, but then it's already a folder right that has all of the different videos that I've looked at.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Tina Marie: With their summaries and their applications. In one location, in a project in Chat Gpt.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Dan: Yeah, so I do Youtube videos. And it's all kinds of videos. Like, sometimes I see a video on. Tiktok, so like I download that.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Dan: So it's videos from everywhere.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you're using your downloader thing right?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Dan: Um. Yeah.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Dan: So I just send the URL to myself, and then I open in the browser. Click the downy thing and it downloads it, and I go poop, poop.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Tina Marie: I keep thinking about that, and then I don't remember where you sent it to me. If it was, I gotta look it up. Um if you send it an email or phone, or if it was a zoom chat thing.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Dan: It's just called Downey, DOWN IE.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. I remember you saying that because.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Tina Marie: I was like that reminded me of the rowdy cheer. Let's get Rowdy. Well.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Dan: Yeah, like, today, I'm gonna download. So Ezra firestones.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Dan: Course on him selling his business like how to prep yourself to sell. I'm like, Okay, time for that. And then I'll just.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Dan: Get all 18 videos, load them up in descript. It'll just do one giant transcription.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Dan: You know. Take it through the steps.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Tina Marie: Nice. Oh, crap! Look at the time.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay. So.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Tina Marie: Words, mom, doing good. I like it's good momentum. And traction. It's crazy, too, because, like.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Tina Marie: You really just have these 2 primary projects. It's it's so.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Tina Marie: Now I'm reviewing like 2024 mentally kind of and like. Um just the progression of.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Tina Marie: Dumping projects haven't been on a Monday calling forever, so I don't know what other things are. Still.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Dan: They don't. We don't do them anymore.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Tina Marie: Really.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Dan: Nope.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Tina Marie: It's so crazy. Cause like, by the end of 2024 we're just like, you know. I think I can get rid of this, I think, get rid of this. And just really. Primarily another 71, which is always like paid the bills always, you know, years since we've been working together almost.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Tina Marie: 8 years this month.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Dan: Okay. Well. Is it this month.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Dan: I thought it was. July, thought it was July. For some reason.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Tina Marie: Yes. No, it's this month, because this was the month I was like, I'm not going to be able to like. I'm getting kicked out of this house because they're selling. I have to go buy a house right now.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, 8 years ago this month.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Dan: Ml.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Around their birthday time.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Tina Marie: And that Dan still have the space invaders like, you know, profile Pic.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Dan: Mhm.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Tina Marie: Dan with space invaders, dude.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Dan: Very helpful.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Tina Marie: Ah! But. You know.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Tina Marie: Getting like, just really the kind of ramping up because we're talking about so many different things. Eric Norio, what you're paying for, but.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Tina Marie: Between 2023, and 2024. There was. This um!

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Tina Marie: More. Constricting of the developer fees and roles.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Tina Marie: You just anyway, because I think of one thing, and then all the other things come into play right? Because it's not that simple. There's all these tentacles. That were out there.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Tina Marie: But I just. I'm just loving. Um where you're at right now. With these 2 primary projects.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Tina Marie: One being pure passion, the other one being pure profit, but also. The kind of.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Tina Marie: Vaults like the library that. Fed you all of these things, and taught you all of these things, or.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Tina Marie: You learned through working it right?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Dan: Please.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Tina Marie: Um, anyway. Just kind of appreciating. Where are you at, and how you got here? Mentally.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Tina Marie: That's cool. It's pretty cool.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Dan: Roll. Then we roll out. Project 3. My whole goal is like, okay.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Dan: All this gets done this quarter, which seems very plausible, like beyond plausible. And then I'm like, Okay, then in.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Dan: Then in July. I start consistently.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Dan: Working. Watt is like the 3rd Project. Which is.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Dan: Just related to this, anyway.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Tina Marie: What is that?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Dan: The band.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Tina Marie: Ah, oh, yeah.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Tina Marie: Wait. What does it stand for? You told me, or is that just the name of it?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Dan: It stands for. We are. You can't tell anybody.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay, of course.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Dan: It stands it stands for we are all the things.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Tina Marie: I love that. Lips sealed.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Dan: Yeah. Someone the other day was like, What does that stand for? I think you told me I'm like I didn't.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Dan: Like. The only way you can know is you. You have to be in the band.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, no, you definitely did not.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Dan: You have to be on a song. So I'm not. I'm I'm letting you not. You're the only person that's not.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Tina Marie: Or it's.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Dan: Hold held to that rule. But you could be on a song. We could. We could work that out.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Tina Marie: Be secret like. Who is that? Nobody knows the secret.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Dan: Yeah, we could. We could probably get some background vocals from you through an iphone that would we'd be able to use.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Tina Marie: I am not good enough for that.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Dan: You you'd be amazed. Stacy is like, I don't know how you make me sound so good. I'm like, you don't sound bad, but I'm like, as long as it's not totally tone, deaf. Even if it's even if it is, I mean, you can't be off like a whole note.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Dan: But if you're just slightly sharper, flat like that's easy to fix, then you drop some reverb on that shit and pan. It sounds great.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Tina Marie: Right. Yeah.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Dan: It's more about the tone of the voice that matters.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Tina Marie: I'm usually if there's. Oh, yeah.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Tina Marie: If if there's music playing, I'm usually on key, if it's acapella. I could go a little sharp.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Tina Marie: A little flat. I'm I'm usually probably more a little bit sharp than a little bit flat, because I'm always like thinking up because my teachers would teach me that.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Dan: Yeah, everyone does. Yeah.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Tina Marie: But and I can hear it, but I can't always fix it fast enough, right? Cause you. You just slide all over the place like.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Dan: Right, right.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Tina Marie: I hear you. It's fun!

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Well, now we are all the things. I don't think I'll remember that, anyway, to be able to sell anybody.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Dan: Right. And the whole point is that it's not one genre.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Tina Marie: I love that though.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Dan: Yeah. But then also no one's gonna know who it is.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Tina Marie: I, but so. I love that, too, because I've just become more and more private, you know, more like I don't give up. Who knows what I do?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Tina Marie: I know he did it. I don't really care. I don't want the accolades. I don't want the attention. Whatever.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Tina Marie: I. I even shut down my Facebook. I just like deleted it. We'll see if Zuck actually deletes it. But.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Tina Marie: Um.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Dan: Oh, nice!

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Tina Marie: But. But.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Tina Marie: What I love also, which I find very interesting. Is the alignment with the timing of the freedom, and the children being grown and almost empty, nesting.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Dan: You're not. Yeah.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Dan: I almost think there's a plan happening, but there isn't.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Tina Marie: Right. But but the synergy and the alignment, you know, cause there's that word right? We haven't talked about it for a while, but. It is very synergistic.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Tina Marie: That. That's that's what's happening.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it's. Yeah, I don't know.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Tina Marie: Just something to contemplate.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Dan: We just. No, no, I know some. I talked to someone the other day, and they were like.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Dan: They that I like. I couldn't explain it to them. They're like, well, you know, and I was like, dude it just I it literally just started. I didn't want to work for someone else.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Dan: And that's really, you know, that's. One of the things like I wake up every day and like I should appreciate them more. But I and I don't. I probably should.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Dan: But I'm like that's what I that's what I designed.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Tina Marie: Yes, exactly.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Dan: And so now I'm. Now I'm designing this thing where I'm like. This is.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Dan: Well, that's I think I told. I said this to someone the other day. They were like. I'm like.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Dan: They're like, Oh, have you put out a song yet? I'm like, no, I'm. I'm like, I have a plan, and I'm like the plan is almost.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Dan: Coming together, but I'm like it's not. Am I gonna do it? It's when. And I know I'm gonna do it. When the website's ready.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Dan: I've got. I've got everything lined up. I have a whole content plan that I came up with. And I'm like, this is a really good idea. And I'm like. And then I'm just gonna tell people what I tell them all the time. Just do it consistently and see what happens.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Dan: And then I don't care if people like it or not.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I need to. Right.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Tina Marie: I.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Dan: I don't care.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Tina Marie: My Tina brain wants to say all the things, but I looked at the clock, and I'm supposed to go take my daughter to school, so for your sake I will be quiet and carry on.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Dan: We're weird. Word.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Tina Marie: Have a great weekend, and I will talk to you Monday. Oh, and happy mother's day to your beautiful Denise.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Dan: You too. Oh, lymosis.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Dan: Alright, cool.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Tina Marie: Bye.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Dan: Later.
