00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.969
Tina Marie: Also, I think I could use open AI whisper to be able to talk

2
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.460
Tina Marie: instead of have to type everything. Is that correct?

3
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.100
Tina Marie: There you are.

4
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.080
Dan: Hello!

5
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.070
Tina Marie: Good morning!

6
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.179
Dan: How do you.

7
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.710
Tina Marie: How are you?

8
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.910
Dan: I'm good. How are you?

9
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.100
Tina Marie: Nerdy.

10
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.660
Dan: Thanks.

11
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.701
Tina Marie: Having way, too much fun.

12
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.590
Dan: Good.

13
00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:39.449
Tina Marie: Yes, okay. So I. If it's okay, I'll just jump right into it. Because, like, I kind of

14
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.649
Tina Marie: chomping at the bit with all of this, and I'm not getting enough sleep. So I'm very groggy and cranky in the morning, but

15
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.930
Tina Marie: the caffeine will hit soon, anyway.

16
00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:09.810
Tina Marie: okay. So I've got, like, probably 5 apps that I've been working on for different reasons, and some of them simultaneously, because there's so much waiting in between. And a couple were started several months ago, and there's been iterations, as everything has changed

17
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:22.320
Tina Marie: like I played with replet before. There's a huge change in replet now because of the model of Chat Gpt or Openai, really, that it uses

18
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.220
Tina Marie: and so that improved exponentially. But what I just learned

19
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:49.129
Tina Marie: this morning actually, is that? Okay? So last night I installed Openai Codex at the terminal. So that allows me to use basically, it's like what Clog Coder does. But what I didn't know until this morning, because I didn't think to ask

20
00:03:49.130 --> 00:04:05.699
Tina Marie: is that with codecs you can choose which model you want to use. So, staying in the command line you can choose model 4.1, which is its like most amazing one with a 100 million

21
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.900
Tina Marie: token context. So it can remember a ton of things.

22
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:30.900
Tina Marie: and then but you can also switch back to O 4 or O 3 for logic. So for mapping out what you want to do and figuring out the best way that it should basically be laid out right for the user interface and for the function.

23
00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:57.219
Tina Marie: Using O 3 or oh, 4. 0, 3 is probably better. This what? It's supposed to be right now and then switch back to 4.1 for the coding. And then what I haven't installed yet, either. But I remember about it because I've watched so many videos is that you can also use open AI whispers that you can talk to it instead of have to type everything.

24
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:08.740
Tina Marie: So I mean just all these different limitations that I've had. The one thing about replet that I love is that because my, I have a teenage daughter who's learning how to drive?

25
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.589
Tina Marie: So she's been driving a lot. She's got like 55 h in since November.

26
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.580
Tina Marie: and there's only so much driving around. I can just be like, yep, this is cool, you know.

27
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.090
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

28
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:31.130
Tina Marie: nothing. But with replet. I could be like, give it a command, and it could be working on something, so I may still try to do some things with replet. But what I might do is like.

29
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.600
Tina Marie: really, really build it on a granular level. So one tiny function of an app.

30
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:47.890
Tina Marie: and then the next one, and then the next one and just layer it. Well, but then, you know, while I'm bored, basically. So I'm not doing nothing.

31
00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:14.960
Tina Marie: cause then I can go export it, download everything, and then give it to chat, which will go look at it and go. Oh, I see exactly what you're doing here, and if I have built it in a segmented way like that, it should be able to clean it up pretty quickly. It's stuff like that, anyway. So I thought, today we could. I still haven't gone through all that like multi prompts you sent me like 7 or 8 prompts I did want to use.

32
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:36.539
Tina Marie: But anyway, I thought today. Like, if you have your computer, we could, you could show me what you're working on. I'll show you what I'm working on and see. Maybe there's something we could help each other improve and get wherever you're going, wherever I'm going faster, but mostly because what always happens is you have a new insight. I have a new insight, and

33
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.509
Tina Marie: we just make it better. And I'd like to see how, whatever you're working on.

34
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.889
Tina Marie: For example, you know, I'm sure that we could create something that helps with.

35
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:58.350
Tina Marie: I don't actually know. Because you know what we haven't asked. Chatgpt is, although you you might have is, how can we do

36
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.980
Tina Marie: better tracking?

37
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:07.940
Tina Marie: Is it Google analytics? Or can we build something? Custom that is

38
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:19.660
Tina Marie: cookie proof, right? Because it maybe it's hard coded. Maybe it's a sandwich page that only gets hit once something happens like how I used to do things back in the day.

39
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.020
Dan: What?

40
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.942
Tina Marie: So tracking transactions

41
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.620
Dan: For, like a specific project.

42
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:48.750
Tina Marie: For for specific sale of anything. So what I'm thinking about is like, Mom, like, how do you track your results? Cause you don't really advertise for anything except for another 71 that might be useful there, too. But you know, cause they keep we keep running into issues with being able to track ad campaigns and things like that, although you hard code everything, don't you? Anyway?

43
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.880
Dan: Yep. Yep.

44
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.509
Tina Marie: Yeah, so that's not an issue.

45
00:07:51.510 --> 00:08:01.740
Dan: I don't run into that issue. Yeah, we're yeah. The the issue that you have is referrers, because even if you try to capture refer.

46
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:09.980
Dan: The best way to do it is to use Utm. But if you don't have control over that refer, then you can't. You have no control.

47
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:29.000
Dan: and a refer isn't necessarily sent every time you get a click from a referring website. But if you pass the Utm through, I think it goes through, it's more consistent. But that's that's an issue. I ran into this week trying to set up something from Mom. I was like, we can't.

48
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:37.659
Dan: We'll we're just gonna get what we get. But any paid traffic will have Utms, and then that will come back. And then I figured out.

49
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:46.579
Dan: so the problem with Google high level. You name it. Whatever they are, they all pass.

50
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.780
Dan: All Google will pass you is an Id.

51
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.900
Dan: It will not pass you campaign, name.

52
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.700
Dan: It will pass you campaign id. So then you're stuck with

53
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:02.631
Dan: well, I don't. I gotta create a key that tells me what campaign that is.

54
00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:19.520
Dan: And then, ideally, you would want to replace the Id with the name. So like I'll just use high level like in high level. I would want to be like, no, I don't want the Id. I want the campaign name, or I don't want the I group I want the Ad group name

55
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.760
Dan: and then at the keyword level

56
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:40.480
Dan: it doesn't even pass keyword. Right? Yeah, I don't even think it passes keyword. It says term. So yeah. So you you would pass term, because the structure of like a Google ad would be its exact match only, or I would do something. So anyway.

57
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.430
Dan: that doesn't work.

58
00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:48.940
Dan: So I've been trying to figure out a way. I think I figured out a way to do it. And it's like

59
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.249
Dan: you have to. You would create a Google script

60
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:05.880
Dan: in your. In my case I have a an Mcc. Which is a like a master. Google Ads account that I then have everyone add their Google Ads account to.

61
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:13.040
Dan: So when I log in, I see every account I have access to, and then I drill into the account, and then you drill into campaigns right? So

62
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.759
Dan: you would put a script.

63
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.329
Dan: I've done this with the the dudes, and down in South America you'd put a script in your Mcc.

64
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.640
Dan: And what that script does, is

65
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.800
Dan: it? Can I think it? I don't think it can do like anything hourly, or anything like that. It can do

66
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:44.829
Dan: once a day or something. It's there's some. There are some restrictions, but you put a script in there that script would then write to a g sheet.

67
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.549
Dan: and it would output every account.

68
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.390
Dan: and then every campaign and ad group in that account.

69
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.470
Dan: and then you would have an automation in high level

70
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.659
Dan: that said, when a when a thing comes in, it would say, Go, get, go, get this.

71
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.719
Dan: and it would go look at the sheet and say, I have account id

72
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.139
Dan: XYZ, and then campaign Id.

73
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.569
Dan: ABC. And it would. It would grab the names.

74
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:24.166
Dan: So that's something. I've been kind of noodling. I haven't built it, but I think that's how it would work.

75
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.140
Dan: and then the referral thing we were trying to get.

76
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:39.850
Dan: I think we wrote some of this. It was like cause they don't track refers and high level. So we wrote a script that's like, if referrer.

77
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.090
Dan: fill in this this hidden field.

78
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.390
Dan: But the problem with high level is they don't wrap their forms in a form.

79
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.649
Dan: So the Javascript.

80
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.219
Dan: the 1st couple go arounds like it can't find the field because it can't find the form.

81
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.210
Dan: So we're like, all right, we're gonna have to. There's gotta be a way around that, too.

82
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.000
Dan: And then we discovered.

83
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.749
Tina Marie: What do you mean? They don't wrap the form in the form like there's no form code like start.

84
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.360
Dan: No.

85
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.140
Tina Marie: One.

86
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.900
Dan: Nope.

87
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.750
Tina Marie: What?

88
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.710
Dan: Yeah.

89
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.270
Tina Marie: How.

90
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.559
Dan: I was like. Oh, I didn't even know you could do that.

91
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.620
Tina Marie: Right.

92
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.110
Dan: But I mean I haven't built a form like that, and.

93
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.149
Tina Marie: I guess it just means it doesn't have a container.

94
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:22.970
Tina Marie: It just.

95
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:31.480
Dan: Yeah, I mean, that's all a form, right? And well you use. Remember, it used to be like the form, and then the where you were submitting it to was always defined like, right there.

96
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.950
Dan: that that doesn't exist anymore. That makes sense.

97
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.872
Dan: Yeah, so that. And then I haven't done

98
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.920
Dan: any of the like I have you ever used notion I.

99
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.269
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, my God!

100
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.649
Tina Marie: Mind blown this year this week on it.

101
00:12:53.010 --> 00:13:00.760
Dan: I just knew what it was. I've never used it so I like in, bought it yesterday and installed it, and I was like, oh, I don't have time for this.

102
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:09.209
Tina Marie: Yes, okay, I we're we're just gonna have a few things happen right now. Anyway, you keep talking, though. Go ahead.

103
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.790
Dan: I mean, I get it in principle, and I bought that. So I.

104
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.389
Tina Marie: It's definitely a mind suck like long time thing.

105
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.860
Dan: I was like Yup, Nope, not to a close. I was like Nope not opening that black hole

106
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.430
Tina Marie: That is the biggest squirrel ever.

107
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:34.705
Dan: Yeah, I was like, I do not have time. Not. I'm like my plan is to dive into it next week. But I'm like I got shit. I gotta get done this week. I don't need this thing to happen fast. But

108
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:43.610
Dan: I did find this notion programmer dude on upwork and explain the project to him. And he was like, Oh.

109
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.629
Dan: that sounds really interesting!

110
00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:47.999
Dan: And so he's.

111
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.739
Tina Marie: You can build. Notion templates very easy.

112
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.420
Dan: He's down. Well, I bought the template, so that was easy.

113
00:13:54.050 --> 00:14:06.220
Dan: Then I ran it by him. I was like, Hey, I got this Gtd template, and he's like, Oh, yeah, no, that looks good. So I've installed. I started. I opened it. The account started installing it, and then I was like, Oh, God, no.

114
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.478
Dan: no, no, no, no! Run away.

115
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.939
Dan: Because I just I'm like, I know I'll go. I'll go deep, and then I'll regret it.

116
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.589
Tina Marie: Well, it depends on the timing. But yeah, and like, right now, this is something.

117
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:35.360
Tina Marie: This is not where I'm going right now. So I have, you know, order of operations. There's a few things the the one that. So let's see, let me think about how I wanna go through this. I'll probably show you the replet stuff

118
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.299
Tina Marie: first.st Oh, I forgot about co-author genius. Tube to task

119
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.250
Tina Marie: this one. I haven't been able to get to work fully.

120
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.909
Tina Marie: So my kind of plan is basically build the tools that I need, and then they become sellable.

121
00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:23.270
Tina Marie: And then it just starts becoming like my suite of things that I can sell. So a few of the things I'm working on, all, all because they're they're all part of the original plan. But some of them, like, I said, are the tools that are helping me accomplish the original plan. So there's the course there's training. And there's like AI kind of version of Tina. That's the only subscription. Well, there might. It might be the only subscription. Most things I want to make front level. Just

122
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:44.699
Tina Marie: buy it, buy it outright for a couple of reasons. Number one, reduce friction number 2. I actually want to help people as much as I can, and 3 I feel like it will minimize customer support issues if it's because it's just easier to over deliver when you're not getting billed every month.

123
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.195
Tina Marie: And I'm thinking about

124
00:15:47.900 --> 00:16:02.889
Tina Marie: tidy cow like tidy Cow, was great, but it was also kind of glitchy kind of miss some things, but I'm like for 2029 bucks. You know what I mean like, it's not a subscription. I was tidy. Cow did like 30 million or more.

125
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:11.510
Tina Marie: So anyway, that was my logic. So I'm working on the the AI writer. But that

126
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:33.419
Tina Marie: context, all of that has probably taken me some of the most time with the learning curve, meaning. I probably spent the most time on it, because that was trying to figure out how to use the Pinecone library. And but the AI models really still hadn't quite caught up yet. I think that they're there now. So I'm working on that this week.

127
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.120
Tina Marie: This has been

128
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.970
Tina Marie: Add

129
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:57.649
Tina Marie: something that I've been doing. So, I have these Youtube people that I follow that just do a really really great job at distilling what the new AI is out and what it actually means like there's a few of them that are super hypey. But there are other ones who have AI agencies.

130
00:16:58.415 --> 00:17:12.000
Tina Marie: That they're helping clients that are, you know, business clients. So their application is very much what I'm doing. But some of them are also in just incredibly articulate the way that they think there's not a lot of them, but there's a few of them.

131
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:30.100
Tina Marie: So I'm going every day and just watching their videos. But sometimes, like I don't have time for it. So the other. So the thing that this is supposed to do is to go to the Youtube channels, pull out the the report of what

132
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:45.059
Tina Marie: they published on any given day. This is not working. It's not getting it like, anyway, and then run it through my master plan, right, what I'm what am I doing? Which I don't even know where that's at right now, dashboard.

133
00:17:45.060 --> 00:18:01.780
Tina Marie: And then basically tell me, okay, did there was anything new added to the stock that I didn't have like a function that I've been looking for, waiting for, trying to build, trying to solve. Did somebody announce something that solves that problem?

134
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:11.589
Tina Marie: Or is there a use case for my existing stack that I was not aware of, that I could be, you know, benefiting from.

135
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:23.339
Tina Marie: And then in in these things, is there anything that suggests that I should pivot, or that my plan is on set like? Did it? Did it add validation, and

136
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:35.500
Tina Marie: 99 times out of a hundred, not quite that much. But it's almost. It's definitely more than 9 times out of 10. There's no pivot. There's no anything. I'm actually always right on track.

137
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:44.929
Tina Marie: mostly because I did stuff like this from the beginning. So anyway, Replit built this and it can go get the latest videos. It can analyze it.

138
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.719
Tina Marie: It lost the master plan again.

139
00:18:51.120 --> 00:19:17.930
Tina Marie: and then it has given me a report and and give so it's given me the transcript, and it has run it against the master plan. So anyway, it's got it's got all the AI models. But let me show you. So I made the 1st version of the wrapper that actually works really fast with cloud. AI this one's called AI model. But can you guys chill? Come here? They're just like zoomy zooming all over the place.

140
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.440
Tina Marie: driving me nuts.

141
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:41.350
Tina Marie: preview. So this this one went fast with Claude, and with replet and actually functioned. It was when I started to get a little bit more complicated about 1st of all working in Mobile. So that was the biggest issues that it would have overlapping things happen.

142
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.820
Tina Marie: And can I do this in a new tab?

143
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.459
Tina Marie: I think I can.

144
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.780
Tina Marie: Yeah.

145
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:55.710
Tina Marie: And so I can choose which model I want to work with, so I can work with Chat gpt for one in here.

146
00:19:56.136 --> 00:20:08.609
Tina Marie: All of these models I was able to program it and tell it which ones and I also have Claude in here. I could. So anything that has an Api rep that was able to set it up for me really easily.

147
00:20:10.198 --> 00:20:20.240
Tina Marie: I don't know if it's in settings. Settings aren't working today, anyway. But so access to this happened in less than an hour with Claude and with replet.

148
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.460
Tina Marie: And

149
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:31.050
Tina Marie: write a store story like I said, Stort story, Dan. That's my brain. I flip things. It's annoying.

150
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:45.129
Tina Marie: anyway, but it will do this, so we'll do. We'll do. Chat, gpt turbo, which actually is chat open, is 3, and I might be out of tokens for that. So we'll see what it does.

151
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:55.810
Tina Marie: So I had to tell it because it would just do this, and there was nothing happening. So yeah, that's the wrong model. Let me do this one.

152
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.889
Tina Marie: And actually, I'll do new chat.

153
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.312
Tina Marie: Actually, what it's supposed to do is

154
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:16.379
Tina Marie: I won't say, tell me a story. I need a prompt tell me the most efficient waiting to track

155
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.420
Tina Marie: refer websites.

156
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:29.070
Tina Marie: That is, platform device proof.

157
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.070
Tina Marie: What it's supposed to do is route. It.

158
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.240
Dan: Other upms.

159
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:55.029
Tina Marie: But it doesn't matter. 1st of all, what's happening in the background is it's routing it. So it's chat. Gpt 4 0 is deciding which model could best answer the question based on the context. And so I built a router into this which Chat Gpt doesn't even have right now yet.

160
00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:05.790
Tina Marie: and then it chose the model, and it's supposed to tell me. And it did tell me so every time I make a change something breaks right? So this says, Gpt. 4. 0, answered the question.

161
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:18.110
Tina Marie: and Utms, yeah. Server side all that look, anyway, I can't remember what. And yeah. So remember, we had. You had the question with Chat Gpt was like, Should you have pro, or should you not?

162
00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:28.150
Tina Marie: And at 1st it was like, Yeah, you don't need it. But I already ran out of Gpt. O. 3, until April 29.th

163
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.770
Dan: Oh, yeah, I got that alert.

164
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:39.800
Tina Marie: I probably will get pro but I may not if I so I do still have O 4 mini

165
00:22:40.384 --> 00:23:01.270
Tina Marie: and it's basically like I have to go look at the benchmarks to see the difference in the coding. But my prime directive is basically I I want the best logic, the fastest, because that will get me. My money's worth easily if I'm not having to fix errors that O 3 would have prevented, or o 1 even

166
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:14.590
Tina Marie: anyway. Let me show you the other ones real quick. Just cause like these are cause. Then we'll have a comparison in a little while with Chat Gpt in the command line.

167
00:23:15.358 --> 00:23:17.449
Tina Marie: Where are my apps? Apps?

168
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.450
Tina Marie: Clients record? Oh, this one was

169
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.709
Tina Marie: oh, we didn't even start it yet. Here, okay, that one. Claude started.

170
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.270
Tina Marie: Coach Tina, Marie? AI,

171
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.710
Tina Marie: yeah. So this one didn't get very far. Well.

172
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:47.680
Tina Marie: what it would do, so there was no proof that I could look at that it said,

173
00:23:50.170 --> 00:24:12.989
Tina Marie: here's the library, so it would let me upload things, and it was able to create a space where I could upload files. But then what? I would ask a question. The question wasn't being answered by what I had uploaded, because I asked a specific one that could only be answered inside of the context of what I had uploaded.

174
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.010
Tina Marie: But

175
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:25.889
Tina Marie: time wise. And this is the thing about the overlap, right? So if I want to sit there and actually like, be productive and stay in the space of I'm working on stuff. I'm just going in between these apps.

176
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:32.110
Tina Marie: It allowed me to choose model 4.1

177
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:39.499
Tina Marie: to do it with so it can upload the content. You'd see that transcripts

178
00:24:42.571 --> 00:24:50.589
Tina Marie: whatever. We'll go here, and then I'll show you the Chat Gpt version in the command line.

179
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.510
Tina Marie: I had a specific one. I want to get the same one, because that's where I know that

180
00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:03.830
Tina Marie: context was upload the files so can see it embed in pine cone. That's new.

181
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.679
Tina Marie: That wasn't there last time.

182
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.910
Dan: No. Well, yeah, of course.

183
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.010
Tina Marie: Right.

184
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.679
Dan: The shit moves like it's insane.

185
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:23.080
Tina Marie: Okay, so what percentage of Youtube creators

186
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:30.290
Tina Marie: create their own intent? According to Maria.

187
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.799
Tina Marie: Maria said, 2%. That's what she found.

188
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.099
Tina Marie: We'll see if it gives an answer.

189
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.210
Tina Marie: And this one doesn't do the thinking.

190
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.749
Tina Marie: Hey? It actually worked today.

191
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.070
Dan: What wasn't it doing.

192
00:25:55.050 --> 00:26:03.559
Tina Marie: Well, 1st of all, it either would give an answer at all, or it would give a very chat. Gpt esque answer.

193
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.739
Tina Marie: but it it most definitely was not pulling from me.

194
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:11.960
Dan: Gotcha.

195
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.479
Tina Marie: This is definitely Maria stuff.

196
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.300
Tina Marie: Holy crap! It finally worked.

197
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.930
Dan: See, all you had to do was not touch it.

198
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:41.300
Tina Marie: Well, I did give it a final command. Jumped ship! Well, I didn't really jump ship. So this is the thing, though I do keep switching back and forth because I'm learning new things as I'm doing it. I don't really feel like I'm staying distracted because there's so much waiting in between 1st of all.

199
00:26:42.030 --> 00:27:02.429
Tina Marie: second of all, because they all have different strengths like this one. So the issue I keep running into with the command line is that it will give me a local host to run, and then I'll try to do it, and it'll give me a 4 0, 3, or a 4 0, 4,

200
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.570
Tina Marie: or even a 5. 0, 3.

201
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:12.800
Tina Marie: Yeah. And so but Chat Gpt was able to work around this in a in a different one. In this one, I think.

202
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.490
Tina Marie: which this one I just finally

203
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.259
Tina Marie: loaded the model so I could choose it.

204
00:27:20.864 --> 00:27:30.569
Tina Marie: Yeah. So, Codex, I gave it a code to give me the list of code, and so, if you need to complete up to

205
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:38.800
Tina Marie: let me know if you want to PIN one of these as your default. Let's default to

206
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:56.520
Tina Marie: 4.1, unless we need to strategize 1st and figure out there.

207
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:11.169
Tina Marie: Best framework, then use Gpt. Oh, 3, and if it's not available use, or Oh.

208
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.499
Tina Marie: we'll see what it does.

209
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:26.259
Tina Marie: and then I'll try to get whisper AI, so let me see if I can find one of the browser windows it created before we got shut down.

210
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.150
Tina Marie: Remember, if it was this one or

211
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.809
Tina Marie: this one might have worked anyway. But now.

212
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:49.610
Tina Marie: okay, cool. So this one works, we'll see if it upload content, choose a file transcripts

213
00:28:52.010 --> 00:29:00.249
Tina Marie: and see how the Chat Gpt version works, and I'll go to that. Was it

214
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.130
Tina Marie: upload files embed in pine cone

215
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:13.360
Tina Marie: error embedding content, internal server error, so that one's not working yet, anyway.

216
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.599
Tina Marie: Figuring these out so cloud AI cloud coder had you used it yet

217
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:34.549
Tina Marie: works basically just like this. So sounds good from here on, out for regular work. I'll default to Gpt. 4.1 whenever you want to kick off a strategy or framework finding session, I'll switch to Gpt. Oh, oh, no.

218
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:41.130
Tina Marie: I never want Gpt. 3.5.

219
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:49.550
Tina Marie: It needs to be oh, 3 or 4 O,

220
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.810
Tina Marie: for whatever reason they couldn't understand that.

221
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.780
Tina Marie: And then let me see if this one is one that I could show you or not.

222
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.900
Tina Marie: I don't remember which one was. I got working because it was like midnight.

223
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:09.040
Tina Marie: Open router to hit.

224
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.520
Tina Marie: Oh, that's a smoke test which I don't even know what a smoke test is

225
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.670
Tina Marie: did not work.

226
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:32.700
Tina Marie: Yep. So those were working. Something was working last night. But it's not now, anyway.

227
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:44.759
Tina Marie: That's my update on, just like how easy they are to use this. So got it no more. Gpt. 3.5. Let me just confirm the exact names. By O. 3. Did you mean Davinci text?

228
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.599
Tina Marie: Okay, I'm gonna have to go like, be very specific with the model names.

229
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.960
Tina Marie: But you can see if I scroll up.

230
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.769
Tina Marie: I want to get to some of the code for you, so you can see.

231
00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.979
Tina Marie: So it it built a patch and then it applied it.

232
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.850
Tina Marie: And we'll get some. So this is not yet, is Codex.

233
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:22.679
Tina Marie: This is Codex trying to figure out what's inside of the files, and it scanned it very quickly.

234
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.579
Tina Marie: Oops. Sorry go dude. Hit the thing

235
00:31:30.861 --> 00:31:36.599
Tina Marie: same thing here, scan the files, built a patch, fix some things

236
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:43.029
Tina Marie: so all I had to do to get this to work was, I need to have python.

237
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:49.949
Tina Marie: I had python 3.9 point 6. I think it's up to like 3 11 3.11 something.

238
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.820
Tina Marie: and then I had to have Pip installed, which I did. But I think I had to update Pip.

239
00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:01.209
Tina Marie: And then I just did pip install, and I think it was Openai or

240
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:18.849
Tina Marie: Open AI Codecs, but Chat Gpt can tell you how to install it. It is crazy, fast and easy, Dan, and then all you do is you can do this right here. Say, okay, what? What Openai models do you have? So you can tell ask it to use the model that you want.

241
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:27.540
Tina Marie: and that way you just interact with it here. And then if you install, whisper how do I install

242
00:32:28.426 --> 00:32:35.210
Tina Marie: open AI whisper, and can you do it for me?

243
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:45.509
Tina Marie: We'll see how easy it is. But basically you just tell it what you want it to build, and it will build it here

244
00:32:46.320 --> 00:33:05.510
Tina Marie: like, it's that easy. It's crazy. So if, like auto a lot of times, it defaults to cli to the command line interface for whatever it wants to build. But if I tell it, I want a web browser interface. It can do that. I keep running into security issues.

245
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:22.760
Tina Marie: Sometimes they've ended up being Api key issues, because for whatever reason, it didn't store it in the right place. Or it was my computer security, because I have Norton and Norton blocks pretty much all the ports

246
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:30.699
Tina Marie: so trying to work around that. But, anyway, so it defaults to command line interface. And

247
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:42.761
Tina Marie: if you want a web browser interface. It can build it, it can build it with tailwind css. I didn't have any of those examples, but I've shown them to you before with the 1st thing that I built in.

248
00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.020
Tina Marie: We're like, well, I used Claude for that one.

249
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:55.670
Tina Marie: but for Mom kind of the calculations of like what? What could be earned at the price points we were doing. Do you remember that?

250
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:04.069
Tina Marie: Look at those Pip 3 install whisperer! I didn't even know what Pip 3 is never seen. Pip. 3.

251
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.350
Tina Marie: So if you're going to go down a rabbit hole.

252
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.960
Dan: Well, I'm not excellent.

253
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:23.139
Tina Marie: I know you're so good about that but I don't. I don't know that it's a rabbit hole, so like. If you were looking to. What is the thing? That?

254
00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:25.739
Tina Marie: What? The heck? Oh, no!

255
00:34:26.049 --> 00:34:28.309
Tina Marie: Why are you calling me? Stop!

256
00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:31.019
Tina Marie: It's a team's call. Sorry.

257
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.920
Dan: Calmly.

258
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.060
Tina Marie: a sister from a mission is calling me.

259
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.340
Tina Marie: But she's calling me on teams.

260
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.430
Tina Marie: That's weird.

261
00:34:44.620 --> 00:35:07.539
Tina Marie: Okay, anyway. Anyway. Sorry. I just totally got derailed with my brain. Whatever. So it just having the conversations in chat like, if you're trying to solve a problem, it'd be interesting if you can be like having the conversation in the command line like, if you were, gonna build

262
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.719
Tina Marie: something to help me solve this problem with high level.

263
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:24.336
Tina Marie: how could you do it? What could we do? Have you? Do you know anything about open, router, open router? Whatever I listen to? Too many British people learn more about that

264
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:32.169
Tina Marie: anyway, there's I think, that there are ways that we can build integrations without having to use

265
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:42.839
Tina Marie: like Zapier or make, or Nan, or whatever some of these features that high level doesn't have.

266
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:51.649
Tina Marie: I mean you're you. You have programmers that you can hire and and get things done. But if you could build a

267
00:35:51.960 --> 00:36:00.919
Tina Marie: basically a wireframe, right? So work out what you want to do, get as far as you can here within, you know, 20 min, half hour, whatever.

268
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:09.799
Tina Marie: and then go. Okay. This is what I think I need. And then you get them on a much closer starting point to where you actually want to be.

269
00:36:11.177 --> 00:36:18.529
Tina Marie: Anyway, that's a thought about how you might use these instead of like going and just building things yourself, getting.

270
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:23.659
Dan: I'm doing that through the whole custom. Gpt right? So I built.

271
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:29.439
Dan: A custom, gpt that scope it, scope. It gpt so I'm like.

272
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:29.890
Tina Marie: I.

273
00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:35.540
Dan: Job. This is what you're supposed to do. So I have to do ex exactly what you just talked about. So

274
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.140
Dan: I found.

275
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.020
Dan: Don't know how I found this.

276
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:47.700
Dan: I found this company called Kunaki and Kunaki. Oh, Shawn, Shawn, or Mark sent me some.

277
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:53.410
Dan: They sent me some pod, seedy, vinyl thing.

278
00:36:54.350 --> 00:37:22.860
Dan: And I went, looked at it, and it was interesting. And then I'm like, I could just tell by looking at the website that this other company I'm like they don't have an Api. I know they don't. They're too new. So I hit them up. I'm like, you guys get an Api. They're like, no, I go. Okay. Great. They're like, you can use our landing pages. I'm like, I don't want to use your landing pages. And then they said, Yeah, but you can use our landing pages. And then I said, Okay, great. If I use your landing pages, do I get the customer data? Oh, no, we don't share that. I go. Well.

279
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.200
Dan: we're done here.

280
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:34.390
Dan: So I was like, they obviously can't they? I could tell. They just launched. I can't remember the name, but I got all right, there's gotta be somebody else. Right? So then I went to Gpt and was like.

281
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:50.499
Dan: Hey, I need a company that's like this that has an Api. And it came back with 3 companies, and Kunaki was one of them, and I'm like I've never heard of them. So then I go look at the kunaki site. I figure out they do have an Api. I think it's like, but their sites like super Ghetto. I was like, okay.

282
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:50.910
Tina Marie: Yeah.

283
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.000
Dan: Interesting.

284
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.970
Dan: So, then, that I then I found an app for shopify called Kunakify.

285
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.160
Tina Marie: What?

286
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.480
Dan: Which I love because the dude's like my flowy. He's like.

287
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:03.965
Tina Marie: Right.

288
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.650
Dan: And nadiring.

289
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.500
Tina Marie: Yes.

290
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.540
Dan: Oc. If I.

291
00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.690
Tina Marie: Heard a nadir in so long.

292
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:24.340
Dan: I know I haven't been using lately. So canakify is a 3rd party app for shopify that connect, shopify to konaki so that people can, you know, do on? Demand Cds and Vinyl, I was like, Okay, that's what I want for high level.

293
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:43.350
Dan: So I figured out who the developer. I stalked, the developer found his contact page emailed him. I was like, Hey, man, I want to build a kunakify for my app fan flowy Yada Yada, he writes like this is over the course like a week. He writes me back, hey? I'm building one for high level right now.

294
00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.870
Dan: and I said, That's great. I don't want to use that.

295
00:38:47.480 --> 00:39:10.079
Dan: I was like, look, I don't know where you're gonna be in 5 years. I don't. Wanna. I don't wanna be reliant on some other somebody else's software. It's bad enough that you're relying on high level, right? It's like I'm building apps to extend high level to like increase the value of what I'm doing. I would want my own integration that I will never put on the marketplace because I have 0 interest in those kind of customers.

296
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:14.159
Dan: Would you consult with me on that?

297
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:27.060
Dan: And then he or he wrote back like, No, I don't really do consulting. And then I'm like you're not understanding what I'm saying. So then I wrote him back again, and then he wrote back, oh, yeah, I would do that. I was like, Okay, cool.

298
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:46.150
Dan: So now I have to. I just texted Sean right before this call. So Sean has shopify. So I'm like you need to go sign up for canocify. So I can look at the interface and see what it what I think it does and doesn't do. Then I'm gonna use my scope of Gpt and I'm gonna feed it. The canocify Api.

299
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.830
Dan: the high level Api. And then what I want

300
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:58.179
Dan: and see get how good of a scope it gets me. And it knows that I use larval, because that's part of how I defined it.

301
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.860
Dan: and then see see what it says. And then I'm gonna send that to Simon.

302
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:12.949
Dan: and then so I'll be like, this is what I think we want to build. And then Simon's like, gonna give me a quote for how much it would cost for him to help us not fuck it up.

303
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:31.659
Dan: and he'll probably because he's a dev, will not be able to help himself, but fix it and be like, no, do it like this, and then we'll get that code. Then Norio will coat overlord Saad's group, and we'll get that built.

304
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:38.919
Dan: and then we will be the only people that have. Pod. That'll just be another layer that nobody has.

305
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.520
Tina Marie: That's awesome. How is Norio? By the way.

306
00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:48.619
Dan: He, I think his wife had a miscarriage.

307
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.840
Tina Marie: Oh!

308
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:58.180
Dan: And I think he's not telling us. And I'm not gonna ask. So yeah.

309
00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:06.610
Dan: I mean, she's all. They're both like early forties. So it was already tenuous. I think it's happened before.

310
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:18.110
Dan: So he had. He had mentioned that that she was pregnant, and then he hasn't said a word since, and then he got kind of weird and went dark on us.

311
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.600
Tina Marie: All right.

312
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.074
Dan: Oh, I know what this is.

313
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:28.049
Dan: And so he sort of reemerged. But then I was like I emailed him the other day. I'm like, Look Bro, straight up. This is becoming a problem.

314
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:40.740
Dan: And then he like snapped out of it and was like, Okay, all right. And he like he's making sure that this new flow is going, and like there's been lots of going back and forth the last 3 days, and a lot of shit's

315
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:58.080
Dan: getting lined up. And I'm like, this is all this is all we need. We just need to push through this thing and get this communication sort of thing. And then fucking Eric. All Eric does complain. And I I'm serious. I swear to God if he does it today, I'm gonna be like, you know, you could go work somewhere else.

316
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:05.409
Dan: like, if you seriously Bro, like, you have nothing to complain about. This is like the best job ever.

317
00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.520
Tina Marie: For real.

318
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:13.059
Dan: Yeah, I'm like, if you wanna go to a real office and realize like you're welcome to it.

319
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.239
Dan: because I don't need to listen to this shit like

320
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:24.630
Dan: I just don't understand how people can't reframe things like you just need to reframe. You're framing it negatively.

321
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:25.550
Tina Marie: Yep.

322
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:31.550
Dan: And then it. But and then it's like a vortex. And I'm like, it's this, everything's bad. I'm like, no, it's not.

323
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.340
Tina Marie: Yeah.

324
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.500
Tina Marie: Yeah. Dude.

325
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.100
Dan: Like he was complaining about the I go then fucking, fix it.

326
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.660
Dan: I don't like.

327
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:48.290
Tina Marie: It was miserable. Even when when you guys had a skate park, basically a pipe, whatever in your like, half pipe in your office.

328
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.690
Dan: Like it's not happening to you.

329
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.330
Tina Marie: Right.

330
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.130
Dan: Happening around you like you can, you can fix this.

331
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:55.740
Dan: It's what.

332
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.290
Tina Marie: Happening around him.

333
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:05.969
Dan: So he. He was complaining because he was like being a go between between the Devs and Norio, and then I was like then, just don't do that.

334
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:16.301
Dan: I go. What? Okay? So, Norio. This is what I hear. Norio is not in their Pm. System. Here's a thought. Get Norio added to the Pm. System.

335
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.040
Dan: My goodness, brilliant Dan, yeah.

336
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.449
Dan: Just tag them in the fucking comment.

337
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:29.570
Dan: So I'm like, I didn't even know these dev test. I go. I literally said, What are you talking about.

338
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.380
Tina Marie: Hmm.

339
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.670
Dan: He's like, what do you mean? What am I talking? I'm talking all the stuff at click. I go. Bro, I've done

340
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.490
Dan: 3 dev projects with them, and none of them are in click.

341
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.190
Dan: So if you're telling me these ones are in click, that's news to me.

342
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.790
Tina Marie: What is click exactly.

343
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.859
Dan: Zoho's. It's Zoho's Pm. Thing. It's terrible.

344
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.220
Tina Marie: Who invented that?

345
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.680
Tina Marie: Whose idea, like in your system.

346
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.880
Dan: Oh, no, it's theirs. It's not ours. Yeah.

347
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.779
Dan: Unfortunately, we can't make people change.

348
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.090
Dan: I wish we could.

349
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:07.732
Tina Marie: I mean Dan.

350
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.659
Dan: I mean, I could teach them better ways. This is true.

351
00:44:11.212 --> 00:44:19.589
Tina Marie: You. You kind of have a a pattern of getting people to do the things that you want that are not what they normally do. So.

352
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.069
Dan: Better for them. Yeah.

353
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.500
Tina Marie: Yeah, but also better for you. So.

354
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.040
Dan: Yes, this is true.

355
00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:29.389
Dan: Well, that's why I saw notion I was like, Oh, you can pm, with this thing like.

356
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.000
Tina Marie: Holy crap. Yes, okay. So that.

357
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.370
Dan: Very interesting.

358
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:38.210
Tina Marie: So we were talking about that I didn't know you could basically use it for freaking. Crm.

359
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:42.309
Dan: Yeah, you can use it for all kinds. It's it's I get.

360
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:48.599
Dan: You're basically able to. It's like, almost like a ui for a database. But but then.

361
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.100
Tina Marie: Really.

362
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.060
Tina Marie: Yes.

363
00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.209
Dan: Way. More than that.

364
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.549
Tina Marie: Exactly. Okay. Hold on. Let me make this big and just show you I don't know.

365
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.800
Dan: Hilarious is I signed up for it. So

366
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:10.010
Dan: you know, I started this whole second brain concept. And then the I mean the difference between what you're doing and what I'm doing is I have 0 interest in ever selling this.

367
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.609
Dan: And I was like, I just need something that works for me.

368
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:31.709
Dan: And then, yeah, in theory, maybe I maybe I exhaust that and then need to amplify it for me. But I'm like that. I asked. Gpt. I'm like, how long could this last for me? And they're like years. I go great, that's all I need. I'm like, I'm not gonna be around. I'm not gonna be doing this much longer.

369
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.950
Dan: So.

370
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.519
Tina Marie: How long could what last for you?

371
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:48.370
Dan: The the notion set up before. I sort of exhaust, and they're they're like, no, this this will last for you like my current in Gpt memory. Not gonna last that long like I can already tell. It's forgetting stuff. And I'm like fuck.

372
00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.720
Dan: But that's fine, because I can kind of reconstitute it all.

373
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:59.050
Dan: So cause I started going down the path that you're on. And then it I was like, Nope.

374
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:07.199
Dan: because then I'm sacrificing my current workflow. And I'm like, it's more important that I can keep working like I do like, through.

375
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.450
Tina Marie: You can just have it.

376
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:28.249
Dan: Through. Well, yeah, that's fine through like an app. Right? Cause I use the app exclusively on my, I never go to the Gpt website. I only use the desktop app, and I use the mobile app. And then I saw you can fake that with notion. You can fake a threaded conversation. It looks like you're having a threaded conversation. But you're really not

377
00:46:28.878 --> 00:46:35.039
Dan: I was like, Okay, so I can fake that. I can fake that workflow. That'll give me the same feel.

378
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:48.099
Dan: and then but then I I will be. It's a level above the custom Gpt, because they they each have their own self contained. Yeah, they each have their own self contained memory.

379
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.470
Tina Marie: Well, also the file size. So.

380
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.280
Dan: File, size.

381
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:57.729
Tina Marie: So it's huge, like I. All of my custom. Gpts ran out of context because.

382
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:02.160
Dan: Yeah, they suck. They're yeah. They're good, for one thing. That's why I just made 9 that do one.

383
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:28.180
Tina Marie: Yes, yeah. But even then the problem is, everything that I do is so complex. And I want to keep a level of complexity. And that's just me. I realize, you know, 80 20 like I could give some stuff up, however, for me, like if I you know, if I'm thinking about Brand and having something that I know stands out. It is my complexity. And the way that I think

384
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.340
Tina Marie: that actually is the hardest to beat

385
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:47.239
Tina Marie: right. I don't. Nothing I do is really, really, really that unique, except for the way that I think so if I and let's say it wasn't even a business thing, just understanding the

386
00:47:47.400 --> 00:48:00.360
Tina Marie: the way to use these tools at such a level, being able to accomplish that there would be so many problems that I could solve. Let's say I never had to work for anything, ever for the rest of my life.

387
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:04.850
Tina Marie: I would still come, use this technology to help everybody else do their.

388
00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.230
Dan: And.

389
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.250
Tina Marie: You're better. You know what I mean.

390
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.840
Tina Marie: Yep, so I would do the same thing, no matter what. So

391
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:31.580
Tina Marie: so it aligns with everything for me on a, on a business plan, but just on a life use plan like these are the things that I like and want to do, anyway. So. Yeah, that's it. It works out for me. But there, like you said, you know, there, and especially

392
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:44.880
Tina Marie: with the 80 20 rule like, whatever you lose in that custom gpt like you're still head and shoulders above everybody else, and you're still, you know, getting speed right? What? What's a

393
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.420
Tina Marie: dan your thing, something money, execution, idea, money.

394
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.889
Dan: Good money, execution. Yeah.

395
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:56.080
Tina Marie: Right? So your system aligns with that.

396
00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:02.370
Tina Marie: The fastest yeah, anyway. But I

397
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:12.390
Tina Marie: get embarrassed to say it. But I'm such a nerd that I really really delight in this, and have so much fun with it.

398
00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.179
Dan: Oh, yeah, that's why I was like, oh, I mean it it right? Here's the problem.

399
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:34.700
Dan: Sometimes we ourselves go. You know what would be cool, and you have to stop yourself and say, Yeah, that would be cool. So I was doing that. I was like, Oh, yeah, I can. I'll do this, and then I'll use glide, and then and then I'm like looking, and I go. No, no, no! What do I really need?

400
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:55.340
Dan: What do I like what is the shortest distance between me and this? Right like the idea. And it's not. There's 2 paths, and one was that one was the other. And then this, this is actually a 3rd path, like, I was not considering notion. But then, when I introduced that into the mix, I was like, Okay, this is sort of

401
00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:07.069
Dan: happy medium between the 2. And then also I was like, Oh, this is another way for me to cause. I always look at omni focus. I'm like, man, I gotta get back to that. But.

402
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.330
Tina Marie: Still do.

403
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.420
Dan: Do but.

404
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.250
Tina Marie: Abandon it forever, but it.

405
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:20.432
Dan: I know, cause it. It's hard for me to use. But then notions like, Oh, you can hook in G drive and calendar, and I was like, Oh.

406
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.670
Tina Marie: You can also look in Gmail this week as of this week.

407
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:36.630
Dan: Yeah, yeah, you can. I saw that, too. So I was like, okay, if I can have like jeep, and you can hook in teamwork it looks like which I would have to pay for. But I go okay. If I could get the team if I could go into a Dan dashboard

408
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:45.119
Dan: which I've never had, and and it was like all that stuff I'm like, oh, my God! That could be like next level! And the Gpt is in there, too. I'm like oof.

409
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.090
Dan: that could be huge for me.

410
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:50.479
Dan: So then I was like, All right.

411
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:56.369
Dan: I gotta go down this so. But now I'm like looking for a notion. Course I'm like I have to go through a course really quick, just to

412
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.680
Dan: figure out.

413
00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:02.779
Dan: Figure out what I need to figure out, and then I got the dev dude ready to go, so

414
00:51:03.726 --> 00:51:04.620
Dan: we shall.

415
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:17.539
Tina Marie: It's, you know, we have conversations about like pacing and synergy, and it's it's been a while. But so Chris Mason showed me notion.

416
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:29.010
Tina Marie: I think he started, or actually I did. I don't remember. I might. Somebody showed it to me, and then I dabbled in it with a couple of people, but I looked at it, and I'm like it's too much.

417
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:34.930
Dan: Too, it turns out, cause when I signed up yesterday, it's like you originally logged in. I was like, I don't even remember.

418
00:51:34.930 --> 00:52:03.179
Tina Marie: Well, you know, when I learned something new, I tell everybody so. It was probably me because I was definitely using it for a little while, and looking like, Oh, my gosh! Because you can use it for project management and all these templates! But it has blown up. It's not I was like, is it publicly traded? I want this stock because the way that they're integrating AI and the fact like you just said, it's basically a Ui for infinite applications that people can build.

419
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.459
Tina Marie: It's nuts, anyway.

420
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:21.089
Tina Marie: But they understand these integrations and they understand the need to customize it at a user level. And I don't think it exists anywhere else.

421
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:24.950
Tina Marie: It's almost like high level, but way better.

422
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.909
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it's

423
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:33.870
Dan: it does seem like it has. Yeah, I think I think I saw that it had some automations, too, or whatever. And I was like, Oh, okay.

424
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:42.829
Tina Marie: It's got AI built into it. Notion AI like ask Chatgbt about it, and say, Look, you know everything I'm working on, and what I'm doing.

425
00:52:42.890 --> 00:53:08.519
Tina Marie: I think I've been sleeping on notion. I know that it has AI capabilities. I know it has integrations. What does it ex? What does it integrate with my existing stack and tools. What what functions does it serve that I'm already working on that, you know. And tell me if there's a way that notion would make this better for me if I were to understand it. Taking into account the fact that

426
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:29.630
Tina Marie: wrapping my head around notion is laborious. It is a big task, but once that task is accomplished, and I understand the interface and how to use it. What, then, is my cumulative, compounding benefit? Saving time, you know, over the next 3, 6, 12 months.

427
00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.870
Tina Marie: Ask Chatgpt to do that math for you.

428
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:37.240
Tina Marie: and I just about guarantee that

429
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:41.869
Tina Marie: you know in a few months. The it's a force multiplier.

430
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.500
Tina Marie: I hate

431
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:55.289
Tina Marie: wrapping my head around something new and complex right now, because I like, you know, short, digestible, speedy. I don't have that kind of attention span these days, but I will

432
00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:06.260
Tina Marie: if I if I have to, and I think that this is one of those investments of time that will be worth it. Also because the other thing that I do as a system

433
00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:14.740
Tina Marie: is watch trajectory evolution right? And

434
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:20.750
Tina Marie: how smart they are what they're doing, how it's evolved.

435
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:41.040
Tina Marie: This is staying. This will probably put a lot of things out of business eventually, maybe not because everybody can iterate so much faster now with AI. But I feel confident in spending the amount of time that I would need to spend to truly wrap my head around, and mostly it will just take practice

436
00:54:41.120 --> 00:55:07.639
Tina Marie: doing things that feel tedious in the beginning. But I think that that's another thing I can do. I can look at Chat Gpt, and say, Look, this setup gets the things done, but the way that it looks, and the way that it feels is tedious to me like the font size is too small. I don't you know what I mean? Like when we look at these websites, there's big buttons, big sections. You move around them. It's not tedious. Notion is compact

437
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:13.310
Tina Marie: that shit drives me nuts. I don't want to see it anymore. I'm old. Okay.

438
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:13.840
Dan: It is.

439
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.430
Tina Marie: Surgery like that shit is hard on me.

440
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.750
Dan: Totally.

441
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.002
Tina Marie: And you know it is cause I just swore twice about it.

442
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.800
Dan: No, I'm telling you I you've never seen me close something so fast. I was like, Nope.

443
00:55:26.862 --> 00:55:29.100
Tina Marie: Like Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.

444
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.269
Dan: Nope, Nope, Nope, not today, not today's sake.

445
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:57.010
Tina Marie: But that that could be changed with the ui right? So you've probably got people designing it that are like young eyeballs and nerdy, and don't mind all this text, and I'm not that person. So but because it's so customizable. So, anyway, having those types of conversations with chat real quick and just be like, I love this, I hate this.

446
00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:08.269
Tina Marie: How do we fix that? You know? Kind of thing, and just basically make it your own? So, either. Like is it simple enough for it to give you an out a template like I just had one. Hold on.

447
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:12.460
Tina Marie: If I don't know if you're still looking at my screen, but.

448
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.080
Dan: Right.

449
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:17.630
Tina Marie: And go up, up, up.

450
00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.480
Tina Marie: No, must be down. Then

451
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:27.499
Tina Marie: one sec. It had basically a framework that it did dude. You're not even going down

452
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:33.060
Tina Marie: somewhere around here. We're talking this right?

453
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.980
Tina Marie: So it maps it out. And then it can

454
00:56:38.610 --> 00:57:07.219
Tina Marie: help create these things. So then you could say, Hey, okay, I've got this. How do I do things and specify the layout and like? And and we know with AI everything works better if you have an example. So like, if there's an interface of anything that you like that has a really good like this doesn't hurt my eyes. It's easy to use. I navigate between this tab, this tab, this tab, but I like it. I've got a dashboard for this all in one like Monday. Monday does a good job

455
00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:22.360
Tina Marie: right teamwork look wise. Monday is much easier on my eyes. Like, if you like, focus like, how would I use notion as omni focus? Here's the layout that I like, how would I design this?

456
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:37.630
Tina Marie: And if it's easy enough for you to create something right, tell me, give me basically an export file that I upload into notion to make for me great. If not, write this in a way that a developer can go, make exactly what I want, and be on the same page with me.

457
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:45.859
Tina Marie: That's how we use chat right now is, what are the gaps that have always pissed us off, whether it's

458
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:54.409
Tina Marie: out you know, layout how long it takes to get a developer to see your vision?

459
00:57:57.065 --> 00:58:04.159
Tina Marie: you know all those all those little things. Whatever is tedious go to chat to make it less tedious. That's what I'm working on.

460
00:58:05.788 --> 00:58:08.980
Dan: Oh, yeah, I mean, I use it incessantly.

461
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.490
Tina Marie: I know I love it.

462
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.059
Dan: Ridiculous. Yeah.

463
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.243
Tina Marie: Yes, okay.

464
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:23.780
Tina Marie: I pretty much talked through the whole thing. But I mean, you did tell me what you're working on, too. I want to use one of the prompts.

465
00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.899
Tina Marie: I don't have them saved.

466
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.189
Tina Marie: I don't even know where.

467
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:34.769
Tina Marie: Also, I feel like my blood sugar is crashing, anyway. What's something? If you have something for me

468
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.920
Tina Marie: that I might not have thought about, that, I should try.

469
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.359
Dan: In relation to.

470
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.750
Tina Marie: AI period.

471
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:45.670
Dan: Just a in general.

472
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:46.630
Tina Marie: Huh!

473
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.270
Dan: Just in general.

474
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:49.020
Tina Marie: Yeah.

475
00:58:49.948 --> 00:58:52.820
Dan: Let me see, what have I done recently?

476
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:01.110
Dan: Scrolling?

477
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:12.092
Dan: Oh, I've got all these. I I just collect prompts.

478
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.989
Dan: But what I was thinking was

479
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:21.650
Dan: my collecting of prompts. And what you're talking about is like for your thing.

480
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:28.599
Dan: It's like you would have like the Tina brain right at the top level if you will.

481
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:33.659
Dan: but then it's almost like they would. They would be like custom gpts

482
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.790
Dan: you would make them, and it's like how they onboard into Tina.

483
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:41.999
Dan: Right? So there's like, Hey, here's this.

484
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:59.950
Dan: you know, sort of like your intake that you do. You would break that into several gpts where you're like your goal is to get them to answer all these questions, and then it would just walk them through. And then it's feeding the their profile for you or or what in Gpt would be

485
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.520
Dan: probably like if you could build context around your clients. Right? So it

486
01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:18.260
Dan: literally builds the context file. Then there when they interact with your Gpt, their context is loaded. So it's you talking to them, knowing what they're like.

487
01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:26.020
Tina Marie: And know if new people would want to talk to. I don't know that they all

488
01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:34.070
Tina Marie: yeah, especially if I keep getting the new non techie, like doctors and lawyers, things.

489
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:44.400
Dan: Yeah, but they, it's not like they're doing these huge, long ass things. It's like, okay, once a week. It's like, Hey, just do this, and it's a little bit and a little bit and a little bit. But

490
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:48.689
Dan: cumulatively, they create a context file

491
01:00:48.900 --> 01:01:05.500
Dan: where, like you essentially do this like, you're looking at people going. This is how this person thinks this is how, instead, you just get that right up front. You don't need to figure it out over time. You have them go through this. It's a dual dual purpose, like onboarding slash context to fire.

492
01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:12.160
Dan: And it's like, Oh, okay, this. This is how this person thinks this is how this, this is their

493
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.149
Dan: the context in which

494
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:30.759
Dan: they operate. And now I know it. And now my AI knows it. So if they ever come talk to my AI, the AI knows. The context of like this is how I should respond to this person. This is what's gonna res this, this team of information

495
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:37.419
Dan: that is helpful needs to be delivered to this person like this because they're this type of thinker.

496
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:38.350
Tina Marie: You know.

497
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:39.440
Dan: I went through

498
01:01:39.440 --> 01:02:05.849
Dan: a bunch of. I went through one that because I asked Gpt, I was like, Hey, I've got this like it was telling me you need to build the context on yourself to build the Gpt around yourself right? And I was like, what was my context look like, and it spit out this Json file, and it's like you are an analytical thinker. You move fast, you you try. You know what you want to do. Then you go figure out the pieces that you need to get you there like you don't waste time.

499
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.230
Dan: You'll but you'll go deep when you have to. Whatever it was very accurate, I was like, yep, that's right.

500
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.779
Dan: So then

501
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:24.660
Dan: I got a prompt from that dude, I think, on X, and it was like use this to figure out what kind of thinker you are. And it just walked me through like a series of 7 or 8 questions.

502
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.560
Dan: And then it was like, Okay, this is. And it was like, How would you solve this problem? And it just lays out the problem.

503
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:43.612
Dan: And it gives you ABC, you got 3 or 4 ups whatever, and at the end of it it was like it. It was an additional context that I showed. Gpt, I'm like, would this be something I add to my context, it's like, absolutely

504
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:48.610
Dan: you would, absolutely. And I was like, Okay, I'm I'm starting to get it.

505
01:02:50.524 --> 01:02:51.820
Dan: But yeah, so.

506
01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.680
Tina Marie: Did it to give you a context file.

507
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:57.759
Dan: I just added asked it to make it, and it spit out a Json file.

508
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:03.740
Tina Marie: Oh, did you feel like it was comprehensive enough.

509
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:32.369
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it was interesting the questions that it asked, but that's the whole thing like you can take it. And then I just looked at like I started taking people's prompts like some people are like, Try this prompt. I'm like, it's a fucking paragraph. I'm like, this is a shitty, prompt like. Conceptually, I like where you're going right? Like I got this guy was like, you need the rewire your mind, and it's like

510
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.609
Dan: act as a neuroplasticity expert and cognitive enhancer.

511
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.785
Tina Marie: Mental training program. And it's like boarded.

512
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.160
Dan: It's like, okay.

513
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:43.780
Tina Marie: You.

514
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:50.970
Dan: That's a good idea. But I'm like this prompt could be so much better. Because it's

515
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.020
Dan: I've now learned that

516
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:59.820
Dan: structurally you're like, Hey, this is who you are. Gpt, this is what I want you to get right.

517
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.230
Dan: So I've

518
01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:24.590
Dan: took these other prompts and I fed it to Gpt. And I'm like, tell me what's good about these prompts. And it was like, Oh, the structure and the dot. And I said, Okay, great. Tell me what's missing. And like, okay, this is missing. I said, Okay, great. Now write me a custom. Gpt, that will help me build these prompts in the future. And I was like, sure. Here you go. I was like this is the description. This is the knowledge base. And now I have a.

519
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:34.039
Dan: you know, prompt assistant. Gpt, so I go into that and say, I want to write a prompt for Xyz. So I would load up like this dude's baby prompt.

520
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.970
Dan: and then it will spit out

521
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.660
Dan: much more elaborate, prompt at the end.

522
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:49.039
Dan: So it's like your stuff. You could do something similar like, Hey, I you know you extract a crap load of data in that 1st

523
01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.680
Dan: thing, like as I recall.

524
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.830
Dan: Oh, yes, or whatever right.

525
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:53.796
Tina Marie: 6. Pages.

526
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.769
Dan: Yeah, so it could be like 6 gpts.

527
01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.410
Dan: 6 short little boop, boop, boop, boop, boop! But.

528
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:11.430
Tina Marie: There are. There's sections. So yeah, for each section. What I'm gonna do is gonna take this this transcript and run it through, chat, Gpt and then have it

529
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:40.239
Tina Marie: basically better analyze what you just did. But one of the things that I was doing which is in alignment is this is my client manager. What I wanted to do was have a system that takes all of my zoom, calls and transcribes it, and then runs it through. 1st of all the context of everything. You know, all previous stuff, which is another reason like I want it local. I don't want it chat, Gpt, or anything like that, because privacy like it doesn't need to know my people's everything or my everything.

530
01:05:40.510 --> 01:06:02.679
Tina Marie: But but then I was thinking about that. I was like what what I wanna do is be able to have it in real time, actually build something of my own that's transcribing in zoom right? Not just zoom, or one of these plugins, but my own thing, which probably bigger and complicated. But we're narrowing that gap much, much faster into how that can happen.

531
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:21.599
Tina Marie: Where, then it can go. Okay, here's what's happening based off of what we know. So now it's referencing the past database of all the calls that we've had with this client. Here's the questions that you should be asking now to get the most momentum for this particular client. But also, what if I built a version? That is

532
01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:50.410
Tina Marie: let's say it's a sales helper, right? So this is a sales call. This is an intro call. Get to know you. It's an opportunity to get a new client. What are the kinds of questions? And then but but then it also has. You know, it's programmed to say, Okay, you need to listen to the answers. This person is given. Right? You've heard the salesperson, let's say, Tina, ask these questions over and over again. These are the different types of answers and profiles. What do we know about this person? The way that they're responding.

533
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.819
Tina Marie: that lets me know this is what they need to hear.

534
01:06:53.940 --> 01:07:05.046
Tina Marie: to help them feel like we can answer their questions or flag. The salesperson be like, this person is not a good match for you. Abort, abort, abort.

535
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:10.360
Dan: Yeah, yeah. But it's like, I mean, now, I'm thinking, like the

536
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:16.781
Dan: I mean that that it gets way more complicated. But it's like, okay, well, what is?

537
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:28.459
Dan: I think this is how I got to notion. I think I asked. Gpt. I'm like, you know, I like the Ghetto version. Tell me what the Ghetto version is, and I think that's how I started down this notion path. It's like, well, you could do this, and I was like.

538
01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:31.540
Tina Marie: We call it Mvp. But that's the same thing like, what's the.

539
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.100
Dan: Yeah.

540
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.340
Tina Marie: Easiest way. Notion.

541
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:33.870
Dan: Yeah.

542
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:34.599
Tina Marie: Coming up.

543
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:44.150
Dan: So it's like, if you I mean taking into what you just said. Now I'm thinking of. Tina had this set up in notion where I'll just use Mark.

544
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.700
Dan: Let's say you had.

545
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.649
Tina Marie: It was Mark.

546
01:07:47.790 --> 01:08:01.389
Dan: suite. Yeah. So you have suite law as a client. Right? Pro slash project, right? So it becomes a project in in notion. In in this setup, right? And then that project has a knowledge base.

547
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.930
Dan: a context.

548
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:17.589
Dan: And then you're transcribing phone calls to it. And you're just constantly feeding it data every week, but it also has. He did all the onboarding right? So that's part of the knowledge base. So it becomes this brain around the project.

549
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:25.759
Dan: and then the brain around you. Not, miss, there's not. Well, if you had a Tina one in there, too, they can talk. They can.

550
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.660
Tina Marie: I'm building.

551
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.800
Dan: Yeah, they can go between each other.

552
01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.030
Dan: But it's like, it's this idea that then that

553
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:47.880
Dan: that project just knows everything. Right? So it's like, yeah, yeah, you transcribe a phone call and you run it through like a post call. Gpt, and you're like, this is your job. You need to find any tasks that you think we're in here.

554
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:58.490
Dan: and then at the it. Just send you a review at the end and said, Hey, this is what went on on the call. Blah blah! These are the tasks that I saw, and then you review it and go. Yep, yep, that looks right. And then you.

555
01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:19.599
Dan: Then you say, and then maybe it makes like a you say, make a knowledge base, a relevant knowledge base, or whatever, from this call that's relevant to the greater project right? Because it could strip out the extraneous shit about like Chona. Right? It would just be like that. You talked about this Chona stuff. I didn't include it correct. Don't include that.

556
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.519
Dan: And then, in the context of like.

557
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:28.108
Dan: if it like, let's say, Mark, God forbid! Had quarterly goals

558
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:55.989
Dan: right? And then it was all. And then that was part of it, too. You're like it's it knew that you're in a quarter, and it's working towards quarterly goals. And you're like tracking that. And you have like a notion board for Mark. That's like, okay, this is what's happening. I mean, that'd be crazy. And then it's like, is this worth turning into an app like? I've now done it in practical. I've used it like it does what I want.

559
01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:07.939
Dan: Now, how do I turn this into an app, these these same things? Because that's the problem I see with the app is like, and I'm sure there's a way to do this, but you would have to be able to create like

560
01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.200
Dan: a container for each project.

561
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.319
Dan: which I'm sure is doable. But I just like I'm like. I don't know how to do that. I don't that

562
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:20.760
Dan: that's where I think it gets into this crazy database. Architecture shit that like is way beyond me.

563
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:27.809
Dan: So that's why that's why I ended up going. I just need to do something that works for me. And then it's like.

564
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.100
Dan: it's the it's the age, old thing, solve your problem.

565
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:37.565
Dan: And then, if it's a problem that other people have, you can sell it. But if you just if I just solve my problem. I'll be pretty pleased.

566
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:45.340
Tina Marie: Yeah, I that was a lot to distill and think about. And now I'm just like.

567
01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:54.229
Dan: No, yeah, no. It was a lot to to pour out of me because I was like, Oh, I'm looking at the ceiling. So you know, I'm really rolling. I'm like, Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

568
01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:00.679
Tina Marie: Yes, so I'll go back to, though, like.

569
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.189
Dan: Oh, here, here's a funny story, though. Here's the universe.

570
01:11:04.815 --> 01:11:05.440
Tina Marie: Okay.

571
01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:13.139
Dan: Literally. I signed up for notion yesterday. I started looking at notion. A week ago. I signed up for it yesterday. This morning. Sean goes. Check this out

572
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.320
Dan: notion.

573
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.220
Dan: I go.

574
01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:20.949
Tina Marie: What I tell you about notion and synergy and pacing. I just said that.

575
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:28.920
Dan: I I was like, I will be an expert in that or a hater by the end of next week. So I was like, just give me about a week, and I'll tell you. I'll tell you if it's any good.

576
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:36.580
Tina Marie: I'll tell you. If you're a hater of it, it's because it hasn't been customized the way you want it to, but it can be.

577
01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.261
Dan: Yeah. Well, and his example was, it was a

578
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:59.889
Dan: I'll just call it a progress tracker. That's way inaccurate, for, like independent artists to manage themselves. And I said, Sean, I can tell you right now. I opened it and closed it. There's no way some band guys gonna be like this. Is it like they will lose their minds. They'll never. It's way too much.

579
01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.680
Tina Marie: Yeah, yes, yep. And that.

580
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.190
Dan: Dirt looks great.

581
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:15.040
Tina Marie: What I was gonna say is, though, you like, you know, and this gets more complicated and it takes more time. But think about you know where we're at

582
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.210
Tina Marie: in life seasons.

583
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:41.140
Tina Marie: Where is your time? Gonna go right now? It's going to go to music making. It will always go to business building, right? Because it's that's just a function that you serve everywhere you go. It's the brain that you have that will help everybody like you. You probably can't have a conversation with somebody and not add some value if it's business related. So

584
01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:48.110
Tina Marie: in terms of like longevity, I'm thinking, you know, next 1, 2, 3 decades of life.

585
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.580
Tina Marie: You're going to be involved in music making.

586
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:58.569
Tina Marie: You're always going to have the business brain. You may not have the interest in it. But whatever is built now.

587
01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.560
Tina Marie: framework wise, knowing the tools.

588
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:12.490
Tina Marie: all of the tools are going to be iterations and evolutions of what exists now to a degree.

589
01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:18.259
Tina Marie: There's only so much change that could happen. But framework, wise as far as anything exists.

590
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:26.560
Tina Marie: notion is the most so like we, the competitors are more like salesforce.

591
01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:43.810
Tina Marie: Really, I don't even know what a competitor to salesforce truly is. I know that there's entrepreneur, and I know that there's infusion soft, but they really don't have the complexity that salesforce does. But salesforce is corporate. It's bloated, it's limited.

592
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:44.570
Dan: Oh, it's all.

593
01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:48.410
Tina Marie: Customize it. So notion is

594
01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:58.120
Tina Marie: between notion and high level, the competitor to salesforce that never existed with the ability to customize things, and now

595
01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:07.850
Tina Marie: add into that the appendages of Zapier make NAN out, right? etc. Those types of things. Yeah.

596
01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:30.780
Tina Marie: we have the ability, although it's not super fast. It's faster than it's ever been to create kind of these custom frameworks. The basis, right? That that's the way that you operate. That's what you did. It doesn't exist. I'm going to build it. It took a long time to build. None of these are going to take as long as any of that did.

597
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:51.429
Tina Marie: and your job is in one way to add the complexity. But in another way it's to remove the complexity right that other people have built in that is never going to get used. And you know, from experience it's never going to get used. So what actually does matter? What is the essential? And I think that

598
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:58.159
Tina Marie: the ability to distill and refine is the higher level skill

599
01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:04.499
Tina Marie: that is always going to be needed. Lots of people can overcomplicate. That's what they do.

600
01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:10.230
Tina Marie: They build and build and build and build and build right. But if your building is.

601
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:37.460
Tina Marie: let me take away the extraneous right, so that what gets used is actually, what matters right, what what matters gets measured everything else. Nothing happens. So anyway, in terms of like the investment of learning this particular thing, I would say. It's as as valuable, as high level. It's as valuable as you learning Bootstrap figma

602
01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.340
Dan: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm I'm going in.

603
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:42.910
Dan: I'm for sure going there.

604
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.449
Tina Marie: I know when you're talking about, maybe getting out I'm like, don't get out just.

605
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:48.000
Dan: No, no, I'm only gonna get out.

606
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.470
Tina Marie: Yours.

607
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:50.509
Dan: If I figure out it's not going to work.

608
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:57.830
Dan: But yesterday I was like, Oh, today's not the day I was like, I got some tasks. I gotta get my tasks done. Stay on task.

609
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:10.160
Tina Marie: That's good. I like this because Dan Dan Brain used to go bing, bing, bing, bing, bing! And that didn't work for you, cause you've got too many things to manage. I don't. I just have me so I can bing, bing! All I want to.

610
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.030
Dan: Yeah.

611
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.290
Tina Marie: Yeah.

612
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:13.320
Dan: Totally.

613
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:23.179
Tina Marie: Alright. With that I need to go like, put some food in. I had a half of a 5 h energy, and it did nothing for me. This conversation helped.

614
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.450
Tina Marie: but as soon as it's over, like my body's just gonna go.

615
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:35.790
Dan: Oh, I gotta tell you my new favorite app it's called Downey, DOW. Yeah DOWN IE.

616
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.439
Dan: I don't know how often you download videos.

617
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.955
Tina Marie: The way we spell downy downy. What sorry.

618
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:45.420
Dan: That I don't know how often you download videos, but it turns out I do it every day.

619
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:46.210
Tina Marie: This.

620
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.629
Dan: This thing makes its it downloads anything.

621
01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.580
Dan: So like Youtube, video, click embedded video on a web page. Click.

622
01:16:55.135 --> 01:16:55.400
Tina Marie: We.

623
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.259
Dan: Entire entire courses.

624
01:16:57.650 --> 01:17:00.209
Tina Marie: Seasons of Big Bang theory.

625
01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:11.639
Dan: I mean, I've downloaded an entire course by logging into the site. It can see every video on the page, and then you select which ones you want, and then you just hit go.

626
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.229
Dan: So I download like I had this spotify. Course, I'm like, I'm never going through this course downloaded the whole thing.

627
01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:25.299
Tina Marie: I feel like people have gone through class action lawsuits and been sued by the Ftc. And had millions of dollars taken from them for doing shit like this.

628
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.190
Dan: Well, I mean, you bought the videos.

629
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.270
Tina Marie: Oh!

630
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:36.859
Dan: I mean, I'm just trans. I did. I just transcribe them and then tell Gpt to turn it into a a plan

631
01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:45.649
Dan: like, Show me what to tell me. Explain this whole thing to me right? So like I bought, here's perfect example. I'm like, Oh, my God, I'm never gonna go through this. Now I am.

632
01:17:45.820 --> 01:18:10.669
Dan: I bought. Ezra Firestone sold his shit for like a gazillion dollars, and then he made a course with the guys that he sold the company through on, hey? This is how you prep yourself to sell your company, I was like, oh, that's relevant. So I bought it. But then I'm like, I'm not going to spend 8 h going through this thing like there's not 8 h worth of shit in here.

633
01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.510
Dan: There's.

634
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:28.379
Tina Marie: That's I bought Peter Parker's trading stuff, and then I stopped. It just took so long. Here's the thing. Here's the reason why I wanted to keep his stuff, but he he locks it like, if you lose your subscription like you don't get access for the course you paid for. You don't pay for the course you pay for access, which, really

635
01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:48.179
Tina Marie: but I but I was like, but he takes forever to get to the point, but his points are kind of genius, so they're worth through, except for I still couldn't just like I don't have the time to sift through it at this moment for the nuggets, but I want the nuggets. I paid for the nuggets.

636
01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:49.310
Dan: Right.

637
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I love them.

638
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:59.600
Dan: Yeah. So I didn't realize how much I downloaded videos until I got this. And then now I'm like, Oh, I'll just. I'll just download that.

639
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:04.969
Tina Marie: I'm glad download the script done your your library in notion it'd be like.

640
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:05.779
Dan: Then I just

641
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.749
Dan: it through descript. Then I run it through Gpt, and then I will stick it in a Google Doc

642
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.709
Dan: and then attach it to notion. Yeah, totally.

643
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.303
Tina Marie: Yeah, we were separated at birth. You're just my nerdy brother.

644
01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:34.360
Dan: I realized it's so funny because the notion thing when I saw it integrate with G drive. And I was like, Oh, yeah. Then I realized, how much time do I spend going to G drive looking for shit, because God knows that thing's not organized and never is going to be.

645
01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:41.080
Tina Marie: Google and Chat Gbt integrate with it, too. I mean, I'm now integrates with it. Also.

646
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.439
Dan: Yeah, yeah, it's great. I'm like, Okay, I'm I'm doing it.

647
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.750
Dan: I'm doing it.

648
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:47.020
Tina Marie: Oof.

649
01:19:47.140 --> 01:20:02.690
Tina Marie: I'm having too much fun. It's good. It's not too much fun, because this getting to the point of like the last child leaving after 4 of them. Been a mom 24 years, and I'm on the last 2 like this is, anyway, it's wild. So I'm grateful for the nerdy distractions.

650
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:04.409
Dan: No, I don't think about that.

651
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.449
Tina Marie: All right, I need food.

652
01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:15.219
Tina Marie: Okay, I don't have any close. I didn't ask lots of questions. I get to bombard you with other questions next week.

653
01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:19.720
Dan: Here. I'll give you an update. So we figured out, I think we're right.

654
01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:24.049
Dan: Ninja should be over 5,000 subscribers by the end of the summer.

655
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:25.920
Tina Marie: Wow!

656
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.059
Dan: I know Bobby and I were like Oh, my God! And that's on the low end.

657
01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:30.860
Dan: That's.

658
01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.300
Tina Marie: Using the.

659
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.380
Dan: Current math. Yeah, because I go. Wait a minute.

660
01:20:34.850 --> 01:21:02.480
Dan: What? What's I go? Dude? We're going into the high season. We must have an average increase. And Bobby Bobby's so funny. He's like, Oh, my God, dude! I never thought of that. And so then he goes and does the math, and he comes back. He's like, it's 15%. We average 15% increase in overall subscribers every busy season which starts right now. So then, we applied that math, but we still can't factor in the unknown. So I'm like Dude. It's a minimum of that.

661
01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:06.099
Dan: So it comes out. It comes to 5,000. It's over 5,000,

662
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.279
Dan: I was like. I'll take it.

663
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.180
Dan: Oh, bonkers! Dude.

664
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.207
Tina Marie: It is, but it isn't like, but it is.

665
01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.560
Dan: Correct exactly. You couldn't have said it any better.

666
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.180
Tina Marie: Cool.

667
01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:26.919
Dan: I feel like, I'm like, Oh, this is cool. Oh, okay, yeah, it is. We don't really know. But it is.

668
01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.830
Tina Marie: Right.

669
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:30.719
Dan: Because the numbers way higher. Yep.

670
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.660
Tina Marie: Well, because, but also like you've done the things.

671
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:39.580
Tina Marie: And there was no way of knowing

672
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:48.829
Tina Marie: the the way that it would change things. But you knew that if anything was going to change it, it was this, right like.

673
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:49.470
Dan: Yes.

674
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:53.479
Tina Marie: And then how much and all of that so wild!

675
01:21:54.310 --> 01:22:08.279
Tina Marie: But all of these things always are just proof of 1st of all, showing up consistently every day, showing up strategically and consistently every day.

676
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:17.119
Tina Marie: does what can only other be described as like good luck, magic miracles whatever to other people.

677
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:26.779
Tina Marie: But it is the pattern that if you show up strategically and consistently every day, crazy, good shit happens.

678
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:29.549
Tina Marie: told him something.

679
01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:30.910
Tina Marie: That's all I'm saying.

680
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:32.349
Dan: That's all there is to it.

681
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:43.520
Tina Marie: But you know most people won't show up period consistently, much less consistently and strategically, and actually use their brains

682
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:46.960
Tina Marie: anyway.

683
01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:54.150
Tina Marie: All right. Well, that was an awesome update. Okay, I will talk to you Monday.

684
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.360
Dan: Cool.

685
01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:01.760
Tina Marie: Have a good week. Oh, wait, wait! I do have to ask one more question. How did the recording session go with Mariel?

686
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:15.249
Dan: So she didn't want to record. She just wanted to sing. She's been over. She was over again yesterday, so she comes over. She goes into the vocal booth she's practicing to try out for Hadestown.

687
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:28.270
Dan: So yesterday she I she doesn't want me to hear sing, but I may have snuck into the room because she's in a booth, and she can't see there's no window or the window faces the other way. So I was listening to her. And I was like, Okay.

688
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:37.649
Dan: I hear, what's she's I'm like she's straining. She hits the notes, but she's straining. Then she came out. She's talking, and her voice is a little hoarse, and I was like you.

689
01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:38.190
Tina Marie: Touch.

690
01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:39.420
Dan: You need to warm up.

691
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:46.980
Dan: and I'm like, do you know how to move your voice? And I was? You know I'm like, I know, you know what chest and head voice are. But do you

692
01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.370
Dan: right

693
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:56.990
Dan: to move them? And she was like, No, and I said, Okay, I'm gonna send you some videos, 3 videos, you're gonna watch them. And it's gonna make. And it's gonna instantly make you a better singer.

694
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.610
Tina Marie: Yes.

695
01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:01.499
Dan: And she was like, Okay, and then I actually.

696
01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:01.970
Tina Marie: Thank you.

697
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.529
Dan: So vocal, coaching thing?

698
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.770
Dan: Who.

699
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:06.070
Tina Marie: Cheryl, porter.

700
01:24:06.681 --> 01:24:09.089
Dan: The singer, the the British chick.

701
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.240
Tina Marie: No.

702
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.519
Dan: Oh, no! Then no!

703
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:19.729
Tina Marie: She? Well, she's not British, she's American, but she lives in Italy. Cheryl porter, voice coach!

704
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.758
Tina Marie: You cannot not love this lady. She does such amazing

705
01:24:27.109 --> 01:24:33.889
Tina Marie: what do you call it? Just social media posts? I'm gonna let's see, where do I? I want to text this to you?

706
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:38.619
Tina Marie: Where's my text? Messages? I don't know. Copy it this way. Hold on

707
01:24:39.154 --> 01:24:49.859
Tina Marie: anyway. There's there's a few on social media that do such a good job of like showing all those voice changes and things. But you know it's a chemistry match, especially for teenagers.

708
01:24:50.010 --> 01:25:03.169
Tina Marie: so like finding the person that lights her up, that makes her go. I love this person. She'll consume the information so much better, but if she watches somebody that she's like kind of met about.

709
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:20.929
Tina Marie: she won't. She won't keep watching it whatever. So if you really want to help her, tell her that, tell her to find the person that you just can't stop watching their videos. And you, because you feel like you're in the room with them, whatever that person will help her, be ready. The fastest and the best.

710
01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:24.960
Dan: Yeah. And if you don't need help with pitch.

711
01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:29.399
Dan: then these things are helpful. Right? It's like she doesn't really have a pitch problem.

712
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:39.680
Dan: So it's like you just have like a you gotta relax that that's in like, where in? Probably, like diaphragmic support.

713
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:44.140
Dan: that kind of stuff like she's you, exhausting her breath too quickly like that's

714
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:50.770
Dan: let's just do it like this. And then once you feel it, you're like, Oh, okay, yeah, I feel that difference.

715
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:54.690
Tina Marie: Go click on that that link for me real quick, please.

716
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:58.739
Tina Marie: even better if you do it on your desktop. I texted it to you. I think I did.

717
01:25:59.150 --> 01:25:59.920
Dan: Yeah.

718
01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:04.500
Tina Marie: I'll be like. Oh, I know who this is. Oh, I do know who this is.

719
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.120
Tina Marie: Yes.

720
01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:06.180
Dan: Okay.

721
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:13.490
Tina Marie: Somebody taught her marketing, though, because look at it, she's got the old way of the new way. She's got all the things.

722
01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:16.299
Dan: Yeah, I do know her. The second I was like, Oh, yeah.

723
01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:28.607
Tina Marie: Yeah, she's amazing. I love her spirit energy. I love that like she's a makeup girly, but she's like I'm also gonna be barefaced and naked, and if you don't like it, or you got mean things to say, get gone.

724
01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.010
Dan: I mean, this is practically the Alan. What's his name? Funnel?

725
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:35.140
Dan: It's very similar.

726
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:35.810
Tina Marie: Clinic.

727
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:41.480
Dan: Yeah, interesting. Yeah. I've watched some of her stuff, not a lot.

728
01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:50.749
Tina Marie: I've watched tons of it, just cause she makes me smile like I literally look at her face. And I start smiling.

729
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.417
Tina Marie: Jesus, cool, anyway. Okay, that's what I wanted to know. I wanted to know how it went. So.

730
01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:57.450
Dan: Happening.

731
01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.480
Tina Marie: That's so cool, Dan. I love that cause.

732
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:00.970
Dan: Yes.

733
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:01.750
Tina Marie: No.

734
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:19.699
Tina Marie: she just has something hopefully that will help her like kids just need a thing to help them blossom. And they need that before they leave the house, so that they do well outside. If they don't have it before they leave, then they have to find it, and that's hard.

735
01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:21.830
Dan: Yeah.

736
01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.390
Tina Marie: Anyway, I'm happy for you, happy for her.

737
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.960
Dan: Oh!

738
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:30.800
Tina Marie: Okay, well, have a great weekend, and I will talk to you today.

739
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.433
Dan: Alright! Later.

740
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.820
Tina Marie: Bye.
