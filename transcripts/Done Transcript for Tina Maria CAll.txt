00:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey, hey, lady. How are you? You're good. You're good.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a little tired now.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I don't know how productive I'll be right now. So let's just make this a short one. How's that?
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally fine. I spent the rest of last night pretty much in the fetal position cramping.
00:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, shoot.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, man. I didn't get anything done.
00:00:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just got off the call with Dan and cramping again. So. Oh, shoot. Well, we can make this short. I mean, I'm excited about everything. So, but we have next week books. I know it's going to be really well.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we could probably just see, basically see if there were any thoughts that we had that we could capture that we could use to continue to kind of distill over the weekend until we talk again. I did go check name cheap for. the spicy brain CEO and I'm one that would get all the adjacent domains. I didn't buy anything. I thought I'd talk to you, but spicy CEO, a spicy brain CEO podcast, the spicy brain CEO, spicy brain CEO Za, plural. I would get all of those so that we've got them, you know, copycats and whatnot. It doesn't cost that much. And I'm also maybe a domain addict.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know, but having been around, you know, I still own I still own ultimate consulting challenge.com from like 15 years ago when I used to run them all the time.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still own your web business assistant, which is how I got started. Nothing on it, but yeah, I used to own plug-in squeeze page and I let that go away, but somebody owns that now. and it's domain stories are interesting.
00:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's fun when there's another nerd in the house.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was the biggest thing for me. It's just like I really keep feeling that. love the thought of that spicy brain CEOs and the neurodivergence being able to have a broader umbrella to talk about executive dysfunction because that's not the only thing I think that we could talk about, which this just popped into my brain. But the 80D version of what it's like to be an entrepreneur anyway and most entrepreneurs are 80D. So there's more than just executive dysfunction. There's some of us just can't like I used to be able to read books all the time. I cannot read now. I get annoyed. get angry. If- there's bullet points I can skim. If there's pictures, it makes me feel stupid sometimes that my brain can't focus on attach to if it's small text. I get angry, like legitimately angry. And it used to be the other way around. I would get mad if I was told to listen to something, I needed to see it. So I still need to see it, but my brain is really good at drawing the pictures now because I have enough experience and context to be able to draw the pictures myself. And so I get mad if people want to draw picture and their picture sucks. I get angry.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is funny.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Small text, safe, interesting. Yeah, so but that's not just me. There are a lot of us that are just skimmers will not read. And so we need you to be concise. There are some people that love my long messages because their brains are like, oh, it's structured, it's good, it's succinct.
00:03:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's others like Tina, stop talking so much, stop writing so much. And they get mad because their brain is overwhelmed with all the things that I've said.
00:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that is important when it's in business and you need that information. So I've learned to chunk things into single ideas. I've even had a friend in Sunday school, he's a doctor, pull me aside, like, I don't know how to tell you this, but I need you to just stop and let me chew on one thought that you have, because you go here to here to here to here. And I got angry and I was like, it's not about you, but whatever, maybe it's for somebody else. But there's wisdom in not using a fire hose to give people information. So there's so many nuances to the conversation. And then there's also on the female aspect, ADD for a woman going through a perimenopause and being able to talk about out just neurodivergence and talking about women. So maybe we know that we're going to repel some men and maybe some men are interested because they haven't went lives. Or maybe they just want to know what it's like with the women that they work with. But being okay with talking about female specific things like perimenopause and menopause, where our brains change, the chemistry in ourselves, it changes. But we're not ready to be out to pasture, you know what I mean? And that season of life, again, we're bringing the village back. We've lost the village elders, we've lost the community, but we need the village. And so I think we're bringing the village elders back. And I'm 47, maybe I'm not elder elder, but I'm like, I'm there, you know?
00:05:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I love that. And you know, it's funny, I had a client call earlier today. And it was just an hour call of him and I was checking into what he was always doing, been with me for about 15 years. he just real low. Yeah, but he's kind of right now kind of not doing too much just besides working full time because his wife passed away few years ago and it still hasn't. Yeah. So I was like, what do you want to do? And I was like, you know, it's really just making an extra thousand or two thousand months. I love what I do. You know, so I was like, well, you know, and then I explained for us, he, know what, sometimes you don't want to do, you could just then, instead of starting with your product offer, just start with a podcast or something you want to talk about start interviewing people, right? And I gave an example of us and he's right away, like, I would buy that for my granddaughter, like because she is like in high school, about to go to college. And I know she's got ADHD and maybe this executive dysfunction is like, I'm interested as a buyer or listener to your podcast. So that's awesome. Yeah, yeah. And I, and I told him it was a little bit more for entrepreneurs, but we do want to help people also who are younger too. So I thought that was really cool that he was right away saying, I'll buy that.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I, that's exciting. But it's also not surprising. I think one thing that I trust in myself is my intuition in being able to read needs of people because that's what always trying to pay attention to. So on a market level, it's, it's really good. But, but yeah, but then there's the other side of me that knows that we have to pace ourselves and build. We can't serve multiple audiences well at the same time. So build for one audience first, serve them well, then extend to the next one, taking best practices from what we learned here. Yeah. And because in, in the, in me trying to serve too many, many people at once. That's where I've created the overwhelm and the disservice also and just the failure to actually launch and gain that momentum. So that would be the one thing. But what I do love is knowing ahead of time that there are multiple facets and paths that will extend and that this one thing, which is also you'll find a huge factor of my operational choices, is I want to do one thing that serves multiple purposes. So everything I do is leveraged and to be able to know that the goal is to also serve youth and help empower them to be able to, because this is what I do with my daughters, choose your path. We were talking about create your own adventure, choose your own adventure books. That's what I've taught my girls how to use computers since they were age two. I've got my oldest, she graduated and immediately got a two-year degree in digital media and design and now she's working on game design as a four-year degree. My second daughter has been a photographer paid since she was 17 and she also does, she's done social media management and now she is a media buyer because I put her through ad skills and how to get work. My 14, my 23-year-old also is a seamstress. sewed prom dresses ball gowns. She taught herself when she was 14. I've always given them all the tools. Like we have sewing machines and embroidering machines. We have cricket machines. They have boxes of stickers. My 17-year-old can do acrylic nails like professionally and she's going to go into beauty school but she's also a seamstress and can sew anything. She makes costumes. They do gore like like crazy Hollywood level gore design and not just gore.
00:09:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. I'm going to show you this real quick.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but my point is, is that they've also struggled in school, actually, up through seventh grade, sixth grade, they were always taught for their class and teachers helpers. And this is the thing that I've learned about ADHD people, it tends to happen is where the structure changes, and it becomes more homework specific and they pile stuff onto you, rather than allow your brain to take time to learn things. And that's when they just start getting overwhelmed because it's, it's mentally overwhelming. It's not because their brains can't process it. It's just that, I mean, that they're not intelligent enough to do it. It's that the workload is not conducive to actually learning. What? Oh, there it is.
00:10:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
on. Wow.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, a couple of years ago. And then she created this.
00:11:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm trying to get a good that's wild.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She made these tails. That's from Sonic. There's a character called Tails and there are two Tails. Yeah, she made that. I put them in the other. That's the same one.
00:11:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, very cool.
00:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but I'm teaching them that they can create their own path. I was on the career path of I'm going to go to college because that was my way of escaping, but it was high pressure. It was stressful. It was overwhelming. It was soul crushing. Not to be career oriented and goal oriented, but the path is created to squash creativity and to create conformity. And that is spirit crushing. And most ADHD entrepreneurial types are the types where they know that there's.
00:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it was born to be free. Yeah.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if we can help younger people skip, you know, needing to wait until they're in their mid 30s or early 40s to embrace themselves, if we can teach them that their way their brain works isn't wrong, it just needs different things than the institutions provide.
00:12:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And to feel good about themselves, then they'll go and they'll create this amazing world for us. they're already like Gen Z and Gen. I don't know what the other one there's like, I know what I can't keep track of them, but they're more compassionate, more accepting, more freely themselves. They have a lot of great qualities. But if we can also teach them how to, how to harness their mind. Yeah, and just kind of liberate them because the world still hasn't really learned how to optimize mind and a brain and harness it. That to me is thrilling to think about the impact of that generation and also because they suffer from anxiety so bad. The suicide rates are climbing and it's because they don't know how to deal with this overwhelm and they can't deal with the overwhelm because the institution is created to create more. Yeah. School, right? Yeah. We gotta work hard. We gotta change the math. We gotta do this. We gotta do that. And they're like, but I can't.
00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can't.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it literally can save lives to teach them how their mind works. Yeah. And that it's not disordered and that's actually pretty amazing. I literally think it can see lives.
00:14:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I agree. I agree. I mean, because like, if my friend's son didn't have a support group, who knows, he could have went off the deep van after that doctor's meeting too, right? getting, you know, rebranded, like, you know, because he was thinking, you everything's going wrong for me, you know? Yeah.
00:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. So, um, yeah, if we want to just keep kind of pondering and let you rest, that's one of the reasons I don't usually do such long calls is because I need a recovery period. There is, uh, it's an energetic exchange and it seems like it's, you know, just talking, but using my brain like that, which is why I don't a lot of clients. There's a huge recovery period from it. Like it's a, it's a big, it doesn't hurt me while I'm doing it. You know, like it's fun and amazing, but I always need a big recovery period and it's, it still surprises me, but I plan for it for the most.
00:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's fine.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's why the conversation of pace is also a big part of you'll, you'll see, like, yay, calm down. We got calm down.
00:15:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay. I love it. I love it. No, and I think I'm going to learn a lot from that.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I don't think I control my energy. I think I give way too much away. Oh, I imagine that.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're a, you're a giver and a server and you're very busy. I see all your emails and I see all the things that you're doing. And you're excited. You have a lot to give, but protecting and managing energy has been huge to me because I saw, and I will keep this short, sure saw a real yesterday that was a great way to explain it. And she asked this lady, she said, if I asked you to give me your bank account, count, use your name and password. Would you give it to me? And they was like, probably not. She goes, right. Why? Because like, if she had infinite money, she wouldn't care if somebody took money from her.
00:16:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right? Oh, there's the analogy.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Right. So she goes, I'm asking you for level 10 access, but I'm only showing up maybe as level three, because I'm not giving you money.
00:16:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not putting money into that.
00:16:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not matching what you're giving me access to.
00:16:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, wait a minute. So she says, so what you do is you don't try to force people to come up to level 10. What you do is you remove the locks and you give them level access to where they're at. But a lot of times, like in our relationships, we just keep trying to pull people up to our level and want them to give according to what we're giving. Or be worthy of what we're giving because we want to give it to them and we see their worth and their value But they're still only showing up at level three entry level. Yeah, I Was like well, that's amazing, but I think of that in terms of energy So I have a lot of energy and I have given a lot of it, but And here's another quick conversation is that the Filipino lady that I'm working with She wants to create So she's been working from home for years and she's a mom She has a lot of friends like I want to do what you do and I want to be able to work from home And she wants to create a VA program that teaches other people how to become VA so that they can Be mama and still provide for their family and which I've done for the last 22 years And I said I said I love that I said but I could tell you in 22 years Every single person that's ever said Tina help me work from home. So I can do what you do. First of all, you can't do what I do. But I will try to help you work from home. And I will show you these different paths. Not one person ever did the work.
00:18:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, wow.
00:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Got one. But if they weren't already on the path and going and looking for the information, because it was that important to them, but they were just like, Oh, it sounds, I want what you have.
00:18:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
want to be able to work from home, control over my freedom.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they didn't want it enough to even go look for it. They just wanted enough to ask for it. But I want to give it to everybody. And what I love is that I work up here, because I choose to, and they're here going, I want what you have.
00:18:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I don't want to do this. Yes. Yeah.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when it comes to like energy management, recognizing that a lot of people will not invest their energy, their mental energy, or their effort. to the same level, even clients, I will fire them if I care about their business more than they do.
00:19:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care what they're making.
00:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I keep asking you the same question and you tell me it's important to you, but your actions say it's not because you don't do what we agree to do, that means I care about it more than you do because I have to keep bringing it up. When I hired you for that, you don't own me.
00:19:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not under you.
00:19:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I don't need you. You need me. And yeah, so learning those things has been given. We have finite energy and finite hours. So anyway, all right. Well, I'm sure that you're fried. probably have nothing else unless you have questions or not. No, no, no, not right now.
00:19:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, just like everything. I like the spicy brain and I just love it the more I think about it.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like this is really cool. It's good to do it. So yeah, I love that. Okay, so then Tuesday, we're meeting.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, like you said Tuesday.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I will make sure not to wear myself out Monday so I can come right at it.
00:20:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But she tailed on Tuesday. Yeah, you're gonna see big difference between one 30 year whatever it was versus after four 30.
00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I believe that I'm yeah, the time of day definitely matters and the time of the month matters. Maria, I'm ready to be done. Am I help me father? There's no point in this right now.
00:20:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Can you just take it please? you just take it? All right, well, still great connecting with you though.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's good to talk.
