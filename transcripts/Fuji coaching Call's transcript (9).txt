WEBVTT

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Tina Marie: Won't go in there.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: No, she'll she has the. Hi Tina.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Tina Marie: Hi! How are you?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Good. Thank you. Sorry. I missed the meeting this morning.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay. We we gotta figure it out.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Tina Marie: Hi esther.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hi! Again!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Tina Marie: I've never had both the Fujis together at the same time. Like to work. I get Esther going by with the baby or something. But this is fun.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, yeah, it is. Thank you for your patience. I was rushing back.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: From running errands.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Tina Marie: I understand I've got every minute of every day accounted for, even if it's just sitting down and resting, because I'm literally just building up my battery so I can get to the next thing. But that's how I get so.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: I know what you mean. All right.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay. So you had a whole list of things that you wanted to go over. Do you want to kind of drive the call today?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. Yeah. I think we'll do that.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: So part of this is also like, as you know, I think Fuji's. Spread a little thin.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: And it works also in conjunction with me, trying to find something to do, to contribute to this part of our like life and our livelihood and our family. So with that being said, um.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: We just kind of brainstormed some items here. Some of them are kind of housekeeping items. Um.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Actually, most of them are housekeeping items more administrative and management items. And we just wanted to get your.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thoughts on some of them, how, in your opinion, how critical they would be, what their. Indirect or direct impact on revenue would be. How much you know, you know, are there certain things that we should prioritize because of their impact to revenue or not.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm. Um on for that list that I I shared with you yesterday.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Which I am looking at.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. Uh, that's the one plan with us, Jared. So Michael, is Tina up to date on all the personnel changes and everything on your on your side. I might not be because you had a meeting with her yesterday. But well, nothing's changed. 2 weeks ago we let go of uh Lourdes, who was making a lot of mistakes, and then we let go of Mirika's sister Susanna.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, because she is only Spanish, only that's we haven't made any other changes. Today we I interviewed 2 people. To fill those roles. Um.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I'm having Paul interview those 2 next. And then their direct managers are email uh. Interviewing them also today.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Tina Marie: Awesome.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Um. My question is.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Paul. He's not moving back into the exact same role because Mirka is doing the triaging. Now, right? Okay, Mirka is doing well with the triaging. It was just that, you know, the 5% of things that required. Higher thinking and also um angry. I want to say angry. But case managers with unique issues. Now she's elevating all that to me. And Paul, okay, instead of trying to deal with it on her own. Okay, got it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: Alright! Um in general, Tina. I'd like to get a sense of.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: How you think the health of the business is. Overall. I'm just kind of based on the numbers that Fuji shared with you, and just the.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know the the things that you guys have been working on since he stopped the brain, MRI, particularly for July.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Tina Marie: So. It's a complicated question, because there's a lot going on.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Tina Marie: Um. If we're ever give it to a pass, fail, it's pass, for sure.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. Other than that.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Tina Marie: There are. Different buckets, basically, that need to be worked on all the time and.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Tina Marie: With. One person.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Tina Marie: Running the show. Primarily, Fuji. Um.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tina Marie: We go in and out of that because he basically spends about. You know, whatever we have after our call, working on the things that we talk about, and then the rest of the week.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Tina Marie: Working in the business right on the birth business versus in the business. So.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Tina Marie: There's been a lot of growth. And the growth has been on a foundational level. So the teams.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Tina Marie: The structure, the systems, the spreadsheets, things like that. And.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Tina Marie: Um. And then the the marketing aspect of it, so.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Tina Marie: I think the team has. The team side of it has been growing and evolving and improving, and I think that it's great.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Tina Marie: I don't think that you can grow faster than than what's been happening. Maintainably.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. And I think that you seem to have.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Pretty solid people in place, but you have to. There's there's a lot that happens that we don't talk about. You know.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Tina Marie: My dogs are messing with each other. Um.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Tina Marie: So I I don't know that I knew about Lourdes um making the mistakes that she was making, because sometimes, Fuji, you'll just kind of. Glaze over that, and you take care of it, and so.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Tina Marie: Unless. Um.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Tina Marie: I catch something I'm like. Wait, let me ask you some questions about that. Then we just move past that and get to other things. There's always.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Tina Marie: Plenty to talk about when it comes to acquisition. Which is the lifeblood of the business right? There is no business. If there isn't.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Tina Marie: Um. Calls and clients.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Um. So we spend the majority of our time on that the business could definitely use.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Tina Marie: Uh. More more. But but we're building it so anyway, there's room for additional help is what I see.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: Um. So like we've got these spreadsheets, and we see the the money that comes in, and we see.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Tina Marie: The calls that are coming in. But every week Fuji and I are getting a little bit deeper into it, so.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Tina Marie: This week. Trying to make a.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Tina Marie: A dashboard where we can look at the corollary relationship between his outreach and new patients. But.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Tina Marie: Um. There's also uh.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Tina Marie: Additional Visits Right Subsequent Visits. And I know that Paul is working on that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't know how consistently it happens.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Tina Marie: Just because. There's so many things to keep in my brain about what you're doing, and your brain, Fuji.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: So. But I but I do know that that's working. So that's these are some of the things that are what I see, as like the most important, making sure that we've got. Committed time every single week.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Tina Marie: To acquisition. That it's a strategic approach, and that we're measuring everything that we're doing.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Tina Marie: So that we can see what works, what works? Well, what works? Okay, what doesn't work at all. Because those are the things that are going to have the biggest impact on the bottom line, the bottom line being the the key.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Tina Marie: That unlocks everything, because as long as we've got a healthy bottom line. You can afford to have the team.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Tina Marie: And you can afford to have the people. The other thing that happens is if we're going into like. Just look at like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Basically.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Tina Marie: If you're not making enough money, you get to a stress point. Your stress point. Your stress levels.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Tina Marie: Overtake creativity, overtake problem, solving, overtake leadership, and things like that. So not we. There's multiple reasons why we want to have the healthiest profit margin.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Tina Marie: Possible. Um. The biggest is that you get to be the best leaders and create the best um.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Tina Marie: Safety, and then the place to flourish on a professional level, but also on all the people that you take care of. The.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Tina Marie: The spreadsheets and the dashboards that we've been working on are the enabling, like. Key to the key. Kind of thing.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Tina Marie: Um so. Measuring where we're at across the board.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Tina Marie: Um. One thing that I don't think we have yet, Fuji and I I know I brought it up a couple of times, but again. There's so many things to go into is an org chart kind of like a a um. I think we did start at once. Um! Who reports to who we did start this I know we did start at once.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Tina Marie: And I don't know if that's up to date. I don't know if all the tasks.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Tina Marie: You know, are in there. Um. I don't know. Do you have.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Tina Marie: Do you just kind of look at things and be like, basically give feedback when something goes wrong or something exceptional good happens? Or do you have? These are your tasks. So this is how you're performing on a quarterly level like, what kind of structure do you have for evaluating the team?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: None.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So that would be something, Esther. I feel like you would like to have and be able to organize and.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Tina Marie: Manage well, and it would. It would help. Um.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Tina Marie: You look at things on a. Kind of a forensic level, like what what tasks are happening in the business.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tina Marie: Um! Are there any bottlenecks? Are there any places where there's friction like. Maybe the the clients are having issues patients, right?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. It just helps you really look at things on a task by task level efficiency are the cogs.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Tina Marie: Um well oiled? Are they working the way that they're supposed to. Is anything getting caught up? So on a team level.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Tina Marie: That could be really really useful. Organizing.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tina Marie: The org chart. Roles and responsibilities.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Tina Marie: A schedule for feedback, and then basically a measurement of feedback. Definitely starting with wins and ending with.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Tina Marie: Highlights with some goals, right? So that you're kind of. Sandwiching in.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Tina Marie: The the good stuff that we gotta work on this, and then kind of bring the energy back up. But.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Tina Marie: Overall based off of. The things that get done. And, Fuji, the things you do or don't have to say about what's going on.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Tina Marie: I'd say it's it's good. I think there's always just room for growth and optimization. If that's what we're here to kind of talk about.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Um. I think that the sense I got from Fuji, and just based on what you said.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Means um is that the business is. Operating. There's not a lot of problems. It sounds like day to day, you know. It's running pretty smoothly.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um some of these things like the org chart and everything. It's. It's not.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mission critical in the sense that it is not in the fact that we don't have. It is not impacting the day to day yet, but it sounds like having these things in place. Will.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Eventually sup. Only just further support the acquisitions that come in.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, and the expectations of the team. As the company continues to grow. So um.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: And plus, yeah, it just doesn't seem like there's really any. Way to have a true overview right now of how everyone's performing, except that the whole machine is just kind of running. And it's like, you know, and it's nothing like bad is happening.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Tina Marie: So let's kind of frame this, too, because, like you said, it's not mission critical. So um! Back to some of the other conversations we've had. Who who defined what the mission is, what is the mission.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: So if you say the mission is, the business survives. Right.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Tina Marie: That's a goal that's definitely. A um goal accomplished right.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Tina Marie: Is the goal, though, and this is the conversation. Fuji and I have. Build July and anything else you guys are doing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Tina Marie: Into a machine that operates with. Minimal stress.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Tina Marie: Um. And really optimal quality of life while accomplishing the goal of getting to 10 million dollars of net revenue.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Tina Marie: And that 10 million dollars of net revenue representing. Freedom to live the life that you want to. There's enough money.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Tina Marie: To invest to make money for you, so that if you couldn't work. Didn't want to work, for whatever reason.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. That you didn't have to.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tina Marie: And everything's taken care of, whether it be your parents, yourselves, your children. Anything that you want to accomplish. That's what does that.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Tina Marie: So, rather than looking at the business, as you know, pass or fail, or good or bad. Is it the vehicle.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Tina Marie: That is leveraged and optimized to get you to. That life goal, that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Tina Marie: Level of freedom, that. Allows you to do whatever you want to.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tina Marie: Um without. Having to.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Tina Marie: Do any particular thing right. So. Um to to that point. Bless you, you have cute sneeze.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Tina Marie: Um to to that point, you know. Uh, some of these some of these days get long. There are things that you have to do that you don't like to do like. There's a point where you can get to a tipping point where.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Tina Marie: Um the margins. Could be good enough and big enough that we can have an acquisition team, and Fuji doesn't really have to.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Tina Marie: Call hardly anybody, and can just do the job. There can be a time. And I don't know right? Because I haven't watched these types of businesses grow specifically enough.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Tina Marie: To to say it. You know. How much can you pull out of it and run the business from the outside and have everybody else be operating. Now, when that happens, the margins get much smaller. But.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Tina Marie: The the work that it takes is is easier to do because you can systematize a lot of it. So.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Tina Marie: To the point of the mission. Esther. What is the mission?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Tina Marie: Um? What is? What is the goal? And then.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Tina Marie: Then we get into. I gotta let this puppy out. Hang on one sec. He's just crying. Here.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Tina Marie: You can go. You go out, you going outside? No.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Tina Marie: He's gonna cry again in a minute, but anyway, um.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Can't hear him.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh, sorry!

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Tina Marie: He! So.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Tina Marie: Um defining. Just kind of like. What are the oh, kpis! Kpis.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Tina Marie: So this is something that we kind of talk about for for us. We know that some of the Kpis are. Calls out.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Tina Marie: Like outrage. There is definitely a correlation between Fuji making calls and. And people coming in, or.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Tina Marie: Um the the other firms. You know, the the brokerage that that bring you leads. So.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Tina Marie: The effort that we put into acquisition definitely has a correlation to how many visits we have. And how much money you know.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Tina Marie: That the company is making. What are the other kpis? Are there other things that we haven't? I have identified.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Tina Marie: So we're working on that in the tracker that we're talking about building and Paul's helping with, which is. Looking at.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Tina Marie: Um so. We have outbound calls.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Tina Marie: Outbound emails. And now Fuji is doing stuff in person. Um.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Tina Marie: And then. So we've got another indicator right? Fuji discovered that if somebody sends him 3 cases they're likely to keep sending cases. But is that a hard and fast rule? Because people that used to send things stop sending things? So can we find out? Is there a relationship to frequency of contact, for.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Tina Marie: Even the top performers. Right? If we. Keep handling their cases, but they don't hear from us.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Tina Marie: Do they stop sending us cases. We don't know that, but it seems like that actually could be possible. So now we're trying to reach out to the people who are sending things right. So.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Tina Marie: Um! What's the difference between acquisition and retention? Um, that's something that that we're working on.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: But again, you know, Fuji's got to do the operations of it. Um. And then you guys are parents on top of that. So.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Tina Marie: It's also a lot to keep in the mind. Um.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Tina Marie: There's lots of conversations. From what I gather, Paul's got probably lots of ideas. I would bet he's kind of chatty. Am I wrong? Is he chatty?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So that's gonna take a certain amount of time. Also, I don't think that's your favorite Fuji, because I'm a chatty girl, and I could watch your face when I go, and you just kind of.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: He does that, too, with me.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Tina Marie: Where is the point? Can we get there.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Tina Marie: That's the. I'm not knocking you either. We are who we are in our strength.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Tina Marie: But that's gotta take a certain amount of energy, too. If you're like, I gotta go do some jujitsu and just like. Hold somebody down and shut them up for a minute.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Tina Marie: Uh. Oh, it's awesome. It's okay. But I can relate to that, too, Fuji. I can't relate to that, too. You wouldn't know a couple of talk so much. But yeah.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. So.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Tina Marie: The the thing that I like to do is help people stay in their genius zone. Where do they work the best? Because almost always. That's also where they're the happiest. Um.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Tina Marie: We're usually happy because we're really good at things, but you know it's a chicken and egg kind of thing. You don't necessarily know what's first.st But they definitely have a correlation.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Tina Marie: So. He doesn't love spreadsheets, numbers, things like that, but you do it because you know that it gets you um. What you need to do.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Tina Marie: If I were to think the ideal situation, Esther, it would be you to compile all the data and organize it. And then, Fuji, get to be able to look at it and go. Oh, I understand it. I know what I need to do, bye. I'm gonna go do it. Yes, no.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because. I I think that might be.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Something closer to what he wants. Wasn't that what everyone wants?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Not have to do the nitty, gritty.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Tina Marie: No. No, some people love the nitty, gritty Fuji. They really do.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: No. Mhm.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: In fact, they hate the the every other kind of thing. Just let me be safe with the spreadsheets and the numbers, and you go do something else.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Tina Marie: Some people really love being in the library. Some people really love being out in the field. And they're very different.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean, like on the on the spreadsheet thing, even like today. Right? If if you tell me if I know who to call I I have no shame in calling. It's literally what takes me. The time is. Is like figuring out who to call. Then, like.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yup!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Then there's embarrassment. Because I'm like, I, oh, yeah, I called this person. What did I talk to them about? So then I look up my notes. I'm like, Oh, yeah, I talked to them.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Or when I was delivering donuts like those were pretty much all cold. Right? I you actually told me to call them ahead of time. I just want to actually know you told me to walk in.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yep.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: I actually did that for half the day. And then the last half of the day I started texting people and saying, Hey, I'm coming in 10 min, and that seemed to work a little bit better. But either way, like I don't mind.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Tina Marie: And you have better results.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: I I don't really mind the marketing. It's the. It's the trying to keep it straight that I can't. It's.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tina Marie: It's the mental load.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, yeah, it's not the middle. It's just like I don't document. Well, I don't remember where I documented. I have like 4 spreadsheets. That have like notes about my calls, and uh.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: So it's not like the it's really not like the calls. It's just the organizing the data that gets me.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna call that the mental load again, because if it wasn't the mental load you'd go do the stuff.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Ah, I this sounds familiar. Yeah, I I'd sit here. And just you give me a list. I will literally call like 200 people a day, or like, I'll go to La once a week and knock on doors like I have no problem doing that, but it's like the time it takes to like.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Figure out who to call who I've talked, and then sometimes I walk into a firm, and I'm like. Oh, you did send me one. And then that's embarrassing. So like, I like to kind of know, like, you know who I'm talking to. Okay, I think I I think this tracks.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: With. Kind of everything I know about how you operate in the sense that.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: For example, um in 2 mains. My practice manager.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Fuji. I need these 10 reports from you. Blah blah blah blah! And then it's like he operates really well on. A task list.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: With specific things to do. Um! You don't.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, but at the same time there, there's like a. There's a balance between um giving you too much information.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Tina Marie: Oh yes!

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's figure out what information you need to action versus what information you don't. So that's the challenge I tend to give too much. And he needs things distilled. So what if I were able to say me and Paul figure out, okay. Here are the 10 for 5 firms that you need to visit while you're in La.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Here is what you hear the important metrics or the points about them. These guys have sent you 5 people. These guys have sent you one. These guys have sent you 2. The last conversation you had with them was Xyz. This is where we stand with each one of them.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I think maybe if you had a practice manager or. Or I like it.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Someone to just manage that information for you, distill it, and just. Hand it over to you.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Then. That'll help you operate a lot more efficiently.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: Maybe.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if anybody ever watches basketball, or if they're old enough to remember the great bulls. But like.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Tina Marie: You need to be Scottie Pippen, and you need to be Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan does the dunking, and you do the assisting just.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I'll say that. Okay. He. He needs the setup right. He's he's ready to go do the work. He's got the skill, the energy, all of that stuff. But just need to be set up. So one of the things that we're talking about doing that, I bet, would do really well if you took this over.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Tina Marie: Is Fuji, those reports of, hey? So and so these are the, you know, the the call that you sent us this week. So we talked about doing it weekly, so we can stay top of mind, so we can thank them, but also be like, Hey. And so we talked about, for example, Esther. Let's say somebody sends us a client for the very 1st time.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Tina Marie: And we say, Hey, so and so we just wanted to let you know you sent us this patient last week. We got this done. This done, we got their reports done. Here's everything you need to know, right? So. Um.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Tina Marie: And and week by week. So people that sending you consistently, you're showing them, hey? This is how fast we turned around. We got all these people done on average within 24 h, 36 h. Whatever these are, the cases like this is the status of everything. So.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: This is a draft we did this morning, actually.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. Oh, awesome. So what we talked about strategically is, instead of just saying um, you know, not sending anything. If somebody didn't send us anything.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Tina Marie: Is. Replying to the message we sent the week before that said, Hey, thank you for sending this thing and sending a message that says, Hey.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Tina Marie: Last week you sent us this or like, 2 weeks ago, you sent us this. That was amazing. Is there anybody I can schedule for you today, for this, this, this or this. So.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Tina Marie: Psychologically and kind of um. Subconsciously, we're like, it's not really subconscious because it's there like, Hey, you sent us something. But then you didn't send us something, but we're here to work without saying. I don't know. Can you send me more cases.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Tina Marie: In the same kind of way. You know what I mean.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm, okay.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: But that sets him up for um. What what needs to happen? So if if you say.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Tina Marie: Basically prepare the thing. And he sends the email, or you can send the email from his account. That'd probably be even better if you don't mind doing that.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Tina Marie: Where the calls need to happen. Obviously you can't sound like Dr. Fuji Naka, but. Emails. You can text messages, you can. So I don't know if there's something that you can do.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Tina Marie: To help out with that. But what he can do is like. Obviously he has to do the medical part of it.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Tina Marie: Um the things where there's liability. You know Fuji has to do that. And then the in person. Hey, I'm I'm the guy. I'm the person, whether you're calling or in person.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Tina Marie: Because it makes people feel like, you know. Wow! He's actually taking care of this personally. Invested matters. You know that kind of thing.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Tina Marie: So anything that you can do to set. Him up for the thing that only he can do.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: I think is going to create a massive. Win.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Tina Marie: Um. Probably a lift of energy, and probably help us with momentum.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Tina Marie: As fast as possible. And I think it might satisfy some of the things that you've been looking for, Esther, because you were talking about.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tina Marie: You know, when you guys were struggling together, that struggle was kind of like your mutual purpose. And it was it felt good because you got to work together so.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Tina Marie: If the gift, if if you enjoy giving the gift of. Solving a problem together, but also making Fuji's life easier because you love him. You know.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Tina Marie: But also being valued because you get to do some of these things he doesn't want to do. You know that that might tick.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Tina Marie: All of your boxes and. Not really be a huge amount of scope, because the team can do things.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Tina Marie: None of this stuff. Has to be done.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Tina Marie: Or the business is gonna just die. So if you need to take some time off and be Mom. You can do that.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Tina Marie: If you're creating all of this structure. And doing a lot of it. And maybe you're also teaching Paul, hey, Paul, these are the things that I do. So.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Tina Marie: If I don't feel good today, and I need to like. Call you in as a pinch hitter. Can you do that?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Tina Marie: You know he can that way. You still get to have it. But you've got somebody. And and the team is able to support you. If you need time off, or you're gonna take a vacation, or whatever.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Tina Marie: Rethink.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I think I just need to. Do you know, um on that point. It sounds like what might be most helpful is just to finally put some.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: Documented organization around the business. I think um.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: I really need to deep dive into. Everything that Paul's doing. I mean, um. Fuji's got written out. Everyone's like roles and responsibilities, and you know they're just a number of bullet points and everything. Um, but I think I really need to do a deep dive into their day to day exactly what they're doing.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like, for example, the summary that Paul is putting together, if that's something that could could fall into his scope. And there's no point for me to duplicate that work either. Right? I could probably look for some. Higher level things to do to lead on, and he can be the one doing these. Um.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Weekly summaries, or whatever it is, and then come time, you know, once a month, if Fuji wants to go to La or something, then Paul, Paul and I will work together on compiling the list of clients he needs to go see. Ah! So.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Again. I don't know what I don't know until I start talking to everyone on team diving in and.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um jumping off point, I think would be. Just working off his um roles and responsibility lists.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. Putting together formal job descriptions, all shared with me a checklist.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: Of the things that everyone's supposed to be doing. Um. So I think those are good starting points for me to just start.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Diving in understanding, and then start organizing. Yeah.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Tina Marie: I would say something to think about is Fuji's been working really hard on just. Um.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Tina Marie: I don't know kind of supporting the team that supports you all. They. Enable you this lifestyle.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: Um something about their people and their culture. They're very close knit, like there's a lot of inter relationships here. Um.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Tina Marie: And. There's a lot of loyalty.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Tina Marie: A lot of hard work. They their identity is very much tied to their. Professional role.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tina Marie: Um. So.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Tina Marie: When somebody else comes in and kind of like, hey, I'm the new boss. That's how they'll feel. It doesn't matter if you say that's not what it is. Your your Fuji's wife.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Tina Marie: You automatically have power over them. And.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: What if you don't like them. What if you know there's going to be some fear automatically.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tina Marie: Just want you to be aware of that.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm. Yeah, that I understand.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Tina Marie: Um. Yes, and so I think it would be best for everyone if you proactively. 1st of all, just.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Soon.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Tina Marie: Contemplate that for a little bit.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Tina Marie: Internally. What will it feel like for these people if I come in and do anything? And I say anything? What do I want them to feel.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Tina Marie: When I come in here and do things, do I want them to feel supported. And like I'm here to help them succeed.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Tina Marie: Or do I want them to feel like. I'm here. Do what I ask you to do, because that's your job.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: You know, so you'll get the outcome that you want. Um when you set the intention to do so.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Tina Marie: And you keep that line of communication open and just kind of be humble about it. But this everything that they do, you know they're.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Tina Marie: This is not. Hiring Americans. Um, with a different if it's a different culture which you guys understand.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Tina Marie: Having a very different culture inside of a culture, right? The Asian culture inside of the American no culture.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: Ah! So just think about as you go into that. If you go into roles and responsibilities, maybe you also want to learn personalities.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Tina Marie: And ask.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Tina Marie: Fuji about them, maybe. Ask Paul like, what? What? What should I know about Mirka? What should I know about ale? What should I know about. Any of these people, you know. What are? What do they like? Um.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Tina Marie: What are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? What are they afraid of? Like. Any type of thing going into that, because if we're going to look at this as something that you're going to do long term.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: And if we're looking at July as as the vehicle that supports the Fujinaka family for a long time. And helps you to get to that $1010,000,000 net worth.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: If it is the vehicle that allows you to be with me and mare as much as you want to, and to give them everything that you want to. You need to nurture this. Right. So you have to protect it. You have to.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Tina Marie: Hope it to grow, and every person inside of it. Is, is a living part.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Tina Marie: That enables that lifestyle. And you can't separate that. That's why I take the holistic approach to business, because I've watched people separate it. And it just.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Tina Marie: Implodes. So as you're going through the measurement. And you're you're you're being analytical.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Tina Marie: Um. Just be aware that the analytical side has a habit of.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Tina Marie: Hurting people. I'm telling you, because I've been that person. Many times accidentally, because I'm just thinking.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Tina Marie: Right. I'm just doing the math. I'm just. I'm looking out for everybody, but on a logical way. And it it can create some issues.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Tina Marie: So keep keep that in mind, I would say, slower is better. Your. Here's what I want you to do is not let your boredom let you go to Gung Ho, or your desire to go. Do something. I'm not saying you're bored, but you know what I mean.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Tina Marie: Like. Be excited about what you get to do, but also be cautious about the ripples that you're sending out. Does that make sense.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it makes absolute sense. And I, I think you and I are on the same page. This is a this is something I've sort of discussed briefly with Fuji before a couple of weeks ago is that I don't want to come in. I know that once I step in.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: I have automatic power because of who I am. Um, and I don't want to anyone to feel threatened, because that's the 1st thing that you know, especially someone like Paul. Right? You know who's always who's been Fuji's right hand man this entire time. He's gonna be like, oh, what's his wife doing here now? What does that mean? Um is she gonna be my new boss? Is she? Gonna tell me what to do? But she doesn't know what we're doing like every single day. She doesn't know like.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: All the details. I you know.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. And I've been in that position, too, in my corporate life, where a new manager comes in, and we're just like. You know what's his manager doing? They don't know our job. Um!

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. And I you know I agree with you, I think sometimes for me. Uh, I like the reminder to move slow. Um. I tend to be someone who moves more slowly. I just get anxious.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because I don't want him to feel like I'm moving too slowly, and he wants something done.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Tina Marie: Wait. What's the laugh about? I I need context for this. This is an opportunity for insight for me. Doesn't.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: But she moves slowly. There's no a little bit. Slowly.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: I just move slowly. I move. I even walk slower than he does. I'm just far more, I would say, like.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Deliberate. Maybe. And I'm more like, you know, conscious.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tina Marie: You know. What's so funny is that I'm half and half of both of you, which that's my thing. If I go through all the tests or whatever. So I relate.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Wow! Yeah.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Tina Marie: To both of you. So funny.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm. Um, no, yeah. I hope so slowly that you just wanted to like, okay, we talked about this 2 weeks ago. Why are we still here?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. It's good.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: I know that look, that's exactly.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Tina Marie: I know, I know.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thinking about.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Tina Marie: You got it the whole time. That's half of my smile going poor food. It's like, are we done yet? Can we like? I'm not even doing anything.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes, um. Okay.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. I can continue the conversation with Tina. Yes, we can go do something else.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Tina Marie: Well Foods, Fuji. What! What would you like.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Tina Marie: Is there anything that if if we could say, Hey, if anybody okay, right, if you could wave a magic wand. And change something about the way that your business is.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Tina Marie: Functions whatever. It's a magic wand, but it's in the realm of possibilities, right? So.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: We can't say. You make money and nothing happens, or you can take um, you just go pull a doctor in automatically. There's there's things that could build up to it.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: So in the realm of possibilities, like, if you can, the magic wand basically gets you from here to here in a realistic. Um realm of possibilities that you know. 5 months, 6 months a year from now, if all the things went the way that they could.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Tina Marie: This is what I would love it to be. What like? What would you work towards? What does that look like for you?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Doubling the doubling. The number of visits per month.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: We're at. We're at 3 50 right now. I'd love to see 600 700 800 a a month.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so that helps to. So I love reverse engineering. I love working backwards. The 1st thing you have to do, though, before you commit to that, as the goal that you work backwards from is, what does that look like in reality.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Tina Marie: How many hours a week are you working? How much do you need? And staff like what has to happen? Logistically. For that existence to be true without imploding.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: Right, so.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm staff. I'm staffed up to do, probably at least 6, because 600 visits a month. That represents about 20. 25 to 30 visits a day. And so I'm you know. Uh, maybe with the addition of.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Someone that has to stay late uh. I'm I'm.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm staffed up essentially to handle that. The the only, the limiting factor is just the number of cases we get every day. Are we staff in terms of the pas and providers, and the hours that they can give.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, right now, we're not filling them. They're giving me more hours per week than I have patients per week. So that's why I know I can. Yeah.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Tina Marie: So the math, though, that we want to see and and the thing you have to understand is, there is a law of diminishing returns. That comes into play.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Tina Marie: And that is so. A person who's working 20 HA week.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Tina Marie: Right. Um is not going to have the same level as exhaustion or performance as a person who's working 40 HA week.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Tina Marie: So if you're saying, you know. Let's say, for example.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Tina Marie: We're working 20 HA week. We have the capacity to do 40 and then 20 HA week. We're doing 350 people, and at 40 we can do 600. You're thinking that this is just, you know.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Tina Marie: Across the line. But that's not it. This person gets more tired, makes more.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Tina Marie: Bad decisions. Um starts to get fatigued.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Tina Marie: To the level of potentially sick burnout. All kinds of things. So when you do that math, what kind of buffer is in there?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Tina Marie: What does that look like on an hourly. And not just hourly. But are they working? Every second of every day? Is there downtime.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Tina Marie: That. Day for each of your people. Once you've created the org chart really needs to be mapped out.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Tina Marie: When you look at, what would it look like if this existing staff. Doubled.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Tina Marie: The workload. Does that make sense.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. And I think that's what that's what we've set up. I mean, having miracle. Only do triage. She is not working.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: The full day like we, we know this. So that's why I know she could handle double the number of emails um, and then our scheduler. I've never had a we've we've had one full time, Scheduler. We brought on Ollie, which is double that capacity now, so I mean I could cut the other full time person and just have Ollie. We'd be fine at the current volume.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then the report delivery. Yeah, I mean that that side again. We cut Susannah so, and everything's falling under Paula.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: And uh, we can handle that at our current volume of 3 50. So I know that if we doubled the volume. The clinicians again, you know. There, we're staffed up to do 10 h of visits a day pretty much, but we're only getting.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Uh 6 and a half to 7 HA day of visits, right? So there's 3 HI know there's about 3 to 4 HA day, plus there's weekends that I've been telling them no weekends because we don't fill it. So I know we have capacity for another like 200 300 visits a month that I mean.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Tina Marie: For you guys. What you could focus on is wherever you can. Divert more time and energy towards acquisition.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Tina Marie: Whether it be researching other firms, other areas, locations like, what are the the things? Where are the levers? That you could work.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Tina Marie: To open more things up, and then spend the time there. Of those levers which one has the highest likelihood probability. Of.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Tina Marie: Giving you something back in return. So.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Tina Marie: In in one aspect. You want to diversify. Right? You want to try the different things, the different levers, whether it's um. Uh, reaching out to new people, looking at new areas, trying new tactics, new scripts, new emails, phones.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Tina Marie: Multiple approaches in person whatever. Or it's um.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Tina Marie: Just doing more of what you're already doing, and a volume, because almost everything, when it comes to sales and marketing is numbers.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Tina Marie: It's it's volume. It's a numbers game. So if. 5% conversion rate happens for all your in-person stuff. Right? The more in-person visits you have, the higher you know number of cases you have.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Tina Marie: So it's looking for what is, what is the return? What is the conversion rate of all the things? So. Getting people in for multiple sessions and treatment.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Tina Marie: Right? What is that conversion rate? What does that happen. Knowing those numbers.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Tina Marie: Keeping track of them week over week. Seeing if the patterns hold true.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Tina Marie: Um watching, changing up the scripts, the tactics, the way that you go with those things, and then spending as much time as you can, without burning out or sacrificing anything else. In those activities that bring new business in, because it is a fairly well oiled machine.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Tina Marie: Like anywhere. Oil machine, you know. There's still ongoing maintenance. But.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Tina Marie: You know you can. You can come in and you you can expand. And.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Tina Marie: So it's. Optimizing energy, protecting energy.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Tina Marie: Optimizing, time, leveraging. Time.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Tina Marie: To the highest return. Activity.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: So maybe the question I should be asking myself, and how, in terms of how I can. Help!

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: Fuji is. How does this?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thing, or this task, or whatever. How does this directly impact acquisition for us.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That. That's what. Okay?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Tina Marie: Acquisition and retention. I'll I'll.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, acquisition, conversion, retention.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Tina Marie: Yes. There you go!

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Tina Marie: That's everything.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Tina Marie: Because everything falls underneath that, because retention. Everything that happens in day-to-day operations.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Tina Marie: That's retention. Because if you're not handling your your people, your your patience, your whatever it's all covered under. There. Yes.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Tina Marie: And they're all equally important. You take your eye off of either one of those you're going to have diminished results.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Alright! That's something to to chew on. Alright.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Anything else.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Tina Marie: He's dark. You guys have dog count.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I think I'd be kind of interested just to hear what. Paul is.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Doing for you, cause he's the one who has a lot of the overview of. What's going on.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I, you know, and I just kind of think I would. I think I want to, just if anything kind of be a fly on the wall. And just see what he's doing for you. Is he? Is there more that.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Paul could be doing? Are there more numbers? Are there different perspectives that he could be giving us. Is there a tab on the spreadsheet? He can add. That'll give us Xyz insight. You know he's working for us. I don't necessarily have to go in there and do all the nitty, gritty spreadsheet work, but I can.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Maybe I can just.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Tina Marie: I have an idea.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Figure out!

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Tina Marie: Would you? What if you get to the point where all the talking that Paul does gets to go to Esther? And you just like, get the benefit of it.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, he knows now, he, when we get on a call he's like I have 3 things to talk to you about, and then he goes into it. So he's learned. I don't. I don't have that issue anymore.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but no, I don't. I don't necessarily think it's an issue. He does have ideas, and he does have insights. And the problem probably, for you would be. He probably takes a long time to get there. And maybe it's like this. Much of a little bit of a difference, whereas for you, Esther, that might be a fascinating conversation for you to have that you just want to chew on it and take your time to get there. And Paul might be happy. Now we've got to have the balance of. Is it productive? Are we getting something good out of it?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Tina Marie: But. I'm just saying there, there might actually be a way where he gets to.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: Because he's had ideas. He's brought them to you. And some of the times we've had conversations. You're like, Oh, yeah. Paul was talking about that. I guess I should let him do this.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Tina Marie: And so that might be another way. Where? We're getting more value out of him because he wants to offer it. But the gateway is long conversation with Fuji, and Fuji is like I got things to do.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, that might not be a bad idea, because that's how I learn about things. Um.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Tina Marie: What do you think?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: The reason that B. 46 operates the way it is is because. I, when I, when I built that company, I was the one who built every single process and trained every single.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like core team, and them just inundating me with their ideas and their thoughts and their struggles. And everything is really where. I got it to where it was.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. You know. So for me at least.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: I see a lot of value in the long conversations, because that's just how. I absorb. And that's how I operate.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that's how I I work best. And every time now Ollie and Paula right, my 2 managers on the other sides every time I talk to them, too. They're like, Oh, how if we do this? So they have. They have a lot of stuff they want to improve to Paula on the report side, Ollie on the scheduling side. Every time I talk to them. They're like, oh, what if we do this? Can we do this? We did this at my other company.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: So listening to them, too, you know they would. They'd have a lot. Okay.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Tina Marie: And that could be a really good in Esther like that makes them know. Hey? She's safe. She's gonna like, listen to me and respect me and. Take some of my ideas like.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Tina Marie: I mean that that could be really synergistic for everyone.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. And I think one of the ways that I could approach it with this. You know, Fuji has gotten really, really busy. Um, you know. But I want to sit down with you guys. So you guys can.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Talk to me about, you know. What are the challenges you're facing right now. You know what are the ideas that you have cause. He syncs with you, but he always is able to do that with you guys every once in a while, you know. Um.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: So maybe that's like a maybe that's like a safe. Like gentle way to sort of um.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: Tap, dip my feet into it, and let them get comfortable with talking to me.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Tina Marie: I think, too, that it fits really well, and I think this is a good kind of segue to. To wrap it up.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Tina Marie: Is that from what I've learned about you so far, Esther. Is, that.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Tina Marie: And this goes to what Fuji calls slow. But there's a slow start, but then there's maintenance and solid. So your company that you built is a testament to the fact that. There is value in that slowness and those long conversations, and taking everything in and you distilling it.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Tina Marie: Because what you created then, is this like refined. Alloy metal. Basically right? You combined all these things and made it into something special. But it runs itself.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Tina Marie: And the way that I think it. Also adds to this synergy of what's happening is that.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Tina Marie: You know, if you came in, and you just started doing all kinds of things, no matter what you tell them. It's going to be disruptive and scary, no matter what. But if you do what I think you do best, which is, just, have lots of conversations, and then go back, and you kind of.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Tina Marie: Ponder and document, and write things down, and then come back and have another conversation. It will be slow.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Tina Marie: But it is the kind of thing that. Has that cumulative growing power.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Tina Marie: So it's growing at a rate that's sustainable. But there is steady momentum, and you know it's that question. If you ask somebody, hey? Would you rather me give you a million dollars or a penny, doubled every day for a month.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Tina Marie: You. You know that one I'm talking about. The the penny doubled every day for a month ends up being multiple like it's it's more than a million dollars. So it's like 10 million, or something like that.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: Compounding.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Tina Marie: Yes, compounding is the thing, but compounding, starting small. Compounding, starting so small it seems worthless.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Mhm.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Tina Marie: It seems um almost imperceptible, like Fuji. If we were to go back to day one. You do have some kind of like Aha! Moments, and I think everybody does. But there's nothing that I ever do with anybody.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Tina Marie: That is like. Wow! Whiz! Bang! Huge like this is.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Tina Marie: So amazing. We've implemented this new system. Nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever seen this before. Blah, blah, blah! It's just basic stuff. Basic conversations, doing the things we already knew that we should do, but finding a way to be able to do it consistently.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Tina Marie: And not hate it so much. There is nothing truly amazing.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Tina Marie: Other than. The small and simple things consistently.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Tina Marie: Having this compounding effect that is so subtle it's almost imperceptible. Until you go look at the numbers and go. What. Just happened.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it's often the most unsexy things that are. Um.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Tina Marie: It's always the most unsexy things.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: That. The get you where you are. Okay. I think this is good. Alright, I've got a starting off point. Um.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Now, I just didn't really want to make any moves, really, until. We talked to you, and we were on kind of the same page.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: And um. Yeah, okay.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Yes.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Tina Marie: You guys are logged in.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Tina Marie: All right. Well, as always, you know how to reach me. If you have questions I will be looking forward to. The Esther, distilled it into a few pages of.

Michael Fujinaka: All right.

Tina Marie: It helps me be able to see the way that you're thinking in that order and structure. All right, we will let you guys go.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh! Thank you.

Tina Marie: Or to go wrestle something and like lock it down in a hold.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. I had to make some calls. Okay.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Tina Marie: What? Oh, that sucks, I mean, that's wonderful. Go! Foods have fun.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's easy. Now, yeah. You got used to talking to people.
