00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello friends, how are you? still have sick child. Yeah, she has to go to her dad's for the weekend, so I didn't get to mama and take care of her and give her other biddies so she'd get better. How are you guys?
00:00:32 - Patrick Shahverdian
So good.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
Mm hmm.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, was new. It's good guys. Take me.
00:00:46 - Patrick Shahverdian
We're at 600 something K and settlements for the month so far.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Put my chair. Good job. I mean, things are, you know, going as they, as they should, good, come with some more detail than that. Come on. You know how much Mark pays me to meet with you, but for today, it's a skin in the game. Let's go.
00:01:22 - Patrick Shahverdian
I mean, it's just things are going as it's supposed to be like treatment is being done, getting a lot of policy limits, so that means the clients are willing to get the treatment that they need, which requires, you know, case managers to sometimes push them to get that treatment or explaining why we want them to get that treatment, which is good. And then, you know, obviously we got one big case, but that doesn't I mean, that thing slowed down. So I made sure to tell the team, firstly, I just ignore that it even gets settled. just try to act like we don't have. So we don't rely on that big one for the month, but yeah, trying to get to a million, but I don't know if we'll go in there.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the 15th path. We can do it. I believe in you.
00:02:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you doing, Lorenz? Pretty good. Not having as good of a month as Patrick, obviously. But I'm actually pretty excited because a lot of those big cases I've been working on for the last year are either demanded or we're drafting a demand, or they're going to be ready in the next few weeks here to demand. So I'm going to start hitting some big ones here soon. So I'm excited about that. Obviously, the extended vacations everyone is taking is requiring some organization skills. Thankfully, Mary took pity on me and sent me Karen, who is a, we just hired her, think a month ago or something, but she's an experienced case manager. spoke with her today. We're going to be using her for as long as Mary will let us have her. So she's going to be sliding in to whichever team has a missing member at an given point, but I can definitely use her.
00:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So let me open. I have a setting up a meeting so We have a guy that's been helping us with Lidify reports. When I started working with Mark, every time I would ask, where do we get this? We're, I don't know, there'll be a pain in there to get, like, I don't care, do it anyway. Anyway, so we found somebody who can help get us the data that we want and organize it. And it is a pain because Lidify is not intuitive is much money as goes into that. And as many people have their business on it, you would think they would do a better job, but no. Not optimized offers, I don't think. Yeah. So, but we're, we found a guy and he does a really good job at things. But now the process of getting the reports is kind of convoluted. so I need to get on a call with him and with Mark, which we're working on scheduling. So that we can. Get all the reports that way that I want them, including one for you guys, just to go look at that. Has the data that you should be looking at. I haven't looked at this yet today because I have a second. My baby is almost 15. And my oldest is about to be 24. One of my looking for Tina to bring together. Tina girl. It's not so smart sometimes. tell me. Reports. It's free. As for it. There it is. It's because I minimized my thing. Do you manage my team? What I want? Look at some numbers. Oh, yeah. And. I think. Mark told me that all of this isn't accurate, but it was close. What am I looking at? For October, it was this month. Refresh. Yeah, because what I see for you, Patrick, yeah, this can't be right, is, well, gross attorney fees by team for you would be 65,000. That's not right, right?
00:06:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
It's like an average?
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, gross for October.
00:06:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, Mark posted higher numbers yesterday.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this report is definitely not correct.
00:06:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Sometimes he'll put three six.
00:06:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so that's Right then, 65, 1, 6, 6, I have 0.4, but in the rounds I have 69,000 gross attorney fees.
00:07:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Should be, well, I got another 20 last night, so it should be a little higher than that.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Depending on when the report updates might not show up. So, like, if Salesforce is on East Coast time, then 9 o'clock last night would have been cut off for the report for today. Or yesterday. I don't know how it cuts off anyway. Anyway, okay. So, now your gross attorney fee, what is, is that target?
00:08:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
Exactly.
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh.
00:08:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
I think the gold a million.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the gross attorney fees for the month. Yeah. I know that number, but that's that's I don't even know how. Um, is that all together? Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. makes more sense. It was like these numbers don't make sense with that. All right. Um. Yeah. The other thing is we've got leads have been dropping like crazy. We're.
00:08:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Thank you Mark yesterday in Arizona.
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super slow right now. Oh, where's my Monday report? What day do go? The, the, I mean, California is super slow. We've only had four for California as a Monday, seven for Arizona, 11 for Washington, six for New Mexico. So Arizona is not slow compared to what else is happening right now. Washington is saving us. And at one point, and this is where knowing the numbers really comes in, Mark was just going to not do Washington at all. And then we went and crunch numbers in his way. And he was like, oh, that's not what I thought. So we get numbers for a reason and we track things for a reason. All right, so what I want to do today, the first thing I need is an update on reports. I need to know how you guys have been reviewing your cases for our conversation. Don't all speak up once now, calm down.
00:10:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, I mean, I started doing three review meetings a week, like we said. We're on pace, we haven't finished the full year since we switched to that, the full case list since we switched to that, but we're on pace to do two reviews per case every month.
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two reviews per case every month?
00:10:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's every other week, we review each case every other week.
00:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you will get through your entire case load twice a month.
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. All right. So I would like you. This is an assignment for both of you. I want you to keep a log. We can put it in a Google Doc, a shared Google Doc. And I want you to modify it. Let's just start it right now. File new document. All right. Week of, we'll say, 10, 14. I'm going to share my screen real quick. Shouldn't I open the Zoom now so I can do that? Levantage away.
00:12:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's okay. She's going to start doing a stereo interactions next week. I was her mindset and energy going through all that. She wasn't too on board that night. She spoke with a doctor and she's eager to get going.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep her in the prayers. I'm going to update that tempo roll for you. Let's see. Okay, I, my brain just went out the door for a minute and it was with the birdies chirping. Okay, we're at 1014. So update on case to cover all cases. So this this is zoom gets in my way. I'll just tell you with all those little things here. What I'm thinking, what I would like you guys to do is just so with the increase case review and the increase effort on looking at your operations. I want you consciously in the morning, every day, be thinking about. In the way that you're looking, so there's doing your work and then there's looking at your work, right? And I know that you guys are looking at it and kind of evaluating it and figuring out like, Patrick, I know that one of your thoughts is, how do we get to higher numbers, right? How do I be top dog? So the answer to that is always going to be operations. It's good, right? So you're having those thoughts. What I want you guys to keep track of every week is let me know what you've noticed two parts, what you could and should be doing operationally to improve things and results that you notice from things that you have started doing. Because when you come to the call, I have to extract that and most of that extraction process takes up the majority of the call where. as if you're taking note of it real time as it happens as you see it, then our calls will become more effective and then we can take that information and use that strategically, which is tapping more into my power and which is a better use of Mark's investment in our time together. So I need you every day to just be looking at it, just every time you're looking at things. If something, if you notice it, I want you to go, you know what? I'm going to write that down so I can bring that back to Tina as a, that's a win or something we should work on or whatever, okay? Is this one o'clock meeting time just too close to after lunch? y'all just like...
00:15:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now I think we're with both Patrick and I are introverts and so it's hard to get information out of us. We're just...
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, whatever. I'm just going to take it personally. Don't like me.
00:16:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So whatever.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not fishing for compliments. I'm fishing for energy, but it's okay. Um, okay.
00:16:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
want to get a hard time getting things out of me.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I am an ambiver. So like, I perk up when I'm around people that I like and I'm engaged with. But then afterwards, I don't want to talk to anybody for like hours at all. Like play my game or go to the gym or like do something that doesn't involve talking to people. I really love it, but also it drains the crap out of me. And so like I'll go to church and I'm all, no, whole time. And then people are like want to talk or call or something afterwards. And I will literally look at the phone and go go away. You never really like them. I'll be in the grocery store and somebody I really We love it there, and I'm like, oh, just like, no, bye. Anyway, okay, so when does that get it? Anyway, I have a job to do here, so I have to extract the things. So let's go to this, this is a little, I was wanting to work on, that's not the right one. Okay, so remember this that we was working on? Do, do, do, do, Yeah, we're breaking things down. So first, talk to me and let me know, we'll start with you Lorenz, has this popped into your head at all as to like these other things that have to happen and just talk to me about if any thoughts have come to you about the conversation we've had around this. And if it hasn't, that's okay. Yeah. it has.
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, you know, a couple of things have come to mind, especially, you know, it's always stressful when the CM takes a couple of weeks off, because we have to reshuffle the teens, but it also provides an opportunity to see what's falling through the cracks and what, where our blind spots are. And so, taking on some of Jessica's case load, I've noticed there's a couple of things that are not getting done. And so, I'm actually, I had a brainstorm session with Mike today, and we're looking at maybe having a sort of flowchart based on this spreadsheet right here, and have maybe as simplified the process to where, you know, it's like a decision tree or something.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If he doesn't have a very high rating, sorry, carry on.
00:19:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Another thing we noticed is that we review cases and assign tasks, but it seems like those tasks get lost into the ether. I write them down in the file review section of the case, but unless I know which we talked about last time, sometimes those tasks fall through the cracks. And so John and Viri and I have been experimenting with the task workflow on Slack to see what we can do. We're still tinkering with it, but I'm thinking about rolling it out, team-wide. And that would keep the tasks alive, so to speak. They wouldn't be just tucked away into the case file.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that workloads are very good. There's this, and then I wonder if there's a slack workflow integration. So slack has a new thing. Do you use, like they have notes and almost like a project management kind of built into it? you have you seen that?
00:20:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is it? No, I haven't played around. I've been, since last week, I've been working really heavily on the $6 million demand. so I haven't had a ton of time to work with slack and the ideas that I've had. haven't had a ton of time to implement them, but that's the demand was sent last night. So I'm going to start tinkering around with it. Is that have you played around with it?
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so I don't use it a ton. I mostly use it. check things out at a workflow. Create a workflow. I have not used workflows on any of that work. Choose an event. So, like, you could go through the whole list of things that we have. Now, keep in mind that when you're innovating, generally, you're going to have rework. You're to do it again and again. Almost always, when you're creating a new system, it's not going to be great out of the gate. Sometimes it will create more problems than it solves. So, you want to fix that as quickly as possible. The best system is the one that gets used.
00:21:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, right, I want to be kind of, you know, idiot-proof. I'm not, you know, I'm using the expression, not calling my team idiots.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, Oh, yeah. Well, also, we've talked about mental load before, right? So the system should reduce mental load. Basically, sometimes all you might need to start with would be a flow chart, because what can help with the mental load is the visual of this is the checklist, or even just this. There's a checklist. So creating something that's just kind of literally like boxes right here, right? Where check it, is it done for this case? I don't know how you structure and organize everything and how you have it and letify. And that's the problem, is that there isn't that kind of function built into Linify. And like Mark, so many different clients were like there, they try to get away from using spreadsheet. But because it feels like we work, right? We've already got all the data and solidify, but it's not when you can do certain types of functions and those functions reduce human error and things falling through the cracks. So there are also, and these are things that as we're thinking about it, because I've never had this thought before, so I'm glad that you brought that to the table, things like Zapier, which is, it's an automation integration with workflows and it's almost an if this, then that kind of thing. So let's say we get a new case and the case comes in and so then Zapier could go say, okay, mail it to whoever and then check and automatically follow up every two days. Did you do this? Did you do this? this? And so it creates a reporting system, never thought.
00:24:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I was looking when I first got hired here. was looking for something similar to that.
00:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I couldn't find any free service. It's not free.
00:24:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not compared for it.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:24:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and he loves automation actually, and he loves smarter stuff, and it's not expensive. And what we potentially might get into is hip butt or just like privacy and compliance type issues. So that's a conversation. But it's a meeting with him and Chona tomorrow night. I have a habit of forgetting things. I'm just going to. Email. You know what, I'm going email him. just told him I might need to go talk about this. And I want to talk to you about the questions for an idea about the runtime. This is just so I don't forget. I had to remember which words had already come out of my brain and into the message. That's how special it might be. Okay, so I like where you're going with that. I think the first step would definitely be just having the team have something like this look at it. So you can copy this. And this is shared with you, right?
00:25:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. You copy this and just show them, hey, this is in modify, you know, anything you want them, don't want them.
00:26:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
see whatever and just go like okay so you how do tasks get delegated does it just come in and people know and they grab it or do you use make assignments yeah so a couple of ways either through your case I say okay this needs to get done this needs to get done who's doing this who's doing that and they usually you know say okay I will do this and I say okay can we get this done within the next three days and then I write in the file review okay you say then though like is it a specific person or you just put it to the team like if I'm talking to Mike and Jess and a case we need some hospital records. We need to follow up on hospital records. Usually that'll be Mike's department. And so I'll say, you know, hey, Mike, can you get this done for the next three days? And I'll put on the file review, needs hospital records, Mike, by this day, and then I'll initial and date it.
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me see if this is the right one or if it's a list. feel like it might be a list. But, um, well, I don't want to do it in here because she is in there. I'm just creating a new channel. Hi, Canvas. For templates. You Okay, ours might work. Let's do okay ours and see what we get here. I mean, you could completely rework this or create one from scratch, but they have, I like these also, the lists, you should explore this. So these are just basically tasks, follow up with whatever case, lot, whatever, and then assign a person to it, open item, you can put the status, you can put the date that it's due. And I imagine the workflows could kind of work like this, but If that is something that we could explore, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this because I love that you have this idea, how interested would you be in going Canvas and workflows? Do you enjoy that stuff at all?
00:29:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, depending on the length, I don't want to sit through a 45 minute video. No.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
somebody can't explain it in five minutes, I bounce anyway.
00:29:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to get an overall concept where you're like, okay, I can see a little bit about how to do this. I mean, if you're good at finding somebody, um, good at a chat GPT. Hey, my guy.
00:30:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They have pretty good, you know, solution driven, uh, response. I don't love them for drafting, like, things, but as far as the technical solutions.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, with two case managers and a, and a little assistance, we get approximately, we have approximately, how many cases do have?
00:30:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, two, thirty-ish.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We get approximately how many new ones a month, like six, no, ten, how many.
00:31:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'll you in a second, I'll just look at September, I'll look at September.
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The last Now, because this month we only got five so far. That's our do you ever use chat GPT?
00:34:06 - Patrick Shahverdian
I've never used it before.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we will break it down right now. Good question. Okay. Task assignment. How are tasks currently assigned to your team members? there specific categories of tasks you'd like to automate? Currently they are assigned manually through. I should say tasks specifically because. Are there specific categories of tasks that you'd like to automate? do you have a standard set of tasks that can be templated?
00:34:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not yet.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we have this right I'm actually so I'm gonna do this one and drag it down No dummy Why did you be too? Whoa, it just happened Copy and pasting from Excel can be You Let's see, due dates, prior shows, do you have an existing system for setting up due dates, due date, systems, non-existent, really, just effectively, we don't have a super structured, you check, you look kind of thing.
00:36:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm the structure system.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Prioritization, how flexible are these deadlines? Okay, so I do have target timelines for how long tasks should take as well. As as order. of past dependencies, and minimum contacts from, will say, maximum, um, and between contacting clients, and then if you don't talk to them, when else, Patrick? If you've gone or you just dipped up on your video, because you should be paying attention to this also, I mean, if we don't talk to them with, I see a chap or something, sorry, need to take this call, okay cool. If we don't talk to them within a certain amount of time, we need to follow up with them. Okay. Tracking a reminder, if you prefer Slack to handle reminders, or do notifications automatically, would you like to manually set custom reminders for each task or their specific intervals? It wants to set the reminder, timeline frequency, parameters, and then have it be automatic via Slack there. What key performance indicators would you like to see in the reports? Keep the eyes. On track back. That's about it. How many days over. do would also be good. Want to improve the overall speed. Closing cases, Instagrams with other tools, no other tools integrated. Actually, we use a program called Lidify. Right? She's a sales force. I want to track clients. Automation scope. Do you want to automate the creation of recording tasks? I want to use as much automation. As is prudent to accomplish my goals without over complicating the process or creating too much dependency on tech. The goal is save mental workload and time. And improve speed of case resolution. We have answered all the questions.
00:40:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good thing for a minute.
00:40:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You hope.
00:40:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I hope I hope the reason he has to take that call is because he's getting that 500,000. I'll see.
00:40:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now. State Farm being a B.
00:40:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
State Farm being state farm.
00:40:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now that adjusters. running from you know They used to call me every day when I wasn't ready to like present the case and now that I'm ready.
00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't answer the phone Task on it it deals very art of warish. You'd be like, have you ever every day Every single day Did it get it? Okay Task templates we can set up reusable templates for each of the 20 main tasks you had on the case This will allow you to quickly assign tasks for team members with predefined due dates and reminders Task dependencies Incorporate task dependencies to ensure certain because like you've got and I'm sure you know what task dependencies are But some of these can't be done until other ones are done. That's the task dependency So just just a rule in the same page Setting up automated reminders to find standard timelines for each task category or to police report two days prepare demand letter Look at this. I already like using our step and put in and in here, KPIs because we already did this, this is the thing about compounding how step builds upon things, right? So having clear definition and putting the tasks with accurate language in there has led to you having that brainstorm and us doing this. Everything that you do feeds the next thing that you do. Like one of these days we're going to get to the point where Mark's going to be like, holy crap, what just happened to the scene? Watch me. Watch, watch you. Watch y'all. Let's go. Okay. Define standard timelines. already did that right. So KPI monitoring reporting, basic reports, which is all I expected. Use Slack integrations or other reporting tools to show the status and trust tasks on track, off track. Overdo monitoring, automate alerts, that's to do that integration with notify tracks, key client case, and see if it can connect with Slack. don't know. We should have known that already. So if it doesn't know, it has some plates. Would you want these templates to include pre-set due dates based on typical case timelines? Oh, we're going to refresh this because it broke. I'm good for breaking chat due to day two.
00:43:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you have a paid version or the free version?
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boy, please, do I look like the free person? Whatever is available, I'm getting it when it comes to technology, because, yeah, my guy, though, he's so funny. He knows I love tech, so I was, I don't remember where I think I was in Vegas, and I went there and he rented a car for me, and I don't even remember what it was, but it was super high tech. And he's like, yeah, because I know you love technology, yeah, do you understand learning curves? I'm like, I don't know how to use this car. It's cool. But I just want to get where I'm supposed to go right now, like, you're like, yeah, anyway, you can just like. I don't want to take on a person. I mean, you can't even give me time to play. Okay, create task templates, develop reusable, a more of direct, blah, blah, Automation triggers. Yeah. Okay. And wait, oh, you're asking me questions. Why? That's too much work. Um, so I don't want to answer any more questions. Um, what can you do to give me something I can do to slack, to get going right now. This is how Tina operates. What's the shortcut, homie? I need it.
00:44:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is the workflow builder. Click create. Set a trigger to the triggers.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have anybody? Do either of you have anybody that's nerdy that would like to, like, play with this and set this up?
00:44:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, Isaac.

Isaac. Isn't Isaac like on paternity leads?
00:45:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, is he already?
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:45:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know he's going on paternity leads. Are we gonna get a set?
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think part two. Yeah. I don't. I don't. That's not the easiest role to fill. Mark still calls him Noren sometimes and Noren was the dude before Isaac. So I'm like, stop that.
00:45:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's so rude. It's a such a nice guy too.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to tell Mark to behave himself multiple times a day. So he's like, no, I'm like, did your last name is sweet? Just try it. No. All right. Um, it's good thing he tolerates me. Go to work. I don't want to do that. Yeah. So we need somebody. So explore Zapier and Salesforce integration tools. So I don't think that exists. Just starting with Slack, using the workflows as and the reminders should be a really, really good start. So showing your teams, okay, really keep in mind and frame this with your teams, look. And I love to start with a question. Do like, and everybody gets paid differently and their incentivize differently, but like, you would ask them like, how do you feel about our monthly goals? That's very open-ended. And they'd be like, what do you mean? How do you feel about our monthly goals? It's okay. They can be uncomfortable. You can just sit there and stare at them until they give you an answer. Be okay with that. It's okay. Don't leave the question, just let them. And they'd be like, you know, they don't say anything. So then the next question can be, do you want to help the team hit the monthly goals? How important is that to you? Now watch them. Be honest. video call or be in the office with them because their face will tell you the real answer. If they are like, you know, make that little micro expression of just like confusion if they're level dot, like they don't immediately say, obviously I want to do it, right? Then they're like, man, you need to know that. You need to know that. Okay, because if that's not incentivizing them, but then you need to come at it from another angle, like, knowing that hitting our goals is a requirement for all of us to have job security. How interested are you in hitting our goals in order to not have to worry about having another job? Now, frame that the way you need to by the person that you're talking to, okay, don't use my language. But
00:48:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That sounds very threatening, like inspired.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, okay, that's what I'm telling you. Look, I don't have the time to think pretty. know you guys can do better. Don't talk like me or people will hate you and be scared about your jobs. They're jobs. Okay, so don't do that. Yeah, anyway, I'll ask GPT before I have please reward my my this sentence so that people don't feel threatened with their jobs, but Here's the thing though, they're grown-ups and you have to realize that your metrics matter and your ability to hit the goals matter. They're not random goals. There are profit margins involved in the business. The goals are set based on the profit margins. Okay, a lot of money is spent on marketing and a lot of money and excessive amount of money is spent on incentive program. It is not super- for profitable this model that's here. these goals are very important. Now, the goals, if everybody is rowing in the same direction in the boat, we get there faster and better, right? Yeah. So you, I'm giving you the overall conversation that needs to happen. You have to finesse it with your people. Don't be like, Tina said to do this and I'm like, everybody wants to quit and they're scared blah, I'm not, no, I have a recording. I did not say just go, don't do it. But you want to read them. You want to have a conversation and read them and know how interested they are in hitting the goals and making things work well. Now, if that angle doesn't work, the other angle is, you know, how much would you like to see things go smoother without really having to put more effort into it? How would you like to kind of just reduce them, the mental load of the... the job but still get things done and it's a little bit easier. Most of people would say yes. The reason that's important is because in the beginning this is going to seem like more like a pain in the butt. Systems and organization take setup and they take getting used to. Old dogs, new tricks, that kind of thing. People just tend to not want to do it. So you want to frame it with ultimately this is going to make less work, less stress, easier to get to the goal line without sitting there going wait what should I be doing. You'll know exactly what you should be doing when and why and how you're doing. But also when somebody is sick and when somebody is not there, everything's already assigned. You've also got historical data about what's been done and how much has been done. It will help you with reviewing your team in a good way. It's saying like, man, you've been doing awesome. All these tasks, because I've been done on time. And then you'll also be able to look at, because you can go and alitify and see, you know, what's the average days to close, or resolution, and give them that and go look at that. This is improving. Patrick, you're still new, but, you know, you'll be able to look at that and just know what your targets are from the beginning once you start separating and having your own cases, not any mixed with Mark, whatever. Like, your day is kind of dirty in the beginning, but it'll be really good. So, but in order to get people to not be negative and go, you know, talk, and also the other thing that you should tell them, like if you've got problems with the issue, you need to bring it to me, but what's not okay is to go murmuring around and being negative about these things. So. So yes, it's new. The point of it is to make the job easier, easier as for to cover each other when somebody's out, and less like trying to keep track of everything in our head and just kind of see how we're doing. Like unless you're the kind of person that just like, hope somebody's looking at your work, then you're probably in the wrong firm because that's not how many things here. So anyway, I think you guys should have that conversation and then we should find somebody and it could be one of you guys, it shouldn't be that hard. Or we can set our next conversation next Tuesday and we can go into Slack and walk through this and do it together, set it up in one account. then if we can duplicate it to another one, like maybe create, I don't know, new channels. I don't know how it would have to go. We'll figure that out as we do it. But worst case scenario, if you don't have anybody that you can deputize, you'd be interested in doing doing this. And Isaac, if Isaac is around and he would like to do it, that'd be awesome. Especially because he can, he can share that with Mark and go back and forth there. But this is a great idea. This is a perfect follow up with this conversation that we had. And really could lead to really, like I said, reduce mental load. Because you're visually going, this is where everything stands. And automatic reminders and follow-ups. You don't have to sit there and follow up with your team constantly. Slack is doing it for you. And then you get to see, well, are they doing what they're supposed to? Are they checking it? Now, the other thing that will happen is Slack notifications are going to increase. So that can overwhelm some people.
00:53:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That is the one thing I want to be careful with because we did have let-ify notifications. When I first came in, every time we open the case, let-ify- And I think it was like 22 different emails for tasks that needed to be done for case opening. And so every single case was 22 emails.
00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so eventually, no one even looked down. Right. So you can modify how the notifications work so that either they can disable notifications on there and just manually go in and check their stuff. You can do it so that it's push notifications, but not email notifications email notifications, but not push notifications. There's all kinds of different ways you can set it up and on the on the company level, but as well as like in the way that you structure the reminders and the alerts as well as the way that your people have it. So how they get notified is totally up to them as long as the job. gets done. If they're not getting the job done, then it's an issue, right? And also, all of these tasks already exist, like mentally, these notifications should be happening anyway, like, hey, you got to do this, hey, you got to do this. This is the nature of the job. There is a lot to do, a lot of cases, a lot of clients, a lot of tasks within it. So the reality is this already exists. If their preference is, I don't want to see it because it's too much, you know, that's a problem because this is the job. So that's another way to look at it. Now, you can have it set so that maybe you only get pinged if something's overdue or maybe you only get pinged one time per case or whatever. I don't know how it works. Again, we'll have to modify it and you can let people know that. Meantime, if they're getting overwhelmed, they can snooze their notifications with Slack, and they can just go in and check under their little red alert tab, right? they've got going on. This will be, so the goal is to work through the system as quickly as possible. So all the feedback that you get, like having them, I give you actual real feedback, not complaints, right? like, not this sucks. Okay, this sucks. What's a better alternative that you can think of? You bring a problem to the table, always also bring a potential solution. Okay, you can bring all the problems you want to, as long as you also bring a potential solution. Otherwise, it's just complaining, and anybody got time for that? Yeah, I told you all this one of them about that already. Yeah, anyway, you ain't trying to solve the problem. You just the problem, and I ain't got time for problems. Now you got to go. I just spent some time in the ghetto every now and And then it comes out, and my girls like to tell me about it. They don't even know how much I hold back. Like legit, get it. Like I go on to English class, and my friends are like, yo, check this out. He's got a nine millimeter right here. I'm like.
00:57:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What?
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was my life. Like I had a friend, as soon as I moved out of there, she got shot in the head by some gangsters because they were just out hanging around. And these guys from Houston, they were bad news. And then a few weeks later, another one of my friends, who was like, he was a star people, basketball, phenom, and like on a role student. And he's in prison for life because these guys shot somebody and said, you're going to take the blame for it. And if you tell anybody, we'll kill your whole family. So nobody ever said anything. That was a fun couple of years.
00:57:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so if you see some crazy, crazy. Come out. It's real.
00:58:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're not coming out.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
God put me where I needed to be so I could understand what I need to understand. And whatever. That's all it is. But every now and it comes out. So yeah. Anyway, um, this is great. Uh, Patrick, um, really do need you to calm down like I can't handle energy. What are you really impressed with this GBT thing? Well, that's what I was going to ask you like, what do you what do you think about this? Like, what's I know you're always thinking and I know you're engaged, but I would love to know just kind of your thoughts about today's conversation.
00:58:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, um, I do know like, let's say we have like these, I don't know, 15 things that need to happen throughout a case. Like, it's like a kind of seesaw like this part of it starts to fall off and we remind the team.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and make sure we need to do this and then that that's being done like perfectly and then the other side like the basic stuff starts to like get missed so it's like I don't know if it's something about you know being able to see it in order for them to not forget but it will help it will help a lot so one of the things that I think that whoa actually meeting myself um that we might do and again please frame this with your team and let them know that this is a work in progress that there is this is going to be probably really clunky in the beginning and maybe more of a pain than it seems like it's worth but if they will stick with it we will make a system that works well for everybody and it makes at least some improvement for everybody and from everybody's perspective if we're wrong about that you got a person that probably ought to go because really it should be something that everyone can get benefit from. The only reason that wouldn't be is one if they're just that negative or two, they don't contribute to developing the system. Meaning they've made suggestions, they've explained with some kind of articulate eloquence why something doesn't work, so we can figure out a workaround. But at the end of the day, things are falling through the cracks and not getting done the most efficiently possible. The goal is not perfection, the goal is progress, but progress doesn't continue to come without being intentional about it. You can't just show up and be like, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I do. Progress comes from strategically planning how to improve doing what you do, right? So that's what this is about. So to that point, Patrick, one of the. things that theoretically, because I've not used Slack like this, I have used lots of other project management suites. But I don't want to create a new application that you guys have to log into. So I love the Slack idea, Lauren, by the way, good job. And I love you, Brad, chat to me too. I was like, I just know you got to do that. I'm such a nerdy girl. literally be talking to chat to you in the middle like, okay, how do you write this? How do you figure out this? I had an hour session with my 14 year old daughter trying to plan her career because she's like, what's a good place that they have lots of pets, but not a lot of vets, because she wants to be vet. So we talked to chat TBT and it's like Aurora, Colorado, and then we were off to the races for like an hour. Anyway, hang on, Lauren, real quick. So, Patrick, what we should be able to get is notice a pattern like, like you just said, right? If we start doing this, then this dips off. We start doing this and this dips off. What you'll probably find is that just paying attention to things, so just thinking about how different operations have been for you guys just because you thought about it differently. We had conversations, it stuck in your head, it popped into your head throughout the week, you're like, oh, you know what? I'm going to go do this. That's what will happen with your team too. They're like, there's just something changes as soon as you create awareness. So there's the level of awareness of just, oh yeah, like that's a lot of stuff that has to happen in the case, and it has to happen with every case. And there's kind of like a timeline that has to happen, and then when you add in the fact that you're looking at your cases and Lorenz you're like, or either one of you like, hey, it's been three weeks, nobody's checked in to see and make sure, you know, client didn't die. Everything's okay. We've still got a number. that works. All, you know what I mean? Like, once a week, at least are hearing from us, Hey, we're just checking on you, letting you know where we're at. You know, nothing has really changed, but wanted you to know we're here, we're working for you. That kind of thing. You're doing that. Your whole team needs to do that. So the more visuals we have here, right, the more structure that they're looking at, if they can see the tasks and slack, if they can see the outline of these or all the things that have to happen, instead of trying to keep it in their head every day going, wait, what do we need to do? Like, did somebody leave me the correct notes about what I need to do next? Do I already know what I need to do next instead of sitting there for two or three minutes ago? Oh, yeah. The next thing is, out of those two or three minutes over a week, over each person, over a month, over a year, we're talking tens of hours at the very least that we're saving doing this. And that's on your best day. Sometimes people going to show up with a migraine, you got women sometimes are going be cramping. Sometimes and somebody's gonna be hurting, depressed, whatever, all kinds of things, right? The mental lag time multiplies at times like that. So this mitigates some of just the humanness and the weakness that we have. And but also really helps everyone to see how is the whole case flow doing, even if I'm not the one doing it. And again, if somebody's like all of a sudden, I'm gonna be out for two months. Well, what has Mike been handling? What's been Mike been on top of? like, look at all those mics. I got to give that to somebody else. Holy crap, know, like Lauren's you're going through this stuff right now. So it's a process, you get some insight with the insight comes some improvement. And also with the insight comes more burden to an extent because now you have a new awareness that, oh, we're actually to not doing so great on this. But overall, it creates lifts, it creates traction. And as you've seen, Patrick, now with chat GBT, you'll notice one of the things that we improve a lot is just the mental effort. We're reducing the mental load and leveraging the mental effort. Chat GBT, if we can use Slack, so you're not having to manually remind everybody, chat GBT, helping us strategically plan it. It's not real AI. It's just logic. If this, then not. It's got a database of questions to ask, but for the most part, the output is equivalent to the input. So if we ask it really good questions and logic, it's not going to come up with anything we couldn't have done ourselves most of the time, but it will get there much faster so that we can process the next question, the next step, and so on. And so, anyway. But At the end of it comes, your cases get done faster. More reliably, we should be seeing better incentive pay. also within, so timeline, roughly 90 days. It's going to be a pain in the butt for roughly 90 days. The first 90 days are lots of growing pains. It takes about 90 days to work out and create the first iteration of a sick, the first successful iteration of a project management system with a small team. I'd say 45 to 90 days. Okay, so bear that in mind. Think about whatever is important to your team, especially that this is going to help us a lot when somebody's not available or the team changes or you're just having a rough day and we can't keep track of everything. thing. The goal of this is not micromanagement. The goal of this is not to create more work. So ask them to have a little faith and try to be part of the team making the process better. Okay.
01:07:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sounds good.
01:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good luck with those conversations. And then the notes. didn't share this with you. I need to share this with you. Where did it go? Which, which, I don't know where I put it, where the crap. That was on it. Oh, was it here? Yes. Okay. Share. What are you guys going to do? What's that?
01:07:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Noted like things that we noticed that are good or bad during our reviews.
01:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not just our reviews, but anything throughout that we Like, hey, this is something we could be working on or hey, this is something we worked on and it's doing good. And here's how I know it's doing good. Here's what I'm seeing. Just things that you're noticing about the overall functions and operations of the team. That would be useful to have a conversation about. Even if it's celebrating a win or potentially something that we could work on, OK? No. All right. Thank you for spending time with me. You little introverts. I like talking to you guys.
01:08:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think you're awesome. Thanks for bearing with us.
01:08:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
I like that.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I look forward to it.
01:08:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You have a good week, OK? You too. Bye. Bye. Bye, bud.
