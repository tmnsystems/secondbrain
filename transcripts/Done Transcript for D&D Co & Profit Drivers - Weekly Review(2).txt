Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?

Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
