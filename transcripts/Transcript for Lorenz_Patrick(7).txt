00:00:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Whoa.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't have a orientation. Oh my gosh. Did you hear what Siri just said? I know. First of all, it's not always muted. I was talking to you guys, seeing if you can hear me. And then that said, uh huh. And I said, I wasn't talking to you. And she says, I don't have a orientation. I'm like, what? Okay. Yeah.
00:00:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's no, I guess.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How are you guys today?
00:01:04 - Patrick Shahverdian
Pretty good?
00:01:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. Patrick's having a killer month.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah? Let's go look at that. Tell me about it.
00:01:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Just a lot of supplements and cases closed out them. Which is good. Big ones, small ones. team is doing everything that they're supposed to be doing. Yep. Some, a little bit of good timing. A lot of, you know, everyone doing their tasks. So It's super enthusiastic about it, I think. Well, the team, they got to do it the next month, right?
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yes. Yeah. Um, let's see, let's update this and then I want for this month. Okay, that is a good month. Um, now remind me though, wait a minute, gross attorney fees, average attorney fees, okay. Laura, you're not doing too bad, huh?
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, yeah, the fees, the money in is a little worried about the settlements though. It's uh, I had a bunch of different, well, a bunch, maybe like two or three big ones are supposed to come in this month and they got delayed, so hopefully get a better
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
seven months next month that I like to be I like to be in the 700 that's that's where I know I can make I can get some good distributions just again reporting question of the mark what is your targets like does mark have an incentive target for settlements specifically just putting us against each other and competing for bragging rights okay so but it's not tied in your sense of it's just um the total attorney fees right yeah that's correct okay so all right well why would you focus on settlements then uh because i'm thinking ahead so whatever settlements i have drive how much it makes up yes i have to think about the the separation of it so yeah the indicator that that's what's coming got it okay so you track that don't you want to spreadsheet the settlements well not anymore now that it's posted on the on the report what report and i'll show you
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, can I share my screen real quick?
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This one.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Settlement. Okay.
00:05:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:05:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did you, did that report change for you or?
00:05:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he updated something, which didn't tell me. That's good.
00:05:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I mentioned it earlier this month and he said that report is not always accurate. So he goes off of what's posted on the Slack channel for settlement selection. But this is. You know, I know my numbers are accurate in here, which is really what I care the most about.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm glad. Okay. So you guys have access to that report. So let me go into that report.
00:06:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
You don't care about my numbers.
00:06:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, I'm glad you're doing good, but I'm not fine.
00:06:29 - Patrick Shahverdian
Don't worry. Take next month.
00:06:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like this better than quiet.
00:06:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Come on, let's go.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. There you go. There you go. Fuel that fire. Everybody wins when we all try to win. Let's see. It's amount. And. Where's here? Oh, Lauren's, you were already sharing that, but where's Patrick? Patrick, are you looking at this report? Regularly, or at all?
00:07:21 - Patrick Shahverdian
Um, I have my own list for my cases. But periodically Mark will just tell us kind of where everybody's at.
00:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any interest in looking at it?
00:07:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
Oh, yeah, it was good to know. But like he said, sometimes they're like really. Not accurate, so.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I think all it is is. Whether the dates are correct. So. I'd have to check on it, but I would think. I mean, let me ask this like I think one time you said the met page not calculated in there. Oh Okay mine is It is I had a met be Settle yesterday for 5,000 and there it is right here I would imagine it's close enough that it gives you a good idea And that it's worth looking at Cuz it's let's see It shows you Settlement five hundred and thirty seven seven thousand seven fifty No, that's for the third party. I actually have a 23 Okay, okay, I see the third party.
00:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's the third party?
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
uh defendants so as this is uh my settle against defendant first party is what they have uh under under insured coverage or insured coverage okay it's all right so then let me go look at and then clearance by 18 okay so i see what you're looking at and focusing on i understand a lot of it is the the timing and these are things that you've been working on for a few months it'll be really interesting to see i don't know the average amount of time for a case to settle what is that that that's what um goodbye to the t-forms. wonder actually goodbye to reports settled. We have a few different dashboards that were created and trying to figure out which one I don't know what. Unless the thing I can't, at heart's resolution speed but team. We're still waiting on the guy that's doing this. the guy that helps us with the reports, this is not his main job. It's kind of his side gig. Just this time here equals this month. And those numbers are getting so much better though. So people are making sure there's nothing here that, okay, let me show the screen. So this is just for this month, but it can only count the cases that have closed or resolved. it's during the month. So this is the thing we're working on to check it but we have been watching this number and they're definitely shrinking and yours are just skewed Patrick I can't even don't even know at what point these were are going to be legitimate but do you see where yours are now Lorenz. So that speed should mean that the well depending on how good your cases are getting worked up and how good they have the potential anyway your settlement fees should be increasing because your unless your case volume goes down the speed of resolution is improving so as long as your volume is not going down then the sentiment amount should go up. Does that make sense numbers-wise?
00:13:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you get the same amount of cases, but they're settling quicker, you're getting to the money quicker. So just by virtue of that, the settlement amount should increase because you're getting the money faster. This we're still figuring out. And this doesn't include when it's the one-third when you're not targeting 40%. So we're working on fixing that also. And I'm just going to go with last quarter so we can look at this resolution speed by team right here. Yeah, that's- I'm improving a lot, so let's go back to report attorney fees this month. I wonder if I'm going to get in trouble if I do something I shouldn't do, but wonder if I can make a copy of it. I would think that that makes a copy. Oh, I have the dashboard. I'm going to make people mad. It's okay. for given I want this settlement amount. Yes. Let's see what I want and I want it this way, we'll just add default resolution between the Anyway, I want to bother you guys with that. So, let's get back to what we were working on. You guys remember the assignments? Great, this is October 21st. All right. So I'm going to copy this and let's see. I'm going to a new new. Let's see. All right. All right. I'm going to get here. Sorry, I'm moving. Okay. so. Make sure and post this at the end of call each week. And that way you guys can have one central location and it's not in. No, to go back to. So I would recommend bookmarking this doing it right now. Perfect. Crittle Lisk in Slack during soccer practice on Thursday night. I think that was the other ones.
00:18:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that was like our little journal entries.
00:18:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, right. So that was what let's see scheduled and the week meeting with Jessica discuss her return and performance and transition for Karen to assist Jessica with case management. John's return, right? Those are things you're talking about preparer. Ideas for process improvements, automation. Okay. Yeah, we'll work for organizations next meeting. need to follow up with Mark. Mark, is terrible about getting things done on the timeline. Oh, where did it go? Opened up questioning it. Opened up a new email when I lost it. Way too new. There it is. I'm going it You You I know that he wasn't going to be able get that right away. forgot about like the crazy travel schedule he had. So I think that's done. I think he said somewhere around the end of the month. So we'll see what we can do about getting the workflow going. Automations. Sorry. With LITIFY, I'm sorry, team performance take notes issues. proud to discuss that. next meeting. That was something that I asked you guys to do throughout the week. That was the homework.
00:21:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yes.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember that Patrick?
00:21:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
No.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this will help. This is something I wanted you to do, keep that. That was what the journal entry was about is to notice anything that's going great. Anything that's going less than ideal and needs to be improved upon. So average doesn't really need to be noted per se, the outlier type things. If something's great, we want to pay attention to that and see if it's something that we can get more of. I want to make sure that we celebrate that if somebody's doing a great job. But also, is that something that could be trained and shown to other people? if somebody's doing great job. So we're just noticing and paying attention. So obviously there's improvements that are happening. We want to be able to know specifically where the improvements are happening. Who's doing it, what are they doing, right? Because we're talking about lot of things and we're implementing different things. We wanna know what's actually getting us the results. So rather than just, yeah, our numbers are looking better, these are some of the things that we're doing. Can you draw a specific correlation to what we're doing that's making the biggest difference? Does that make sense?
00:22:37 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I did put something in the journal, is that what you're referring to?
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did I create one and share it with you or not? Okay, I should have it up and then I probably don't. What's the, somebody drop it in the chat after me. There it is. Okay. Okay, got it. Um, good. So we'll keep the homework one separate. Um, we have 10. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to pull these like you guys to pull the name and date. Let me go ahead. Here's another thing that you can do when you type your notes. Can you type at Tina, a profit driving, it'll, it'll populate. That way I get a notification that you've updated it. Please and thank you. You want to give it a try, both of you guys so that we can make sure that you know how it works and I've got that muscle memory and then I can get it. Please. You know what I mean, Patrick?
00:24:08 - Patrick Shahverdian
If I put, oh, it'll give you a notification.
00:24:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so where it says Patrick week of 10, 15, 22. At the end of that, put at. And then Tina. should pop up my name. And then I should, there you go. So what that will do is trigger an email for me. And let me know that I've got something to review. So anytime you guys leave a note or an update journal entry, whatever. I'll get that notification. And even this guy's, this is a simple system. It's a very simple system. We keep journal entries. Number one, that's the system in and of itself. The nuance to it is that both of you are in there, that you put a date, that you notice what is great or what needs work, and that you tag me. All of those things are part of the system. So, and I'm telling you that so that you think about systems in a very basic way. But what that allows us to do is have more effective meetings, because you're, first of all, you're thinking about things throughout the week, but you're taking note of them as they happen. And also making sure that I get notified so that I'm called back to what we're working on throughout the week. And you know how we talked about mental lag time, know, like why you want a time block instead of just check email all throughout the day. It's because of mental lag time. So, if we're only thinking about the things that we're working on together once a week when we meet. We have to recall everything that we've been talking about, and that takes a little time. So we kind of have to rehash everything, whereas if we're coming back to this document of the things that we're working on a few times a week, then it stays fresh on our minds so that when we come to the call, we are already focused on what's happening. And we don't have to spend so much time and effort recalling, does that make sense? Okay, cool. So now let me look at this. I love that, Lorenz, that you're reviewing the operational improvement every morning and seeing whether not it's had an effect on the KPIs. So which KPIs are you looking at specifically?
00:26:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Settlements, and these, and then time. I'm open to close.
00:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect. So you're looking at that stuff daily.
00:27:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not necessarily daily, but like every other day or so.
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think honestly weekly is plenty. Just get your stats. Otherwise I feel like it's a little bit too obsessive. You could be doing it. The things aren't going to change that much in the course of a week. So that time will be better spent somewhere else managing it. know what I mean? Like the fact that you're reviewing the cases. Twice, let's see, going through all of the cases twice in a month now versus once every few weeks, you know, that's a big difference. All right. And Patrick, drink for our view, know. The implementation of stopping lean treatment, once we identify, I know, defendant insurance, am on a, on the shirt runners. Okay. On a police report or a finding insurance is taking too long. Those implementation of stopping lean treatment. So, I don't understand the lean's, um, how, how that works.
00:28:26 - Patrick Shahverdian
So, can you elaborate for this a little bit? Yeah. So, basically, when we treat the clients on lean treatment, which means, you know, the doctors in our net work that are going to get paid from a settlement, want to be careful to make sure that there is insurance coverage before we have them treat with those doctors, because if there ends up not being any insurance or a settlement, then they kind of get burned.
00:28:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The doctor gets burned?
00:28:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. Okay. Whereas, if the client treats on health insurance, If there is a settlement that you know will reimburse the health insurance But if there ends up not being any then the health insurance does the job and just pays for it anyways So it's a safer way to Make sure that we're not having the doctors that are network treat clients that they're not going to end up getting paid on So the way that your Language is do you discover that somebody on your team noticed this and implemented it? No, I noticed that on some of these cases where We're not finding insurance or the police report indicates There may not be insurance that the case manager is putting those clients on a health insurance treatment Until we can find insurance, which is a good thing. So it's so the doctors You know, we're not having these doctors treat clients that are at a risk of potentially no insurance being found So you saw something good that you didn't know was happening I did notice before like they would just set up with lean treatment while we were looking for insurance, but that's kind of a risky game that you're playing. So I let them know like if we get a case and it looks like a good case as far as injuries and things like that, we can do lean treatment, but just keep it very minimal. But you know, we're searching for insurance for like a week, two weeks, and nothing's coming back to proactively switch them to health insurance that way that doctor's not going to accrue this high bill.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenz, how does your team handle that?
00:30:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty much the same. We can't review the cases if we, you know, especially in Tucson, Tucson cases take a long time to get the TCR police report. Okay, but it might be a little bit. different here, though, because we have, well, all but one provider, really, understand that, you know, every time they take a case on a lean, there is a bit of a risk involved, and they they've been doing this long enough, that they don't mind getting burned once in a while, just because they know that we're usually going to pay them in full anyway, for the other cases. So, like, for example, we have, I had lunch with one of my providers last month, and he basically said, look, know, I charge, if you were to walk into my clinic, I charge 40 bucks per session. Okay. On a lean, I can charge $120 per session for the same amount of work. So, if a client comes in and we just want, we don't have liability established yet. don't want to gap, just haven't come in, we'll treat on a lean and if liability doesn't get accepted, then, you know, that's fine. I can eat the past because on the other clients, I make three times as much as I would if they have just walked in. And so he's been doing it for 30 years, he knows how this works. But then we have like other providers like Dr. Kim, who wants to be paid in full no matter what. And that one, we have to be a little bit more careful. Absolutely.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you have to handle providers on a case by case basis?
00:32:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and I try to keep my providers pretty happy. Like I'm, I'm going to go to a son's game with a couple of them in Mark, next week, I think, just to, you know, put some face time in with them and make sure their our team is meeting their expectation.
00:32:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many providers? do you think you have total or like the preferred ones that we we both so preferred ones probably about 10 or 15 okay uh total well that depends honestly because you know if you don't health insurance too and i don't know i don't know anyone personally like banner and stuff but when you say preferred what percentage of the business is in your preferred network um over 50 percent i'd say i still have a big gap what i'm wondering is do you notate the preferences do you do you have any kind of record of sorting and keeping track of your providers that preferences how they behave
00:34:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, we all know them. mean, we have my cell phone number. I have theirs. Usually, we have a relationship, but like as far as like a word document or an Excel spreadsheet where I keep track of all my interactions with them.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, at some point, they're new, right? And at some point, you don't know everything about them. And the ability, like, okay, so let me ask you this point. Question, when was the last time you got a new provider?
00:34:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, last month, it's called precision integrative care. We have a couple of clients with them and actually my wife did injections with them on Friday and uh how's she feeling by the way? Worse. They gave her a ketamine and she's uh she had a really bad trip and they basically they're not a preferred provider anymore. I have some godfather vibes coming up out of me right now like one in the go have a conversation for you. Yeah well she didn't realize I thought the owner of the clea the stuff was fine but the owner of the clinic was the one and so she like put us in the parking lot to so that she wouldn't be too loud for the other patients and the biggest red flag of red flags yeah and then you will sweep uh something like that under the rug knowing that those allergic reactions can turn into something better later because they can keep developing yeah that's terrifying and i wouldn't want to be associated with them at all that's what's the word not um that's negligence medical negligence yeah well i mean fortunately there's no adverse long-term adverse effects so that was good but yeah i get you know she was like well once you give me your numbers so that i can check up on your wife later today you know as we're in the parking lot and you know i thought i assumed she knew who i who i was because her staff did and uh i gave her my card and that's when like She went from like, oh crap, you know, she was, I could see in her eyes that she realized she messed up.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you talk to her boss about that?
00:37:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, she's the owner of that clinic, but she's part of the network with someone, one of the doctors I get, he's a chiropractor. He has his own network here in Arizona. He refers a lot of PI cases from us to different providers. And so I'm going to be talking to him later this week.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you talk to Mark about it?
00:37:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I told him in passing that Carrie was like, because I had to take off and go pick her up from the office. And so he knows what happened, but I don't know if he knows it's one of the hard. for providers or one of the providers I was trying to establish relationship with, I should say.
00:38:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just mean because everything about who you refer out is impact, sweet, law, reputation. you know, that's word. Yes, yes. I mean, yeah, we got terrible on so many fronts, so I hope Carrie feels better soon. I know it's been...
00:38:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it was a big deal for her, actually, because she's from Portland, so you know, doctors are not high on her priority list, and so it was a big deal for her to be able to like go and get some medical treatment, as opposed to being person.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then they just talks her out of it forever.
00:38:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she's done.
00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's not. Oh, I'm like, I will figure out everything on my own, but I live in Oregon, so you know, little great here. Okay, so, Anyway, before that, what was the last time you got a new provider?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, we got Dr. Utas back in June, I think.
00:39:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's not a frequent, over like changing thing. I just wanted to make sure this just it for so we're all on the same page going back to Patrick's conversation about the weans and how we're handling that that some people some providers might actually not care if you stop and you switch to healthcare because they're they're basically playing the game going the odds are in their favor that they'll get more if it is lean treatment that they'll eat the cost. So maybe part of the process is what is your preference here? What do you think about that?
00:39:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have some providers honestly. I don't know if it's the same in Arizona but in California, but there's a lot of chiropractors here that will not deal with health insurance at all. They only do treatment or cash services. That may be different once you get to ortho or PM, but caros that we work with, they usually don't work with insurance.
00:40:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, Patrick, just because this is some new ish to you, the new wants of all of these things, and it's even there were to me because I don't do your job, so this is just a conversation trying to facilitate, you know, what's the process. So, the whole thing came about because you realized somebody was handling it. particular, it seems like a good idea, but it also seems like a nuanced thing rather than a cut and done. I hate if it's been a couple of weeks and we still don't have insurance, cut it off and switch it to health insurance. Now that that is part of the caveat, Lorenz, do you have a time period or and how many how many doctors do you think prefer because of that the the leans do I would imagine pay all of the doctors more? What do you have a percentage where you think that more of them would prefer to just go ahead and eat the cost on occasion?
00:41:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know most of my caras are not set up for health insurance. one and number two, only about 50% of my clients even have health insurance.
00:41:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is most of the work that happens, Kairos.
00:41:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Depends. So if it depends on what the injuries are, so there's two in a row, Chiro's and MRI always happen no matter what okay 99% of the cases and our MRI is going to Hospitals cuz like I live in small town. That's the only place that's gonna happen. Do you guys have clinics to do MRI's? We have clinics that will do MRI's on a lean okay, and Once we have the MRI results the chiro decides, you know whether the client is Is A good candidate for pain management or if it's if the MRI is negative then the adjuster is never gonna pay for pain management If there's nothing showing on the MRI Did mine not even pay for the MRI at that point, but so okay, so the chiropractor is cuz I'm trying to Narrow the conversation down to this process specifically around leans versus health insurance um But if you know if it's only the
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or fractures that prefer leans over health insurance because they're not dealing with it, so not one specific kind of nuance that maybe is new information for you, Patrick, or not.
00:43:12 - Patrick Shahverdian
I don't know. No, this is like what I'm saying is like this is how Mark trains us to run these cases. What I know just is that my case manager is consciously thinking about this when we're getting new cases because it's so easy for them to, you know, just look at our map. Oh, there's this Cairo here, let's set them up. Whereas it takes more time to be like, okay, let me look at the police report. Let me look at, you know, these things to see because you can kind of gauge whether there's likely going to be coverage or not.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if it's a hit and run or something like that.
00:43:43 - Patrick Shahverdian
Right. not going to be coverage, but, you know, we still try, you know, as our due diligence to try, but I'm happy to see that they're consciously thinking about, okay, let me, because it shows that they care. about the cases, because it's so easy to just throw it in the treatment system and let's get the ball rolling, but to stop and say, okay, maybe I should do this on the health insurance, so we don't burn a doctor, but the client can still treat. So that's why I put it in here, because I was happy to see that, you know, L.C. is taking the time to think about the cases before, as opposed to just throwing it in the system and getting things rolling.

That's awesome. Okay, so one thing that we can do is maybe be a little bit more specific in the language, who's doing it, what's good about it. Not just what the observation is, but why it's important, why it's good, or something's bad, like why we're concerned about it, because otherwise I'm going to ask a question.
00:44:48 - Patrick Shahverdian
Sorry, that was very vague that I put in there.
00:44:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay, but it's all a learning process, and I probably could have asked different questions, but that's the way the my brain works is online. Let's go around then. So, all right, good. Let me see. After the run string power view, a parent that the list functions in Slack, takes too long to set up, and slows down the power view process. Need to take time outside hours to set up list for each file. What was the status of that? Is it actually a helpful process or just more time than it's worth?
00:45:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I was going to do it. And then last Tuesday, you said you were setting something up.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not.
00:45:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I said, if something else is going to happen, I'm not going to spend, you know, that's good. It's been hours to.
00:45:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. No, because the whole thing, when I talked to Mark about it, he was like, well, that's the whole thing about letify. It's supposed to be able to do all of this. And I'm like, and does it? And how many years have you used it and have you trade your team? And I got crickets. So we're going to have.
00:46:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
call about that yeah uh okay so and then let's see if more than one person speaks to the client about continuing treatment rather than closing it out clients is more likely to keep treating than to push for immediate settlement care so it's another thing of um second care kind of huh second yeah um you know it's uh noticing that a lot of cases though came from uh jessica uh you know she was like I talked to them because they're Spanish speakers so I can't talk to them myself directly uh a lot of them said you know I just care about PD I don't care about my case I just want to get my car fixed and so they ended up with like six thousand dollars in medical treatment and which is not enough to to get even a minimal policy here in Arizona and so I was trying to figure it out ways we can kind of help them understand that there's, they are still hurt and that in order to resolve those injuries, they need to do additional treatment, which will yield better results for their legal case. And I think Jessica has a little bit maybe shy and asserting and having that honest conversation with the clients. And so, but when Jessica was gone, Karen went through those cases and she was able to convince 50% of those clients that were ready for, that were supposedly ready for demand, she was able to convince them to go back to treatment, to take care of their injuries and increase the value. And so, I discussed it when Jessica came back. Mike has a bit of an ego. He didn't like the idea of Karen coming in and taking his clients over, so he decided he was going to do that and second voicing some of those clients. And he got a little bit of success doing it himself. So I think it's revealing the second voice principle that it can be helpful, especially with those clients who want to wrap things up. I think oftentimes, honestly, they don't know. They say, I've got to go back to work. I can't afford taking all this time off of work. And we have options for that. We have telemedicine. We have people that can treat them on Saturday after work hours, whenever it's convenient for them. And I don't know that they understood that that was an option.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that makes me think, and this. This has come up with intake too, but do you have, so we talked a little bit about scripting and maybe creating a list of objections for each of the points, right? So if there's objections to treatment, how do we handle those objections? If they say this or something like it, respond with this. If they say this or something like it, respond with this. But the other thing I think that you might do is if somebody on your team has to do something and they are weak at it and it's conversational, what about role-playing? What about just giving them practice and there's a lot, it's muscle memory, you know? the muscle memory is not going to come, they don't do it in the first place and they're not going to do it in the first place. If they don't feel safe enough to do it, so if they're wrong. playing in a place where they feel safe, then they just get practiced. Then it becomes kind of rope memory and muscle memory at the same time. I imagine that there's resistance, shyness, whatever it is, but regardless, it's a real thing. Muscle memory is a real thing. That practice is a real thing. It takes out nervousness. think about driving, and I think that we have this conversation. I can never remember who I've talked about the driving analogy before, but everything that you have to think about is nerve-wracking and stressful. Do I turn my blinker on? Where the heck is my blinker? Where's the clutch? Where's the right? okay, nobody does clutch anymore, but I did, and it was hard.
00:50:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, the M3 is stick still, right?
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to have a manual car, no electronics, but like souped up so it can do all the things, but also EMP can come and I'm still going. I don't care. live in a crazy world. love technology, but also the technology be crazy. I ain't having no Terminator come at me. Okay. But anyway, mostly it's just a fun excuse to have something that's like fun and retro, but I won't my like if you're at a four-way intersection and it's just a stop sign and two people got there at the same time. Who goes first? Like even if it's a green light and you're like in somebody's opposite of you, do you go? Is your green light being yield? Is there an arrow? You know what I mean? Like there's so many things you have to process and it's terrifying at first and you make a mistake because everybody makes a mistake and you're like the way you find out that was a mistake is because you almost got hit and it's terrifying and there's Anxiety and then one day you look back and you're like you don't have to think about any of it because you know how it goes Unless you come to my town and there's these weird like one-way streets that I go backwards and you always run into somebody Doesn't know that it's a one-way street and they're coming at you. It's great. Anyway But my point is is that the anxiety and that conversation and the discomfort so there's two aspects of it One of it is if they feel like they're doing something that is not in the best interest of the client so if they have a moral dilemma with Pushing towards treatment You first have to overcome the moral dilemma that has nothing to do with practice if they feel like it's manipulation or whatever then you have to address that and and so Number one is the way that I would approach that is We all know that the injuries aren't always apparent, they can be revealed down the road, but they have a better chance of being covered if, you know, they got sufficient treatment in the beginning. But also, sometimes people have such a high threshold for pain that they're just not really aware that they're suffering, additionally, and the doctors are going to help pull that out of That's the truth. When you're a person who's just like, I got work to do, I got work to do, I got work to do, you can be hurting all day long, you just like deal with it, you know, so those are the kind of people will be like, whatever, I'm going to deal with it, but they don't understand sometimes the impact that that can have long-term down the road. You have a slip disc and you're working on it, keep working on it, keep working on it, what's going to happen. You're not able to work anymore, and that window has closed. So, in terms of dealing with the moral dilemmas, The more care that you get after this, probably the better overall to make sure that everything's been covered, right? And that you're taking care of and it's worth it. So then the practice, though, I just kind of lost my train of thought for a second. The other thing about it, and this may not feel like it's in the benefit of the clients, but it's in the benefit of all clients. So, Sweet Law doesn't get paid unless the client gets paid. If there are no fees, there's no payment, that business can't stay in business. So if Sweet Law's not around to take care of them, they've got to go to somebody else, and not everybody is going to take as good a care of them as you guys will. We know that. We've seen the reviews. We know that. Also Sweet Law's out of business. So, knowing that, making sure that everybody gets maximum treatment, one. is the best protection for them. And number two is the best protection for sweet love. There's no reason not to do that. It ultimately it helps everybody in the long run. But then the other part would just be practice. And so I would really consider maybe you do it for distributions, negotiations, anything where you've got to talk somebody into doing something that there's some pushback on. If there's a person on your team having that type of conversation and they're not awesome at it, I would practice some role playing and be like let's get better at this. So what I want you guys to think about this week is where does that show up in the business? Who is maybe not so strong at those types of conversations where the outcome requires an agreement from anybody else whether it's the insurance? Maybe it's just dealing with insurance providers better. Maybe it's dealing with the clients, but maybe it's a different aspects of the case, different points in the case. Whatever that is, think about where there's a little bit of friction, and it's because somebody's holding back. Bring that, put it in your notes in your journal. And let's come up with a plan for how we can create some scenarios where you can kind of role play and help them get a little bit more confident at it. And think about a time first before you buy it, like it doesn't do it good if you don't buy into it. But think about a time when you did this, where you practice saying something that you were like, I don't know how to handle this, right? don't know, maybe it's just being an attorney yourself, maybe it's just going through certain types of things. The thing that comes in my mind is the dare program. Like that came out when I was a kid, grade, I was probably the first one. And we did. role-playing, we practice saying no to drugs. That's stupid, like saying no to peer pressure, whatever. But it created this muscle memory. you, you had to use the words that never would have come out of your mouth at any other time. So when the time came to say it, you're like, I know what those words are. I've spoken them before. They've come out of my mouth before. I can say them now. And so anyway, just, don't know what, Lorenz, did you start my mission?
00:57:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I would like to talk to you about our one thing, Jesus Christ. You probably have some practice with that, huh? Knocking on doors?
00:57:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm not afraid.
00:57:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not how we go about it. But there are some things you know that you have to do. There was a United Way fundraiser thing that we did in my call center, my corporate life, like almost 30 years ago. And When I figured out that the thing to say to people was, you can buy X for this person for less than a cup of coffee or less than a two meter bottle or whatever, I got yes, and I won the competition. I raised the most money and my boss had to die her very long, beautiful hair and ugly seaweed green. And my other boss got his head shaved. I loved it. So anyway, not competitive or vindictive or spiteful or anything. Don't cross me. I'm just kidding. Anyways, think about it because look, your guys, all of you care about doing a good job. The systems, even role playing, it's just how things are going, that's a system. It's a systematic approach, right? the strategy is, okay, now that I've seen this through my... Systematic observation. What am I going to do to improve it? Everybody can improve Practice makes perfect, right? That's what we're told. So where are they going to get the practice? Well, it's not really practice if nobody's watching and critiquing and Offering feedback about how you can do better in real time, right? If you don't get the feedback It's it's kind of like well, okay, I did the thing, but I don't really know to do it good Could I have done it better? So let's make sure that we build that into into the day not day to day, but like overall kind of operations Because I think I think it'll make a difference and remember if we get a little lift here and a little lift there and a little lift here, know what I mean? Then it has a compounding effect and That should it should mean better results for everybody Okay, so don't forget, set up some sort of reminders so that you remember just to kind of be thinking about this at the end of each day and kind of review mentally what stood out to you if anything, and maybe at the beginning of the day also so that you remind yourself to be observant and watch out for these things, and eventually we'll get to be able to talk to the litify people and see what we can do for workflows and automations, but in the meantime keep doing what you guys are doing because the stats are improving, you're clearly making a difference, and it's all coming from the way that you're approaching stuff, so good job.
