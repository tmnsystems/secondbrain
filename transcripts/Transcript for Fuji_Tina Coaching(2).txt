00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just updated my Mac OS and I haven't had meetings since then so I think that it was just let me put it in the way I don't know some glitches you go in there sorry how are you good good we're all starting off on a little holiday week so can't complain yeah let's see I feel like I saw a homework email actually I will I'm gonna actually one moment while you're doing that I'm gonna move a little okay
00:01:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll take this in my car. Have a good one.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, did I lose you?
00:01:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm just moving to my car.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. was fine earlier. Um, let's see. Okay. Reports. That should be in our spreadsheet. All right. think slower since doing that.
00:02:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you, sorry for that delay.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No problem. All right. So where's the wait? Oh, I'm in the wrong tab.
00:02:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I used to drive home after Jujitsu and then take the call with you. And then I'd head out immediately after I called and get Emmy. But this time I was like asked us, so can I just stay at the Jujitsu place? Take the call and then go get Emmy. She's like, oh, yeah, that's. Saves you an hour of driving, I was like, yes, good, good. Okay.
00:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it adds up minutes here, hours there, they add up big time. Where's the? So the report that Paul sent you that you forwarded, which document do we keep that in? that the growth forecast or that's not it?
00:03:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I think that's just You have the reports end of month. It's, he just, he screen captures it. Well, so yeah, you're right. I guess what I could do for the weekly one is have them do it in a spreadsheet.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The thing is I would like to be able to see the pattern, like that's the whole point of getting the weekly thing.
00:04:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So what's the relativity to prior weeks? Okay, can I set that up with you right now then?
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, course. So what document should we create that in?
00:04:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm going to go, well, first of all, I'm going to go into my Google Share drive and...
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you have a laptop with you or not just on a phone?
00:04:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, yeah, laptop.
00:04:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:04:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did a food tracker to get more referrals and then I'm going to do a new sheet. We'll just call it weekly numbers. each Friday. Okay. So weekly numbers. I'm going to share this with you right now, Tina. All. Okay. So first, how do we do this so that I want to see who's sending it. Well, I guess at a top at a big view, we just want to know the week. First of all, we want to know the weekly numbers. That's the first thing. Yeah. Okay.
00:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we do want to know who's doing it. And I feel like HubSpot is actually the thing that we should be using because it has all of this data. But and I know that they have reporting functions and it may be. either dependent upon the tier that you have for the types of reports that we get, or there might be an extra human step and you're paying for a person to do it. But either way, all of that stuff should be in HubSpot.
00:06:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This isn't in HubSpot at all though.
00:06:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The doctor referrals?
00:06:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Correct. Everything's in Google Gmail and Google sheet.
00:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because he looks like, okay, so he's doing just a count. So I need to get, first I need to do, how do I, where do I put the days? it week one, week two?
00:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, that should be the like a raw data thing that we have. So that all the dates are there. then, Oh, like, so he makes me He did talk about doing work week one, two, four, or, you know, whatever the week of the year. Um, but work weeks were good when we were wanting to track throughout the year.
00:07:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So maybe I could, I could have them do new tabs with the raw data and then have this top sheet be the summary of it kind of.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:07:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. let me do, let me try to have a week ending 12, 27. I told them on Friday, just take like the afternoon to do this, these reports for me that would be a help.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
every Friday he said he'll do it. Yep. And then if you can, um, have him like, like have an auto forward from whatever he sends you or that so that I have it before we talk, will be great.
00:07:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Let me do a couple just to show him what I want. So the weekend in. One, two, uh, okay. So. I'm right. She we want how do we do this? we put like total number.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so, um, hold on, because we have something similar that we can model already. And I it's not this one. Where's that? I got it. I think it's the one document a little bit. Hold on.
00:08:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Total number near furls.
00:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's not it. Now I just saw the raw data one over game data. that one. Oh, for me. Oh, yeah, it's the Conteo Cetus. So we've got, um, you know, where it dumped the raw data and then we've got September, which we haven't got past September. So we definitely really need to get all of these things organized.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So why don't you look at that one for a start? Okay, Conteo Cetus.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Oh, yes.
00:09:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. were on data. All right. Okay. So data referral, September summary. Here it is. Okay.
00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because this is what we were already starting on.
00:09:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right. Okay. Okay. So that was just a copy of it. did a count. Okay, so we want the final report. It's we want the number of new referrals. Okay, I guess total no visits. Okay, see Oh visits So The returns okay Turn Okay, there we go. And then, do you think it's helpful to count the number of visits seen by each clinician per week?
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
should it be like the monthly data? No, we want to see that too, because we're still really diving into structure and planning the smaller, you know, we don't need to look at it daily, but looking at it weekly will definitely help us get to creating the better structure faster. And in order for you to get your best investment out of coaching, that would be the most helpful thing to do.
00:11:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure. Okay. it completed by Elizabeth? Is it completed by Sherby? Is it completed by Diana? Is it completed by Diana? What's that?
00:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I was just also thinking about too like the pace of your people, like how like it seemed like Elizabeth was able to complete a lot more visits for the amount of time that she works comparable to the counterparts. So, you know, all this on an operations level, Fuji, when we're looking at, first of all, how do we optimize the system so that you're making the most amount of money with the least amount of time and money invested, right? And then if we're going to expand or replicate anything, how do we do that? So, all of that is data-driven. Also like what kind of people we hire, what kind of schedule we have, all of these are facets of what makes the system work well versus really well. So, again, like really being able to not just have the data and look at it, but have it. organized in a particular way so that we really can interpret it very well and so it reveals to us everything that it has to reveal. Does that make sense?
00:13:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you weren't on like self-service or gym Wi-Fi I'd say share screen but that's probably not a good idea if you look on that new weekly numbers each Friday I shared it with you weekly numbers each week or each Friday okay so this is the summary sheet where we want what we'll do is each Each week, on Friday, we'll get new data. 1st 3 is 2024, the next one is 1-10, 1-10-2024.
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you should be able to drag from there. Yeah, yeah, Once you've got that pattern.
00:14:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, 4.
00:14:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, 2025, that's because you didn't change it.
00:14:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yes, thank you.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was like, you dumb human.
00:14:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm going to give you what you asked for.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There you go.
00:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. You're welcome.
00:14:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So what we'll see on this top level sheet is total number of visits completed. That's because that's what we want to track, right? we want, eventually we want to get up to 500 or 600, 1000.
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to track all of this?
00:14:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to be very, very clear. You're right.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really just important. Those nuances have everything to do with how successful your business is. I know that you have a default mode of simplifying. You really want to just go like this and then block everything out, you repel it, boot it, you repel it energetically, you repel it in conversation, you repel it in operation, and that is something that you need to break. It's probably very much aligned also with the accountability issue is you want to go small. Now, what I have to do for myself, because I would be like that, I would feel like things were overwhelming and so I just blocked it. But because I'm growth oriented and so are you, I realized that spending a little bit of time doing what I would define as tedious or admin work and hated was the one thing that got me to my goals so much faster, so I basically looked at it, there's the same way as like eating check and breast and broccoli and doing all these things that are not really that just flavorful, but get me the results I want. You know what I mean? Yeah. Oh, look at that as not just instead of focusing on what is the minimum I can do to get to the thing. What is the thing that gets me to the maximum, right? Not what's minimum, but that is what we're always trying to do the minimum. But I need you to understand that this much data is the minimum to get to $10 million with the least amount of stress or these problems.
00:16:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair.
00:16:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And and this is always helpful to keep in mind. It's something that I have to repeat to a few people haven't hit the goals that they want to hit. First of all, if you want to get to something you've never had, you've got to do things you've never done. You know, it's it's sounds cliche, but it's not really it's the truth. The other thing is your goal is not an average goal. So you have to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results. What you'll get from me is the minimum amount of effort it takes, but it's still going to take more than your default mode.
00:17:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that make sense?
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fair. Okay. But we'll get you where you want to go.
00:17:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like it.
00:17:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We will do that. You have shown me that that's in you, that you do enough, and especially having your amazing Esther as a wife. You guys are going to do this in a matter of just a few years. I wouldn't be surprised if it's done in three, even with the kiddos. If you throw another one in there, it might take a little bit longer, but it's five, six years max. You should be at earning that much per year, and then probably having as network. maybe five million within five or six years. If we do this right. And I think that we can. And how young are you? You'll have met your goal, I think, of a net worth of 10 million before your 40.
00:18:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm 40 already.
00:18:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? I thought you were 30 something.
00:18:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I just turned 40.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did I think you were like 31 and 32?
00:18:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Uh, I wish.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no. Well, before 50, but that's still exceptional. And anyway, but and we and that's going slow, Fuji. That's like really not working more than than what you're working, which for people that are earning that amount of money. That that is slow. That's not standard. That's not what most people do when they earn that amount of money. They're usually sacrificing their health and their family to do it. You can have that while still being an awesome husband and dad.
00:18:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll try.
00:18:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. Trust me, you can! Okay, so number of completed visits, brand new referrals for last seven days. Yeah, we're doing this weekly, so we want that. Total number of completed visits for the... Okay, so the other thing that I want to do is, and I don't know if it's going to let us do this, but let's put a divider at the month line. Hold on a second and see if the formatting will go with us. don't know, but well. Just so we can easily, it might try to take it as a number thing, whatever. If we don't manually do it, we'll go manually do it. That's fine. So then we would just, and you should be able to see my mouse hovering over what it is.
00:19:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So if we, let's say, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna put fake numbers in here just for a second, okay? Sure.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then if we highlight all of them like I'm doing, if you were to do that also, then we get the sum over on the right. We get the average if we were to do that. So we could just break things up very easily and manipulate this data without adding new formulas. What the heck, oh, hit somehow. Anyway, okay, so total number return completed visits from CA of California, Washington, Mexico, it's Arizona Missouri, it was a sweet ball. That's where we're at. And visited, okay, Elizabeth, Sherby, Diana, Jasmine, and Angelina. Wonderful. What would also be really wonderful is if we had this data for the last year.
00:20:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If we could go, I don't know, I know that it would be a lot of work. It would be worth it to have somebody go back and get this data. historically, even if you have to go pull it from Google Calendar and it was a lot of extraction, it would be worth it to go back and get this for the last year so that we can really measure the evolution and the change, but also so we really understand the value of each of your employees, which you can then translate into what does that have to do with maybe their characteristics, how you hire them, how you manage them, just different things so that you can understand the the management, leadership, operational side of your human resources.
00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's right.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right, so Paul is going to update this for us every week. Will you ask him for historical data? And I would wrong, if we did it, I would like to start working from December, November backwards, one month at a time. start from January, you know, and fill it in that way.
00:22:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, what I'll do, maybe after the calls, I'll have a meeting with him and just kind of summarize what I want him to do. So that we're not he's not like confused about what we're doing. So this weekly report is not going to replace the monthly summary that he's been doing.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love the monthly summary he did.
00:22:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So this weekly one is really to do like the monthly one on a weekly basis. But I still want to see the numbers in month format at the end.
00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. whatever he feels would be easiest to allow him to do both without creating extra work, right? You know, like if it give him some autonomy and say, how do you want to go about it? long as in the end, I get this data organized this way, you can do it however you want to, as long as it's done by this time.
00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because he definitely has shown himself to be Able to work autonomously, be helpful, wants to be organized, wants to be valuable, wants to do more work, so I would let him make suggestions or do the work. I really want to click the AI convert to table and see what it does. Yeah, anyway, I built my first Python, like my own autonomous agent, my last week and it's going to be a project management one and it can create tasks and organize them and follow up with them in my project management suite. So, I know I like to be playing with it and building in our bar and just seeing what it can do because the one thing. of the way it's growing and the speed that it's growing, if we, we, you know, small business owners in general can get away from like the subscription services and have local AI systems that can, and also the local AI systems outside of other people systems, they have more autonomy, so you'll actually have to be really careful, you know, at the coding, but they can do things without doing a basically credit system where you're paying for every single thing that's being done. When it's accessing an AI through an API, you don't pay those kinds of fees. it has a lot more growth potential as well, and the learning potential. as I figure that stuff out, I'll share what I learned as we go, playing with all the different things. All right, so let me go to your notes from the last one. So you did 10 calls and you sent them to me, right?
00:25:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did more than 10 calls, but only, you know, I didn't get answers from a lot of them. So I sent the ones that I was able to get.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I need to review those. You worked with Paul to get all of that stuff.
00:25:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Can I show you just real quick the formatting that I want done here?
00:25:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so I'm on weekly report for each Friday spreadsheet, and then I'm on tab called week ending 12, 20, Okay. what I want, what I think Paul has been doing already is first he makes, he copy pastes the people. Like that were referred in that last week.
00:25:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So for this one, it's 12, 16 to 12, 20.
00:25:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. And then he's doing this function called count. And it counts the number of referrals from. Each law firm listed in column B. I don't know how to use this like this formula, but that's what he did. It's like equals count A. I don't somehow he got it to work.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Count if or count A.
00:26:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's count A. And like, what I'm trying to do is like, I want column B counted. I don't know.
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, I don't know.
00:26:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This doesn't work for me. But anyway, he somehow he got it. This is a copy paste for his last one, but he somehow he got it where it took, he counted the number of furls from each law firm and column B.
00:26:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:26:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. So anyway, he knows how to do it. I don't know how to do it, but.
00:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it is long as you go through and manually check the work and make sure that it's counting correctly. You don't need to understand it. But we also can go to chat GPT and say, you know, what is the formula to do? So, remember that when you want a specific structure, take the time to figure out how to express it, because if you can express it, you can ask for it and you can ask for the instructions and we can get it.
00:27:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I'm going to just take one minute to do that with chat TPT.
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Also, I have chat TPT the highest version. So, anytime we want to try something that maybe has been complicated or it's not giving good results, let's try it through mine.
00:27:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Let me just try it through the basic one here. think I need Google spreadsheet for me to help. I have a list of law firms. So, okay. All right, simplify the data as it takes.
00:29:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll add some four new sales calls from Joseph. I mean new referrals and your sales call to Joseph.
00:30:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, let's see if this guy works. Go. So I want to... There it goes. All right. There it goes. Okay. So that counted how many loss firms. All right. Oh, I was saying count M and Y, but that's weird. Why is it saying count M and Y for Sandra? don't want that bad. OK, let's do that. Cool. OK. Good job, chapter bt. So now this tool tells me the tools. Yeah.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now it tells you what?
00:31:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Tells me how many each law firm referred to in the past week.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's wild. at that. Like, you got to send some thanks to law. Oh, Send some thanks to Chen. No Fuji. That's not what I'm saying. But yeah. Don't forget to thank the robot.
00:31:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
For the work I always do.
00:31:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I say thank you. I do, too.
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They're trying.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I say please and thank you and I compliment it and but also we program it too for its interaction and it's just good. Okay, so where's your formula there it is? right, where p is not no group by order. I can't be calling the descending. Nice. Okay, so that's separate, so it's not lining up.
00:32:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Let's try this one. Now I want to count the number of each individual case manager. Yay! Why is it doing it sussily first? Claudia LaBelle sent eight. Where's Claudia? She's nice.
00:32:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
her name here. this a matter of like the column or the model?
00:33:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I guess she did list eight eight times. Look at that. Good job. This is awesome. I love this function. Why is Cecily listed up here? She didn't send me that major.
00:33:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, we've done this before, right?
00:33:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did it manually.
00:33:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:33:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We talked about this function before. Why is Cecily listed way more times on this?
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's do this fine suit. Oh, what is happening? Go away. Control app, Sue, Sony shows up nine times.
00:33:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's way more than this three that's predicted in this box. See, this one says, To sell, he only sent me three.
00:34:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in OK, so one, two, three, four, five. Looks like there was five. Two, three. Well, OK, no, so hold on. So as the funny uses. Oh, so are you is that the whole law firm?
00:34:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I thought you wanted it by specific people. Oh, yeah, so this this one over here, this formula did the count. How many law the total the total number sent by the law firm?
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this one was supposed to be. So I think you need to have that done by name, not email, because sussole, they all use the same email, like Estefani uses sussole at my law. Jose uses the same email. Alexandra, a little bit Alexandra. Um, uses the same email. So you're not actually looking.
00:35:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, no, but these are, but those are the patient's names.
00:35:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, okay. All right.
00:35:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, um, I just try to count the number that, um, yeah.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is there only one person that's usually that?
00:35:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think that's their name. never heard of that name before, but.
00:35:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, yeah, so it should have counted by two, three, five. Man that that. Can we change that green? is blinding. Go ahead. I just need something. I guess that would be green, but oh, man. I have like a green, you know, when you get a flash, like the light bulb flash from a camera? That's the after effect that I'm having from that green right now. Everybody's eyeballs are weird. Everything in my body is sensitive. So sorry.
00:36:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I wonder if it's, oh, it's, I know what's happening, it's because it's, it's, looking at capillations.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so ask chat GPT if you can make it not case sensitive or we just need to be consistent and what we put in there.
00:36:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. This is, it has to do an array formula.
00:36:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:36:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right. Here we go. See if this one works. It's still, it's still in Sicily. I don't know, that's a little better. It's still only showing me Susselli sent me four. But Susselli sent me like nine, I want to say.
00:37:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it's only five.
00:37:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, it is only five. One, two, four, five. Oh, it is five. go four. Is it four or five? Why is it not counting one, though? Let me try. Let me try Yasmin.
00:37:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah.
00:37:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yasmin sent me one, two, five, six, five. That's right. Why is Susselli the only wrong one?
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know why it is because you started at row one instead of row two.
00:37:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, oh, yeah. Nice. How do I...
00:37:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here, can I fix it?
00:37:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, go ahead.
00:37:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you have C two. Yeah, that's exactly what this and do two and make that do one and that should.
00:38:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, that's fine. I'll just have to read. What if I just put a an extra row here?
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can do it. It might adjust the formula. So because generally formula is what it did, it changed the formula.
00:38:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So now can you change it again to try starting out row one?
00:38:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's try. Maybe that'll. No, it's now it's at two.
00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So that should actually work, correct. Can you write it back to one? So it starts a row above. I redid it.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you just go into the formula bar.
00:38:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One. And then. So you sleep five. Yeah. Okay.
00:38:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
had to add that extra line in there. Okay. Oh, this is awesome. right. This is going to make it a lot. Is it for him? wow, Claudia sent me a ton. Nice work, Claudia. Eugenia. Yeah, she's Leslie. She's been with me. Oh, I'll see. Thank you. I'll see. Diego was lagging last week. only sent me three. Come on. Where's Thelma? Thelma only sent me two.
00:39:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ouch. It's holidays and they have kids, don't they?
00:39:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's true. That's true.
00:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everybody's been kind of. Well, but also, things have just slowed down a lot.
00:39:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:39:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A lot. Like, a lot, a lot. We're, the numbers just have been, we just, I just had my meeting with Mark and so our needs and cases are way down this month. In fact, almost nothing, hardly anything came in last week at all.
00:39:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:39:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, it's just the time of the year. And it may be like that next week also, probably.
00:39:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That makes sense. Yeah.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would imagine the second week of January is probably the influx when people, like I think the first week back, they're still just kind of in that brain fog and that hangover state of just, you know, different rhythm. It'll be interesting to see. It's also interesting, and I want to point this out to you, how easy it is to forget the tools and please don't use those bright eyes.
00:40:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, we'll do that one.
00:40:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have these old lady eyes for you.
00:40:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There we go.
00:40:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But how easy it is to forget why you're doing something, how to get to things optimally when you're not doing it on a day to day. a basis or spending, you know, just getting a habit of using chat GPT for programming, saying, this is what I'm doing. Is there a better way to do this? You know, that type of thing. Because there's been a few times we've gotten on here and we've done a version of something we did before, and it's almost like, oh, yeah, I forgot. So what I want you to get into the habit of doing is kind of just asking yourself. And I think part of it is your blocking mechanism that you have, which is, I don't want to do that much work. this isn't a judgment, it's just an awareness. If we figure out what are our self sabotaging mechanisms, then we can improve them, right? we can stop them. So anyway, because there's some powerful resources at our fingertips and then look at what does it do for you so by being able to do account if statement or an array statement because we found out that we're not putting in things case sensitive right consistently. Now look at the way that you felt about Claudia like wow like eight in a week that's awesome that's a powerful partner to be having that's somebody you want to spend a lot of you send a lot of thanks to and really appreciate so that is the reason why we do these detailed things there comes this awareness that is significant it was already happening you didn't know to what level and to appreciate it fully that is the point of the data analysis is that perspective that value you know what i mean yep my cannons Alright, this is good. So formatting and structure wise though, let me look at this, just make sure, you know, can we, basically we want to formulate it so that, you know what we should do is set up the structure with the formula and make that as a template. So next to the new week and so then you duplicate that instead of duplicate the previous week when you get new numbers.
00:43:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that would be fancy.
00:43:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's go ahead and format this the way that you want to. Sorry. I'm not bringing myself water. Yes, I did. And then we'll create the template sheet that your Paul will then. Oh, so bright.
00:43:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Huh.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's ours, I know you're not a web designer because there we go.
00:44:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So first, we copy the data from the master spreadsheet, then we input the formula to count the number of referrals from each law firm, then we get the formula to count the number of referrals from each case manager. That's it there. And then the rest of the data on the summary sheet, unfortunately, is rather manual. But I can import this final total number. I guess I can move this here. We'll move this guy out here. Relax. Our total number is called right over here.
00:45:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what you could do instead of, like, try to block out that formula numbers, you could hide that row and then start the data pasting on the row below it.
00:45:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I like the red. You don't like the red.
00:45:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the red? Oh, no, no, that's not what I'm talking about. The yellow blocks.
00:45:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I just wanted to remind myself where I put the formula.
00:45:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, got you, because I never remember that I used a formula. Okay.
00:45:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so then I could take this little box here. How do I reference this to the other sheet? GPT.
00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:45:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want the value inbox i3 i3. to be in a different tab on the same sheet. That is the form you want to do that. All right, let's see. Okay, so it needs to know the sheet name. What's the sheet name? Here it is. Oh, wait, but that's going to be really wonky. Never mind. He's just going to to copy this. So that hundred right there will go to the summary sheet, which will tell me the total number of new referrals, 104. Cool. And then completed visits. Paul has to just manually count that right now in our Google calendar. Total number of return visits, I'll ask to manually count that completed business from California, again, manual, Washington, manual, New Mexico, manual business completed by Elizabeth, manual, Sherby, manual, Diana. It's all manual, it has to count, unfortunately.
00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I would like you to consider not saying things like, unfortunately. So it is manual, but first of all, you don't want to totally take the human element out of everything because you want somebody keeping an eyeball on your stuff, right? There's a difference between delegation and abdication. When we have technology do everything, you kind of abdicate it, right? You want somebody being aware of it. It doesn't cost him a lot of money or him a lot of time to go get that data and put it in there. And there's nothing unfortunate about the fact that one, you got a business, data to get that data reports and tells you things to help you make more money talking millions of dollars. So like the energy that we put into those words, Fuji, they matter a lot. And it's also the same part of the mechanism of yours that is deflecting the work. Everything that we do that supports that type of habit and that deflection we need to get rid of. So it's not unfortunate. It just is that we have to go manually do that.
00:48:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that make sense? Yeah, that's true. And it's pretty straightforward if I explain it correctly to him because now we've created a formula that will count the number of new referrals and the number of referrals from each case manager. And yes, now what he has to do is just very specifically look at the Google calendar and count.
00:48:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. yeah.
00:48:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We've defined it pretty closely now.
00:48:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And there's nothing unfortunate about the situation you have. an amazing business. You have a great person to help you who's really interested in getting it, getting the data, you know, and it helps him be a little bit more valuable too, going and getting these things. anyway, I just really want to focus on the energy and the intent and how we feel about getting and organizing the data.
00:49:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. While I'm on the call with you, can we also, can you also force me to clean up the other piece of data we want him to do?
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, let's do it. That sometimes we will, there will be all kinds of things, but some of the sessions should be work sessions and doing the things that you avoid. You would not be the only person modified to do that with everybody at one point or another. We just have to work through some of the things that they avoid. That's okay.
00:49:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I'm going to share with you just so it pops up on your email or you could search it. It's called clinics volume ml data.
00:49:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do have that one.
00:50:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I'm going to take out that, I'm going to rename this and call this one our monthly sheet because ultimately we want this, this is going to be the monthly data, right? Like the member you said, like a high level monthly overview, and then we could do the percent changes.
00:50:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I just need things to be a little bit more specific than monthly data. So like July clinic volume, something like that.
00:50:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you mean like the name of my company?
00:50:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, for the sheet, because first of all, I've got lots of sheets and lots of things looking at, but also we have several that were in. So we need super specific naming structures for these reports.
00:50:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so how about we'll call this one, we'll call the other one week. It's a weekly report at the end of every Friday, so we'll call this one. How's that monthly report for July?
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see monthly clinics by in this.
00:51:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, I'm changing.
00:51:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry. Okay.
00:51:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll put it. I'll put out in the name July for the ones that we're going to start using here. Okay. So we have monthly report for July.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it a visit report, right?
00:51:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Oh yeah. see a weekly. Okay. want to call like weekly visit report and monthly visit report.
00:51:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That would be really.
00:51:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We visit report. Okay. Cool. All right. So that's a little more clear. So I'll make sure that let me make a note of this or can we make a note on this on our notes. So priority priority for Paul is to fill out the weekly. e, visit report each Friday at the end of the day, and at the end of each month to fill out, or, you know, a couple days after the end of the month, is to fill out okay, so we got that, very good, very good, very good. Cool.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going
00:53:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Stop again the weekly one Oh, no, I was just I Had listed like the number months July has been operating just to keep track, but that's don't need to have that I Like knowing that I like I think it's good as we're measuring the trajectory of how we're growing because that informs pace big-time Okay, did you have that monthly visit report for july med on the column a Mm-hmm it had like the month and then it had like the not the month of Like the what number month I mean
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, I see that.
00:54:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. So now we don't need this container see I'll just put redacted or what do you say? I'm updated. And you can link to it from there in case he ever opened it.
00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can also just like archive it and put it somewhere and remove access.
00:54:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think obsolete will be fun. All right. Okay. Good. All right. So we got that. And then let's, let's revisit our spreadsheet.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
eat. You have to be more specific and that.
00:55:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
These are all hours. Oh, yeah.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
need that like one document to roll them all or?
00:55:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, you're right.
00:55:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's matter Fuji?
00:55:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Where's matter? Yes, yes. I actually I don't even know what is it called?
00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one document? Yeah, July, I'm going to rename it though, put July at the end because we have July. It'll make it easier for me to find when I've got a billion tabs open and can only see the first three letters. Okay, only I have half a billion open, but whatever one document.
00:55:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, wait, this looks the same as the monthly data one. That's what I'm telling you.
00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, we already did most of that.
00:55:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, no, no, but that's because we didn't want we wanted Paul to be blind to the revenue, remember? Oh, right, right, right, right, I should put owner only. Okay, so I'll put let me read what do you want
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I rename this one. Well, so is it data and revenue data? Yes, I definitely want to have revenue in there so that we are very clear about, first of all, what's different between this and what Paul's accessing. The other thing is, ultimately, Fuji, we could probably have everything pulled from here through formulas and then just add the revenue.
00:56:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we did. See, we actually, if you look in box 1A, we actually are importing this from monthly visit report spreadsheet.
00:56:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Box 1A.
00:56:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
A1.
00:56:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A1. Oh, there it is. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, we're pulling this from monthly visit report for July 1. Yeah, having gone through all of these spreadsheets and also still being in kind of a development stage, like both of us are forgetting some of the things that we have structural wise. But if we keep, as we keep growing, first of all, what's going to happen is we're going to build this. system and then we're going to go into just operating the system and optimizing the system and then we're less likely both of us to forget any of the things that we've been working on. But I want to make sure that we cover a couple of things really quick but I also need to be cognizant of time because I've got signs with my daughter. But I want to make sure that we've got homework assigned for next week if you plan on working on it or if you want to just really focus on family and just do you know basic operations this week which is probably prudent I think that you'll.
00:57:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah I think I think if I just kind of tread water for this week I would be that's probably what's and it's going to end up happening anyways.
00:57:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay so what we'll do when we we still meet next week and if there's nothing to report there's nothing to report and we can make it. a bi-week but what we could also do is if there's any formulas you want to improve if there's Oh, you still want to have the call. Yeah, I'm planning on it.
00:58:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're on my you're on my book.
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah But I think maybe what we could do is just you get work done Yes, because on a call with you it forces me to get work done that I say I was gonna do it Then won't then we'll plan on it being a a work thing show I'm just telling you it will work better if you spend a little bit of time on how to time Thinking about what you want to work on so you can get the most out of the time. I mean I see yes So if that's the only thing that you do homework wise, and I'm gonna tell you it will work better if you spend it Planning that today like while we're talking or like it's gonna be get off the phone rather than waiting until next Monday You will think about it much better if you start the planning now things will pop up in your head and you'll be better prepared Whereas if you deflect and wait until Monday look at goods done, but it'll be better if you plan sooner.
00:59:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, can you find I look when I I was making my calls this morning, I couldn't find the three questions that we had decided on when I do cold fun. Can you refoward that? I don't know if it was a phantom transcript. I looked through like the things you'd sent me and I couldn't find it.
00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it come up with three questions to ask.
00:59:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It was like ask for their permission. And then I was like probe them about initial consults and difficulties.
00:59:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't remember the other ones. It was like, how long did get your notes?
00:59:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, yeah.
00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People taking care of what difficulties do you have?
00:59:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, the initials or something. Anyway, if you could forward me those questions we figured out, I will implement them and try to ask.
00:59:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay, so all right. Let's do that. I'm going to wrap up because that's going to give me a few
