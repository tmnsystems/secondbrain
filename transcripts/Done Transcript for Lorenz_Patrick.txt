00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guys hear me okay?
00:00:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And hey Patrick.
00:00:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Hello.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:21 - Patrick Shahverdian
I'm doing good.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. Good. C.B. And life is crazy. have three car wrecks in my family in the last three weeks. That's wild. Do we have your case? Huh?
00:00:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
Do we have your case?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, nobody's injured. And Mark said that if nobody's injured, the car is pretty basic. So yeah, because otherwise most definitely I'm coming to sweet love.
00:00:49 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, your insurance is probably like thinking there's something wrong.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, they're probably going to drop us. The crazy thing is like nothing has happened.
00:00:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
I've never filed a claim in my life.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I got this daughter, she's gotten two wrecks, they were both her fault, and then a lady ran into me and it was, I was just, I saw her, feels like she's not really going to do what it looks like she's about to do and I slept under my breaks but it wasn't enough to completely avoid the collision but yeah she just crossed the solid white line and drove straight into me from a side street, I was like okay, did your daughter cause two accidents? yes you backed into a parked car and then she, she changed the lanes across a solid white line and I think dude was speeding behind her but also I think I just need to teach her how to use her mirrors better yeah like lessons in parenting. Lorenz how old are your kids?
00:01:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
well I've got a 15 year old, I've got a 14 year old, about to turn 15 so I'm not super excited about it.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my third driver. My other two were okay, but I'll tell you what I'm terrified of all of them. So good luck.
00:02:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, he's he's more terrified than I am.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe that's a good time. Maybe. I'm happy to be fearless, fearless children. Um, Patrick, I just realized, so I went to go see because I saw your message, the email that you sent me, which was great. And then I went to see if you had replied to my notes, and I realized they're still in draft because I never clicked send. apologize for that. But you were, you were on top of things. So, um, first of all, thank you guys for rescheduling. Um, on the fly, I appreciate it. And let me go over here. So let's start with this. Um, first of all, anybody got any When's the report anything that's just going good and you want to talk about and share into the table?
00:03:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, that would be a good week last week got, you know, uh, a $250,000 settlement, so that was good.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. like that.
00:03:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Team was pretty excited. Um, So that I mean, a lot of people were sick last week, so I mean, the win is that I would have survived that, I think.
00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. Patrick had a win last week and that was that while he was on vacation.
00:03:42 - Patrick Shahverdian
He came back and everybody had been handling business, huh? Yeah, it's very important. The team, the team has to carry us and one of us is down, you know.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm really important. How about you for last week?
00:03:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, we got subbed out and then We got the client back, so Okay, tell me about that Well, he was just upset like Very needy of communication, which we've been good at it's just one of those like having a bad day Didn't get a response when he texted. like 5 p.m So he was like I'm over it, but I've already sent a demand so the case settled the next morning Wow Yeah, and then he was still like well, I want to continue. just want to do it on my own So I kind of let us sit for little bit and I Told him like we're still gonna collect our fee even if cuz I I started getting the thought that He thinks that if he fires us that, you know, basically we don't get a fee Because he mentioned well, it's in your retainer and I said it's not And then he called back and he's like Well, I mean you guys have done a good job so far other than the little instance or whatever so
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He probably talked to somebody and found out he can't keep that money or something.
00:05:04 - Patrick Shahverdian
don't know what he was thinking, but the problem is there was also a passenger that he convinced to do the same thing, so I was like, oh, without him both back, it's good. It's a 100-case settlement, so.
00:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice job.
00:05:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. So it's a good one.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you feel like was, and I'll ask you the same thing, Lorenz. If you could highlight what the best part about how you handled that case was, what do you think it was?
00:05:46 - Patrick Shahverdian
Like the fact that the team kind of had all of the communication in the file, because, you know, the client says, well, no one's ever been reaching out to me. And this is a case where they weren't going to offer anything because he's. on is excluded on the policy, so like all those things were communicated to him before. So I kind of went over those things when I spoke with him and I think that's when he was like, kind of forgot how the case was when we got it and at the end we got the policy limits, which is like it's the best result you can get. So the fact that it wasn't a case where he was right where we kind of dropped the ball in communication. I think just having all the notes and everything about laid out about all the good things that we did kind of helped get him back because if we did drop the ball in communication then he's right and he didn't a bad job.
00:06:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Good job. I'm going to come back to that and ask you some questions about prioritization. Lorenz, same question to you. What do you feel like you did great to be able to keep that wound on that?
00:07:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
at a $250,000 case? I said, think it was teamwork being able to review the case often, stay on top of little things, client missing appointments, rescheduling right away, and being aware of high value cases, knowing what they are, so that they get reviewed, they get touched at least once a week. And then a few weeks ago, Richard Selco talked to us about doing non-quant fables, little bit better on our cases. So tell a story in our demand. I pushed that pretty hard with all of our. pushed it from that point, I've pushed it pretty hard with my team. And this is one where we had essentially have $59,000. and bills, and we're able to get the full 275 total with 59,000 bills because of the non-quants.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because of the what?
00:08:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I call them non-quants, non-quantifiable, so if they're not medical bills, they're just like how her life has changed as the accident. know, hobbies look different, and she has kids or grandkids and her ability to be able to do that. And in future care, there's a possible traumatic brain injury, then talk about that. quoted some medical studies regarding future care for TBI patients and stuff like that.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oops. So we have just a lot of teamwork. work.
00:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Teamwork and prioritization. So this was the thing I was going to come back to you on this cat and we talked about it last week and Lauren, you and I talked about it, which is now looking at all the things that have to get done each week. There's a standard operating procedure, right? Every case needs to be worked out. There are certain things that have to be done. But when it comes to priority, some cases are worth more than others. Some are have more work to do in them. Every client is important, right? case matters. neglecting any is not an option. But that doesn't mean that we can't sort of triage and prioritize according to what's most valuable. And I'll give you perspective on this. Again, taking into account that at neglect is not optional, not acceptable. So we're not talking about not taking care of somebody because they're not valuable enough. That's not what we're talking about. But like Patrick, we were talking about when you do incentive pay, one of the things that you're talking about is making sure that everybody knows that they're equally valuable and you thinking about using incentive pay to show that. But what I explained to you and I'll tell you, Lauren, I know you know this but just something to think about is that when it comes to how you show up in your job, you're not the same because you've invested in a law degree, you've invested the time in that, you've invested the money in that. on top of that, you have liability on you. You can get sued, they can't get sued. So there is a real priority. station slash kind of ranking in in hierarchy, if you want to call it in kind of in everything in life. Now, abuse of the hierarchy can get us into trouble, right? But not acknowledging it can as well. So at the end of the day, sweet law is a business. And what is the main objective of what your values are, how you treat people inside of that, that's culture, that's important. But at the end of the day, there is no business if it's not profitable. And making sure that we have the ability to pay everybody, pay everybody well, so that, you know, we've got lawyers here, like if there aren't attorneys, we can't help anybody, right? If there aren't good legal assistance, we can't help any of their good case managers, we can't help anybody, or we can't help them best. So, profit matters and just thinking about that. Again, neglect is not not negligible and not optional. So, just ranking, looking at things, how do you and how do your teams think about what has to get done every morning? Who determines priority for their tasks? Do you prioritize your day? Do you get it and you say, okay, here's my plan for the day, and here's why it's going to go down this way.
00:12:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you asking someone specifically or?
00:12:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Either one of So, he punted.
00:13:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
You can go, Laura.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you fun thing. That's what that's called.
00:13:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I actually have a bit of a system. You know, I. But, I don't know, seems like it goes to . Pretty much. By 10 a.m. So I don't know. Much of the system. I have my. I try to start each day by writing down the three priorities for that day. The three things I cannot block out without. Finishing. And then I also have. Every week I start with the 10 most valuable clients, the 10 VIPs. And I try to advance each one of those cases every week. And then. Yeah, I make kind of a plan based around those, those ideas, but honestly, like when we talk about prioritizing, you know, I'd like to prioritize my cases based on value, case value. The problem with that that I found is the, is people that call this twice a day saying they're going to fire us if we don't solve all their problems right away, and it's, you know, it's enough that, you know, I know Mark hates it when he gets subbed out and rightly so, but it, it puts, it's enough pressure that as soon as someone, you know, says those magic words, I'm going to, I'm going to replace you, then the whole day is based around them. You know, we have to solve their problems as quickly as possible so that they don't fire us. And sometimes it's, you know, sometimes it's not a big deal. Sometimes it's just a matter of, you know, holding their hands and whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But sometimes it's, you know, it's like they, we got to track down their car and they have no idea where their car is. So we're having to like doing a bunch of free work to resolve their PD. And, and then like a week later, we find out they're not interested in treatment. were just interested in solving PD, you know, it takes away a lot of time from the valuable clients, I think. So maybe it's just because that happens today and I'm kind of, that's like, that pissed me off today. So that's, that's what it's in front of my brain.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that makes sense. Um, so it could be a matter of who handles what. Inside of your cases, there are certain types of tasks that are best suited for you, right?
00:16:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, for example, you have... Hang on sec. Where... Mike. Mike, that does distributions for you, right? Well, not the only one, but Mike doesn't...
00:16:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
does other things too, but yeah, that's...
00:16:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so, um... And are there certain things in... Okay, so... Not every business is equal. Generally, when somebody is upset, it's like, I want to speak to them. the boss.
00:17:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I want to speak to the manager, head honcho, whatever.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do that because they think that's the way to get the thing resolved and to get the biggest impact. So if we take that into account and really what they want is faster resolution, better service, whatever, it may not always need to be you. What we want to get into and it is going to take a little while to kind of figure this out and it won't be standardized because every customer is different, every case is different. Every day is different. ability or your team's ability to handle conflict varies day by day, hour by hour, according to the things that we're doing. There's a baseline, but we're not always at baseline.
00:17:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sometimes we're up here, sometimes we're down here. Right? Sure.
00:17:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can kind of create a list of scenarios. Not quite like role-playing, but imagine it where like if these things happen, this is who should handle it if available, if this person is not available, then this person and this person, based off of need combined with skill. So not necessarily, so you could frame it, like somebody doesn't need to know, oh hey, you can talk to Lorenz because he's the official attorney on here. But what you could do is say, hey, let me let you talk to Mike because he's the rockstar at handling X. It's the power of the word, not the title that gave the energy and the confidence.
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Mike's rockstar at this thing or Cindy is our rockstar at this thing. She will take care of you. So now it doesn't have to be the attorney, the one that's got the liability, the one that's got all the power because you've empowered your people. people. So if there's certain types of conversations that a person's upset about, I want this or I'm going to get subbed out and you like, my people can handle this. They don't need to know what their role is. They don't know if they need to know if it's a case manager or assistant. don't have to get, and if you're in the habit of identifying and labeling people, you can stop that and just say, this is the person that's going to take care of this for you and they're the best at this. Do you know what I mean? Like it's framing. How do you, do you see any value in that, either one of you and using that to kind of make people feel like they're being taken care of by somebody capable?
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So that would take, that would come from the receptionist, the front desk people.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it can, it depends on where the call's coming from, because you could even triage locally. Let's say they pass it to you. and it shouldn't have been, right? You can say, actually, hold on a second, I'm going to give you two so and so because this is the rock star that handles this. So everybody on your team can be empowered to place the call where it would be best served according to the current needs of the day based on the cases and based on the tasks that need to happen. So whoever is most inclined to have the wait on the call on the phone for insurance companies doing monotonous minuteness, that type of thing, you know, if that's that person can handle what they can handle where ends you can handle a certain other things. I'm talking about when it comes to fires, if you don't have to be the one to put it out or whoever got the call isn't the best one for it, then you can Use your own kind of bone tree type system and direct things where they ought to go for that time, that day, those needs. Does that make sense at all?
00:21:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, I think so.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You would have to come up with some examples, right? Some types of calls, types of scenarios and some types of things on the team. So this could be an exercise that we could go through. And again, this will take a little while, because we're trying to build a framework here and kind of look at things, but you could come up with scenarios of this is the type of fire, right? This is the person calling. I'm going to sub out. And here's the sub out reasons, like, and look by you already have sub out reasons. What are the top five sub out reasons that you have?
00:21:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Either you know I'm going to, well, I don't know for sure, but I'm going to guess the first one is lack of communication.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that? If somebody changed the password on letify for me again. Well, let me turn that different browser. We use a shared letify account with Isaac and. No time to get to help me. Okay, let me go to. Trying to figure out what should be the best report. going to go and see if it drops and subouts by team, by case, by type. This is not giving me what I want. I want to report what's about reasons, let me shoot off an email, I want report report I I want want want want want to what want want want report want Okay. Sorry, but I really want to see that. What would you say? Sorry, Lawrence.
00:24:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What you thought the reasons would be? I thought number one of the lack of communication.
00:24:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how often do you feel like that's a reasonable thing? Like some people are going to say that they've been getting messages throughout the day or throughout the week. Let's say lack of communication, reasonable and lack of communication, unreasonable or unrealistic.
00:24:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
you is like a guesstimate, but I would say probably 80%. I know this is probably, I'm probably off, but that's what I would guess in.
00:25:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think, Pat, for your team?
00:25:29 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, 80,% unrealistic.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so could you kind of ballpark what you think these people are wanting versus what is realistic in terms of. First of have got a ton, like there's not a lot of data, but I'll park this.
00:25:49 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean, if you look at it from the client's perspective, right, like they send a text, they expect to be texted back right away. You don't think that we have, I mean, like for example, I don't know, 300 cases, right? It's not that we're ignoring your message that there's a list of people I need to get back to. If we've been talking all day long, and I've got to now put some time into this climb, because it's not fair for them not to get a response all day, and I stop responding to you until the next day. It's like, well, you guys don't really respond. And you can't really say, have 198 other clients that I need to get to, then they're like, well, my case is not that important. I'm still trying to figure out how to kind of raise those communications with them.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to you, do you think you and Lorenzo are asking both of you, if we had an auto reply that says your message has been received, will respond within X hours, or business hours? Has that ever been tested? We do have Lead Flowey where we have a phone automation system, and it's only for intake, I think, but there is a possibility that if there's a possibility we could set up an automation for that, so that it would auto reply to all messages, and then there's just this communication, hey, we've seen it. It also kind of conditions them every time, 100% we've seen it, somebody's going to respond, the timer has set, right? This is when we will respond within this amount of time. Just because generally most offenses come because of a failure to meet expectations, and if there is no expectation set, or if the expectation hasn't been re, that word, tip of the time. So, like, for example, maybe when the person starts up the case, okay, if you send us a text message, we will respond within x amount of time. You can count on that. Is that a part of your process at all?
00:28:17 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, because I can't. I don't know what's going to happen throughout the day. one of the problems when I started getting assistance is I was always the one that was talking to clients and I didn't have that many cases. So, I would get back to people like right away. And then as the cases grew, those same clients would, you know, kind of feel like communication dropboards, just a matter of, you know, we got more cases. So, I feel like if you start off really good with the client, like responding right away, taking every single call, it kind of hurt you a little bit on the days where you're not able to, because then it's kind of like they're not used to it. But for the most. Part of clients are pretty understanding like rarely will they send like two following types with like question marks if you don't respond with them like 15 minutes or something.
00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good trigger. Multiple question marks.
00:29:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, hold on a second.
00:29:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just think about that because that's something that we might be able to scrape and text and kind of figure out. Let's see. Maybe there's so there could be maybe two types of things that we could include in automation would be like an if this the not. If they've mentioned summing out, then we trigger, we select that in their case. And so then we triggered that respond to all messages in X amount of time thing. And then it could also trigger an automation that every time they message, hey, we've got it. We're going to respond in X amount of time. So that we were not handling all the cases that way and setting a precedent of we're going to respond to you urgently take all the calls. But as soon as we receive a signal, the very first time and multiple question marks is a good signal, right? Most people don't do that unless they're what? Yeah. That's like the one you better call like in the. Or question mark plus an exclamation point. They're not happy, right? So we could do that and that would allow us to triage again, right? According to we're potentially going to lose this case or we're dropping the ball in service or they have unrealistic expectations. But even if they have unrealistic expectations, we've paid for that lead. We've paid for the work that's processed it. So now we're in the hole right now. We need to recover that, which means even if they're unreasonable, we still need to apply everything that we can to say that case. So, whatever those signals are, and this is until we can get with an automation, you know, you can train your teams. If somebody sends you multiple question marks or a question mark exclamation point or threatens sub out, we need to be able to identify them as we need to, like, save the case, right? Then we have to figure out what's the system that's allowed for saving the case. Now, mark isn't going to tolerate abuse of you, so that's non-negotiable, right? They can't treat you badly. You can go, bye. But within that space, you know, what do we do? And also, how often does that really happen? So if it's not happening all the time, it's not a burden that we have to kind of kick-glove some people, if that makes sense, right? How often would you say that this happens on your team throughout the week, each of you?
00:32:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
like threatening to set up.
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah or just super annoyed that they're not getting fast enough to communicate.
00:32:08 - Patrick Shahverdian
Maybe like a couple times a month for my team.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that's not high volume at all. Right so then if you have a process for handling it and there's almost like this psychological thing that's happened when you've marked the case as basically it's pain in the but that's not the technical term for it right? Then everybody knows and it almost kind of probably gives you a little permission to be like okay let's just we're gonna deal with this. This is our you know few a month that we have to deal with. This isn't everybody and we've got a process for massaging this the best that we can and working this system and we're not going to drop the ball and everybody else is going to be caught. I'm normal and you know we just get through it, but like there's like this All right, know who you are. know what this is. We're gonna handle it So it gives you a little bit less stress and pressure because everybody has seen Um, that this is a threatened to sub out whatever like it's the case has been marked. What you guys think about that?
00:33:21 - Patrick Shahverdian
That would help.
00:33:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I know we have like a client demeanor tab Yeah, this one I was going to say we use that client demeanor tab I like that.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but if we could have a very specific And this would be good for my reporting too um Almost like a precursor to sub out was like from what point did we get the signal to the the point that they actually subbed out if they subbed out and And of how many cases that we got the signal did we save it? We don't track that data. I'd love to know that like you, you saved the case. How many times do we save a case that was on the chopping block? I want, I want you guys to get credit for that. I want you to see, you know, be able to track what you're doing well. So, let me write this down too. So, many times do you think that you get people like that?
00:34:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm to say that. Well, it's hard to say because we have repeat offenders like right now I'm dealing with one that her and her husband are tag teaming us. know, they're calling about what you're yesterday, every single day, and we tell them the same thing every single day, it's going to take a minute. We go shooting your lean of the hospital. It's not instantaneous. know, in the next day, sure enough, ten o'clock in the morning, we get a phone call from her and get an ear full. And then, you know, we tell her the same thing. And then her husband calls up two or three in the afternoon telling us, you know, we're not going fast enough. And, you know, if they're not negotiating it with us, unless we don't have the right kind of weight or whatever. And so, in their Spanish speakers too, so they don't know about you Patrick, but with my Spanish speakers, they always feel like there's always that feeling that we're trying to put one in over on them, or trying to take advantage of the language barrier. And so there's a lot of, we have to do a lot of hand holding to tell them, you know, We're doing the best we can. We have your best interest at heart. We don't get paid until you get paid. There's no sense in us trying to drag this out. But it's a lot of like having to repeat that over and over and over.
00:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you made a good delineation between cases and incidents that you have to deal with throughout the day.
00:36:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. And I'd say I have probably little bit more than Patrick in that sense. I probably have. Well, I have that one that's taking, you know, until it's resolved, it's going to be every day. have a sense that it's just going to be an everyday thing. But then I've got a couple of other ones they'll call once or twice a week. Just getting impatient, generally getting impatient. know, there's plenty of communication, obviously. But they're just getting impatient. They just won their money yesterday and, you know, they're getting future. picked out of their apartments. It's our fault because we're not going fast enough. We have all these things. as soon as the case manager is busy and can't say their call, then they're like, oh, going to find an attorney who takes my calls. And it's like, well, we spoke to you three days ago. I mean, we're not trying to drag this out.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. So what have you noticed any type of thing that pieces or pacifies people like that?
00:37:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I mean, like, it puts lot of pressure on the team when they do that. But I also understand their point of view is they're taking things out of the apartment. their apartment or losing their living conditions or whatever, then they're like a drowning person trying to grab at everything they see to stay afloat and we might be collateral damage. The things that appease them is showing them that we're doing everything we can, explaining to them like what the process is, what we're waiting on, that we're not just sitting on their case and putting on the back burner. That's the issue of these then, but then the next crisis happens and Patrick seems to be better at. My thing is like get to them before they can get to us.
00:38:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's actually what I was just about to bring up.
00:38:53 - Patrick Shahverdian
So how do you do that? Yeah, like I had one like that, Paula Bo, she actually subbed out, we got her back. It was another like 100 case um and I like she would like text like every other day I like 10 a.m. like any update she's like a degenerate gambler like she told us like I want money I want to like gamble all this stuff so every morning I would come in I would check if she hasn't texted us I would just text her hey Paula's Patrick just you know just wanted to let you know we're still waiting on the Medicare uh and that would help her like one I already responded to her that day so she doesn't think like they're ignoring me and to let her know like hey every day I come and I'm thinking about your case yes so the Medicare leaves not gonna come for like another two weeks yes and that was one where we just had the whole team like even Cynthia like hey this lady uh we just had to like take it head on until it closed um but sometimes you have to do um but that was the one thing where I was like if I text her before she texts me well
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's not going to be mad that I didn't reach out to her and to I already gave her information for that day Perfect so Lorenz what that that's exactly what I was going to suggest However, I would rather it if possible not be you guys. I really want to Kind of compartmentalize the tasks If it needs to be you if that's the highest value thing that you could be doing that day great If not, I feel like those are things that could be Systematized and those could be things that your assistants do potentially case managers and we work that out So again, if you've received signal of I'm not getting communicated with enough or quickly enough They automatically get marked So some kind of categorization which we can create if it doesn't exist so that it's easily sortable and identifiable So pat you've got a hundred open cases Lorenz you have 180 open cases right now So, you know That's a lot to scan through, so you really, if we have a specific categorization for unhappy with communication speed or whatever we want to call it, right, then those people will go to the morning list, whoever's logging in first thing in the morning, sending out an update on whatever it is. Now that update could be potentially scheduled at the end of the workday unless you want to wait until first thing in the morning in case there are updates that come in overnight or whatever, and you can figure out what that is because you can use email automations to schedule it for first thing in the morning, but it is done at the end of the day, and if it would be better to wait until morning than just have them do that in the morning, and they're going to tick the boxes. Hi, so and so, we just wanted to let you know, here's the current status of the case, nothing has changed since yesterday, here's what we're going to do today to push our case forward. Follow up with someone, so do this, do whatever. You don't want to lie and maybe the follow up could be also just another thing that you just have your assistance to, go down the mark and it could be email follow up phone call follow up or you can say when let's say it's the insurance company and state farm say you know they have X amount of days to get this done calling them makes zero different so on that day if we haven't heard from them first thing in the morning we're gonna call them and do this so basically just setting really clear expectations of this is everything that can be done up to this point and we've done it this is the next thing that can be done here's the window for when it can be done this is when we're gonna get it done that type of thing so there are gonna be people that are gonna be happy unhappy no matter what you do right most of them just I just want to feel like you didn't forget me and you're doing everything you can. So, if your message tells them I didn't forget you, I'm doing everything I can, but showing them how, Some of that is probably going to get a swage, what do you think, Lawrence?
00:43:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like the idea of making a list for each team and making, I'm thinking of making the case manager kind of responsible to go through their respective lists and kind of get it, sending each client an update every, maybe every couple days or something like that.
00:43:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that idea for being the case manager, especially just because that title, you can even say like, I'm the case manager. You're the attorney, but manager just kind of has a, has a feeling of I'm getting it done and taking care of you know what I mean? And it's all perception and we'll find out how people respond. on the net, there's always going to be some nuance to it. But Pat, how do you feel about that having, so would that be Elsie for you? And do you think that she could handle most of that? if you just have a system for tagging people as they need a daily update right now because they're not feeling like they're getting communicated with enough that you could write down these are the things that you need to tell her and you need to tell her whoever they are, right, whoever gets tagged this way by X time every day. Do you think that that could be something you could do? Like me personally do it or have? Well, no, delegate. Do you think that you could delegate and it be handled well?
00:44:50 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean we kind of have a system now like on Slack because we don't have that many climbs to like make
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of official list of like checking when it's like that those two last we just popped up because on that right now we don't have any other ones but so the thing about not having a very specific system is once you start scaling up and getting more clients it's too easy for things to fall through the cracks and to for when you're not in the habit of doing something forgetting oh this is what we could do to make sure that this doesn't become a problem so proactive versus reactive um you're not there yet but i would recommend thinking about it and you Lorentz as well and maybe that you create an internal channel specifically for that instead of using littify i'd rather you use littify um and we tag them that way but you can reiterate through slack and have um whoever you're kidding managers are report to you. This was my list for the day of these people or there's nobody on this list today. But basically there are certain things, so we were talking about priorities. One of the priorities is don't get subbed out. What do we do to not get subbed out? If people are upset because we're not communicating quickly enough, that's an issue. So this is a tiny little system, tiny hinges swing, big doors to make sure that we're mitigating the risk of getting subbed out as much as possible. And if you don't have it a specific process with a specific owner that is getting just scanned every day, oh, nobody there. Okay, Then when it does become something, because you know how things go, it could be nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody. Now we've got five pennies to ask who are really unhappy and want you to communicate. They've all got to be checked up on the same time and then nobody. Nobody, nobody for a while. It's not always just, you know, there's one every week, that type of thing, right?
00:47:05 - Patrick Shahverdian
Mm-hmm.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, thoughts, Lorenz?
00:47:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, I agree. I think I started doing that, kind of an intervention of that last week as getting frustrated with one of my clients who kept calling me every week to see where their money was. so I drafted an email with a timeline of the next steps and what I was going to have next. I don't hear from her in about eight days, so.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty awesome. And what you could do if it's that type of thing, and you're, you know, now we're talking about, it's going to be weeks or several days in between things, then maybe it's a once a week type thing. Maybe it's a Monday, Friday, So little things, little processes, little systems. that you could just follow to, um, help with prioritization, help with kind of triaging things. All right, um, let me go back into my notes and just like, um, when I think I'm going to start doing is talking with Mark so that um, I can get him just kind of some input because, and I picked on him a little bit about this today, is that, you know, he's not in the office a lot. There's not a lot of just overall, overall. or site. And we're working on, not that there should be like micromanaging or anything, in terms of all being on the same page and taking the best practices, and benefiting from his expertise, having, you know, doing this particular business model for a while, every office is different. And then,-lipped firms, and then pre-lipped firms that actually have integrity, that kind of thing. So one of the things he was saying is that sometimes, and he said, he's guilty of it too, is that we can be blinded by the limitations of teams. And he pointed out, Elsie, for example, said that she's relatively competent, but extremely slow. What's your take on that path?
00:49:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
She said, he said that her or she said about herself.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pieces that about her.
00:50:02 - Patrick Shahverdian
Um.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Certainly this doesn't go out of this meeting.
00:50:09 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. Um. I mean, so far it's been like pretty good. Like. Lately, I'll just kind of go through the file and give her like. Heads up on, Hey, you know, we got to get this done and get that done. And it gets done. Um. I'm not exactly sure like what speedmark wants things to go at.
00:50:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He might be wrong.
00:50:33 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah.
00:50:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He might be wrong. He might be working from past data. So. That would be something I'd want to. I'd want to correct you. And he was saying Cynthia needs to better stay in her lane. And not take everything literally said he had a group conversation about what goes into a file when we get fired. He said everything but demands and our retainer. She didn't understand that meant everything but. and needed to have it broke down exactly. and that could be maybe that she's the type of person that takes things very literally or does not take things very literally. They're different. You talk it to a nor divergent person versus neurotypical. There could be some real communication issues there. Doesn't necessarily mean one is right, one is wrong. It just means that when we're communicating, we need to be on the same page. So, Mark's perspective is not necessarily the correct one now. I don't know when the last time he watched either one of them work to have that kind of information or get that kind of feedback. We've been on your team for a few months. What is your take on LC in terms of competency and speed?
00:51:53 - Patrick Shahverdian
I mean, I like the way that she works. Like I said, for the pace that I think is helping the team. Mark wants to, like, ramp things up and us to go faster than that'll be new for me, too, because I'm kind of just, I feel things out and if I don't really get any bad feedback, then I'm like, okay, we're going at a good rate, right? But if he tells me things are too slow, then maybe I'll start thinking that she's working slow. then for Cynthia, I mean, sometimes I'm too, like, Mark will be like, hey, like, do this, like, if I've never done it before, like, it's kind of like very general instructions. And I'm like, sometimes I'll ask Mary, like, is this exactly what he wants? Or sometimes I'll like, just have him dumb it down for me. But you just got to tell me one time, right? And then after that, I know how to do it. But I feel like if you've been doing something for so many years, and sometimes you give really general instructions to somebody, do you think that they know? Like, I did it to a client today, like, I kind of told her how like, Finders compromise thing works and she was like I'm really confused and I look back at my email And it was like the most basic breakdown, which is my fault because I'm like I've been doing this for so long now And I'm like she probably understands what I'm saying, but she's never dealt with anything like probably So I went and like gave her more detail but Yeah, Cynthia you got to really like do this this and this um Which I'm okay with doing but if you like having a bad day or don't feel like Breaking it all down and it can seem like the person's incompetent So Lorenz Had talked about that serenc Cynthia likes Systems and processes and she was starting to document things that right Lorenz Yeah, yeah so Is there a way to tap into that
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, for example, if she gets an assignment, you know, say, okay, if you were going to write this down and document this as a process, what would you need to know? What do you not know to make sure that there's that you're absolutely clear? One thing that everybody needs to do, um, and I have to do this with Mark a lot, wait, what are you talking about? I need you to elaborate, you know, um, I had another client that he actually referred to me and, uh, we did that today, like half the conversation sometimes is had in our heads when you've been doing it over and over again, the story, the picture, the full visual exists in you because of your experience, because of your perspective. And it can happen with, you know, whoever you're subordinate to, whoever are subordinate to you, peers, doesn't matter. but asking and getting in the habit of asking, are you clear? Is anything confusing? Do you feel like you understand every part that needs to happen and if not, what questions do you have? So then the onus is on them to, do they have a full visual in their head? Do they feel confident that they can do it? And when something comes up, ask about it. But there are so many things to take into account when it comes to your people. Does it just show up on time? Is she loyal, seem to be loyal? Does she care about her work?
00:55:37 - Patrick Shahverdian
More than the average person would.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does she just have an overall kind of good attitude? Okay, integrity. So a lot of those things are internal compass type elements. They're internal values. can't train those. have them or they don't. They get refined over time. know, we improve and we involve. Skill is a different thing. And from what I've heard from Lauren, she and you, she is trainable even if her pace is slow. She's like a kind of slow but steady person, right? And that's the conversation I have with Mark too. And I think that we have to, we put in perspective is that there are certain types of values that also you can't just go hire anybody. Like we are always got, um, I'm really having tip of the telling guys today. Being job job, like looking for what do you call them job postings? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Anyway, we always have people out there, um, looking, looking, but we can't just hire anybody anytime. It takes a long time. Lorenzo took so long to find you, and Patrick, you too. So looking at what people do and what they can do has to be something that we take into account. So basically, imagine that everybody that you work with is either we're going to test your marble knowledge, Tony Stark or Pox.
00:57:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Lorenz.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:57:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You with me?
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you. They both have suits, right? OK, but they both have different skills and different functions. And the suits are custom tailored to their strengths and probably also their weaknesses and also their needs. What makes them special is who they are, but then it gets improved by the suit that we built. So the suit needs to be what they needed to be to support them. So it. can be systems and processes and here's the other thing I really want you to think about is mental lag time. Simple systems can reduce mental lag time so think about it being like two o'clock in the afternoon. Everybody's brains are just kind of statistically that's like the slowest time across the world for everybody mentally around two o'clock in the afternoon. So if you're sitting there trying to figure out what do I do and I've got this whole list of cases, if there is a system for prioritization and it isn't something I have to go through mentally but it's something that I get to go through categorically because we have a tagging system that automatically puts the most important things in a particular category. When my brain is tired I can just go look at that category and So that needs to be handled first, right? That's a little simple system. Another thing could be a checkbox of, hey, not sure what to work on, ask yourself this, ask yourself that, ask yourself this, ask yourself that. Based on those answers, do this, this, or this, which is very ambiguous and probably not helpful. But we can fill in those blanks and we can start to create kind of a framework or an Ironman suit for your people according to where they get bogged down most. So something I would like you guys to start paying attention to and then we got to wrap up. Man time flies. I almost like you guys. Thanks for that. like you. Even though you're hiding your face today, Lorenz, what are our anti-self? I'm now Lorenz. Join the party.
00:59:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, you hit your face last time.
00:59:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do that. I do that. Sometimes I can be anti-social, um, but Gosh thing. lost my train of thought by thinking about it being just uh, how fast it went Um, um, oh so I want would like you guys hyalurin Uh, my bearded guys should I grow up here too?
01:00:20 - Patrick Shahverdian
Who is it?
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Portuguese and me I probably could do it whatever Um, I want you guys to watch your team and You know, you're not watching them obviously over their shoulder will pass tricky. You could be a little bit, but just looking for what kind of bugs them down and You can ask them questions Which actually takes us back to Um Am I kissing my speaker James every as the audio good you guys still hear me? Yeah, okay good. Um, we talked about meeting with teams, Patrick, you and I were talking about just checking in with everybody weekly. Lorenz, we were talking about once a month for you, but Patrick, your team is still kind of new and you're getting some traction. I do like the thought about being consistent weekly, but in that, while you're talking to them, what I would like you to do is think about, oh, I know what it is because I keep opening and closing this and it's messing with my audio. Whatever. Sorry. Awesome. Just each week, you know, anything holding you back and just start taking notes and bring that to our meetings. Anything just feel like it's dragging and so what we're going to be doing is looking for patterns. Is there a certain type of thing that they tend to get bogged down on? Is it a certain type of person? We will learn. Basically, our job is we're looking at everybody going, okay, how do I design the best suit for you so you can be the best person in Sweet Law and also this is what we're doing for each of you here is we're building that for you. How do we make Patrick the best version of Patrick and Lorenz the best version of Lorenz so that we all show up as our best selves and do that best job and that comes, you know, energy, satisfaction, happiness, job fulfillment, all of those things which enrich the quality of human life. It's that giant water. That's awesome. It's good. All right, so what are you guys going to be looking at this week? What bonds are king down? Oh, I can't hear you. Did I mess up my audio? Hold on, hold on, hold on. No, it says iMac. Are you muted?
01:02:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No?
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I can't hear you. You can't hear me.
01:03:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can hear both of you.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't hear either one of you. What the heck? Hold on, hold on, on. What did you do that? It switched to Microsoft Teams. That was not this. I did not do that. Sorry. Can you hear me? Can I hear you?
01:03:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I need now.
01:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we can hear you. Yes. Okay. I never had teams on my computer before, but I just became a missionary for my church and they have to do that. And so, anyway, new tech and its mission, everything that. So anyway, what are we working on this week?
01:03:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pagging the high maintenance clients and figuring out what the bog is down.
01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And for right now, until we can come up with a system for automating it internally, like a selection and letify. Just figure out an internal system, a simple system for now that works for you. So, if somebody has, what are those signals? talked about them for potentially subbing us out.
01:04:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
are those signals that we know we're in danger? low summation points or question marks, key keywords like subbing out or other attorney or?
01:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Elsewhere, whatever, any of those things.
01:04:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The word attorney, usually you don't say the word attorney unless you're saying you're going to hire a new attorney or you think your attorney is not doing a good enough job.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so yes, so you're trying to figure out, you know, where does your team get bogged down? What is the bog for them? But you might also notice like what's the speed zone for them? What are they cruised on? That would be awesome to know. I'd love to know that. You don't want to just look for the. we want to look for the good because then maybe that's something that we can take advantage of more right whatever their speedy ad let's get some some more of that potentially not everything can shift around but but let's get some more information about everybody in specifics and then have a way of just ranking those clients where we could potentially get subdoubt as soon as we get the signal that that's a risk that we handle them differently proactively first thing in the morning case managers taking all the boxes here's what we've done here's where we're at here's what's happening next this is the timeline we'll update you tomorrow or later today if we hear anything today we'll update you no later than tomorrow like work at the verbiage but something to that effect yeah yes all right any questions no no no already then well gentlemen have a lovely rest of your week and i was 15 monday
