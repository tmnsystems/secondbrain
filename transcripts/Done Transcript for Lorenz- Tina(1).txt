00:00:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good to see you Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I was. How are you?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, how are you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I'm good. So much going on. I'm going to need to see if we can move this call, though, because we're getting into school time, and this is when the kids get in school right now. She's in theater camp, but it's the same thing.
00:00:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's getting around the same time. Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a time on Tuesdays that would work for you?
00:00:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Tuesdays. Yeah, we can do either Tuesday. Uh, or we can do it around like four here.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that it's the four PM ish, like the late afternoon. uh, can really move this thing around. I can probably do it too. Two. Um, well, this was the first one that you said one one. Yeah, I can make that work.
00:01:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me see. Let me just email Patrick real quick. This is you. I just don't want to forget to do this. So I need to take up our time with it, but, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, You Okay, let me get that off there. All right, so How's things been going since we spoke last week?
00:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. I What started out, you know, was a pretty bad month Finished off as a pretty decent month You tree above $100,000 settlements. That was good. was, it felt good. The team was definitely a little bit down by, you know, two weeks ago. Everyone was a little bit exhausted trying to chase down some more settlements. Everyone was kind of stressed out and then the hard work paid off. So everyone felt pretty good about them.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Job. How did they feel about the new incentive program?
00:03:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You mean the bonus structure? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they like it. It's just, you know, we have to get the money in to make it money.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify? Let me go open. And then if I see the report I want, I guess we'll do, oh yeah, Patrick said yes, all right, thank you guys, you guys are awesome. Well, that's going to be, I'm definitely going to need my brain on that one though, because I have to move multiple, and that's really easy for me to mess up, and I don't want you guys to get a billion emails up, oops, from one, sorry, oops. Oh, what am I going, oh yeah, let's apply. Me and browser taps, Lorenz. Alright, we're reaching to the choir. Equals, last month, because we are in August, refresh. Is that the one I want, I might want a different report. If you were going to go check your numbers, what would you do in Linify?
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. I keep track of my own numbers on that spreadsheet. I don't particularly like Lidify. I find it pretty clunky. I can use it for what I needed to do. Anything that I want extra I just do for my own with Excel.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my god is a favorite. It's a case of science. That's not what I want. Probably do you want my dashboard?
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It means reports.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which one I want. So edit this one real quick. It's not going to be what I Let's see if this one grows last month. Because the reports, I don't want to have to go to multiple reports, so I want to go to one of my dashboards. So, cases, attorney fees, actually, so, your, that's my state, don't want to buy a state, don't want buy team. Cases close my team, I want to add, okay, gross fee by team, that can't be right.
00:06:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I also don't know how often I guess those reports get updated.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One other good update as soon as I run it, if I hit refresh, which I did. You didn't just get 92,000 and then attorney fees last month, right?
00:07:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it was the attorney fees was pretty bad.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I think that can't be right either. So drop out subouts. What's other? I have dropped outside the data is two and then other is 30. Oh, 30 of 32 for two minutes. Hmm. Now we choose to. Let me go back to Mark's notes. So $1 million in and settlements $3 million, okay. So I just look at team brands, well I'm just going to click on you that should do it. Let me show my screen so I'll be looking at the same thing. Sure. Okay, okay. I'm to zoom out of my way here. I'll probably shrink this up a little bit so I can see. Oh, what am I looking at? Time period. It's probably for a month filter last month. I want to look at. Last time through. No. I'm not going to. I'm Save and run. Where's there an error? Filter, the friends. Get rid of that. I already have that. Save and run. That won't give it to me, that's not going to do it. I'll do it for this year. It equals this year. Refresh. It doesn't matter if it's my It's gross to turn me face by team. Okay, now we have just you. Which is not, oh, I think I messed up the report. That's okay, I think I fix it. Ummm. It must just be this, nope, I already clicked on a map to get one of them. I'm just going to discard that and go to a different report, see if this will work. I want to see your stats month over month this year. That's what I'm looking for. Let me do that. me go to, let's see, I don't know what matters. I don't want to turn a fees. Turn a fees this month. a fee by attorney. Oh, it's a mark reports. probably can't see it. Oh, that's everybody. I just overlook you completely. I'll see you. Tyler, Samantha, Patrick, Hank. What's this? That's a time of program. All right. What do you, how do you track your numbers?
00:12:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, with an Excel spreadsheet. Can I see what you've got? Sure. So this is how I track my settlements, my money in, I use, basically use Michelle's reports that are in Google Sheets, this is my settlements, I keep track of how many I get, keep track of the other settlements and I have not every month since last August, so I don't the name.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand why they're, like, do each of those attorneys, attorneys, have they worked on that case?
00:14:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, The name is just for me. I don't keep track of the name of cases that the other attorneys settle. I just keep track of their numbers so that, you know, I can see where I stand.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are, what are the line items then for everyone?
00:14:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So this is right here. This is my own box.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's like the cases I settled last month. This is right here.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then these are these are these numbers represent cases and settlement amounts. Also for them, just not named.
00:14:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't, I don't keep track of names for them.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that makes sense. was just. Okay. No labels, okay. So then the totals. And this is settlements, not attorney fees.
00:15:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is July settlements and attorney fees. I have the records.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So before we get into that, can we just go ahead slowly go through June, go through each month real quick.
00:15:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just take a peek at what you've got. So this was June. A lot of cases settled, but not a lot of big ones.
00:15:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And your target for settlements is three million a month, right?
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For settlements. Three million, that's the firm goal.
00:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brown goal. Okay. What is your, what is the pod goal?
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I've been setting it up 600,000.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not have one for you guys like on a pod level?
00:16:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No. Well, he's never expressed a specific pod goal. When I first started, he said my your break even number is you need to make $110,000 in fees every month. But since then we've hired new people. So I'm sure it's higher than that.
00:16:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and if it's not, it's going to be. Okay, so July, can you share on me July one more time, please? Okay, and May. And April. Can I see Megan? Oh, wow. Okay, April and March. Okay, December. Do you know how to tabulate across worksheets?
00:17:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've tried playing around with it and I can figure it out.
00:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind sharing this with me? We can work on it and do a tabulation real quick? I know I do that. So share it, Tina at ProfitDrivers Inc.com.
00:17:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
See you now.
00:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At ProfitDrivers Inc. Okay. Send that and then I will open it in ScreenShare and then I'll create a completely new tab so it doesn't mess with anything. We just get that. Wait for it to come. wait where are you asking me to log in a Microsoft?
00:18:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is that a Microsoft thing?
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay see if then should be able to do that because that is my Microsoft account. All right cool. It's in there, I'm going to you Windows on my way zoom. Okay, so we're going to create a new one here and we need this to So do we want tools? No, we don't want tools. want that. We just want average name So then we'll just do the same. We'll take these. I'm just actually going to do this for a minute Okay, so we're that big enough to see. Okay, and we're going to uh we actually don't need any of this oh my gosh can i pick the right thing please all right delete these rows and okay i don't want to delete them yet so i actually want this to be really rent and i want it to here i want it to be average and it's going to be of you that um i think you have to do comma oh let's see you Yeah, that should work, right? And then this comma, that comma, that. So you would just change this formula by adding the next sheet every month. And then that should work. So that's your average. And then we're going to drag these, drag this over seriously. So that's your average. Now we can. Oh, sorry. Hopefully I can delete that without messing with the formula. Let me check the numbers though first.
00:22:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How does Hank's average $900,000?
00:22:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. now that's when you go double check everything. Did Hank even exist back here?
00:22:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was marks that used to be marked. That's fine. Yeah. So we got it. That's the other things. We got to make sure it followed the same formula. So A, B, C, D, E, F would have to be the same across the board. Otherwise we just go and do them regularly. And so this is not correct because you will actually, it might be because I might have done it right. Hold on. So this is A, is B, B, B, B, B. Okay, so, so we can't drag this across. We just have to go do it manually. So you should be, yeah, we can't because of Mark, Nick, and Hank. They moved, and Robert even.
00:23:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, Robert.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you could do this, or if you want to spend time real quick, we could go do this manually. took like a whole minute, I think, for each row, then we'll have that data.
00:23:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd like to see how I stack up. Yep. Okay, so we got to average, and then you go to the cell that you want. And so this is Tyler's. You want to make sure that we're getting that correct, and then we put a comma.
00:23:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they make you the same format every time.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that would be the way to simplify this. If you wanted to create a new one next year or whatever, but this really doesn't take that long. to go through it. You just want to make sure that you're in the correct cell for the correct person to get the right thing. And then after you've chosen the cell, you enter a comma. Oops, there's a space. Don't mess up that syntax. And then put that word belongs and then go to the next one. And we're in Tyler. So Tyler and Samantha are that way.
00:24:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And then now they switch.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now we're October and I need Tyler. And then November. Tyler is D. Comma December. Tyler is still D.V. Comma January. He's probably that way all the way through it. We're going to make sure Tyler. make sure I missed February here somehow.
00:24:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have anywhere. You missed February.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing? Okay. So April, Tyler, there, comma, May, Tyler, June, and July, May, June, July, and turn, and that should be Tyler. So, now we'll go to Samantha, and okay, so maybe it took two minutes, but still it's good.
00:25:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's because we're noticing some issues at the same time.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
August is Samantha, I just want to make sure, because this looks a little bit, I guess it's just because it's so full on her line, oops, comma, Samantha, to go over to Samantha's Bee, November, I'm to go Samantha's Bee. Let's see, should I get my comp, okay, December, Sam, September, January, my ADD, and I really have to focus the comma, March, Sam. And there's no February, wait, yet January, March, Thank you, bye. I'm on a call. April, Samantha, we have April, so we're now going to May, comma, June, July. You ready for this? That's our average. Yep. And Patrick's and maybe do you want to get these guys yet?
00:27:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're concerned about Sam and Yeah. So now, now let's do a little bit of a difference. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to. Difference between. And. And. And then we'll do Tyler. Tyler. So it's going to be. I'm going to do this. I got to make it the same thing. So it's going to be. Equals. This minus this. And then equals this minus this. So that should be a negative number. This is how much more you are above Tyler on average and Tyler's been around longer than you hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah, Tyler's.
00:28:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's been around forever.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was minding her mouth for a minute. I don't do that very often, but I remembered I should. So, I mean, so I want to look at that as a percentage. What percentage of that? So, going to do this equals this. That can't be right. No, so it's it would be this divided by that. And I would just formulate it as a formula, no, not formula, uh, format, format, cool away, whoa, percentage. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay, and this equals that divided by that, and I'm gonna copy and paste special formula normally. So you're 132.6% out of the entire average over since August, so that's that's not quite as bad. She is, she is, she, she doesn't. Now kids, um, she's a workhorse and she is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's not a derogatory thing, but, but she's built differently. And that has to be taken to account.
00:30:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Uh, I mean, no, I, and, you know, I'm, I I'm, I'm supposed to be the nice guy, the, you know, the dad with kids, but I'm pretty competitive too. And I, I have been chasing her for the better part of the last year.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to, let's, let's, sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. This is my brain.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Please continue. Sometimes I get close, but, you know, it seems like she gets, uh, you know, well, you know, sometimes it feels like, you know, she settled, you know, one month, she settled like 30 cases. I'm like, you know, I was pretty happy with settling 23 cases that month. It's, it's just no matter what I do, it seems she's always like a step ahead, you know.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's other things that we have to look at, but she, she just, I mean, she just, she's exceptional and, uh, but there are other values that get, oh, that's one time I'm on second. Hi. Amazon, her way to get to you. And she's, she's in cosplay, so, um, fun with that. And I'm going to call. That's why she can't to you. Oh, sorry. I just, I can't get it. No, you're, you know what the pollage is for coming up. just want to make sure that you know. I'll see you when you get home. Bye. She picked up from theater council. She'd be fine that she's like and she didn't know she was gonna go dress go pick her up What's our mental name? Miriam who I like that. That's a good good biblical name November Moses's sister Good Am I in December? I'm in December Patrick. See getting my brain back on track. It's a little bit of work Okay, January Patrick That's what I'm doing right December January. That's the right thing seriously March Patrick is coming That's quite a number isn't it? But I know he gets Mark's cases so Yeah Yeah, this is definitely not apples to apples June but it's still in the number so and pretty soon it's going to be more apples to apples June july okay so we do that wait minute what went wrong august september comma comma what did i do wrong here it looks correct oh it is correct okay we're not going to worry about nick is litigation right yeah i don't i don't compare that because that's just out of interest it's not how long this hink even had cases like it's a month and a half all right let's just go I didn't get him in there, so there's the formula. We're just going to not do these guys and they don't even need to be in there because of that. Hank, we're going to drive. Oh, here's my little. Hey, I dragged you. Oh, you're just slow. Okay. Average. And let's see. Hank was June and then comma and July. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and put him in here too. And that way we'll just watch that trajectory because you know you don't want them getting in front of you, right?
00:34:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been watching him. I've been keeping track of him. I've been keeping track of the cases that. He's getting to, why is he getting the broken arm one?
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, that's intake, really, isn't it?
00:35:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of it is intake. I think some of it is also like, it's like a slam dunk. It doesn't make much business sense for Mark to like give it to me, and then I don't miss on it where I can give it to Hank, or who doesn't bonus, and then the fee can go straight to the firm instead of part of it going to my balance.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But does Mark, I mean, he doesn't have that much to do with intake, does he? Unless they specifically ask him?
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think he does. I've talked to, a of it event, but who gets the cases as far as thought.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was that before, so I want to ask and understand it again. I'm here to say, I'm here to say something. Yes, but that is something I've already been trying to dig into. So it's not necessarily motivated by the call. It's just this call. It's just like reiterated. I really want to understand that. Okay. So then. I love though that you've been tracking your number. July, July, July was above your average.
00:36:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but not money in. So yeah, it was a good month.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to get a good August as far as fees. Yeah. So let's do that now. What's, let's, I'll stop sharing and you could share your attorney fees with me.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, attorney fees, I don't, so I keep track of it through Michelle's reports. So that'll be.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But are those not just monthly or something?
00:37:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's my. Commission reports. Share this with you. Are you. Share. You see that? Yeah. So this is, it's all dated down here. I don't know. All the fees for this year.
00:37:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, oh, that's going to be a lot of numbers to look at, balanced, cover based balance, do balance, do a sweet lot. Can you break this down for me a little bit?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so really what you're looking at is firm fees right here. That's the money I bring in. This is my commission's right here. And then, so really this is the number that matters as far as like what I think we're talking about.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just for a two week period?
00:38:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, this is, yeah, two week period at the time.
00:38:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. do you have, do So, attorney fees target is what, and is it by Sweet Law or POD?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's by Sweet Law.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is that across the board monthly?
00:39:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
1 million, I believe.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's the 1 million, and then the settlements are 3 million, right, across the firm?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you only see your report?
00:39:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I can only see my report. I mean, Mark posts them on the week before the end of the month, but he hasn't done it on the last day of the month in a long time, so we don't really know who wins.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know if this is correct. So, let me go look at something really quick, dashboards. That's average, I want to total gross attorney fee by team. Let see manners, manners by owner and status active manners by, I don't miss that we want active principal attorneys to kind of figure out which report. Or look at me attorney fees. Let see if that will turn the fees this month. I should be able to customize that by... So, Mark does show you everybody's stuff is just not at the end of the month, right? Yeah, so it's not up to date. Okay, so then I'm going to take that as the sign that it's okay to look at everybody's fees.
00:41:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you see it, you just don't see. It's just the timing thing. Yeah. So it's not a privacy thing. Okay, so, oops, I almost ended the meeting. Share. I'm going to take over sharing.
00:41:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll stop sharing.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. I'll share... Get these out of my way again. Oh my gosh. Grab the window. That's not the right thing. Okay. So this is for... This says... yeah, I don't want to change this for... It should be last month. This hot-time custom. Last month. Oh, run. Yeah, save it. That's good. Okay, so the runs... that's not right. Wait, so that's not right. That's right. That's what I'm looking for, that's empty. So that's not right. All right.
00:43:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
that's what I don't like about that if I never does what you think it you want it to do. Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's what I need a note to solve. Okay. Let me go back to my notes here. All right, so we talked about scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings for your people.
00:44:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they're coming up again.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they're monthly, right? So did you just tell them, hey, this is going to be monthly.
00:44:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is going to happen every single month now? Yeah, so then it's going to happen every single month. If we need to reschedule, we're it right away kind of thing. It's not like push it out to the next month. And I think we, yeah, that's what we had discussed regarding those. And then also set goals with them. And then set goals with them, follow up with each goal. I take notes of their goals and try to follow up with these goals.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So did you create like a call agenda for those things so that you have something just to go through line item by one?
00:45:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have this. I don't know if that's but it's the same format for everybody. It's not like kind of taking notes as they you know ramble on this. It's a bunch about the same format but I I need to digitize it maybe set it to them in advance too so that they can prepare for the meeting so they're not just like uh uh uh.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah I think that that would be best because it helps mentally for that exact reason right? It helps kind of anchor them to what the purpose of the meeting is and you'll probably have a more effective meeting if everybody has the agenda even the agenda is the same thing every time, know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing. Once you get there, now it's on your mind. But you really want them to be thinking about it ahead of time. So they're not searching for the answers. They've been thinking about it, formulating it, putting into the most articulate way so that you can really comprehend what they're trying to express. And maybe just even so they are able to find the words because sometimes you can have a thought and it's kind of ambiguous in your head. know, not really clear, a little fuzzy. So in just a reminder, and maybe it could be something that you automatically schedule. So let's say it's a calendar invite on Outlook and you have a specific invite that goes out to Viri and inside of the invite, here's the notes, here's the agenda because it's the same every time. And just a reminder in the calendar invite. I think in Outlook you can probably as well, how the reminders go out like in Google, can say day before, hour before, whatever, and have multiple ones. So the reminder would show up and it would show the agenda and just reminder, please review the agenda, be thinking about these questions in advance, and then when you get to the call, ask them, did you review the agenda, did you think about these questions in advance? Yeah, because you want them to be doing their part to make sure that the call is and their meeting is as effective as possible. And that is not a second thought, but it is the priority or an afterthought, that's the word I meant. Okay. So, can you read me your agenda?
00:48:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I write down everything and so I end up with like no books.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is another reason to digitize it with a really clear title so you can find it. Yeah. Because I'm the same way and I've learned that the more those grow, the less helpful they are.
00:48:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Yep. And I don't throw them away either. So, I just, yeah. So, first we start with, you know, basically, how are you doing? Well being kind of questions like how you do feel overwhelmed. Do you have any major issues, any stress points right now that we can address? And then we go through the basically stress points from the client's end and then stress points from the firm end to see if there's anything there that we can help relieve. So, for example, Jessica had from the client end, she said, like, forty percent of her time is being spent resolving PD issues for her Spanish speaking clients. And so we talked about maybe at the intake level, we can take a few extra minutes to kind of reset expectations with clients, explain to them where personal injury attorneys were, of course, going to You know, point in the right directions when it comes to PD stuff, but really our principal concern is their injuries and kind of reset expectations so that on Jessica's end she's not constantly resolving PD issues and On the firm and She says it's PD property damage property damage.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:50:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just make it sir Now the firm end Yeah, she had you know, we talked a little bit about how she's she gets really triggered and upset whenever Mark or Mary are stressed out about the numbers and stuff like that Does it feel sometimes like they're disappointed in us a lot, so She's Just gotta try to reassure her that you know mark is kind of like me We we kind of focus on what needs to be improved and Sometimes we forget to say good job, you know, we forget to Be encouraging that doesn't mean you think any less of first. Okay, I kind of reassured her there and then we moved on to the next The next section which is goals what go I asked her to give me goals for the next 30 days that she wants to accomplish and And, you know, Jessica's very like she's like, I want to do better at this and I want to do better at that Okay, but how are we gonna quantify that? How are you gonna measure that? She's like, well You know, I think overall just and I'm like, no, no, no, you need some numbers that can help you keep track of That and another question that you can ask is what does better look like? Yeah, yeah, and I did And I haven't done right here.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does better look like?
00:51:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we said some goals about you know, collecting net, you know, cases that are stuck in collecting meds. And then we want to improve policy limit cases. So one of the big issues we have on our team is that Spanish speaking clients, they just want to get done right away. They don't, they don't care about case value, they don't care about treatment, they just want to be done right away. so we're having a hard time getting policy limits on them. And so we set a goal to get, you know, try to push for 10 policy limit cases in the next 30 days. And then one of the things we wanted was more face to face meetings with Mike or her co team member, feels like sometimes they can't redo the same work. So she wants to have, she wants to touch base with them.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then at the end,
00:53:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you create a plan for that to happen or yeah, I spoke with Mike And then I spoke to the both of them setting that expectation My the issues I did not follow up like a week a week later to make sure it was happening.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's my family so But we Did you set a timeline for? Okay, so they scheduled it to make sure it's happening. So you'll follow up on the next call and and that will be your follow up So at the very least it's gonna happen within a month. I think it's reasonable because you gave two adults a You're not micromanaging, right? You gave them an assignment They're accountable for it. So, you know, I think that that's I Don't think you dropped any kind of ball by not checking to me that would be micromanaging Did you grown people do what you said you were going to do? I'm following up, yes, following up a week later, whatever, no, you've already built this. That's the whole point of being very consistent about having these monthly meetings is, you know, unless it's urgent, if there's something urgent and it needs to be addressed because it's a major morale issue or a major financial issue, integrity, that type of thing, then you need to really step in because it's not getting handled and the cost is huge, right? The liability of not addressing it is a big deal. But if it's just overall day-to-day operations, the system following up with it monthly and then two things, one, empowering your team and two, setting very clear accountability. So, okay, you guys said you were going to get this started by next week at the late. It is. That needs to be what happens. And, you know, I'll be following up when we meet next to make sure that it happens. But when you do follow up, you know, you can, there's a couple ways to handle it. If it didn't get done. Um, neither one of them have an excuse. So Jessica asked for it. If Mike doesn't show up, but she doesn't say anything. That's on her. If Mike, um, up and it's not working well, whatever, then then that's just a talk about it, but if they showed up, then then it's good. So, and if Jessica didn't show up and Mike did, then he could say something, know what I mean? So there's no, there's really no reason to be more involved in it other than to say, okay, I hear you. Here's the plan. We're going to make it happen. Let me start the conversation between the two of you so that. that you know, as your reader, that I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this needs to happen, make it happen, that kind of thing, but from here, your job is to make it happen, not, not mind. I'm not going to call you, did you talk to her, did you do this, did you have your meeting, this is the job, you said that you need this to do your job well, make it happen. If you have issues, report the issues. Otherwise, I assume it's getting done.
00:56:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what else did she say?
00:56:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So then we moved to the third section, which I call coaching, any things that I have noticed that you can use a little bit of coaching on. And last month, one of the things I noticed is that well, number one, there's a lot of time spent on non bodily injury issues, like property damage, or just like, you know, listening to your client complain. about her life and things like that so she's you know maybe spending a little bit too too much time on empathy and there's a balance right because you don't want to get subbed out every month because you're too uh too short but at the same time you know I noticed that she was missing a lot of calls because the call that she had taken 45 minutes ago was still happening uh and so kind of thing yeah same thing as John you know uh you know we talking about last time so we talked a little bit about some uh being able to set down Teresa's client even if she has to say hey I'm so sorry I have to go into a meeting right now uh you know I can check in with you in a week to see if we can um if we can get this this thing resolved and then uh the other thing is case value we discussed case value and how we can better communicate with providers to make sure that even if the client doesn't want to do pain management, well maybe we can do a consultation and get an estimate, at least I guess it's more valuable on the case than just the chiropractor and MRI. If we have an estimate for a pain management dog, then there's future that needs to be considered. Even though state farm will likely not consider them, at least they have to, at least that gives us more of an argument. And then we set a date for the next meeting and that's it. That was my first monthly meeting, my first structured monthly meeting with them, so I kept it pretty simple, but if you have any suggestion of things that we can add to that.
00:58:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it starts small, be consistent, measure the results of the start, and then you make improvements based off of what you've observed. It's entirely too, you can't think of the word, but so that is not the right word, but it's to want to go big and try to over plan and strategize and make the perfect thing, but the simplest solution is often the best solution. So trying to over plan and strategize how that should go, it is not good. Generally, it's going to stay very simple, very small, and the fine tuning comes from the content on the call with the person. What issues get revealed, what things tend to show up fairly consistently for a single person or across the board, and now what they because now we've got a pattern established, good or bad, so whatever the strengths are, you want to turn that up, right? And whatever the issues are, you want to turn that down. So it's more about creating a system for revelation of what do I not know, but what do my assets, my team know, and that's it. having our conversations, reviewing you go for calls with them and just kind of riffing off of what you learned, combine your experience with my experience, know, none of us are perfect at any of this, but, you know, two has better than one kind of thing, as long as it's a good head. mean, some people are just kind of, yeah, think Mark does a good job hiring people. for next. And it's interesting, too, because there's a variety of personalities and skills and ability, and that's one of my favorite things about it, though, is seeing the shifting across teams and how people show up differently on different teams.
01:01:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know. I think that's why I learned a lot from you last year, is to kind of play to each team members' strength and not try to force them to a square pet into just a round hole.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and not playing to their weaknesses per se, but figuring out what you can do sometimes to mitigate the weakness or, I mean, sometimes it's training, but sometimes the issue is personality and brain function, like some people's brains just don't work analytically or in the same kind of systematic way, and some cannot. deal with chaos like Cynthia, like it has to be structured or she's overwhelmed. And that's not a fault. She literally cannot choose to be a different way. So trying to compel her to be a different way, not only is it can't it's not going to be successful, but eventually that would just that could break a person. That's real depression. That's real anxiety.
01:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's real health. That's I couldn't see that. When she was on my team, I kind of could see that a little bit. She was just, you know, really getting frustrated with our style and our kind of, you know, like get it done as quickly as possible whenever you can and fit it in between function, like.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the way people procedurally do things, those things are innate and they can't be trained. You can corral a little bit, but a small percentage, whereas if you can determine what their strengths are and amplify their strengths, it's pretty easy to amplify strengths when you realize what they are with somebody and give them the resources to do that and that also will increase autonomy. Then you now have an expert who can train some things to other people. There's a whole another way about being able to take advantage of that and not everybody can. There's also a threshold for emotional pain and stress that people can handle. Like Samantha, there's no comparison, I would imagine that Cynthia and Samantha probably could not get along well at all. That could break Samantha or Cynthia. I don't know, I'm guessing, but based off of what I know about certain personality types and performances, that looks like a disaster. Samantha is not wrong for being Samantha and the way that she runs. She's not bad for it. It's just how she, then there are people who can work really, really well in that environment. But Cynthia is not wrong for how she is. She's just Cynthia. So, but we've got people who are willing to show up every day, who are willing to tell the truth and be honest, be an integrity, who care about their jobs. Those things you can't train either. They are either there or they're not. And as large as this world is, there is a shortage of those type of people who will just rather than feel entitled to a paycheck simply because they were given a job. that is a really small percentage of people and that's decreasing. So when we've got people who are willing to work, who are teachable, at least willing to be taught, there's always the mental capacity of how much somebody can be taught. Interestingly, the only person, I've only ever fired two people in my life out of hundreds for being completely unteachable on a mental, intellectual level. One of them's name was Cynthia. She was so sweet and I hated firing her, but I had to fire her because there was nothing I could do to get through to her within the capacity that I was allowed to within the corporation. But that is almost always not ever the thing. What I usually end up having to terminate somebody for is bad attitude, unwillingness to follow procedures, unwind. willingness, not inability, but unwillingness to follow procedures, the way that they treat the customers, not showing up on time, not being reliable. It was almost never a training issue, because if I could figure out what their strengths were, I could figure out how to use them well. And some everybody's got strengths. But if they don't have the foundations of showing up being an integrity, being truthful, being dependable, playing as nicely as they can with others, at least being respectful. Samantha, I think, is super aggressive, but I don't think she's disrespectful. So some people just can't handle aggressive. I'm aggressive. I've learned to tone it down, because I don't want to narrow my pool of people that I can work with. And I've been offensive unintentionally, many, many, many times, sometimes intentionally. Yes, it's the Portuguese in me, but, um, but there's also African and Filipino and all kinds of other angry people. So, wait, I'm not saying that I agree with you. Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, so having these consistent meetings, having a consistent, um, what you call it? Agenda and feedback. Let me go back to your notes. I like, um, hopefully you like that we went through and got the averages so now that you can. Yeah, I think averages is much better because it allows you to compete with yourself. Um, on a more realistic level. So there's two things that you can do. First of all, month to month, did you beat your average and also are you increasing your average because that's really what you want to see. Month to month is difficult because there's just a lot of play in the cases that you get. Yeah. And I like that you're keeping an eye on everybody else. And when you look at the averages, That's the great thing about averages is they it doesn't matter how long somebody has been there. It does because they're not given full case loads. And so you're still not doing apples and until they get full loads, right? But you're able to watch their trajectory and see how they're doing. And if you see somebody new pulling out ahead of you, maybe go like, all right, what are you doing that I'm not doing? What can I learn from you? And tapping into that knowledge base. But also you should be looking for what are you doing good? What's good about you? What are you improving on? Like really, you have to run your own race. Lorenz, because you're too, we are all too unique. We want to be inspired by our teammates, but it shouldn't be about self-deprecating.
01:08:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you know, and I struggle with that because, you know, of my thoughts and school graduated, you know, with Honors in college and, you know, got, you know, always was like at the very top. And I've been sitting in second place to Sam for a year right now. You that's bugging me.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can look at some things and we can try to break it down what you think it is, but a lot of it is probably going to be how she talks and how she communicates. And so you have to ask yourself what you value most. Do you value most being the top performer in the firm financially? Or do you value being an excellent performer in the firm and being a nice guy that makes people feel good? I'm not saying she doesn't because I don't know that makes your team feel safe. all of these values matter. So you need to decide what your most important values are and you need to rank them. When you evaluate yourself, you need to ask yourself, how did I show up on this value? How did I show up on this one? How did I show up on this one? And then month over month, did I improve on this value? Or did I at least hold steady? And then do that with all the things that matter most to you as a financial success in the company, but also in the way that you show up to your team as a leader, the way that you show up to clients. You need to measure all of the things because you're at the end of the day. First of all, we all have, we slow down, we get older, we slow down a little bit, cognitive function. There's a whole lot of things that go into play there. Having kids is a lot. It's a very difficult job. It is the best job in the world, but you can't always check that stuff at the door. Sometimes you can lose sleep over it. Sometimes what your kids are going through is popping up in your head. You're also married so whatever is going on with your wife You know and the older we get the more health issues come up and even though they're minor But all of these things like there's an accumulation That happens the older we get we care about more people We are involved with more people they take up mental space All of these things have to get taken into account and almost nobody does they're not Does not know that No, nobody does really I I'm just wondering because it seems sometimes like You know, I I want to have those values those non quantifiable values these talk about sometimes it feels like The only values that really matter at the end are the quantifiable the The You need to go have a great conversation then Lorenz and you need to say, I want to know these things. I want to know what matters. First of all, do I need to worry about losing my job and at what point would I need to worry about losing my job? And then you need to ask them what do you value and can you rank what those values are for me so that I understand it and how do you feel I show up in those values and ask them. I would like to know about the financial one. I know what those values are but I want to know are you happy with me? Are you happy with my pace? Like I know you think I can do better because I hear that all the time but what I want to know is what do you value about me and do you feel that my value is enough that if I keep going the way that I am and I'm trying to do the best I can do I need to worry about my job. If that's a concern that you have which seems that you do. Enough comes up. that I come from there's some like professional trauma that comes into it to where I know I've worked in places that you know if you have kids you're always kind of on the shopping block at then you're you're on the and no one says it but I can promise you that that's not what you have with Mark okay I promise you that I would not make a statement I wasn't confident in and it's the opposite he is very tender hearted towards families and kids and has a huge responsibility in taking care of his people as much as possible sweet lot is about the people to him I understand yeah I think that's why I'm very cautious in you know doubting him because honestly he
01:14:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
has given me no reason to to doubt him if I'm very if I'm being objective. And all of myself down actually come from my past experiences at other firms.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good to know. But you know what it markers the kind of person I think you can have that conversation with and you can blame it on me. I'm just like I'm just talking to Tina and these things are coming out and I'm realizing I've got these fears and I think they're holding me back and like like you can tell them you want to do the best that you can you can tell them what you think your weaknesses are and what you're working on you can tell them that you think your teammates some call control training which I just googled and I think that we could probably find some training even if it's through video courses. My first life was in the corporate world and a call center and tech support and when you get old people who don't know how to use a computer now this was 28 years ago so computers back then nobody plenty of friends. Everybody would be like, they thought that CD holder was a coffee cup holder. I'm not kidding you. They would say their computer doesn't work. It's not even plugged in. I'm not kidding you. That was a regular thing. So, and they were lonely and they're like, there's somebody I can talk to. No, you can't because I've got, I've got metrics I have to meet or we don't get paid. So, but if I treat you badly, then I get docked and then we lose our business because they're also measuring that. So, I had to figure out where the safe place was where I could get them out the door, they're happy about it even though they didn't get the socializing they wanted and they didn't like being told what to do, especially by a little girl, especially the men. Didn't all like that at all. It was just, you know, almost 30 years ago. So, a lot has changed since then, but that was a whole different world. Anyway, your team call control for sure could learn that. I think everybody at Sweet Law intake, especially, needs call control skills. I've been talking about this with Mark. I really just need to go find the solution for him and get people on there and training, because I think that I haven't even listened to the calls. But from what I've heard, it's got to be there's way too much allowed to happen. And there is a way to finesse a conversation so that it's handled efficiently without hurting feelings. And it still feels like care. that is a skill, and it is trainable. Everybody won't learn it as well. Anyway, so, Pondre, think about it. But if you're not sure who you're working for, I would recommend that you figure that out.
01:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I'm getting an idea. Honestly, I share those, I share this with you kind of in confidence, but also because that's You know, that's some of the feedback I'm getting from the CMs that have been here a little longer kind of, you know, they kind of get the same feeling like that, you know, they like Mark and they feel like, you know, the firms are whole values then but they It's so inscrutable sometimes, it's hard to say, it's hard to see if he thinks he's doing good job or not. And you know, I think, you know, I will have that conversation with them probably later this month.
01:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll give you one more perspective. He pays me $1,000 an hour to have these conversations with you and I have no oversight whatsoever.
01:17:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wow. Do you know anybody else that would be up for you? What's that? We should probably end this call soon we're over.
01:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I, it's not hourly. It's monthly. This is, this is my time. So it's me.
01:17:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Honestly, that that did. a lot of my confidence when we set up these calls because I know how much he values you and so if I was I know that if I was on the shopping block he wouldn't bother.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No 100% would not because there are other people that not really on the shopping block but he would not invest in. So that's also between us. Um but do you know anybody else have you ever worked with anybody else that would give you that kind of training and that kind of time?
01:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
01:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I understand that it's what you hear is get this stuff done. But um I don't know if you were listening.
01:18:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
By the way sorry for interrupting but I don't kind of the same one of the issues that I'm kind of the same as Mark is I also think about what's next. I never take the time to smell the roses.
01:19:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you really care about your people, don't you? Yeah. And you're not looking for ways to fire than you're looking for, how do I help them, right?
01:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Exactly, yeah.
01:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think that you two are, you have some similarities. There's a scripture though that says, shall know them by their fruits. How many people do you see getting fired at Sweet Law?
01:19:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I've seen in two years, I've seen one. And I've seen people leave, but getting straight up fired in one thing, because she never showed up, essentially.
01:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably pretty unique, isn't it? Yeah. How many people do you see getting suspended, terminated, like, fully berated in front of everybody? I've never seen her. And how many times have you heard somebody like complain is just about getting. two down getting threatened with our job and just high levels of stress over it. Let me just give you one more example. Cynthia is still there. I know Mark has a hard time with her too, but he still keeps her and she's easier to replace than than an attorney. So I don't tell you a lot right now. When I say you shall know them by their fruits, you can say all that you want to do and you can look like a prickly pear, but if you're soft on the inside, you know, that's what kind of fruit that we have is that at the end of the day, the people are really what matter most. The business has to be profitable for the sake of the people. What good is it to you? Sweet Law isn't profitable. You don't have a job anymore. So he has to push that. But but also tell you one more thing and then I do need to wrap up is that when we start reported this. It was supposed to be every other week. And it was mostly about marketing business building. And it was with, it was my client that Mark also works with. They were working together and he says, I need Tina in here because she does something I don't want to do, I don't do, but I need you to have her helping you. And so we got on a call and then the second week, Mark said, how do I get this weekly and how do I focus on leadership? I've never had anybody before that say, I need to work on my leadership. Now we did that, but nobody just asked and they didn't ask right out of the gate because I had asked him some questions and he and his self reflection was like, I need to be a better leader. And so he's been working on it. So I will tell you, you have a very unique person that you're working with. And if you do better because you just want to do better and make them happy but not because they're scared. That energy is different. How we operate from fear is very different than how we operate from confidence, even if we have the same exact goal. So ponder that a little bit and maybe get to know what we work for.
01:22:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's funny because I just said that's my 11 year old last night. It was just that conversation.

And this is why we all need people that we can talk to you because we know the things but sometimes we feel to recognize where we're not employing.
01:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's me.
01:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's me. It's all of us, really. It's all of us. We have to have those people. So but when you're at the top in your area and there's really not a lot of oversight from Mark. So really you're top dog and there's not a lot of people to counsel with but also you know don't necessarily want to tell your boss everything that you're worried about, especially with previous trauma. In the standard corporate world, that's just not that's just not good for business. It's not a safe thing to do. But what I'm expressing to you is that you do have a very different situation. situation here, and I would suggest that you explore it, and then ask for advice, use mark, but I think if we keep having these conversations, just inspecting how you're doing things and making these little changes, the amazing compounding effect over time you look back and you go, wow, we're all different. And it's just because we're inspecting it honestly and bull normally every week and then making some decisions based off of that and it's pretty powerful.

Well, I appreciate you showing up and, you know, not being like, oh, Lorenz, you know, you're just too nice of a guy or he's not getting it or, you know, I appreciate you. I know I take some repetition, you know, I know I can be a little stubborn in my ways because I'm probably a lot better than you think you are.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I promise you, it does mean no good to tell people things like that and to lie. I get nothing. out of it except for more work. If I were to compliment you falsely, I'd just mean my job harder. You're better than you think you are. Whatever that past trauma is, whether it's in the workplace or anywhere else, I know. But generally the best people are the ones that are the hardest on themselves and it's usually the jerks that think that they're the most amazing people in the world. It's so weird, but that's the truth. So the reason you can see your flaws so much is because you're looking for them and because you're trying to improve them, whereas an egomaniac and an narcissist is not looking for their flaws, they're looking for how awesome they are and they're working on nothing. So take that into account too. There's a balance for everything, but what I want you to make sure that you're doing every day is, what did I do good today? What was good? What did I move forward or what did I do even though it was hard? What did I do to Help somebody else be better. What did I hold myself back from when I just really want to You know take into account all the things that you did good if it was it was You know spouse related if it was parenting related if it was health related because we can't do all things all the time So you have to take all the things into account Because what you might do is go. Yeah, I dropped a ball at work hard for today But if you had a super dad day, I don't really care what you did at work that day I really don't because it all comes out in the wash But Lorenz is the one at the center of it. You're the nucleus of that world and so you have to count all the winds and You can't just go. I did all these things wrong. I'm not saying don't take stock of the things that should have been better I'm just saying count all the good things every day You'll start to feel better about yourself and not in an egotistical way You'll just recognize your power and you'll be able to let your weakness says have less power over you recognize that they're just human and tomorrow will be a little bit less weak and a little bit more strong.

No, I think that's good advice. think that's what I've been working on this year is trying to be lose my confidence less easily when something bad happens when trying to.

Okay, so this is, I know you're saying it's the last thing, but this is where your tracking is going to help you. Okay, so looking at all of your stats and having them in a spreadsheet where you can look at your monthly's, but then your average is, and you're just looking for incremental improvements. So when you go have a bad month, you go back and look at your average and go, but it only knocks my average down a little bit. So maybe the disparity between the two months are super huge. The average is going to come out and so you're going to go, you know what, bad month, shake it off, month we're on fire because we're due for it.
01:26:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's how it's going to work. I see. Now that's good. I'm glad you. but the formula's in there. going keep them going for the, you know, every month now.
01:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and that we want to track attorney fees too. So I'm going to see if there's an easy way to do that through the reporting and if not, we're going to create a spreadsheet and take Michelle's stuff and just start tracking that and whatever reports Mark gives you and we'll make our own spreadsheet and tracker because that is actually going to help you too because you'll keep it in a track of that anyways and that's good. All right, well you have a great amazing week and I will talk to you
