00:00:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, Fuji.
00:00:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you? Good. We're crazy.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on. We got a little delay.
00:00:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There we go. Wait a second. Hello.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing?
00:00:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good. This is more order now, even though you can't probably tell, but it is.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not even looking at the moment.
00:00:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, good.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Drive. Fuji, that should be open. I've got a raging headache right now.
00:00:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not good for focusing. All right. Let's get done here. And you sent me something, but I was already in meetings, my name is.
00:01:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
chance to look at it. Oh, yeah. Can I share my screen?
00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, totally.
00:01:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Let's see. So, let's see here. So, I did my calls and I fixed the sheet that we're going to do for the case manager outreach. So, I fixed the formula. So, now it counts how many referrals each individual case manager sent me. Only thing I couldn't get it to do was merge these lists. is one column and this is another. So like you'll see like Orozco is here and then she's listed over here somewhere.
00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't know how to combine these but you know Chachi Petit should be able to help you with it but it will um be able to call uh you can merge two columns and choose what your separator is so like the word and or a comma which is probably what you'd want to use um I'd have to look it up myself too how to do it but for sure you can merge um the the so I don't know about the column titles what would happen but if you're just merging like column A and column D with a comma separator starting from like row two oh it doesn't matter if it starts at the top with a thing anyway but oh you know what I forgot about this some of these we uh my staff separate some but with commas
00:03:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, like, if there's more than two emails, I haven't just listed it out on the format.
00:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's just still be able to be merged up. And if not, then the only thing would be you have a differentiator of like, you could specify a semicolon or something.
00:03:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. All right. So I did that. It's kind of manual though, but it does pull from the, like we were talking about last time, it actually pulls from the master. So I'm not copying. I still have the raw data here, just so remember the formula.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's that these are actually pulling from my actual master lien's document instead of pulling it from a mirror.
00:03:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Awesome. But it is kind of manual. My fix to this is I will add that extra formula.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll pick that one out, this merge.
00:03:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But I am going to start having my manager do. And that's what I emailed you. So this pre we did the tallies for October. We had a three. 101 total referrals. This is his email that I forwarded you.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But he counted up 300 referrals. So it's about the same as the last two months. The total number of visits we did I think was 406. Where does it say that? Oh yeah, total visits completed 406. So we're heading that 4500 range where Mark was recommending we sit. I would like to see that closer to 450 though. And then he broke it down by the number of people that each provider saw. So Elizabeth's sure be Diana and Angelina. I guess Jasmine was a vacation. actually didn't know she didn't see anyone. And you'll see towards the bottom of the email. We're keeping track of one of the pieces that has been a little bit hard to track, which was our call schedulers. Eric and share a full-time share. So Eric works four hours, and his wife, Caro, four. And so together, were eight, Ali works four hours. And what was happening was that Eric and Cara Leena were only doing like 300 calls, Ali was doing the same number, even though she was only working four hours. We were trying to figure out what happened, like what's going on, like, are they that slow? And what was happening was that they were only accounting the numbers that people picked out. And at any time, people, lot of people work.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we were just having, we're not very successful getting people in the daytime.
00:05:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So we started to track their attempts. And then when we track their attempts, Ali is still pulling above her work, like her rate, but the numbers are a little bit better now. It's like four, they're making 424 calls a month. Ali's making 276 calls a month. So it's a little bit closer to double.
00:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she's still like, what is that, 20% more? Cause that would be...
00:06:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And that's do you have an incentive program for performance, you know, program to maybe when I first started the clinic, I was actually thinking them or thinking of paying these people essentially like a certain amount of visits per schedule, meaning if they schedule 200 visits a month, I would pay them like five dollars, like I visit, like if they, or if they successfully schedule someone, I can $5.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't do that because of tracking reasons. Well, so something you could do, and I don't know how difficult it is, but again, I want to remind you that we don't want to shy away from setting up the systems and the tracking and whatever, we just want to simplify it. But I think that you should have an incentive program that's above the baseline, right? So you consistently have been performing here. Here's the baseline. by the way, this is the minimum requirement for doing. your job to keep your job. So that's for incentive. You want to keep your job, right? Now, if I want you to perform above that baseline, here's what I'm willing to give you to, you know, do better than than you're doing and the minimum work. So that's something to think about and I think it does well. And when you have people who are not intrinsically motivated to be their best, which I would say Eric and his wife probably are in LA is probably just a go-getter who's going to do good no matter where she's at. Then those types of incentives work really well and people that are already intrinsically motivated and driven to do well often will do even better with incentive because it's just in them. Everybody's got more in their tank than they're using, why they're preserving it, conserving it, depends on different reasons. And that's what the incentive and performance programs are for, is to get more out of what you have existing. It's still cheaper than training new people, placing all that stuff.
00:08:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. The thing that I didn't like about this, like these numbers, if you're looking at the numbers where it shows like the total attempts in October, when I first started the clinic, I was calling in all 80 patients, right, and I was calling in about four to five patients an hour. And when you break down the number that they called, they're calling like two patients an hour, which is like kind of ridiculous to me if you think about how long an hour is.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I would make the baseline be that.
00:08:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. was going to be like, well, I was going to actually tell them you guys need to average three calls an hour, or we're going to find someone else, period, forget the incentive, like the middle on this three, you know, I mean, like, so what's the average call time? How long do those calls last? The scheduling calls will take. about seven to 10 minutes.
00:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If they can have someone, that's. Read is low. Depends on how many calls are made and there's nobody answering. And so how much time is actually spent on the phone? Because that number, they're still not adding up.
00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that is that number. They're making 2.65 calls, even if someone didn't pick up.
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's unacceptable.
00:09:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Yeah, so. And see, Ollie, Ollie has been consistently doing better. This is the first month where it's been less than like four, but she's at 3.45. But you know, still, you've been an hour. It's not that. Is there reporting?
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there stuff that they're having to do in addition to making those phone calls?
00:09:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We hired someone else. Her name is Jessica. I actually guess Jessica's name is referenced in the little red table. But we hired her to do the paperwork for them. So once our scheduler's success, to talk to someone on the phone. Jessica comes in and does the paperwork, fills out there. We have like an appointment notification form, a text message, and Jessica does that part for them. So we've tried to take away the burden of paperwork, and we're just trying to let the schedulers just call, call, call, call, call.
00:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's what I would do. I would draw, draw, write it, piece of paper, something really very clear. three times, you said the average call of times about seven minutes. Yeah. Okay, that's 21 minutes. What are you doing with the rest of the 39 minutes an hour that you are billing me for? Yeah. Because if you, so, and I would say, never mind, I don't actually want to know the answer, but here's what I am going to tell you. If you want me to pay you for an hour, I require you to work for an hour. These numbers need to add up, or I would need to find somebody else.
00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Simple math.
00:10:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Paul and I were thinking that another thing. is they weren't tracking the missed calls. in October, we told them we want you to list all the calls that you're making, even if they don't answer. So that's why these numbers did come up. But then when we did the math, it still doesn't, it's still not coming out to the right amounts.
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when you have that conversation, give them, give the most generous version of the numbers, right? So let's, let's be generously that this is what's actually happened, even still, but you're still 30 minutes of not working time and you're billing me for it, that's called that.
00:11:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like that's how I agree.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's that. It's called that. I don't tolerate it. I tolerate a whole lot of things. And I'm willing, and you can show me where I'm wrong, show me where I'm wrong, and I'll always have that in the conversation. But if I'm not wrong, and you're okay with taking my money and doing nothing for it, we can't work together anymore.
00:11:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bye. Yeah. Yeah, I'll probably, you know, power with my manager and essentially kind of, you know, tell them, like, this is not acceptable, and I think the other thing too is I want, I have made clear in the past that if you have free time, you need to tell us, right? Like, if you have an extra 30 minutes an hour because you're ahead, I don't know, tell us and I'll find more work for you. know, there's always more work I can, you know, do. that's the other thing is they're not telling me. Even if, even if they're being very efficient, maybe there's just not people to call, which I don't think that's true. There's other work to be done, and you're right, that is just, they're just not telling us if they're finishing early. Either way, it's not ideal.
00:12:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, not only not ideal, but I think the language is really important, it's not acceptable.
00:12:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Acceptable, yeah, that's fair.
00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, so you're given autonomy, and let's say we're talking to Eric, all of them, right? you're given the autonomy, nobody's micromanaging you. But we're much given much is required. If you want the autonomy, if you want to be able to have the freedom to do your job and not be micromanaged, then manage yourself well. That's the requirement of autonomy. Use that time wisely and well, be a good steward over what you are managing. That means that if you're getting paid for nothing, your brain should tell you that's probably not what I'm expected to do and not what's required of me. So I need to either alert and report that or go get more work done or whatever. But that's not what's happening. so I would have a real conversation about what this opportunity is. And then I would remind them, hey, this is what it's like working for me. You get paid on time. You have a very like, these are the parameters with which you get to work in. It shouldn't be overly stressful, you know, unpleasant, hostile, not all of these things. This is what you get. This is what I choir and what I shouldn't even have to ask for, but really, you know, like, I really have a full-on human conversation about that. And I know that that's more words than you would generally use Fuji, but I'm going to tell you that you don't want to shortcut that. It is worth the effort to communicate very thoroughly, because otherwise, you're still not getting the results that you need out of and you're going to have to replace them soon, which will take you a lot longer than it will to just have a really good conversation. You can then store and set aside for later. And I'm even happy to help you, you know, write it and use way more words than you would to get this done, but the power of this conversation being very thorough is going to be so much better for you than multiple inefficient conversations, too short, too unclear, whatever. Do you know what I mean?
00:15:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and how do I balance, you know, Paul's role as a manager of these people and, you know, what I want? So, should this be something where we have like a three-way talk, Paul's there, I'm there, and then we have Eric there, or Carolina there, or both?
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, first I would have a conversation with Paul that's just you and him so that you're building up. So you're having a leadership training moment with him, said I've come to this awareness and here's how I got here. So, this is what I would like you to be looking at and managing in the future, but since I drop the ball and have been looking at this, I'm going go ahead and spearhead this conversation, so let's all get together and I will drive it. But once I've said my piece, if you have anything to say, you add it and you kind of take over and we'll leave with reinforcement of your, the boss, but ultimately it needs to be remembered that everyone reports to me and if I see something I'm not happy with, I'm going to handle it.
00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. That makes sense. That makes sense.
00:16:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that way you can support him, but at the same time, you like, you know, he's new. So he's just wrapping his head around everything.
00:16:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, Paul has been he was my first hire with July.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. OK, what is what is he doing? Something new that he added, right?
00:16:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, well, I kind of gave him more of the operational role to watch over everyone.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, but this role is kind of mean. OK, so that's what I mean by he's new. Like in this this realm of ownership over what's happening is new. So it's a good time to kind of maybe you've already introduced him, but reinforced like this is how we were working together, me and Paul, looking at these things. And we will be looking at them with detail. And I would also introduce an incentive program at that time so that they're not going, OK, well, now we're going to be working. for a dictator, you know, like okay now we're working for somebody who's really paying attention to what's happening and is raising the bar but is also raising the opportunity.
00:17:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah okay I like that. I think I'll have the conversation with Paul first and then essentially we'll have that conversation together with these agents and essentially say this is what we're offering like you said but this is what I expect. This is how we're tracking you. Yep okay yep.
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like it. We're good looking at that and evaluating it because that is that leverage right so I can have it.
00:17:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay let's see what else here. So yeah and then this is the sheet that we're trying to look at the number of visits. So yeah. They said four hundred six so we're up a little bit from last month and I think as we come into the winter months we traditionally see a higher number anyways so hopefully they'll bump right up into the four hundredths and stay there.
00:18:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what we're going to want to watch is the correlation between your efforts to the response. So there's primarily let's see how many of those were 315 and 91. So that's interesting that mostly all that went up was the new patient visits but not the repeats. So anyway at some point we would like to see the repeats going up which means the the outbound kind of new patient effort can I don't know it doesn't have to be so aggressive. We don't know but either way we want to keep an eye on both of these numbers, not just the total number, and look at what makes that model work. Did you end up having a conversation, or I'm trying to remember, I feel like we made the decision that you just don't want to have that attention, but in, sorry, I'm like having that conversation with myself in my head before it comes out. But in terms of either duplicating this model and trying to grow it as a way to increase your revenue. But I think that we decided not to do that right now and just try to figure out what other ways we can improve the other business revenues.
00:19:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I think we're trying to just shoot for about 450 to 500 visits as kind of maybe a middle ground because Mark was saying, know, it should I think we could push it a little closer to 500. That was kind of where I left it, then the other states, I mean, I've just been expanding to where Mark expands, just because it's straightforward to do that. But I haven't really looked at expanding into other states that he's not in and kind of recreating either the same business name or opening a new clinic completely. Mark's idea was that these insurances are tracking the doctor, not necessarily the name of the business. it doesn't matter if I call it like ACME medical clinic. They still know it's Dr. Kujinaka that does the visits. So the other option is I find another doctor MD to run it, and I be the manager of the clinic, rather than the doctor of the clinic. So that's something that I've kicked around, but I'm not super uh yeah not super motivated to do that.
00:21:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay so that's that's what I thought was the outcome of that conversation. um now last week I was talking about momentum. So right now what we're doing is a pretty good job of really wrapping our head around the operations of july and looking for how to leverage it and optimize it. But the pace is relatively slow. I would imagine you're only spending a few hours a week on this. So all I will say is if you wanted to increase the pace of uh and the results of the coaching then you can spend more time on it. do also have a brand new baby. You have a lot going on. Holidays are coming up um and honestly I think that it's a decent pace because the one thing to take into account is let's say we have uh you know an hour long session and we mega process lots of things. You can't do that a lot throughout the week, but what happens as a natural consequence of that type of conversation that we have is your subconscious kind of kicks in and solves some problems for you while you gives you some ideas while you sleep. There's also the pacing of just having the conversation and then waiting for the catch up. So you have a conversation with Paul, he needs to execute something that takes a little bit of time. So it's not that anything is going slow, but in order for us to be able to divert some of our time to the other businesses, thinking about, you know, we started in June and there's a time of just wrapping our head around it and you getting a new perspective. And with that new perspective, trying to put a framework in place. And then with that framework, actually executing the plan and the strategy. So June, July, August, September, October, over four months into this now, we're actually at a good pace. This is an excellent, matter of fact, it's an excellent pace. But I'm just letting you know in case you like you start thinking about like, well, how long does it take? So I guess the one thing is to think yourself, like, are you happy with the pace that things are going? Do you want anything to change? And basically, what it looks like is replicating what we've done in July, and then putting the same type of effort to Q and E to, and none of them are as complicated as July and Q and E. But basically, taking the same type of treatment and applying it to the other businesses, which definitely should probably be roughly 25% of the time that we've put onto July, and then, and then we'll go with Q and E, which we'll take probably a few months as well, depending on how we're doing it, probably not as long because now you understand how I'm. thinking about things and you're thinking about things differently, the way that you look at it once we get to it automatically kind of evolve as soon as we start getting into it. But I want you to think about how you feel about the work that we're doing and the pace that it's happening at.
00:24:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, nothing would have gotten done if we didn't do any of this data stuff, so I'm really happy that we're on the track to look at data. And I do, I know initially we spent several sessions on QME and my reluctance to that is that that is just adding more hours, which is fine. It pays me while I get, you know, $2,000 an hour. Where else do you make that kind of money? But I like spending the time on July because it is more of a business that I don't have to do work. I mean, I still check all the notes, but this very limited amount of time, you know, based on our napkin calculations, I could make 3,000 an hour doing July work, and not having to leave my house versus, you know, Q and E work where it makes a lot of money, but I have to spend the whole day in, you know, other cities or other things, like tomorrow I have all day in like South City or something. So I do appreciate the time we spent doing July things because I think in the end that's where I want a lot of my money to come from.
00:25:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hope this is So to that, let's do some journey about that. I don't think that we've done before, which is what will July, what can July make you if we're capped out at the threshold of, you know, no danger zone, I guess. What does that look like? Because we're not too far from it, but, you know, but I don't have to answer that question is I don't know how many cases I settle from month.
00:26:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I know the revenue, like I think I shared up until on the one document, like I have it up to August for instance, but I don't know how many cases that is, and it's because I'm tracking it like this, see, just kind of embarrassing, but we'll I'll show you some tracking is better than none. So there's that. So I gave I gave the responsibility of the in the checks. That's the thing that was like driving nuts. We gave it to my assistant named Cynthia, who works for my wife's company, and said, it opens the check. And then what she does is she lifts on the check, she finds the name like this person, Cheryl, and then she puts in the amount of the check. And then that's how I know that that file is closed off. I see in this column, all the checks that came in. But what I don't have is like the date that the checks were collected, and I guess I could just add a line. would solve the problem, I guess, really quick. didn't think of that. But like, yeah, anyway, so she just, she puts all the numbers here, but I don't know how many were collected in September or October. But my book, my bookkeeper sees the amount that was cash. So that's how my bookkeeper can say, okay, well, you got, you know, $57,000 in August.
00:27:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know like how many collected.
00:27:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, for sure, that needs to be separated. so I would start right now. Okay, take a second and tell us and do that.
00:28:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so generally you're only getting checked one at the most you're getting checked three, right? Because you don't have people coming in the four times that I've seen.
00:28:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, the only time I get two collections is when I do what's called funded cases, they pay per case. So sometimes it they even send it to me three times and then she's just like puts that number here.
00:28:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the very rudimentary collections.
00:28:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and then I only have lines for a D there.
00:28:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so just inserting a column and just naming it so collected the amount.
00:28:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I mean, it could be collected one amount and then I'll put, yeah, column the date. date of collection one.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, like that.
00:29:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right. And then I could, okay, well then yeah, then I could start pulling the data from here with the formula. Yes, exactly. Okay.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I, I literally don't know how this number, I don't I've already never at the very beginning when you told me like, if somebody asked you a question, I'm kind of just budget the answers and because you want to give them what they hear and everything and what you want to stop doing that.
00:29:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is, this is you stopping doing that. This is you getting real information, real data. Um, so, you know, mission accomplished and, and it's been an improvement. Also, I don't think it's been totally uncomfortable for you. I'm sure there's Some discomfort talking, but the thing that you should learn is that when you are Talking to the right people in your life You're we all get embarrassed for moment, but I think that there's Embarrassment and shame, you know and guilt and all these things and they're a little bit kind of different and there's degrees of it And I think anything that motivates us to be better cannot be inherently bad but When it when it causes us when it when it goes past that point and just continues to cause this pain Which could almost be defined as trauma because trauma is just pain that we live over and over again In shame our pain that we relive over and over again therefore traumatic Then then we don't want those kinds of people or those kinds of things so those kinds of things are Generally behaviors So you're modifying the behavior of instead of just lying out right, you're just like there is thing and then you've shown me, right? And that's good. And you don't try to hide it or try to budget. You're just like, this is embarrassing. But here you go. That's perfect. That is moving past whatever that that feeling was. And this is not people pleasing. Like that was a big thing for you is trying not to be a people pleaser and actually, know, live up to your potential and just do the work that needs to be done. So I just wanted to point out that that's what you're doing. And so in terms of like one of the goals that you had, now you've been doing it for months, so it's becoming a pattern. So one of the things I want you to pay attention to is if there are people that you feel like, and there's there's two aspects of this, if there are people that you feel like you can't be fully truthful with, and you still have the people, please, there's one of two things happening. Either you're not respecting them to trust them with the truth. And they, and you never even give them a chance by telling them the truth. That's on you. Or you do trust them, you do tell the truth, and you still feel ashamed, then those people don't really belong in the intimate circle of your life. Now, I don't mean like not in your life, because like my mom and I, we don't talk a lot. She belongs in my life, but not at an intimate level because emotionally she's not safe. So I can't tell her certain things I would tell other people. Anyway, that's something to think about. But it really helps us to get where we're going when we can, just be like, yeah, this isn't embarrassing. But here it is, especially when we're talking with people who are going to help us get where we want to go, because we all need those people. And in order for them to help us, we all have to be honest about what we're doing.
00:32:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So anyway, yeah, I appreciate it. Like if I know this, I move just much, this pace has been a lot slower, probably than other. people, but I do appreciate it because one of the things that, you know, if, if I only would do what I knew I needed to do, I would, I would be a lot farther. I could get a lot more things. And this, you know, clearly the bookkeeping for my, you know, my record keeping, I know this needs to be fixed. And so, you know, if anything, I appreciate these calls because it's like, oh, yeah, I definitely need to do that, you know. So I, what I'll do on this, on this front here is I'll have a conversation. So after I talk to Paul, I'll talk to Cynthia about just simply adding the data to the collection. And then also I forgot that I have, I collected, before Cynthia was helping me, I collected a bunch of other stuff that I never documented. So I will have her go through it and help me get those into the main document.
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do want to give you this perspective in terms of like comparing you to others first of all, it's not really a lot of comparison, but no, your pace is actually really good and I'll tell you why because most people have more resistance, but we had that conversation from the beginning and you just leaned into it and so these things are difficult for everyone. What I've noticed in the entrepreneurial types is we've all got this shiny object syndrome and we call it ADHD, but what comes with that is executive dysfunction and that is knowing what we need to do and not getting ourselves to do it. Now the DSM will call that disordered, the world will have you think that that's disordered, but the truth is we are the type of people that make magic in the world, we do things other people won't do, we create jobs, we innovate on a regular basis, but the mental energy that is is given towards creativity. the A.K.A. the right? First of all, there's finite energy and finite willpower, right?
00:35:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We discussed and read in the book, Switz, right?
00:35:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
recognizing that is step one. And most people don't have anybody teaching them how to recognize that because it's not in their purview naturally. And they're not going to seek it out because they're having more fun innovating and creating and, you know, being a kind of magic to the world. So you are leveling up from the majority of creators and innovators in itself by getting into this this realm of operations and administrative work that most people will never touch. And unless they're lucky, like, they have a sibling or partner that just takes over for them and recognizes, like, Ray, whatever McDonald's, I cannot think of their names, the people that created McDonald's.
00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, correct.
00:36:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, may crack. Okay. So he was the innovator behind his brother, who was like, um, he led everything. He did all the operations. He wasn't actually inventor of it. was his brother, but he was the one that supported everything and made sure it actually became a successful company, made sure that we've got menu items. You can't order off the menu like these. This is what you can do and put on the guard rails onto the business. The business would never have been successful without that person, but it also would never have existed without the visionary. And so people want to make one right and one the other and be like, you're so You create a person. If only you just behave like those, well, if they just behaved like this, there would be nothing to to behave to, you know what mean? Yeah. So it's really important to take all of these things into account, like if Fuji was a Fuji, none of this would exist to begin with. So you're not bad. You didn't do any. being bad what we're doing is up leveling from where you're at which was okay and making you even better and maybe even potentially just great so that you can meet the goals that you want to but that doesn't include just 10 million dollars you know set aside to take care of your it's having time to take care of your family the fact that you would rather have a business that allows you to stay home and work you know and be close to your kids that's not something everybody else is choosing the hustlers and grinders that have gone through four or five wives and have all kinds of kids they've got heart attacks and all those other things like we're making you're a very you're drawing a very distinct line in the sand like that's not what I want so coming up with the systems that are compatible with high-end optimized earnings as well as a leverage and optimize and happy life that that doesn't just come to you there is a mental process a thing that has to happen, there is a pace of letting go of some of the things that you might have been attached to and attaching to new things and attachments and detachments, they happen at a mental and emotional level and they don't happen quickly. So in terms of like, that's what's happening in this pace. It really can't be rushed. You can try to force it. What I have learned, because I'm a bull and I like to push, is that that backfires every single time. So you can't do much more than show up consistently, have the conversations consistently and choose something that you're going to act on for that week and then stick to it. Knowing and taking to account things like moving, having children, illness, of life, we lose family members, things that happen, holidays, all these types of things. So no, I actually think that this pace is right on track actually probably little faster than most because generally right around 90 days is we're first just creating the systems and we got into that faster because you're like okay I just want to get to this and yeah so no I think that it's good but I also think it's important to have pacing conversations from time to time to evaluate well how do we feel about what's actually been accomplished what does it mean to future pacing and projections and and that type of thing but you're getting your head wrapped around the numbers you're creating better systems for not just tracking but calculating and manipulating the data you have that's huge foundational you brought on Paul into a higher level role to help be a leader you got which we haven't talked about in a while somebody to help at home how's that going by the way I'm
00:40:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so Saturday Esther's mother, who had been with us since the birth of Mari, just permanently went home. And then to, I guess it was last Thursday, our housekeeper went full time. So, like today was the first weekday where we are by just being Esther. So yeah, Esther was watching the newborn and then I did Emmys wake up, Emmys, you know, getting ready for school, get me to school, and then I'm going to pick her up in about an hour. Yeah. Well, I'm going to pick her up in 40 minutes, no, 30 minutes, I have to leave in 30 minutes. Pick her up. So, yeah, the days, my days are going to start getting my work, my bit. And then I went to jujitsu, which has got back from jujitsu, because I leave it, but yeah, I'm probably going to start doing jujitsu maybe just twice a week now. I think that'll be fine. mean, just until Esther and I can make sure that we have everything taken care of. But that should be fine. Yeah. But yeah. Can I show you before we end my fun activity?
00:41:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:41:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go homework with you after that.
00:41:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right. I'll just make this quick. But so this is... Oh, come on.
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Were you working on a website or something?
00:41:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. So I just signed a contract to get a website developed. You know, I've been, you know, what you call it, choice paralysis between doing it myself. So I just hired a developer and he's going to make a website for me. And this is his kind of his stuff. So it's just going to be a very basic one-page website, and it's hopefully going to look better than my current site that looks like this.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, it's already better. I love that he knows the power of blue, though, because psychologically, blue is trust, and that's the reason why you see so many brands using it. Blue, green, and orange. But if you look around at the products that you have and the things that you buy a lot, you'll find there's lot of blue.
00:42:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
He said that on our call, I liked it. And so, yeah, the next is I need to fill out this document that kind of has my preferences. And I was kind of getting paralysis on this, because I was like, should I make a website to target people that are aging, or should I target people? that are like biohacking and I think I'm just going to focus on the biohackers, the people that I know are buying supplements, the people that I know are spending money, that's actually what it's about.
00:43:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if you want to tap into a market, the market is where money is being spent. so if you want to tap into a market where a lot of money is being spent biohacking, is it longevity? If they have to, but just because they want to live longer doesn't mean they have the resources for it. We know that a biohacker is making resources for it.
00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I think that's kind of the direction I'm going to choose and then I'm just really going to focus that. Once the website's made, I'm going to try my hand at Google Ads. I already have kind of a campaign of AdWords, so I'll give that a try and so least the website part will be taken care of and then that'll allow me just to focus on the ads. Like I said on the back end, I have the contracts with the imaging centers in 13 states right now And then I have the back end set up to provide doctors orders when people call from one of those states So I can cover off all of the states where I have imaging capabilities.
00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's really just a matter of selling now So I love that you're getting some traction on this too Make sure that when you look in Google AdWords that you learn negative keyword matching It's going to be very important because Google also you don't want to have a financial goal You don't want Google to be able to track your sales because they're terrible and they like to steal from people and I'm just not a conspiracy theory There's there's God people that do this as you can ask Mark about it But if they know they're going to optimize for you spending more money That's right. Yeah, I can believe that. Yes, so if they if they're like well, okay, then I don't want you to perform as well Because then you won't spend as much money. So um you you want to try But you don't want them to be able to track and have the pixel all the way through. So there's that negative keyword matching because same thing they want to maximize how much money you're spending. They don't want your campaigns actually work that well. They just want you to have hope enough that you keep spending money. So understand that that is the beast that you're working with and the negative. So what they will do is they'll in your campaign, they'll throw in a keyword that gets eyeballs but not conversions. So they know that that keyword is not a buyer keyword, but it is a clicking keyword. Does that make sense? So they will put it into your campaign. So you're paying for the clicks, but not getting a purchase. negative keywords means anytime you see one of those words that they're starting to send you traffic and you get clicks and no sales, you need to negative match that so they can't do it. So we can spend some time looking at that too. But ultimately, we just want you to understand it well enough to. higher properly, not to actually manage it and do it yourself.
00:46:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The website builder said that he would set up a performance tracker. He said we could use Google ad tracker, but if you have another one that can do website tracking, I guess it's just performance tracking, he said he'll do it. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I mean, because I was just going to use Google analytics or whatever, but if you just look at it, look it up and you get one, but it depends on what level you want to get into.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Analytics is a whole another beast because you've got heat maps and that's one particular type of and you should have a heat map on there. Google has it all built in, but if you don't want to and see what other solutions.
00:46:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The other thing is he, the website developers that I had to know what he wants to, what I'm trying to funnel people towards, he's obviously like, well, obviously people to buy, right? And I'm like, yeah, but he's like, are people going to buy without talking to you?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I think so, he's like, to have phone calls or?
00:47:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
he's like, do you want me to funnel them to calling you or to email you? like, I don't know. So I don't really know what to say, except let's try it. But.
00:47:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's two guys to look at this. And, and this is what most people do. So they go like, okay, well, what's the thing that gets me the most money? What will get you the most money as sales calls and a good sales person on the phone?
00:47:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I would like to do that because I want to hear, you'll learn the most from it. Maybe I should tell them like initially I want to funnel everyone towards like, set up a call. Yes.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll tell them. Yes. But if you, so the other thing you always want to do is be having a split test. So you need to have a split testing tool. Um, there are different ones.
00:48:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Optimize the we I said the one that you recommended split AB and he knows it. And so he's going to, he said he'll make it, uh, he'll make it split AB usable for me.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect.
00:48:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, so then split test. I said split test for Elementor or something.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Split test for Elementor. Like, I'm like, I don't know if anyone calls split AB, but it is a split test that you're doing. So, yeah, so what you'll do, and I can help you with this and coming up with some of the split tests to do. You'll test calls to action. You'll test elements on there. So, like, maybe you have a page that's just all text, but maybe there's one. There's a video and you're saying, Hi, I'm Dr. Fujinaka and what I do, blah, blah, whatever. we're going to see what kind of copy, what kind of stuff on a page gets more phone calls, but you always have a split test going on any type of website on any main page. So, whether it's a landing page, check out page. Whatever. And because you want to get and on ads, you want to split test all ads. your Google keywords campaigns, you want to have split test there. You're always trying to improve what you're doing and split tests are the fastest way to do it. And honestly, most people don't do it and they leave money on the table because of that.
00:49:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So keep that in mind. I'm going to go ahead and call should I, can I have it just like email me or is that too big of a, you know, remember we're talking about switch and make it it easy?
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He says, boy, do you want a calendar where they click and I'm like, I have no idea my schedule. Yes. Yeah. So you do. So you just, the best way to make it work and not piss off people who are coming and not waste the dollars that you're spending on ads is to make sure that everything that matters gets on your calendar, even if it's, I'm not available during this time. So you do something like Calendly, which will, you know, check with your staff and make sure so you may have some mistakes that's generally how you figure out. how to use the calendar right as you do it wrong a few times but ultimately that's how you want to have it as automated as possible unless well yeah because they're not talking to you until you make it so yeah I would recommend that you do that and then just get really good at living by your calendar okay so initially make it easy for people just to check it out book a minute talk or whatever 15 minutes yep and then uh and as I get better then I could change it but okay initially all I'll just I'll make a commitment to letting people book it almost like an instant visit with me um we cord all of those calls so we can run the transcripts oh yeah yeah that's right that's right make sure that we get the frequently asked questions make sure that we evaluate because AI can review sentimentality and responses too so when Fuji answers this way how is it received what is the temperature of that conversation And so that way, you know, maybe you've got five versions of the answer, but one of them like slaps and it's really well, and people get that. So we'll be able to optimize your answers, and then at that point, what you could do potentially is have a pre-recorded webinar that people can come to that basically is you presenting, and maybe you do it live one time, but I don't know what the volume is, but there's different ways that you could set up a pre-recorded webinar and address all those conversations that you've had. There's so many different things that we could do. could also use an AI-generated version of you that does this, and that does it well. Man, yeah, anyway, my dogs are growing nuts right now. My migraine, I'm struggling.
00:51:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right, I think that's great.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's much stuff though. There's so much, so much good things coming.
00:51:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I think the first thing I'll work on is optimizing the website to have people get book a meeting with me, and then I'll... optimizing towards biohackers. And the final thing is, yeah, I'm going to commit to at least trying Google Ads initially. We had talked about having Instagram influencers to give them a cut, know, have them make the ads for me. But I think initially I'll try Google Ads first, see how that traction I can get and see if I can optimize with that. Because if I could do that, that's something Mark knows I could ask him. And yeah, if I could get traction with Google Ads, that would be the best for right now that would be very sure.
00:52:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Another way to do it. And so the first thing I was thinking is like he were targeting people like Gary Breca or Bulletproof guy, can't think of his name, see his face, a minimum person, I can't think of his name, save my life now. Asprey, Dave Asprey. So because those say, even Dave Asprey doesn't know about this, right? So that way you're targeting his name, people searching him and then get some attention, and you know it's a biohacker if they're looking him up. But the other thing is, you know, potentially being on a podcast or like figuring out how to have a conversation with one of like a well-known biohacker that has a podcast and getting interviewed about this and, you know, drawing traffic. Obviously, some are going to siphon off to somebody else, but that's potentially something because you're, it's a new market. So raising awareness back to the book that I told you about, which was Breakthrough Advertising and Levels of Awareness in the market, is something that you're going to want to do. If you're going to do this long term, then you definitely need to raise the level of awareness that this even exists and is essential.
00:53:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you can learn your brain age.
00:53:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so let me, I'm going to share my screen now. Let me do this real quick. Okay, so, what's today, 11, 4, 24, seriously, dog knows, pretty much why everything is bold, we'll take that out, this, this is, this is a, you already kind of did this, but, um, not really, well, I don't know, so, I don't like contradicting statements because we talked about growing it and then you're like, yeah, but I don't really want to think about that right now, but then you're like, QME is in person work and July is leveraged and I can work home. So anyway, just keep pondering this, that's just the thing, um, July, so this, you should have this done by this time next week, agreed?
00:54:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:54:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do next week and then meeting with meeting about of my schedulers, schedulers how they're calling three people, three people an hour slow call rate, I guess I should say. Yeah, so that's the other thing I will take care of.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm pretty mad how much would July be earning, and we don't know this if I know, if we had 450 to 500 and that's two separate numbers I want. Yeah, visits for both. Yeah visits and I want you to at least have something significant on a spreadsheet to show me by next week.
00:55:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can you read that or?
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Let's do it. And then this for sure, by next meeting and write down, okay, this is what I'd like you to do if you can have a couple weeks since I've got a long list. Write down wins since we started coaching. For example, um, more consistent jiu-jitsu, jiu-jitsu.
00:56:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you.
00:56:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:56:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, Brazilian. Just BJJ. Thank you. JJ, because jiu-jitsu is the Japanese one, and theirs was like, you do dance movements, but there's no practical value to their jiu-jitsu. was like dancing, like memorizing moves.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. explains me the difference.
00:56:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Which one is different?
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, the original jiu-jitsu meant the gentle art. It looked like Tai Chi. Like, people.
00:56:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. You twist their arm and you, you know, rake their face and it was just dumb. Like, it's never going to happen. So, Brazilian jiu-jitsu is what I do. Okay. emphasizes like actual 100% attacking each other and practicing your moves.
00:56:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. When I'm, I'm still thinking that one day I would like to go do that. I've always loved karate and I have some black belt. um cousins and an aunt in my family and my aunt who's a black with their Asian by the way too they're have it well my cousins are Asian and Mexican and my aunt is Asian and Mexican um and wrestling with them was really fun as a kid we got hurt a lot but anyway they were the best um but my aunt who was a black belt she got in a wreck motorcycle wreck because she was that she's still bad but um she was paralyzed from here down and they're like that's gonna happen forever and this is my black belt and she's like no and she's got full mobility bag so like i'm a huge fan anyway um so so to me these are some of the things that are wins i would elaborate a little bit more on this and it's tracking the reasons why these particular things are wins some of them were just the mindset of well this costs too much to do this and it costs too much to do that but really what's the cost of not having it right like with the housekeeper and Esther about dirty dishes and the stress that it was causing her and all of that. So I would like you to think about what you feel like our wins since we started doing this. And this is as much as a validation for this, but also it's more a tracker of growth. it also kind of puts me on accountability pace because my goal is always how do I keep bringing improvement to you. And at some point we get to a threshold where I've got to work and dig deeper in order to help you continue to have growth and improvement. And so for me to be able to look at this and go, these are the things that you you agree that we've done, then it helps me to go, okay, how do I keep serving food you well? Because that's what I'm always working on. And just show up and be like, whatever's in my brain is what you get, I'm going to go feed my brain for your benefit and come back and try to bring my ego.
00:58:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, think that on a business note, I had forgotten that the lifeblood of any business is sales, right? And I for the last six months in July, I've not, I've not made a new sales call, right? I was just, I hate doing, I mean, it's uncomfortable to do them, but at the core of any business, you have to get business. And I think as long as we work together, keeping reminding me that, hey, you have to do the basics, which is call, you gotta call, connect with case managers. I think as long as I keep hearing that from you, I'm gonna, that's gonna be great, because any business I just need, I need to keep selling, I need to keep selling, that's how you do it, so.
00:59:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do that point, and we didn't talk about it, I'm out of time, but I do wanna know what kind of partners did you make on reaching out to those people, because we didn't touch that at all this week.
00:59:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I had it on HubSpot, so I did my two hours of calling. Yeah, and a couple of them, sent, I'm gonna send lunches to them with Paul tomorrow, actually. So Paul has a door dash account now, and then I got some of the case managers phone numbers, so I'm gonna send, I think, of them lunches next week, they're tomorrow.
00:59:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So technically, you failed, and you did not do your homework, because you didn't. I mean, the update that I saw on the homework from last week. Did you report? Because what I said was homework is considered not done if you did not reply.
01:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, it's not done.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so I really do those help me. And it also helps us not waste time reviewing things that you could have just reported back. This is done. This is done. is done. and I definitely have to go. I really would like to have gotten this.
