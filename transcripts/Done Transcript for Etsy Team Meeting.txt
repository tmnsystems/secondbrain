00:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My hair is crazy. were playing outside today. Just waiting for a lead start. want to make sure she has a has the link. Oh, there you are.
00:00:49 - BethanyGrace (3)
Hi.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love your smile.
00:00:54 - BethanyGrace (3)
You're so pretty.
00:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This makes me happy.
00:01:00 - BethanyGrace (3)
Now you see me then I'm not a robot.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you're not a robot. Robots aren't that sweet. It's afternoon there, huh?
00:01:13 - BethanyGrace (3)
It's 10 a.m.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 10 a.m. Okay. It is 7 p.m.
00:01:19 - BethanyGrace (3)
Here on Tuesday. Oh It's 12 hour. mean 14 hours behind.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Yeah Let's see.
00:01:30 - Lee Maureen Hina
Lee, can you hear us? Yes. Hello everyone. Good morning. Sorry. I can't turn on my video because I look miss It's okay.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We all will need to turn them off, but I just thought it would be nice to say hello to each other But we'll probably need to screen share and so we'll need to save our resources and turn video off But I just wanted to say hello and connect and Maybe sometimes we can do videos so that we can and all feel like we're working together because it's we're across the world from each other. It's wild. love technology, it's a blessing.
00:02:11 - Lee Maureen Hina
Yes.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll turn this off because I'll get distracted looking at your cute face when you're pretty dimples. Don't hide your face. Okay, let's see. I'll turn this off. I'll just get distracted looking at everybody. So I will share my screen. Make sure I get the right one. think this is another. Oh, maybe that's the right one. Hold on. Oh, go away. I'm going to need to change that. Now that's the wrong one. Okay, here we go. And in Google Drive. Okay, so Beth, you were asking about MUG. mockups. And we actually do have a lot of them. I don't know where this one is. Let's see, so I'm gonna move this, organize, move to favorite mug mockups. And I'll move this one. then we'll go ahead and check out and see what we have for. Oh, it went too fast. What we have for tote mockups. And I just thought that we could use this time each week just for a little bit. First of all, just to really feel connected as a team. And also to answer if there's any questions, maybe a little bit of training if necessary. And mostly just make sure that we've got all the support that's needed to be able to do our jobs the best that we can. So, the way that I'm looking for this, and you might have different access than I do, but if I go to home on my drive and I search here and I click on advanced search, I want to make sure that the location is anywhere, because that means if it's in my drive or shared with me, I'll be able to find it.
00:04:29 - BethanyGrace (3)
Does that make sense?
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so then I just typed in my and it would be great if both of you would do that on your computer right now, so you can see and compare what you see to what I see. What I'm going to do is do what we've done before and put our favorite mock-ups in a folder so they're easiest to access and we don't have all them there. But I would like to see how many of them you have so that maybe like I'm not moving the Christmas ones right now or the fall Halloween ones right now although we will soon. So I just want to make sure that you're able to find them so that when the time comes you can you can get them. And just let me know how your search is going since I can't see.
00:05:53 - Lee Maureen Hina
I want to drive now in the eyes of the monk. The monk.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you see a lot like on my screen?
00:06:05 - Lee Maureen Hina
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I got the wrong one. It was last modified December 22.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible. What I want you to compare is like, I have no idea how many files I have here. Let me, let me search this way. Okay, but I have a whole lot of go this way. Go just to the images. It should select everything and tell me how many I have, 337 items selected. So when I'm working on the wrong folder, you know what?
00:06:55 - Lee Maureen Hina
I think I'm on the wrong folder.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so remember I wanted you to go to home. home on your drive.
00:07:03 - Lee Maureen Hina
Okay.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I want you to click on the search, but then go to advanced search. Are you doing this also Beth?
00:07:18 - BethanyGrace (3)
Yeah, totally.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then from the advanced search, we just want to make sure that the location is set to anywhere. And then type in mug. And then what I want to know is what do you see when that happens when you click search that way? And I'll stop sharing screen and one of you can share your screen so that way I can see what what you see. So, one of you want to share your screen?
00:08:00 - Lee Maureen Hina
Wait, let me show you the line.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:08 - Lee Maureen Hina
This is lead tooling.
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:13 - Lee Maureen Hina
Monks.
00:08:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you click on the. At the top where there's the three lines and there's a check mark next to it. So you instead of a list mode, you can have it image mode. Go up a little bit. Little more, little more. Right next. Yeah, grid layout. Okay, keep scrolling. No, no, click on a folder. Anything with the word mug and it should show up here. So I want to see what files you're able to see. Good, there's lots of them. And Beth, you should be seeing something similar because you have the same shared permissions. Does your drive look like please? Yes. Okay, so you've got lots of mugs then, both of you. Okay, great. So let me go look at totes then and see what we have for totes. Okay, we've got some good totes and we've got some from one of my favorites. mock-up creators. I think she's mock studio. Let me see. I don't know, but I'll put all of these in the fair ones. We don't have a ton of them. But I'll move these to Oh, let's see. don't know. Let's not make a copy. Okay, and then I'll go to the top again. And I'll put all of these in the favorite totes.
00:11:07 - BethanyGrace (3)
I can see your screen.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on one sec. Let me go. So we've got all these totes and I'm about to go put them in our mockup folder in favorites. So organized. I should let me move. Oh, I need the copy only. So hold on to me. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Organize. Why want to let me move them? Let me click on this for a minute. I made a copy so I should own it. I'm good at details. Who I like this. Okay, so let's see if I can just move one of them. Okay, I can move that to the POD mock-ups and then do I have a let's see my favorite folder. I'm gonna my drive. Let's see if I can move all of those. Let's see if move all of can of them. Let me just try these. Top face. Oh, that's because I don't own that one. Okay, these are not the copies. Honor, I am not one of that one. Okay. Uh, some top face. All right. so now we go to top face. We should see plenty of tufts that we can use. So, um, these will work and I think I'd like to use that one. And that one. Well, let's see. Yeah, these are not white totes. That's okay. Yeah, I want to use this one and this one. Let me check out, take a look at this. That's cute. So, like, if there's one that has a sassy kind of saying, this would be a good picture of for it because of her expression. Does that make sense? So, like, if it's kind of a funny sassy, feisty type saying, we'll use this one. If it's like a mama kind of thing, or just nice, we'll use this one. And we'll just, we can play with some these different ones and see how they do, but. These will get us started. So you can download these and put them in Canva and then get the, so you'll go to Printify and see how much of the space a design takes on a tote bag and then make it match.
00:16:16 - Lee Maureen Hina
You understand what I mean?
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or do you want me to show?
00:16:24 - Lee Maureen Hina
I think it's also better to show you.
00:16:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So let's do this and prove I'm a human being. Let me go to catalog. My eyeballs don't like searching, so I'm just gonna go one part one. I'm going to to and I'm to catalog. Let's see which one she's got here, I think. see, I feel like it's that one, but she should have copy of Canvas Tote. Okay. Printify. You only have one color. Oh, okay. Beige. All of her prints, 13 by 13. I just want to make sure that we're using something that the mock up will work. Oh, we have all these different sizes too. Preview. Okay, so let me just take a look at this because I haven't done this before. We definitely are going to have to get some different mockups, so let me go back here and just close. I like that they have some different colored options, so we'll look at that. These are all the totes they have, and organic canvas tote. Kind of look like what she has there, but I'm not positive, so what I'm going to do is go to my drive and see, did I put in here? here. Oh, I remember I went search drive type shortcuts, trends on our mockups, journey marks, mock city, tote bags. She doesn't say anything other than just canvas tote. So let me see if anybody else has any more details. Trends on our mockups. don't think we have tote. No tote. Canvas and tote bags. Yeah, I don't know what this is, it just says Canvas tote bag, so it seems like it's this one, let me see hers, and the same bag, the same bag, okay, okay, See that has the the the band is on the outside and I wouldn't want somebody to get upset and go Oh, that looks different. Do you see what I mean? This stitching.
00:21:21 - BethanyGrace (3)
I didn't notice that one.
00:21:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You went?
00:21:25 - BethanyGrace (3)
I didn't notice that one.
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This stitch. So look at the stitching here. Okay. And then the stitching here. So they don't look like the same thing. So if I go back They have also the brand logo, right? Yeah, but I didn't see anything that looked like that. That's the thing. I guess maybe it's this one. Let me check if they have a different. So we'll edit, preview, color, beige. Yeah, see the handle is beige but the bag isn't. So I don't think it's this bag either because white is white. It's not the same thing. Which is really unfortunate because I don't know what tote they're using. So let me go back to bags again. Let's see that it's just that stitching is different. This is not the same either because that's a wine bag and also you can see where the handle is so much closer and it's not the same size. And then this one is the same thing they have. It just changes the handle color. Not the actual bag. So I'm very confused about what bag they're doing unless it's printable, which I don't even want to do that. So let's see. And this is why binding mockups, the right mockups, takes along. I don't know where they sell these, okay, so Printful, Tote, okay, so this is Eco Tote bag, but this is the right, you see the same? Yes, so we're going to use your printful now. I don't know, I have an account with them, we can, I may just not do totes at the moment, we might just work on mugs, but let me, let's see, do we have any white tote mock-ups here, go back, or maybe I just need to, I don't eat organic, this is the same thing, so look at this, E conscious AC8040, it says it's the same thing, but look it, it looks different.
00:25:30 - BethanyGrace (3)
It's AC8000.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, that is slightly different, isn't it? 8,000. Okay, so let me see if I can find, gosh go away. Oh, did I stop sharing? Sorry. 8, 0, 4, 0. 1, 4, 4, Let me see how totes sell. Let's see. And we're going to go. This is not what I want. Let's just go away. Come back. I'm to change the filter. By the way, we're star seller now. We still don't have a lot of sales and we had a really big problem before. The order that got messed up with the wrong color shirt, when I went ahead and ordered it again and paid for it out of my pocket, but then it shipped really slowly. So that was not fun. Okay, so this is selling for $11. That's selling for $14. Let's look at the best sellers. Best sellers are really cheap. I don't think I want to try to compete with this. At these prices. Let me look at custom tow bags. Custom maybe. Shh. Yeah, I mean, that's not even going to make any money at all. Let me just do custom top bags to get. But we may just forgo these best sellers. Look at these prices. There's no way. Yeah, I'm not even going to try to do that. So no top bags for us. Let's go look at Prunify. Oh, again, actually, one of the things I was thinking about is their gene jackets. And seeing and trying some designs on the jean jackets, which I would need to get some mockups for that. But let's see, we started $30 shipping 40. Let's see if we can see any best selling like custom. And border and this is also custom text. Look at that right there. Yes, that does look. This is a really good mockup. And let's see if people have bought. that shirt island from the shop but not for the item and details. Oh actually let me analyze the listing. So that hasn't made any money yet. 98 dollars. Okay. Let's see if I've the same. It's not quite the same. Let's go look at some more things real quick. I wonder if these are, let's see, I guess it's not right there, we're wrong dogs, we could we could. Well, we might just, so one of the things that like Cassie and other people have said is that their bread and butter is the t-shirts and sweatshirts and part of the reason for it is that people go through them so quickly, they grow out of them, they lose them, they ruin them and The cost of them, like candles, you know, you can get new ones, so candles is definitely something else that I would like to get into. But it's things that people use and keep using. tank tops, we haven't gotten in the tank tops, that's definitely something that we can do, potentially like bottoms and stuff. So, I have to do some more research. would love to get into journals also. I'm just trying to figure out how to keep you busy right now while I do some of the research that needs to be done. And ultimately, because I don't know if about basically that they're cracking down on making sure that the stuff in Etsy is supposed to be here and it's Things that are unique and that the shop owner has spent some time creating. So I'm also probably not going to use designers too much because most of them tend to create like everyone else and I want to have something unique. So this is all, this is a huge learning curve. There's a lot to figure out about it. Again, it's not a profitable business and it won't be for a while, but there's just a lot to learn. But I would like primarily, I would like it to be about uplifting and positive messages. And there's a lot of that out there, but really kind of unique, maybe deeper thinking, maybe sometimes a little bit funny but not every day kind of stuff and just kind of put our own spin on it and That's what will make it special But sometimes I get distracted with the okay, but I need to do what's popular and this that and the other thing and Really, that's never been what it's about for me It's been about putting goodness and with You know my own kind of twist on it Because I think differently, but there's a lot of people that don't see themselves represented, you know what I mean? Like they They have faith, but maybe they have spicy faith or Funny faith, you know what I mean and Just trying to to create some uniqueness. So Anyway, um, but Are you know are there jammies that have like pajama bottoms or pant bottoms? that have scripture quotes on them or, you know, symbols that let's see scripture pants and I don't know if anybody's looking for them and maybe we just kind of created a whole different movement I don't know but yeah anyway oh look at this so any thoughts you guys are so quiet I feel like I'm talking to myself the whole time which is not fun by the way I don't enjoy talking to myself I'm sorry but we're already listening well I mean I can I can just give you recorded videos if if I'm the only one talking because I mean there's no point in meeting if if there's no interaction that's what I would really like to have is like if If you have thoughts, if you have feedback, you have comments, if anything, but just being there very quiet or muted or anything like that is not, I don't think that that's very useful. It doesn't help me the whole part of all of this that's hard for me is that I'm always working on it by myself and I don't enjoy that. I don't create things for myself, but I don't like when I work with my clients, I work with their teams, but for my own businesses, I don't have that. So part of why I invest in hiring and other people is just so I can hear from them and get help working on these things. So if we're going to do calls, I would really like to hear from both of you. Are you, is that something that you can do?
00:37:52 - BethanyGrace (3)
Oh, yes.
00:37:53 - Lee Maureen Hina
For me, sorry, I mean, Yes, in the year or in the upcoming calls, like maybe I in bed can like bring something that we can share like an idea before going to the meeting.
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I love that. And it can take time. I really love these designs. This one that's like desert and it's got kind of like a faded ground look to you. And I think that that's something that we can incorporate is doing videos. But part of it is we all need to acquire more skills to be good at product research, be good at making little videos like this. There are tools that we can use to kind of simplify it. So once we figure out how to do something, we can do it over and over again. But Yeah, so Beth, do you have any ideas?
00:39:05 - BethanyGrace (3)
I just want to suggest, since we are starting a personalized personalizing customization items, have you heard the Custom Cat app? I've never heard of what? Custom Cat. Custom Cat, C-A-T. Custom Cat. And since I have a background last two years, I think we personalized the items from Photoshop, and then they will print that one. Since if C now is trending on customization, like they send some pictures, then we print that on the shirt.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we edit that and then didn't send to custom cut and they will send to the customers. So you've done that before?
00:40:09 - BethanyGrace (3)
Yes.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Custom cut, 20 to 40 percent of standard pricing. mean, yeah, customization is huge. And one of the things that we can do to kind of tweak it and make it our own is choose fonts that other people aren't using. So it's not just somebody's picture, but maybe it's a funny saying with their picture in a cool font. And we can have some different font variations. So yeah, I love that idea. And do you know anything about their prices for t-shirts? Like, how would I look at how much a t-shirt costs?
00:40:58 - BethanyGrace (3)
I don't know about that pricing. Okay But they are selling mugs Every day they sell mugs Especially those people Professional like doctors lawyers From states because they really love drinking coffee. Yeah So every day and they are They have savings on it. Uh-huh And So What makes it different than Printify that you know of that you would say oh Well in the listing that I have before we have Black Mugs and then the customers will a can I have this on the mug, sayings, the funniest sayings, then we have to edit on Photoshop and then send the preview with a shopper.
00:42:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you know that we can do that with Printify also?
00:42:24 - BethanyGrace (3)
I don't think so.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's exactly what we do, so the only difference would be that we would go create a custom order. So we would make a unique product just for that person and we can also do it with Hello Custom. So, but you think that this is easy. Do you think it's different custom cap? You know what would be great is maybe for next week. And actually, Beth, this would be a great assignment. I would love it if the two of you would even do this together, maybe. And maybe you can have, since you work on similar schedules, at least live in similar schedules.
00:43:13 - BethanyGrace (3)
I would love to, in fact, we can create a custom mug for one of you if you want.
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, so this time it would be, create a custom mug, and use Printify, and Etsy, and just create a private, like, not a public listing. I don't even care if it's a public listing, if that's the only way you can figure it out, because the odds that somebody's going to find it and buy it are pretty small, and if they do, we'll take care of them. But, see how long it takes to do a custom listing with Printify for a custom mug, and how long it takes with a custom cat. I'll go ahead and create an account, and let's compare. pair price and how long it takes to create and then make a decision on that and then maybe we spend some more time focusing on custom mugs but also custom t-shirts because it's the same thing but people want to put their faces on t-shirts and I don't know like I'm I just started to learn a little bit more about what Lee does I've seen her website I don't know what experience either one of you like what you have and I would definitely love to tap into what you already know because I'm sure that you can teach me things and and then we we cannot write better especially because this is not my primary business this is kind of a it's almost like a hobby but I don't want to think about it like I'm still running it professionally it's just not my source of income it literally just bleeds money from me right now But it's something that I would like to have to, like I said, just put some goodness in the world, but eventually, maybe it could be a good and profitable business. And I'm going to at least give it a whole year to figure that out, but I'd love to see it, see what we can do. So would you two be willing to and maybe Beth, maybe you just want to do it, but I would love to have both of you have this experience. So could you both work on and you can either do it together or separately, but create a custom mug order that has somebody's face on it. If you could download a picture from the Internet, or you can make one for yourself or a family member and we can send it to them. I'll pay for So that I can see. how the process worked for both things. Would both of you please do that?
00:46:06 - Lee Maureen Hina
Yes.
00:46:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, Beth, how about you? Yeah, sure. Okay, perfect. All right, I actually have another meeting right after this, and then my daughter is, she's cooking dinner for us and she had a question, so I need to go get to her. It was a great meeting with both of you. If you have any questions, could you please either just send it through Slack, audio, video, however works best for you. And remember that I do have a questions for Tina document, and we can also create a new file that is meeting agenda notes, so that if we have ideas for the next meeting, we can put them in there, and that way we've got something that we're working on so that when we get started, we know what we're talking about. Okay, I'm to put that on there, perfect. All right, ladies, I'm gonna go so I can go help my daughter and I will talk to you both next week.
00:47:05 - Lee Maureen Hina
Yes, see you next week again sometime, Cindy.
00:47:10 - BethanyGrace (3)
Yes, thank you.
00:47:23 - Lee Maureen Hina
Thank you.
