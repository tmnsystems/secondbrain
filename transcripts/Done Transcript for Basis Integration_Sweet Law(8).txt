00:00:05 - mark sweet
Can you hear me?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? Who has his new baby.
00:00:15 - mark sweet
I know how exciting.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, they are so cute.
00:00:19 - mark sweet
All of them. Yeah, I like.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. They're awesome. I told you I got to meet Esther right on the first call. No. Yeah, so we were talking and I thought I had seen somebody walking in the background, but the background was blurred. So it was hard to tell. And then he's talking about family stuff and he's like, yes, she's my wife. She's right here. And so she came and she sat down and she just talked to me and told me how excited she was for the coaching and. told me, you know, stuff about him and it was it was not what normally happens, but I loved it because like families are really what I'm thinking about most of the time. I'm just getting to it to the business. It's just weird. But anyway, that's me. So that was really cool.
00:01:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. And she's super techy, super smart.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you said that. And she's incredibly gorgeous.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Oh my gosh. I just like the whole family.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they have amazing energy. Sorry.
00:01:36 - mark sweet
wish I had like, you know, 200 of those funds for you because you would be the happiest person in the world.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I would be so happy. A few and far between on people like him that exist, unfortunately. Yeah, but that's why you learn to recognize them as gems when you get them. They're like, yeah, you're not normal. And my favorite thing, one of my favorite things to tell people like that. is how special they are, because a lot of times they just have no idea, they just think, you know, whatever, they usually think way less of themselves than the people who are way worse. All right, let me get my notes.
00:02:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, the other new one, I'm talking to her husband, I guess, on Tuesday?
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like tomorrow Tuesday?
00:02:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, it looks more like Tuesday.
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He makes me like, what day is it?
00:02:28 - mark sweet
don't know.
00:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how long have they been in business together?
00:02:37 - mark sweet
Since like 2012. Wow. And then in law school, he did not pass the bar.
00:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did not pass the bar? Like, ever or then?
00:02:50 - mark sweet
He's not a licensed lawyer at this point, so yeah.
00:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Are they both Asian?
00:02:57 - mark sweet
No, he's white.
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with that last name.
00:03:02 - mark sweet
Uh it's all under her name.
00:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. Oh okay.
00:03:06 - mark sweet
I've married or what the deal is.
00:03:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:03:09 - mark sweet
They have three kids together so.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm trying to get the month to date. Let's see.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
We'll see what comes of that. It's interesting if nothing else.
00:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was when I was talking to Fuji. I've been doing more so I typically don't do video calls but I've been trying to incorporate them more often especially with newer people just to get kind of like a baseline reading on people. So again that's how I got to see. Actually I was an on video at that time so Esther didn't get to meet me but anyway it adds a different layer of connection. It's just good. Where is my document? I was trying to get them. I have three minutes to get ready and then you were there early. I'm like, oh, just like Damon. Let's see. Oh, what I want to do is because I keep asking the question and I don't want to keep asking the question. Oh, I do have it. Okay, I just need to update this. So sweet little attorneys, who is doing Missouri cases? Does that just you or Patrick?
00:04:25 - mark sweet
and some just kind over to seeing a little bit.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so he's got those three cases. So let me screen share real quick and if you can just correct anything that you see for.
00:04:46 - mark sweet
So there's no more Robert, Robert's not okay.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make right. I need to have you in here for what you do.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
You got to add Sam, New Mexico.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's right there. Okay, and Hank does what? Huh? Yeah, it turns on. Okay, and what states do you do?
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Everything.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything. So Arizona, California, New Mexico, Washington. Missouri.
00:05:32 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was it. That was the whole process. wasn't where you didn't know. I don't know that.
00:05:41 - mark sweet
We've been everywhere. I'm also licensed in Texas.
00:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:05:48 - mark sweet
Samantha is too. Right.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Texas. that's just you.
00:05:54 - mark sweet
Okay. We have her applying for Illinois, Colorado.
00:05:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. So let me. But that is. You're getting questions. And Nick is working on Washington and he's going to take the Arizona bar in February.
00:06:20 - mark sweet
Patrick is going to take the Nevada bar in February and Hank is going to take the Georgia bar in February.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Yeah, because I was just thinking about this earlier this morning. Um, especially after seeing your the, you know, the month to date and looking at. where, or did I paste that in here yet? on a second. Oh my gosh, zoom is in my way. There it is. Copy. Just thinking about what we're working on in terms of leveraging existing assets and resources but expanding revenue and growth and not necessarily having to get new lead sources because that's what's difficult. So this is our strategy of expanding out into the states. But then I was thinking about making sure that I can track, first of all, who's in each of the states and the way I spelled that. And then just kind of looking at, so like we had three Missouri this month. And when we're talking about the pace that we've been growing, that three, know, that starts getting us some momentum. Even though it's not huge, we're only halfway through the month, that's significant. we started, if we got six more in Missouri every month, which I don't know that we would, but you know, it's just, it's just talking about the potential math, not the probable math. Sure. Looking at that. then also though, who's in Missouri, so if it's just Patrick, but you can do Missouri also, right?
00:08:36 - mark sweet
I'm the only one licensed in Missouri.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So how is it that Patrick can do it because he's working it up and you're technically the attorney?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah. So like, you know, Sam's not licensed in Washington, but she's working on Washington in case it's undermining.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark. Okay, because I want to also kind of keep an eye on the ceiling that might be arriving and reading so we don't have a dashboard for this type of thing so I'm just gonna kind of use a spreadsheet and this is going to have to improve over time but with you know not February is a ways away but we've got how many bars coming up at least three three yeah so three potential will see easy is not at all like end of May if they passed or not
00:10:00 - mark sweet
it takes a while.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. about a year. And that's so Georgia, Nevada is not new though.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
You waved in Nevada, right? Nope. I can't. We've been in Nevada.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
We had a Nevada bar issue, which is probably why it's on your head.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So nobody is in Nevada.
00:10:25 - mark sweet
You can't do Nevada cases right now, right?
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Correct. Okay. So Nevada would be a new, newly opened. Yep. Can anybody work in Georgia right now? Nope. Okay. So Georgia would be a new open.
00:10:39 - mark sweet
And then it would be brand new Illinois would be brand new.
00:10:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So I'm also glad though that we're getting started with the attorneys and it would be good. You know, I don't know when still, but talking with the intake team. Just building up. up kind of that momentum because if we're talking about getting into one, two, four, five new states in May, potentially.
00:11:10 - mark sweet
Yes, potentially.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're shooting for it even if it's three new states and let's say the three new states could get us six new cases every month each. If we got 18 new cases retainers every month and that would be. So matter is matters everything and retainers are because there's people retainers.
00:11:40 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? Matters are retainers.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:44 - mark sweet
What Mark? Incidences is when it's the lower number.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Incidences is the number of right? Right, right. Okay. Okay. Got it. Right. So, um, Anyway, but if we're getting, I'll just stick with retainers, because that's the number that we're tracking for the most part, like 18 new retainers every month. And then there's the compounding effect of those are open cases that are being worked for a period of a few months actively before they, you know, get to where they start to slow down a little bit. With the amount of attorneys that we have right now, like that, that ceiling will get there faster. So I just want to start plotting the course out and thinking about it because we're also still trying to increase how many retainers we're getting each month. Now, while everybody's still pretty busy right now. Lorenz is kind of capped. So anyway, just making sure that I'm getting all of the data points and that we're really looking at everything all the way around and massaging what we can trying to get and optimizing and getting more. out of what we have leveraging it, but also anticipating that at some point there's probably going to be another ceiling. We're going to have to probably hire other attorneys, but I don't know.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Anyway, so I was just thinking about 150 retainers a month for you now. We've got five main pods, I'll call it.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing with that though is that's a very basic and generic number spread across your pods when all your pods do not function the same and they don't all operate in same states.
00:13:37 - mark sweet
So while that I mean that math to me is like not even dirty that's just right so it's so we're just going to stay with Arizona. Arizona only goes busy enough to keep him solid. Hank with being relatively you know, we can give him other states to work on. He doesn't have to just only be Arizona. He's losing Arizona, he's licensed in Arizona, but you know, clearly he wants to take the Georgia bar and he's open to do another things. You don't know if he's been an attorney long enough that he can wave into some of these states, but if he does well in the Georgia bar, you can wave into some of these states as well. Okay. So, you know, I can see him eventually taking cases or New Mexico cases.
00:14:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Our short term issue is we're spending more we're bringing in, which is never good. So, you know, we Got to keep our group.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:09 - mark sweet
I'm waiting for it to catch up. know it will catch up. Give me now of cases that we're signing.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just. And that big settlement that you just had the dad not help.
00:15:20 - mark sweet
Balance about that gets us back to even plus 500 grand basically. So, I mean, it was in a good position. It's not like it's a bad position. But obviously I would hope that that money would have gone a lot further.
00:15:40 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, so if you forecast, if you, I mean, you can forecast at this point, right, to some to a pretty solid degree. So, what happens when you forecast it out, right? It's you should be able to say, Hey, like I just did this for us, right? I forecasted. that we will hit our subscriber ceiling, I forget what day I did this on, but it was 155 days from the day that I did it. And then at our meeting this morning, we are 30 shy of hitting that ceiling. And when that happens, that's it. We're not going to get any more revenue unless we change something, right? So in our scenario, I have to change new customer, the new customer metric, which is I'm working on that, right? That's the only path to growth. Same thing with you, right? The path to growth is more retainers. But in my forecast, our overhead doesn't change, right? So it's like, we just won't make more money. We lose customers, we make less. But if we say here, it's like, we're just going to get stuck. And what I figured out was when we zoomed out, like when I zoomed out, which will be different for you, right? When I zoomed out, was like, oh, really don't work. really just kind of stuck for lack of a bit of word or no, it's actually true. Like we're just stuck at around three million, you know, 2.8 to 3.2 million a year. Like we just float in and out of that zone, throwing in the global pandemic. So it's like, okay, if nothing changes, if actually not nothing, if that new customer metric does not change, nothing else will change, we can just stay like this. for you, it's like, okay, how do you forecast this stuff? Because this is the scenario, like, it just made me think of, oh, it's my buddies, even knows this. I don't think I told you the story. So in, yeah, in January, my buddies like, oh yeah, we're gonna triple the business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 60 days later, he was laying on top of stuff because he, and I swear, Tina, up. And it was, Because his, he forecasted improperly and like was using some math magic, some really happy math. I was like, Hey, man, I don't know about this. And within 60 days, he was asked out completely upside down, laid off after staff, and is now still playing catch up. So that was in March. And he's kind of, he's treading water now, but they're about to lay off like their number one salesperson. The benefit of it was, I mean, I don't know if there really was a benefit, I guess there was, is like, now he's really digging into like the inner numbers, right? He's not just looking at the surface level things. He's going deeper on these numbers. And he's also figuring out that certain processes don't work that great. But here, it's like, what's if you forecast that, what actually shows you what's going to happen. That's the concern I have it's like okay if I look when when when is that what is that horizon like oh yeah we're gonna be back we're gonna be in the black whatever you want to call it in 140 days because xyz is gonna happen based off of all this data I mean you have years and years with the data granted you do have growth that's happening over here but and never assume growth I would never unless rock solid yeah how'd we look at that looking at it if I use a hundred retainers and I would throw out the person outlier cases to me those aren't real those are just creepy yeah I can't rely on those no I'm looking at a hundred incidences or sorry a hundred retainers which were usually beyond but I think a hundreds of pretty solid number 15% between drop and sub-out rate which the real numbers 12 I'm using 15 as a
00:20:00 - mark sweet
conservative number. It consists of 85 cases that should pay out out of the market. If I use the $12,000 average fee, and I'm sure you remember we ran this a while ago, our average fee.
00:20:16 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, I use 11, yep, 21.
00:20:19 - mark sweet
Yeah, let's use 12 grand again, conservative, that should put us a little over a million. Our monthly overhead is around a million. fluctuates from month to month, but that's around where our breakeven points.
00:20:34 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, that's before.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, is that we've sent out?
00:20:44 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is your overhead increasing at the same rate? Like are you just creating more, but getting less, right? You create more revenue, but you're creating more overhead, right? Are these things just moving in conjunction? So your for your bottom line numbers going up, but that's it. you're not really making, you're not picking anything up for doing this other than more employees, more this, more that.
00:21:12 - mark sweet
Like, it's more, more, more, more, more, more, but what it's not more of is profit. Sure answer is yes. Long answer is yes with a butt. And the reason I'm saying Yes with what? A butt, because the answer is yes. But the more cases I have in my pipeline, the more value my firm has. The more I could theoretically decide tomorrow to stop advertising, right?
00:21:34 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
cut down people and The Salko model.
00:21:37 - mark sweet
Salko model. Two more cases you're bringing in the higher chances of getting one of those whales, right? Larger net. True. Catch a bigger fish.
00:21:52 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, so that's all, all right. So, I mean, obviously, the Salko model I get, but that's like this long-term play. Are you really? I do you really think you're going to do that?
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't even think you wanted to go that way. So let's definitely talk this out.
00:22:10 - mark sweet
No, it's that or you sell.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, value your firm is in your case.
00:22:15 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. made the decision. I made the decision like 60, 90 days ago. Like when we got another PE firm come in and offer us a bunch of money, it wasn't enough money. But it was the first time ever that I was like, you know what? I would sell it now. So now I've shifted and my plan is to sell it in three years. Like I've set a time like in three years, I want to be I want to sell it. So I'm building it now and massaging it like getting I got this new bookkeeper and I'm getting a valuation done right now. We're setting up all new. We're setting up these docs. So I'm positioning it to sell and then I'm bringing in an advisor to help. to show me, hey, they sell these kinds of companies. So I'm engaging them now so that in three years, this thing is just shining and everything looks great. And then they're going to go selling. That's it. That's what I'm doing. It's happening. If it doesn't sell, I don't care. If I just make the business better, we make more money, that's not well and good. But my goal is really to sell it. If I just end up with a more profitable seven-figure business, oh, well. So I wonder if you should, I don't know, I mean, you could operate in those terms, right? And you'd be in this exact same position, right? be like, OK, well, I just made it all better and I'm going to keep it. But I'm doing all these things with this sort of thing in mind. And then what does that really look like? So for me, I know now, hey, I got to really figure out this new customer thing because that's where I'm going to add to the bottom line and therefore that's going to add to I know that that multiple whatever the multiple is that it's eight if I increase that metric that eight is worth more. The eight's only worth what it is right now like at a a 22 new customers a day average which is what we average no no matter what it's that times eight or that whatever the multiple is right so I go okay great if I want that multiple to have more value than I need to change this one metric so I'm only focused on figuring out how to change that metric so for you it's like what what does constitute the value right what does it what what would be the best looking version of it in three or four or five years whatever your horizon is and then how do you start to do things now to make it that then right is it and maybe it is you just keep doing this thing where you're going grow grow grow grow and like your profit margin doesn't change at all because that's how the multiple works there. I don't know, but something to think about.
00:25:08 - mark sweet
It's definitely something to think about. And again, the numbers that gave you were the most conservative numbers, right? the like Rosie everything's perfect. I use the 12% drops about rate, which is our actual rate, and that number should go down, and our 12,000, 684, 99 number, you know, now we're at 1.116. We make 100 grand a month, give or take, which, you know, it's not like that's insane, but it's not terrible. And that's not going to any referral fees or any big cases. So to me, it's keep growing and keep looking at what our average settlement is in these states. And are there any outliers that throw that number off? And then does it make sense, you know, take Washington, for example, does Washington still make sense in two or three years? Part of the problem is, We're spending a lot on the advertisement and it's taking a while to chase the tech.
00:26:05 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Is 10%, I mean, that's a 10 profit margin. Like, is that a good number? I don't even know. I don't know what the math is in this world.
00:26:16 - mark sweet
It should be about 20%.
00:26:18 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
10% when you're going through growth is so no.
00:26:22 - mark sweet
20% to 20% to a third is where you're really trying to be, depending on if you can do and what not. I would be perfectly fine with a 20% profit margin. I think that is fine.
00:26:36 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right. So are you not getting 20% now due to operational inefficiencies? Like, what's preventing you from getting 20% now? Is it because you're on this track of like, hey, that's just not possible because we're doing this thing? Or is it like, oh no, that should be possible right now.
00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it your incentive program?
00:26:53 - mark sweet
The incentive program is not helping.
00:26:56 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have high payroll.
00:26:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Our payroll is high. It should be like 25 to 28% and it's closer to like 37%. So our payroll is high because of current incentive package, right? that's mostly the attorneys. That's really where the money is going.
00:27:16 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:17 - mark sweet
Yeah. And obviously our advertising costs is high too. We're getting it better under control. But if I look at it for the year, we had some swings and misses. That we lost money on. Yeah. If I was better.
00:27:34 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. the payroll is like fixed.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the real problem.
00:27:39 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Marketing's variable payroll is fixed. And then if the goal is this longer term thing, what you know, right? And I know, because I know the talk a model is that you would just eliminate marketing altogether because your firms then subsiding strictly on referrals. And blah, blah, blah, blah. And brand, right? Pray to some degree. That's interesting. So I've been going. I'm back and forth with the ad sergely guys because they're like, they don't understand why the conversion rate for sweet loss so much worse for lack of a better term than everyone else. Right. So that's why I was late because I was lacking with him. So he told me that he, and he showed me like all the metrics of these other firms. He's just not showing me their names. The firm in Washington that is that multi-state firm like they're closing 30% of the leads like, okay, great. And then the other firms in other states, the average is 14% and ours with them is somewhere like five, which is what we keep seeing over and over and over. My argument to him that I wanted to bring to you that ties directly into what we just talking about is I'm telling him Mark's criteria is different. They're signing lower value cases and they just, they either doing it on purpose or they just don't know. And he's like, well, that doesn't make sense. I got no .
00:29:00 - mark sweet
but I go it makes sense only in this way and I don't know if this is smart and so I'm gonna run this by mark and weirdly we just kind of kind of covered it like maybe they're doing it on purpose because they're trying to expand their user base right and that they're playing into this long-term model I don't believe that for a second because I think they're not doing the math it's not just that it's the difference between me and all these other firms is they look at is this a case and I made this one first started and a lot of the larger firms are guilty of this is this a case the answer that is yes for me it's is the lemon worth the squeeze and more often than not there is no for a lot of these other firms it's it's a case and it's a completely different mindset I could probably double what our retention rate is If I was not so picky, or I did not require so much information on fraud, I promise you that there are pieces where they don't know if there's insurance, they don't know any of the liability, they are more than like the property damage photos, and so they're drop rate.
00:30:20 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I think is happening. And I'm about to prove it to him, because I was pointing this out to him said, look at the turn down rates, there's a distinct, I don't know, no treatment, no injury. Unless somehow we're getting these very special leads, that exact percentage exists across everything, they are signing those. And my guess is if I go and do the math, let's say that our conversion rate with them is 7%, guess what the other 7% is going to be, those two reasons. And I'll be like, dude, if the math is right there, they're signing them. And it shouldn't be and that's the difference and so in that context It's like this is what I was saying to my go and I also told them the 30% Washington I'm like dude, they're referring those out. We don't count those. Yeah, they get tracked But they don't count because they're not real money. It's not a real real retainer So if you take those out of theirs That's probably gonna drop them down to like the 14% average my guess is that they I'm not my guess I saw it they'd refer a ton of them So they're signing crappy ones and that was must be extra crappy and then they were throwing them out. So with him like, okay, let's get to What is the cost of working with you to get us a Sweetlaw retainer, right? Because these aren't all equal in any stretch of the strictly with it, right? So yeah, I was like, there's no way there's no way they're signing them as part of a grander strategy They just don't know I I this, I know he's not going to have the answer, but they tell you their average value per retainer because I can guarantee it's lower than ours. And if it is, then that proves my point, but I think I can prove my point doing that analysis just as it's late.
00:32:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, it just makes sense. And again, if you've got larger firms, they're signing it, they've got capacity. It's the same reason we're referring up is they're getting signed up and getting referral fees. It's not a case, right? Yes. For me, it's a lot of work or lot of...
00:32:34 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It won't math out. It won't math out.
00:32:37 - mark sweet
Yeah. takes a lot more labor to get that out than one that contains a lot more issues.
00:32:42 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. And it will lower, it would probably lower your overall average on the real stuff because you're people are running around working on stuff.
00:32:51 - mark sweet
So it's going to bring down the whole thing. However, every now and then there's a diamond in the room, which is why it won't do anything.
00:32:57 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But it's gotta be super rare.
00:33:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's kind of like, I don't know, it just seems like gambling math to me where because you have less control of it and it's not because it's not the norm because it's an outlier. And just thinking about, there's multiple things. Again, the SACO model has a much longer runway. So one of the things and the math activities we could should do would be to look at that. What does that runway look at? What are the variables? What, what does it look like to get there? So I like to reverse engineer. What does it look like when we're there? What's the difference here to there? What are the steps that would have to happen in order to. get there what's the nearest step take that step and it works better reverse engineering because you know what it it that's just the definition right so starting to do it the other way it gets really confusing and you can make some really bad choices but then when you look at so reverse engineer where you want to go come back what does it look like what are those steps what's just too big of a leap to take because it's too risky too much change too much volatility in the business obviously you want to step it down from whatever that is that you can mitigate risks along that path but the longer you play the game of i want to take as many as possible within the realm that you already have right that you won't take all garbage stuff so that you have the a greater opportunity to catch the big fish. You're playing two different games. You can't play both games at the same time. So at some point, one has to become the priority goal and one has to be sacrificed. And those decisions should be made mathematically. But we haven't even begun to outlive the, or lay out the framework for that equation. But since we're having this conversation now and we're looking at it, that's where we should be going late. that would be a whole calling itself just trying to start the math. Because of all the assets you have, all the people you have, all the sources that you're going, like, what does that look like for sweet law? Because there's, you're not going to have the same amount of staff. So anyway, it just depends on how much you you're interested in that. Whereas before, I think it was a no way in hell, am I doing that?
00:36:07 - mark sweet
And now it's a it's either that or so, or, you know, conclusion, the problem of the soccer model is, yeah, it's a it's a runway, but with a brick wall at the end of it.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Right.
00:36:19 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and everyone and a bunch of people get fired.
00:36:21 - mark sweet
Right. And who's going to work where the ship that's going down?
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. But so here's the thing, we're having this conversation sounding like that's a potential. We need to block our energy off from anything that's not even a real opportunity. So if you're really not even actually consider going down that path, then we need to stop talking about it and stop putting any energy to it. If you really are considering it, then you need to ask yourself, are you really willing to take the actions that have to happen, taking the people.
00:37:00 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
into account in order to make that happen and if so on what time frame are you talking about it two years from now five years from now 10 years from now because all of that makes a big difference but whatever conversation we're having needs to be real needs to be what we're actually working towards or we need to stop talking about it yeah who's what someone talks about like you know you can't have a B right you work the A it's like don't have a B because that it's it's a distraction the B becomes a distraction because you're considering this thing that you're not going to really do and you it pulls focus from the A so if the A is really selling the firm in and then yes put a time frame on it but with or without a time frame you can certainly define hey this is like what I was saying for me it's like this is what it needs to look like in order for me to sell it and maybe the time frame is like It's going to take me three years to even get to that point, right? But that point can be defined now. And if that point is like, hey, no one's going to want to buy this firm because I know my overhead is too high, well, then that needs to be factored in, like, how do I reduce that overhead in three to five years or whatever the timeframe is? then, I mean, in a way, you have sort of this B, it's not even a B, it's like a fall back. The fall back would be like, oh, if I do all these things to sell it, in theory, I could fall back to this Salka thing because it would just be there. But it's not being factored in at all. It's just sort of this known backstop that's there, but it's because I focused on the A version of this. No, that's my- So start firing people is what I'm hearing Tina say.
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is not what I said.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
But I heard a whisper, it's going to be there, like, no matter what I do, that's always going to be an option.
00:39:07 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:39:07 - mark sweet
Yep. And realistically, it's not even a plan. It's like, it's a fallback. It also has more value to my firm that let's me get larger lines of credit or whatever I need to do for growth or whatever.
00:39:24 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's growth in the context of selling, right? So then what, I mean, I don't know when Jacobi sells, right? what is the metric here?
00:39:35 - mark sweet
Is the metric straight?
00:39:37 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's profit margin in bottom line?
00:39:39 - mark sweet
No, because they're a brand. They're in the name.
00:39:43 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am not. Well, yeah, that's true.
00:39:44 - mark sweet
That's not the problem. is significantly different than theirs. My value is the value of my cases and nothing else. Okay. I mean, yes, there's some value to my systems. Yes, your value to my people. Yes, there's somebody in my processes. what I do is very rip it.
00:40:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Replicatable. Okay.
00:40:05 - mark sweet
Right. there's nothing special. Like if Tina's law office tomorrow could pull from the same sources.
00:40:11 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you haven't the same I had, you could do the exact same thing I do. Right. Totally. The only difference would be that they don't know the numbers yet. Right. That's your advantage right now is that you've gone through and figured it all out. And now you're like, okay, these are the numbers, these are the targets. That's why the dude in Arizona failed. Right. We know that without even without knowing anything. He thought, right, money, money gets cases done. And it's, we know, because I say it all the time, it's idea money, excuse me. So you started the, what's interesting about your scenario is that it wasn't necessarily your idea. You changed the idea. The idea was Steve's idea and Steve's idea was wrong. He, he had ideas. money. And he's like, idea money, and then he sort of had the execution that was you, right? I'm going to execute it. But the idea was wrong. The idea was that he could spend money to get cases. And that wasn't true. So then he left you holding the bag, and then you change the idea. You were like, okay, I'm going to find vendors to get, I'm going to figure out how to get a series of vendors to get cases. So it was similar idea. But his sort of just relied on throwing a bunch of money at it. And it didn't work. And that's what the dude in Arizona did. His idea was, hey, if we throw a bunch of money at it, it turns into retainers. It turns into money. Of course, the idea being that every retainers equal, like God only knows what their math was. God only knows what Steve's math was. But then Steve's new idea was, I'm going to go buy marks, essentially, right? I'm going to go buy sweet loss. And that's what he started doing. And I'm sure his math is still bad.
00:41:53 - mark sweet
But that was a better idea than that. He's extremely different than mine. His math is, I can absorb a higher cost for gay speaking. because I get more out of them than anyone else.
00:42:02 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:42:03 - mark sweet
He's making a ton of money, so clearly, if not worse, I don't understand how necessarily.
00:42:11 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if you don't understand how, it doesn't really work.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
If you're sitting there questioning it, they don't reduce their fees ever for clients. I think they're outsourcing some item so they're payroll may be lower and just charting into the client.
00:42:30 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, his math might not be all that great. By making this, he's getting $10 million settlement, or he doesn't refer it up.
00:42:40 - mark sweet
He keeps it lit again.
00:42:42 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are they even going have to get that?
00:42:44 - mark sweet
They are. They've got some good litigators there. Now, now they've got some. And again, they've got a brand. So they've got people, you know, being the name forever, you call in. So their costs should go down or whatever. time, but he's buying.
00:43:01 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. They're sort of hybrid model at this point. They're doing, they're sort of working multi models, basically.
00:43:09 - mark sweet
I mean, realistically looking at all of this, what I probably should do is save up enough money to spend a year worth advertising on billboards in Washington state. Steve's not in Washington. Yeah, they don't know who he is. Or Illinois or Missouri, like a state he's not going to.
00:43:31 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wonder what the alternative to billboards is, right? It's like, what's the bill? Is it like next door in Hulu? Like, what's what's the new billboard where like you're in everyone's face? Like, I see these commercials on Hulu. I've never seen a legal commercial on Hulu. But you're inundated with them now. And then it's like on next door. It's like, where what are the it's not Facebook.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, what are the
00:44:00 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equivalent of billboards.
00:44:01 - mark sweet
It's YouTube.
00:44:02 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I ran a bunch of YouTube ads.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about TikTok?
00:44:08 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, you can't, I don't know. mean, how do you, if a billboard is someone on their commute, it's like, how do you inter interject yourself?
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would test basically a billboard ad on TikTok. Because here could be, well, I, but I think it's cheaper on TikTok, but I don't know. But I would test and I do like this theory because I do think that social media is the better billboard or TV spot type ads, the streaming ads, because if you don't need it, so you don't have to have a long spot. It just has to be short and frequent. And so that somebody who has been in a wreck or recently gets in a wreck is going to have seen that, and the frequency is the most. or important thing, and a memorable number or access point website, whatever, but it's one of those things you don't need it unless you need it, and you're not looking for it unless you need it. So frequency and location, which is why billboards work, people pass them back and forth on their commutes. It is effectively the same thing, but it should be cheaper, and the exposure should be better, and the tracking is way better, which means the opportunity to optimize is better. And unless you've been seeing it, most of your competitors probably aren't doing it. Most of them are more old school, playing the old school game, dominating those spaces. I think that there's a lot to be looked into. This is not my area of expertise in terms of where to get it, but we could find those people and try it, set the budget aside, but I do think that that would be much better than billboards is TV spots and social media spots, but very short, very clear, billboard-esque so that you're not spending for a lot of time, but it's just frequency and location, location being digitally in their faces frequently. Personally.
00:46:27 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's like, what's the digital equivalent? If you think about a billboard, they're strictly like zip code base, right, and their routes, right, roads and zip codes, so it's like, hey, we're buying a billboard on this street in this zip code, right, and basically this lower income neighborhood is where they are, for the most part, right, or major, or in major, major thorough thoroughfarers, so it's like, what is the digital equivalent of that? I don't think you need to do that just like the bus. It's like buses, but that's what the if if you're gonna If you're gonna emulate that strategy You have to be like, okay I feel like this is the bus and or the banchan or the billboard like I think I'm just going through my head right now I see the whole day long here.
00:47:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see like who are you talking to the those neighborhoods?
00:47:24 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, that's the targeting the targeting is where Where is the who is it touching, right?
00:47:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like you drive by the billboard That's it and it's they picked that billboard for a reason so typically because it's Psychology behind it is Because you just made me think of something that we could discuss about this is first of all people of all Wealth ranges, I can't think of the word economic statuses Yeah, um, get in rex, but the bigger impact and the need to handle it strategically is with the impoverished people who like I can't afford to get health care I can't afford to get things fixed. Because a lot of times I mean you just make a call go to insurance people just like deal with it. I don't know. I don't know that that's true. That's an assumption, which I would be trying to get more data on if I'm trying to build the most optimized business. I would want to know what are the statistics of hiring a personal injury attorney across the income lines. What does that look like. Now, because here's the difference between billboard placement and doing it online is that placement has to work and it has to work for that demographic. And you don't want to waste eyeballs because of how much it costs whatever. Whereas when you're, when you're doing an online and casting a wider net, Mark can practice in all of these different states, and now he's, he's got less competition, because his competitors aren't in that same space, which is not the situation with the billboard ads. So understanding the frequency of hiring an attorney engaging an attorney, at least even exploring it with personal injury with an accident. And what is the competition presence in those spaces because those two are significant variables that billboards can't really change because they're physically located in one place. So, like, it isn't apples to apples, no matter how much we try to emulate it. I think it would be foolish to try to replicate it, I think taking the best practices, which is very The clear language, the visualization of it, the will get you help, you know, that type of thing, but things that we can do that billboards can't do a split test. We can track demographic engagement. You can't do that with billboards. you know, the angle that you're taking to me is a little bit like, I don't know. I think it's not tapping into the advantages that we have by doing it online.
00:50:33 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, when I've never seen someone do, and it's just my personal experience, it's like, what they do with billboards bus ads, whole thing, they're always hitting the vanity number. It's always the vanity number, right? So, what they're trying to slam home is this brand, this vanity number. So, you would emulate those aspects in an online ad, right? Whether it's a fixed image or it could be a video, right? But... it's really hammering home those two things so you would get a vanity number and then you dedicate it to your billboard scare quotes which is your online app and you would use and then you would rely on these these are how many people we've held from this how many millions of dollars we've gotten and settled or whatever no no the vanity number is like one eight eight five five five five five five five oh like they're all taken they all cost and seen amount of money but you have to have some that's yeah it might be easy to remember yeah you need a hooky something um like here it's i think the guy's number is all zeros or some maybe not that would be a terrible number we'll get you zero nine million um most different stories is 800 all sevens um Morgan and Morgan's got one that's the blades yeah yeah but that's what they do right so they're hammering home the brand and the number And it's literally just with the classic marketing of just repetition, right? They just keep repeating the same message over and over and over. They're just drilling it in people's heads. And then when the time comes, they're like, oh, I got in the car accident, I'm going to call 1-800-the-LAW, or whatever it is, and they do.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you use also a QR code?
00:52:26 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They have to scan it. So the way that it works traditionally is that they're remembering the hook. So it's like, you need the hook. Yeah. Or either in the name or in the number.
00:52:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, does it have to be? So first of all, there's options. There's so many different phone services with different prefixes where I think potentially you could get that if, and maybe there's a person whose job literally is just to go get you the best member memorable that stands out.
00:53:01 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or you have to figure out a hooky thing and then get the, you know, the decoded version of that, right? So you're as 1-800-COME 1-800-APPA and you're like, oh, it's available, but it won't be. It's like a domain name. It's like it's not going to be available. You have to pay a crap ton of money for it.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you just have to be a little bit creative in the way that you think of it, because like I can always find a domain that works really well that's available. It takes a lot of thinking about it and then you just have to brand that. But it's the thinking and it's always the thinking that does the winning because most people won't think that far and they won't think that hard, but that's the way you win this game.
00:53:48 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to emulate that stuff, you have to come up with, that would be the works. And then, and get it. And then you'd copy that online and you could copy in all the ways that we just talked about, you could do it on the TikTok, right? Maybe you run these things in separate, distinct runs, right? But you have to run them for like, I mean, this is always trying to do the math in my head, right? So if you figure a billboard, someone goes by twice a day, right? So that's two impressions per person per day. So you'd be like, okay, I'm going to cap that aspect. I'm going to allow two impressions a day per person, because that's like a billboard. But same thing, they're going by maybe once or twice a day, any more than that's probably excessive. But then it's every day, because that's their commute. That's the way to the house. That's the store they stop every day when they're on their way home, whatever it is. So you would cap the impressions to two per day per person. And then what is that costing you? What does that cost on Hulu? What does that cost on TikTok? What does that cost on whatever? You could probably get kind of project that out. And it's like, okay, what you don't know is how long does that need to run until it turns into a phone call, a lead, or whatever, like that's the big question mark. then once you're committing to that, trying to figure that out, and then you would like a billboard, you would just leave it on in perpetuity. Hopefully you have tracking that can buy it back to TikTok or that becomes part of your intake. You get some of that, where'd you see us? But yeah, and it would likely be cheaper than a billboard, for sure.
00:55:41 - mark sweet
Well, people think billboards equal legitimacy.
00:55:46 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I think it's the repetition is what it's because, I mean, it's the advertising, it's the repetition that them seeing over and over and
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the imagery so it's it's in his favorite thing it's what does name space she loved it he's ready to hire him what are you talking about when you saw the sweet chains girl boards that are trashed fella oh boy almost doesn't matter what's on there as long as it's that frequent and it looks like authority and there are so the colors you know the navy blue um gold uh there are different colors that have psychology behind them um there's a whole color rule of psychology but it's also going to be so if it looks like something they've seen um there's black backgrounds basically and navy blue backgrounds the majority of them that's what they have they're used to seeing people in suits and ties big language they're to seeing a scale of justice, that imagery, a big phone number, you know. So, people that are in metro areas are used to seeing billboards like that. People in rural areas who still can make you just as much money and are not seeing your competition as much, they don't see those billboards. So, they see at best an ad in the paper and it's not very good, or they see a card that somebody's handed them because they live in a small town where there are no billboards. And you want, you're going to be targeting those people, that's probably actually the majority of them. So, you have to take that into account too. But even still, suits and ties, the scale of justice, navy, black, professional corporate type stuff makes people feel like, oh, that's an attorney. That's not Billy Joe down on the street who's brother is practicing law and says he can help me out, that kind of thing. So anyway, but it's starting somewhere. First of all, finding people that know those channels and can advertise well on them. Getting, I think we could probably find somebody to help us get a good vanity number without having to spend our time on it.
00:58:25 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking right now.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's horrible. then the other thing is to get a list of all the sources where you could get toll-free numbers. not 800, but a toll-free number and then find a few different phrases and basically we use chat2bt to give us a few different scenarios and then basically maybe take one of your assistants and systematically go through each of the toll-free providers with each of those phrases and see which ones possible. Eventually we get there. It's the great things, which is what we're aiming for doesn't come from little efforts and flukes. And you know, we just arrived there. It's strategy and it's systematically going from this step to this step to this step to this step. But and then, you know, there's innovation and disruption, which is where you're at right now, because your market is still primarily radio and billboards and maybe TV spots. There might be some people coming out of it, but we know enough to know that people buy from what they see on online ads and streaming ads and things like that. So it's not a huge risk. You can mitigate the risk by with the budget, but the likelihood and even probability that you could do better by putting some very strategic ads short, low level of exposure again with the math that that Dan was doing with the bill. boards, although I would probably want to double that if they see it two times a day. want to let them see it four times a day. If it's just a few cents per impression, I don't know.
01:00:10 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I would just try to near what's real, right?
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're like, okay, I'm trying to do define what's real though.
01:00:17 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like this is billboards. If you're commuting to work, well, you not pass it four times a day.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay, but I'm saying we should not be trying to duplicate billboards because you can't and it's so much better. So we're using billboard type strategy and ads, basically essential of it and knowing that those are the big competitors. And then the rest of the emulation would be from other successful ads that people are running on streaming services that are working for them.
01:00:54 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But we don't have any data on other.
01:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find data. Anyway, I'm sure we can find data like if this is what we want to look at and it's worth really looking into and looking at it. Well, we can put some meat on this framework and and plot a course that that has some numbers behind it. So we're not just, you know, going blind, but we would have to decide that's what we're going to do. Who's going to go get the data and look at that, because again, going back to you trying to optimize everything that we have based on our resources. The fact that payroll is excessive and marketing is excessive. The faster one to try to correct could be marketing because payroll is going to be a whole, if you cut that back, there's a morale issue. And I'm not saying you don't cut that back, but, you know, replacing attorneys becomes difficult, and I don't know. You know, maybe that ends up working if you lose one attorney and you said, basically everybody can do from everywhere. It's just somebody else has to, you know, look, they have to pair up with somebody who is Able to work in in that state. That's a possibility.
01:02:19 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So maybe you Yeah, that's that tricks on something. Thanks.
01:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I told you forget about this.
01:02:25 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? So I have a buddy that is barred in DC. He's now barred in California. Here in California, he had a job working for I forget the name of the place, but it was like in the legal department and the head of the legal department was a lawyer. So he worked under that lawyer and like did all the contract work, right? he knew all that stuff, but he was never I'm gonna say I don't know what to call it the lawyer of record or whatever, but he literally did all the work and then that person's name was attached to it. So it's like, what is that version? That guy can't command the same level that an actual barred lawyer can command. But it's like, is that, is that even possible?
01:03:15 - mark sweet
There's some, yeah, there's a huge difference. If you're in-house counsel in a corporate firm, it doesn't matter as much for your license. If they have to go to a corporate proceeding, he has to just pro hop in. So if you're doing too often, it's a problem. But if you're working in-house, it's not. Okay.
01:03:35 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Very different. There's no version of that in your world.
01:03:38 - mark sweet
That's what we're doing now. They're just doing it under my name.
01:03:41 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, what really? So these guys don't need to be lawyers? Theoretically.
01:03:48 - mark sweet
Technically. Diego can run a case from start to finish. As long as I'm signing off on it, it doesn't matter.
01:03:56 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that solves your payroll problem.
01:03:59 - mark sweet
No. It doesn't, because lawyers and case managers don't handle cases the same way, they're generally not as good, and they don't get as much money.
01:04:10 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I would argue that becomes a process issue, right? Could that be solved the process? So, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, would be like, don't know how would you test that theory, not in your office, right? Where people are like, wait a minute, he's gotten non-lawyers working on cases, what the hell is going on? That's a lot.
01:04:32 - mark sweet
mean, it's like Daniel Kim. Are you serious? He's attorney in his entire office. 99% of work that's getting done is being done by people who are not lawyers. Oh, so that is a thing. She failed law school and she just was borrowing an old man's lawyer.
01:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is real. I didn't No way.
01:04:56 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you could bring Kim Kardashian on the staff is what I'm hearing. This would do wonders for your marketing.
01:05:02 - mark sweet
Yes.
01:05:03 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, okay in-house.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, let me go up in the lenses.
01:05:10 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's interesting. So you could have like, you, Mark, could take more cases in-house. know, everyone's on your name, but you could start taking more cases and then have like a sidekick that's not a lawyer, but you're like, this dude knows his or gal. They know their stuff, but they're not barred. So there's no threat of that person like going to another firm. So you could pay that more than like less than a Sam or whatever, more than the other, because you're like, I see that you're more than a case manager, right? So you went to law school, whatever, and then, and then teach them how to run a case the right way. And it's like, okay, and then, then that's it. Then they just know how to run the cases the right way, and then you just keep giving them cases. question is how are you-
01:06:00 - mark sweet
We found those people don't want to usually have some pretty large words, right? Otherwise, why are they not a lawyer? I still have all the liability here. So she's also got liability. I do have her supervising attorney, but her license on the line too.
01:06:17 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right.
01:06:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, totally. So there's a different level of responsibility versus Diego, who I get a bar complaint or I get super malpractice, it just goes on as another job.
01:06:31 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, maybe then that maybe that's where, so maybe that's where an incentive package actually works in your favor. I don't know that the incentive actually works in your favor with the lawyers, right?
01:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because they can't skate, but this person's like, hey, oh, yeah, it does what Samantha you can, you can tell.
01:06:53 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but so the grand scheme of things, there is a version of the world. There's a, there's a version of the where there are no attorneys on style. That's interesting. I didn't think that was really a thing.
01:07:05 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah. know there's a lot of those.
01:07:07 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had no idea.
01:07:08 - mark sweet
I just didn't see plausible. product is usually garbage, but yeah.
01:07:14 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is where my checklist argument is like, if the process is so dialed, you can mitigate that.
01:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.
01:13:44 - mark sweet
Okay, I'll talk about the script essentially does.
01:13:47 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I read it. I'll send you my notes because I'm like, to me, it's not a script. Okay. But parts of it are like it's in there.
01:13:57 - mark sweet
It's weird. The presentation, was like, well, it's not really a script. But, uh, but it's way there.
01:14:02 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's that first minute dude. Like I don't know if you guys listen to calls, but it's just getting whether they should stay on the phone right up right after the cell mutation. Like there just needs to be like one question, which I think it's sort of there. And then it's like, to me it was, I'm used to reading it like in a script mode. I don't know. Like from like being on sales teams in a certain way, that was like an overview of like the strategy sort of that. Like so, but whatever I read it, I would just change like that one part. And then because it's, if they get into the other parts, great. It's really just like, should they still be on the phone? That was the thing that I just kept running into like, dude, you should not be on this call. You're like wasting your time.
01:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that gets into call control training. That's all. Call flow. Yeah. All All All All All All All So we can keep working on that too. All right. We okay bad it.
01:15:14 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This 800 number stuff is for the birds.
01:15:17 - mark sweet
industry is clearly captured. We do have one half the one that we got produced this year. One eight hundred nine seven five two thousand. And not that difficult of a number to remember.
01:15:30 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not bad.
01:15:31 - mark sweet
That's a ring. You're paying numbers or whatever. Those are going for high six figure to seven figure.
01:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just going to work. How much do you pay for that?
01:15:40 - mark sweet
We have it. I don't remember how much.
01:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we paid like a couple grand for it. Yeah. I think you can make that work. And again, it's repetition. So how many times does it get repeated? Like is it is it being said, it doesn't flash on the screen. It does a flash on the screen while it's being said. repeatedly those things stick in your head and so it's not just what you have but it's how you use it. That's workable.
01:16:11 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah and we can just mess around with it because it could it could be like you're sitting here like sometimes you just go boom there it is right so it's like you got this this one and then you might come up with one I'm like trying to do one around like oh I well the other thing is how adjacent is it to somebody else's so like if you ever typed a domain name wrong in or whatever like sweet lost sweet James like you can get into that oh yes it was strategic as you are if there's something closely adjacent to it that's a competitor then maybe that ends up actually creating more of an issue so something that's not related to a specific phrase but it's simple just an easy number to remember and you
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you make sure they remember it, then maybe that's actually better than potentially sending it to a competitor. Whereas if it's just a number off and it's, you know, Joe's burger shack, you're not worried about it because he's not going to take your business and they're going to keep trying to figure out who it was instead of go to your competitor.
01:17:23 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like 1-800-the-law 3, how about that Mark? sure that guy would love it if you did that.
01:17:30 - mark sweet
I'm sure I'm going to sued for that, yeah.
01:17:35 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like it's a totally different number, buddy. 3, 2, am I even saying? Yeah. The next number.
01:17:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I believe in...
01:17:44 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like the price is right strategy of phone numbers.
01:17:47 - mark sweet
I've got one dollar about it. I mean, we do, um, like, sweetlaw.com instead of just sweetlaw.com.
01:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
01:17:58 - mark sweet
No, it was like you just in case someone... misspell sweetlaw.com.
01:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, right.
01:18:02 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:18:04 - mark sweet
We also sweet.law. Or whatever that's for it.
01:18:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah.
01:18:14 - mark sweet
Okay. Sweet as you, IT portion is already taken.
01:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that what you have is, is easy enough. Like it really is. Think about all those ear rooms, those jingles, the friggin just repetition that stuff sticks in your head. It's, it's psychology. The human brain is not that complicated. So work with what we know works. Just it's the common seriously big text. It's flashing. Somebody's repeating that number over and over again. It gets in their head. They could be sleeping in the middle of the night and they're repeating that number and they don't know why. That's how the brain works.
01:18:58 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So,
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:19:01 - mark sweet
You're right. You're absolutely right.
01:19:03 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
doesn't matter how good or how about it. It's repetition.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:19:06 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
if it's a little hooky, it's got to have a little like roll off the tongue.
01:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does because so you've got two sets of zeros, 800, 975, It very much falls in that and it's unique enough. So the repetition, it will get in there subconsciously. I'm telling you. And then if you make sure that you also make the correlation to this is an injury attorney, personal injury, a law firm, know, then it's it's stuck there. It gets into the seps and that's why I'm talking about more than two times a day, that kind of repetition. But whatever, we should be split testing it and we'll be able to test way more than radio ads, billboards or anything else. But we haven't even started this. This is going to be somewhat like I'm talking about a year long path going down here, trying to figure it out. and do it right but I think that we bleed a lot less money doing this. I think we have way more leverage doing this but the first thing we have to do is stop being afraid of what's got to be this it's got to be that it just tapping into human psychology that's what makes marketing great doing it getting data real data not assumed data because somebody else is doing it getting real data and then adjusting our approach based on our real data that's what we should be doing.
01:20:35 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how to think is like this is also like a 1980 strategy right this is based off of a phone number the letters on the phone like why would you even do that what is what is the new version of that what is the future version of that is it text settlement quote to 965 well that's the other thing I was thinking about is how do we engage a chatbot into these types of things.
01:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that because these people was streaming ads, whatever, do they want, you know, an instant answer? Do they want to have to dial one number? Do they want to have to remember it? Can they remember at Sweet Law now or something like that, where we're somehow the Google search and it gets into a chatbot? I don't know, like, hit us up on Messenger here. And maybe that was on a Facebook ad, hit us up on Instagram messages. And it's on an Instagram map. It, like, TikTok messages, TikTok ads, kublu message, I don't know, maybe it's a phone number, whatever. But that, again, is all the nuance.
01:21:40 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But first we have to get a framework to get started as a QR code. For sure.
01:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the thing is that here's the two things. So if they're streaming on their TV and they have a QR code on the TV, then you get it with your phone. If they're streaming on their phone and you have a QR code, then you have an issue because they can't scan it with the device. They're watching it, but can it be a clickable QR code with Hulu ads? I don't know, but that's a potential and if that's not available now, I guarantee you it will be down the road very soon because they want advertisers to stay with them and the more engagement they can create for their advertisers, the more money the advertisers will spend, so that's just down the road. So if we're planning for that, if we're positioned to be able to take advantage of those things because we're already on that path, all the more better for us. But either way, being where the people are, that's the whole point of white billboards work. So that is what we should be doing by online.
01:22:49 - mark sweet
Still think the boards still work, we should still be there.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying they don't work, but you want an optimized leverage business and there's competition and dollars matter. So definitely. fine work. Does it get you clients? Yes. Does it get you in the profit margins you want to be? Bet you it doesn't.
01:23:09 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's really the time. The time is a totally unknown variable. Like, does it take a year? Does it take two years? Like, how long does it take? And how much the only way to plan that is?
01:23:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. It's going to take at least a year.
01:23:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:23:25 - mark sweet
So you got to stick this in for at least to get it.
01:23:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So but here's the thing Mark. Do you want to work? Do you want something that works? Or do you want something that works at maximum capacity? Optimal leveraged? I thought that was what we were working on.
01:23:44 - mark sweet
I'm interested though in how we build a brand that has more value to getting those. And unfortunately, purely digital does not carry the same way.
01:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that you're making assumptions based off of the world up until this point when the world is something changing and is almost new every year at this point.
01:24:06 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and the other thing is that brand is, is free of analog or digital brand become brand is branded exists outside those things. And then they translate that brand into an online search, right? So are they brand is losing its power? Brand. But you can brand through both and then the brand is established. So the question is you can build brand through an oppression offline or online. So it's like you get to the same destination of brand.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think brands now is as powerful as your reviews are because that's what people are relying on. Back in the day, it was all word of mouth. We knew what we heard about. And what we heard about was from our friends, whatever, and so that was the power. our branding. But now, everyone, not everyone, but a lot of people go to review sites. So you've already got that game locked down. If you do that, and also are in the location where they are, when they need it, I think that they, I don't know, that we've got to get some research to find out the power of branding. But everything that I've been watching for at least the last five years is suggesting that branding is much less important these days. Unless you're looking at the brand being their reputation online and their reviews.
01:25:48 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, deep in the vanity shortcuts. Like, how do you get one of these? I don't think I've ever seen a Or he's one of these either.
01:26:01 - mark sweet
Uh, Morgan and Morgan uses pound law.
01:26:05 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
01:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what about pound, sweet love or sweet justice?
01:26:11 - mark sweet
love that one. People don't know how to spell on their phones very well. OK. more they try to spell a word, the more likely they are to screw it up because people just keep on them. Numbers now, they don't really, you know, see letters. That's much.
01:26:32 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, this is this would be text text my quote to 0, 0, 0, 0.
01:26:38 - mark sweet
Right.
01:26:41 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have to spell anything. They're spelling my quote in the SMS message and then the destination is 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, it all is.
01:26:50 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Until I'm also going to look at the QR codes. This is not going to be far away where they're on a device. device or QR code where you can click that and all of that will be coded into the link that all they have to do is tap it and it opens up the text message or an app with a message that drafts it and all they have to do is click send and it's going with the right word and to the right number or address.
01:27:21 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not following. I think do that with I think I could do that with leaf glory right now.
01:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's so and that's leverage that's what I'm talking about every friction point that you can remove like you guys are talking about these different games you know branding and it you don't you don't have to win the branding game you don't have to win the billboard game what you need is a certain amount of cases and at a certain value above and beyond what you're at without increasing your payroll costs. That's all you need. We're overcomplicating it but trying to worry about what the competitors are doing. Leverage the technology. That's available to us now. Keep your eyes on your own path, because we have enough data to know that we can do better if we apply it and stop thinking about everybody else.
01:28:18 - Danâ€™s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to go ahead my haircut. Thanks everyone.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be thinking about this a lot, trust me. I would like some Ronin pictures, please, if you have them. I do.
01:28:32 - mark sweet
I need happy pictures. He looks like a stuffed animal.
01:28:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want it. Oh boy. Bye, Dan. Bye Mark. All right. Later.
