00:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Are you excited?
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so excited. I have to tell you I don't usually do video I'm paying attention to my notes and my screen and sometimes I'm not even in the same place. we just good.
00:00:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sounds good.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, I muted myself.
00:00:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
was like, why are you not answering me? That you're taking notes.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, I have lots of questions for you today. And then I said, let's start with how was your weekend?
00:00:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It was good. My sister and my mom and my dad threw us a baby sprinkle since it's our second child. We're expecting next in about three weeks. So it was a lot of fun to have that. See, a lot of my wife's friends came over to support her.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's awesome. And you have, would you have a boy or girl right now?
00:01:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Currently have about a 2.75 year old girl. So she's almost going to, she's going to be three in August. She's like two, two and three quarters.
00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Are you having another girl? have fun with that.
00:01:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have four daughters.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh boy. Yeah. And they're strong and powerful. And it's amazing. It's amazingly difficult, but also pretty awesome.
00:01:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I was, it's really made me kind of shift my thinking about like powerful, you know, empowered women that I know. And I'm just like, and then of these things like, man, this coaching goes, well, I would love to give this to my daughters someday, know, living that and this is. like yourself, but, you know, some sort of a coach if this goes well, you know, instead of like a nice car or something, yeah, yeah, help them be about more powerful and stuff.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's the world is shifting and this is, you'll find Fuji that we go through a lot of technical stuff, but also a lot of just little conversations about these things, because it all circles back. So I told you I take a holistic approach to everything and part of it is just learning how we think about things, but there's a kind of you're the one that does all the things. You're the one that runs your business. You're the one that runs your personal life. You're the one that runs your home life. And that person being in charge of everything, if you can apply the same type of mentality across the board, then there's consistency and there's mass power and consistency, right? So in learning how one thing, so I like to make choices that have multiple benefits at all times. So everything I do is leveraged because it serves multiple purposes at all times. So if I do something that strengthens me in my business, then I wanted to strengthen me everywhere else. And one of the ways that that happens is through leadership. So by becoming a better leader, I become a better partner. I become a better leader in my business and for my clients, when I'm coaching soccer, basketball, whatever. So that's one of those things that does everything. So if I study psychology, like I'm working on my psychology degree, finally I dropped out of college when I was 18. I was not for the agendas and the politics and mostly just being told what to do. I was over that for a while. Anyway, but studying psychology. understanding more about why people think the way that they do, understanding where there is agency and choice and accountability and where there's not, where there's chemicals that override and people can't actually make choices. our conversations will sometimes diverge into different topics, but almost always you'll see that they come back and there's a point to it. So just back to you being a dad of young women, you're going to continue to be a dad of young women and you're going to watch them grow. Whenever the firstborn child is a daughter, you have an automatic mother there, but you also are probably going to have, and there's kind of two types depending on how they get to grow up, getting to have a mom and a dad who are strong and loving, you probably won't have all the anxiety that a lot of firstborn daughters do. She'll be strong, she'll be bold, she'll be fierce, she'll be loving, she'll be nurturing, but she'll probably also be super emotional, maybe a little jealous of the second child who comes in. And I think birth order is just interesting. You should study that because it's kind of amazing what happens there. But you learning how to give space for all the things that are going to happen. And also the way that they interact with mom, there's the electro complex. And I can't remember what it is for the boys with the dads. But there's a different energy between moms and daughters, especially strong women, and fathers and daughters. And so there will be a lot of good bonding with you. And there may be some like animosity there. That's just natural. So there's so many things that you just learning how to be the better version of yourself. You'll get making people that plow through other people, but rather just strong. unlike 100 billion gallons of water like it's soft and it can flow into all kinds of different containers and shapes but and it can give life but it can also destroy you know what I mean. So there's different kinds of stories. anyway that was my alarm for you. I have alarms that go off all day long. Okay so I have lots of questions and I think that the best way to start which by the way I do have a call right after this it's mark at 11. So get started and it's just going to kind of be an ongoing process and a lot of times if you want to keep moving things forward then we can there'll be ways that we can do that either through messages or like a shared talk because right now I am going to put all my notes into here. I also use an AI note taker which is recording everything so then I don't have to pay attention so much to writing I could just absorb. um and and you also never need to worry about so sometimes we might need to miss a call because baby whatever yeah yes but the momentum will come so we will have the ebb and flow of life happens in these calls also so we'll have weeks where it's just like whoa we just like that was a we unpacked a lot and um we'll have weeks where it's kind of slow but you know that it there's nothing no traction lost a lot of times there will be kind of pondering life's lifing and um all of that goes into it so it's a very big picture and I just wanted to give you that for the pace okay so how how long so your doctor what I need you to do first is and this part is succinctly as you want it to be but if you feel like there's information that is imperative that I need to know know, then go ahead and share it. And this is one of those things where in the beginning, it feels like a lot of talking. And you're like, okay, we don't really need all that information. But I do all because of the holistic approach, everything is really useful. So you think about that. So I want to know everything that you do in business. And you're kind of origin, how you got there, why you got there, how long you've been doing, if you're doing multiple things, I will want to know the origin of all of that.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then further deep questions will come into it.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You got it. Okay. Your turn to get away, tell me about it.
00:08:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I had a, I had a great childhood. My mother is one of the nicest people I know I will probably ever know. She is loving, giving completely self sacrificing. She gave up her career as a special need. teacher to raise me and my sister. My dad again is a loving man. He never hit us, never hit my mom. I've rarely ever seen him angry. a wonderful loving person works hard as a farmer. So we grew up on a farm. I think when I was about four, he told my mom, you know, I think our farm's doing well enough. You could stay home with the kids. And that's what my mom did. And so she raised us. And my dad's love language is giving and providing, you know, farmer. So, yeah, he literally gave us the best of everything I had private, even though we didn't, we weren't rich, but I had private swim lessons to teach me my swimming. I had private tennis lessons when, I mean, it was an incredible amount of money. Now that I think back, I went to private preschool, private kindergarten. Then we went to public schools. you know, at that time, I had, I had my own skis.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We went skiing.
00:10:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Wow, you know, so a lot of very pricey things for that that period of time in the 80s and 90s For how much we made on the farm parents really invested in you, huh in your family and your kids You know, my dad would spend everything on us, you know, so I got everything I didn't know it I didn't really think of it But now when I look back I'm like that was a ton of money that they spent like My private lessons and my skis and just everything so I had a great childhood. really never got yelled at I think the only time I got yelled at was I tripped my sister And they caught me like I don't know why I did I still don't know why I did But I was about five and I tripped my sister and they got really mad at me for that, but Yeah, I telling my mom yesterday actually that like I was always so well-behaved and never said no to them because I wanted their love and I am extremely extremely Externally motivated like that. want people's love. I want their affection And and it makes me it made me a good doctor, I think, but it makes me a poor person to do interpersonal due diligence. Like, if someone's nice to me, I am the easiest person to come on. know, I, you know, that I and that period with I don't do due diligence when I like someone.
00:11:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll just trust them to be good.
00:11:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And you'll see in my emails that I sent you about kind of my business origin stories, how it just burned five years of my life because of that.
00:11:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you sent me that?
00:11:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
didn't see that. Oh, no, literally, I just and that's another one of my problems that I put, like, I want coaching because this is a problem. Like, I do everything at the last minute. literally just emailed that to you like a minute ago. my gosh. Yeah, yeah. yeah, that's that's kind of my origin had a super happy childhood. really can't like, I couldn't plan a better childhood. You know, I never had any bad experiences. No one abused me. Think in school like middle school. I hung out with kids that we would play like punching games So I you know I get beat up But you know, it was always something that could walk away from and I just never chose to walk away from so I don't really I I guess I got bullied but I don't really consider myself like a victim of bullying them I'm just like well, you know, it made me learn how to punch people better You look for the positive in everything, huh? I miss my parents. just there's just never any anxiety. I had in my life like I never grew up with parents that Stressed me at all like if I forgot my homework my mom would literally bring it to school, right? Like Yeah, worst thing I could imagine is like forgetting my homework And I did that several times and my mom would like bring it and so I really never had like any stress or anxiety growing up around failure Yeah, I just really wanted to please you know that there are people that have parents like that that still turn out very
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very angry and bitter and, um, not choices, there are, actually. So, um, the one thing that I would point out is maybe asking, do you feel like you acknowledged your own goodness for the sake of your own goodness?
00:13:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm starting to wrap my head around that. don't know if like I'm necessarily good, but maybe my positive attitude is something I should reward myself for. Um, I'm learning that more, you know, in my, in my marriage and everything because not everyone comes from the same upbringing that I had. And I'm, uh, I definitely am more, um, accepting of how wonderful my parents were and my upbringing.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that'll probably be something that we talk about a lot, because it's really important to know yourself. Um, and I think humility is critical. I think it's everything for growth and evolution, but there is a difference. between humility and failure to acknowledge your own greatness because that's divine. I'll use God language from time to time because it's the only way I know how to do it. I don't know what your beliefs are but you can use a filter to figure out what applies and ask any questions but it helps me to not have to filter per se you know but regardless and I'll give you a very quick example like for me i'm christian our scriptures say ask him you shall be received knock or ask him knock at you it shall be open asking you shall receive and then there's a lot of attraction which has nothing to do with religion it has to do with the universe whatever but to me that's the same thing it's it's different language it's that there are things that are wanting to come to you and can come to you so just kind of an example of where the language may be different but there's there's something that can be seen into it. There's also you know the science just between of what we believe and the ability to manifest and just because our senses are elevated to being able to think about the things that we want once we've set an intention you know just psychologically our our receptors are on you know there's so there's so many different ways for it. So but um back to giving your own self credits um for the choices that you make it also be really important that you do that for your girls so that they can see that their goodness isn't just because you're good that they have the ability to choose what they do with what they're given because you could have really entitled um that's 100 a statistic that would happen with somebody that is is is so loved and taken care of is that, you know, everybody owes me everything. So, um, you are unique in that humility and that grace and that honor for your family. Um, anyway, so, so we'll have some, some things like that.
00:16:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, uh, let's just let, you know, I might, I, I consider, I, I, I'm open to, I guess some more agnostic. I'm open to the, you know, belief that there could be something higher and obviously I went to like Catholic high school.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so, a lot of my friends are devout Catholics and Christian.
00:16:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm just not, I'm not religious in that way. I think if I would have grown up in a Muslim country, I'd probably be Muslim spiritual. I don't know, in Israel, I'd probably be Jewish, know. So, uh, I think I'm, I'm really happy that some people find, uh, spirituality and religion and Christianity. uh, so I'm really happy for people that have that. And yeah, no, I don't my filter in at all because, you know, whether you believe it comes from God or whether I believe it's just, you know, part of, you know, comes to me from my work. I think it's, it's the same idea is, you know, that we should be thankful and to that. Yeah, it's filter is no problem for me.
00:17:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
happy if people are religious and happy if they're, they don't care and I don't care. But yeah, it doesn't come up a lot, but sometimes it does because I don't, I don't know another way to explain why things come up.
00:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
cool.
00:17:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love being thankful and, you know, for, you know, what you have, like you said earlier, so I don't care where that really comes from and people around me. I'm just happy that they think they think the way I do so.
00:17:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it's always nice to like have that positivity. Okay, so origin story. You had a great amazing childhood and you were cared for so being. a doctor makes a lot of sense in that in that way.
00:18:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Also, I actually, I'm, I became a doctor out of fear. Yeah, honestly, like, I'm not a doctor person. I'm really not. I have very little empathy for people. I tend to be very apathetic towards others actually. My wife actually has to teach me how to be more empathetic with her and others. It's not natural for me, partly because, you know, the upbringing I had, I am, I am, I am very selfish. Like, I definitely try to be gracious because I know that that's good. But like, inside my head, I know that I'm a badass in that way. I'm very, very intelligent. And, you know, I'm thankful for all those. things. But like, I don't think that should be at all confused that I'm a doctor, because I became a doctor for the money that I saw that was kind of promised, not promised, but like guaranteed. I made a calculation in college, like what was my odds of having a good lifestyle as a banker, which is what I was thinking of doing, banking, banking, and being happy doing that for 10 years versus if I worked 10 years to be a doctor, where would I be? And I made the choice to, I think I would rather have had the guarantee $300,000 when I was 30, than to kill myself when I was 20 to be a banker and maybe make double or triple that. was a very financially motivated decision that I became a doctor. And I think, as we get to know each other, you'll see that I have zero interest in helping.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people, really.
00:20:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Mark said, to be honest with you, some of Yes, 100%. I'm happy when things turn out that it helps others and it helps me.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what drove you for it.
00:20:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's not what drove me. don't care about helping others. I want to provide for my family. My love language is, you know, to provide my dad. So I want to be able to give my wife, my kids the best, if that's what they want, and you know, just be able to provide. And so to meet that end, and like even my parents, like, I want to be able to, now that they're 70, I want to be able to send them on amazing trips, buy things if they want it, which they don't really care about.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They actually want everything.
00:20:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But I want the means to do that. And so whatever means to that end, that's what all that's what I'll do. Yeah.
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's good. No, no. I'm not judging, I promise you, I want people to be straight, I'll tell you this, I believe that the world needs every kind of person. We need people who can compartmentalize and do the things, the hard things that no one else will do. We 100% need it. We need people that are able to fight and sometimes necessarily shed blood to protect people who would never do it. It's a terrible, horrible thing. But we need every type of person in the world. And I don't think that all characteristics that a lot of people would think are negative are inherently bad. I also believe, I mean, I speak the, I talk about yin and yang probably daily, definitely weekly. There is light and good in everything. the greater the personality, like the greater the energy, the greater the spirit, the more the better. or great light there is in there but also the more great dark there isn't there because there's equal opposites in everything and in everyone so some people you know they they travel along that full spectrum of the light and the dark throughout their life some people kind of hover in the middle um people with weaker energies you're not really going to notice which way or the other because they're just not that powerful i'm a powerful person you will feel my energy palpably whether it's good or bad which is not great for me because if i'm in a bad mood and it has nothing to do with people around me they're still very uncomfortable and they think i'm mad that they think i'm potentially violent now going to hurt something like i've had people just say i'm terrified of you you will hurt me i'm like i don't even know where you've got that from because i've never i've never had any kind of aggressive thought towards you so my point is that the the there's a whole lot inside of us that I think, you know, the awareness isn't really important. I think the labeling is detrimental because there are so many things that we will experience in life and so many things that we're able to do that may be difficult, hard, and even unsavory sometimes, but can also be for the greater good.
00:23:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the Ying and Yang speaks to me because, you know, even though I'm extremely selfish in what I want and why I've done the things, I also have a balanced, strong sense of honor that I don't do things the wrong way, I don't treat people the wrong way, I don't use people for money, like, or do things that could, that are like, that I would do something for money against another person, like, so, like, I'm selfish. selfish, but like I'm very, very, I feel like I'm very, very honorable from like my parents. Yeah. would never do something or initiate a policy or a part of a business that preys on people because of my knowledge. Like I feel like there's a lot of ways to make money in this world that I don't have to treat people poorly when in fact I can do good things for them and make money. So like in all my, in all my clinic and my businesses and treating patients, I've always done the best. And so that's like, that's, that's a part of me that I like that. Like you brought up like Ying and Yang because I do have a very deep sense of like honor and treating other people well and not using people for money. And that's so yeah, I, I, I say that I'm selfish, like, are you on the book at this trend?
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which one?
00:24:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Atlas trend. by Ayn Rand.
00:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You might find it interesting. She's very polarizing. She's passed away, but she's a very polarizing author. But it just kind of gives an insight into the definition of selfishness. So, you know, these people that basically, you don't want to give away the book, but the book is like four inches thick. It's huge. But but it's about kind of about capitalism, kind about creators, and how people, there are people that use it and abuse it and have no integrity, and how, generally speaking, government, while, you know, to be something for the people, as generally people are for the government. There are people there that, you know, there there's enough pockets of abuse of power. Yeah, that that have most of the concerns. the 80-20 rule, right? 20% of the people in the government have 80% of the power. We'll say it that way, right? So, but it's still kind of a necessary evil organization because otherwise they're chaos and anarchy and that kind of thing. But to the point of selfishness and, you know, people wanting to take away the money from billionaires, what do they need all that money for? Like if you could understand where the world would be without people who could think like that and, you know, Elon Musk has some very, you know, um, savory characteristics about him. But look at the gifts that he's given to the world. You pick up one end of the stick and it could be the poopy ends and the other end could have gold on it. But regardless, you have to pick up the whole stick. You're getting both sides of it. And that's the yin and yang, right? You can't separate the light from the dark.
00:26:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They coexist. Period. End of story. My wife likes to say that it's a spectrum. And yeah, I don't I don't think I'm wholly selfish, you know, and I'm not I'm not trying to say that I'm like a sociopath or anything.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not. No, no, I get it.
00:27:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I'm not coming off that way at all. into medicine. We're more definitely more selfish than like to like what a lot of my doctor friends like truly want to help others like martyrs, like martyr type people, you know, and yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're aware that that is not going to be the time to like we got to start on the on that understanding. But I'm not like, but you still do good.
00:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't matter that if you're, yeah, you're, you're, you're driven for, for what motivates you, but you will not do evil on the path to do it. That's right. And if good comes out of it, great. But that wasn't what you were there for the first thing. I got to, I got to, yeah, got to. Yeah. Okay. So, um, how long have you been, when did you graduate out of college?
00:27:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, 20, 2007 graduated and then. graduated med school in 2011 and then finished all my medical training in 2016.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And did you, because I just remember you gave me notes like at the last second so I had no time to read them? No. No problem there. Yeah, I didn't have the date. Okay, so let me go through here. Because my note taker isn't doing its thing where it's supposed to let me go to like highlight open fathom. Maybe that'll do it one sec. Normally everything is set up. The power went off when I was out of town and and how everything launched the way it's supposed to be. Okay, which is good. can't it um two thousand uh okay sorry 2007 you graduated when did you 2011 finish?
00:28:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
2007 was uh college and then 11 was med school. And then 2016 was when I finally finished all my medical training, so I had to work.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and when you got started, did you open up your own business or did you work with?
00:29:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Stanford kept me on his faculty, so I worked at Stanford for about a year and a half. And during that time, I unfortunately met one of my old college friends who was not a doctor. But in 2018, I quit my Stanford job because we were going to open a clinic in a surgery center together. And yeah, obviously, there was a lot of issues, but he didn't have the clinic ready. Everything was delayed. in 2018, I crawled back to Stanford, asked, could I work again? They said no, but I could do part-time with them. So in 2018, I did part-time. then finally, at 2019, the clinic. opened its doors. A lot of issues. I wrote out a couple at the very, very last email I sent you, but just no transparency in the business side. He was supposed to run the business. So we were getting a decent number of referrals in, which is the lifeblood of a clinic. So we're getting a lot of patience, but the back end was a mess. I didn't know it. didn't look. I didn't check. And then COVID hit, made everything worse. And finally in 2022, early in 2022, I was like, this isn't working. And I said, let's stop this business. So we stopped. Luckily, in 2022, there was a buyer that came along and bought our assets. So we didn't lose everything. We didn't do well. Obviously, we still lost a lot. And my biggest anger about that is I did side work. And you'll read this in the email I sent, but I did side work. for the state of California. In the 20, between 2018 and 2022, I made about 2.5 million, like literally working like weekends and nights. And all of that got rolled back into the business because my business partner had convinced me while any work that you do with us should go back in, which I'm now angry about because I'm like, that was my own free time, right? But anyway, so there's about 2.5 million that rolled in and that was what sustained the clinic because we had to pay staff, we had pay licensing fees. There was a lot of bureaucracy fees. So my extra work was what floated the clinic until it failed or until we closed it. And then in 2022, the last half of 2022 and in 2023, that was the first time that that money that I was doing on the nights and weekend became my own. It went instead of going into the business to get lost, it came into my personal bank account. account. And so that's why in 2023, that is the first year that I made, we made one point, whatever, 1.5 million, um, kept about 900 of that probably. Um, and this year we're on track to do that or more. Um, and it's all just because I don't have this weight of a failed clinic and surgery center. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, that's, uh, that's why I say like I lost five years of my, my life with a poor due diligence and just poor due diligence on my part. Like in the first year we operated, I should have looked, I should ask for the pinows. shouldn't have just trusted, right? And, uh, and so that's, uh, that's what I'm call life college?
00:32:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That costs you a few million dollars, but yeah, that is decent and it lasts you forever.
00:32:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It will last me absolutely forever. So, uh, first part of 2023 is pretty bitter. You know, I'd never been bitter, but I was pretty angry. and better. Last part of 2023, we, you know, I feel like I was myself again in 2024. I feel like I'm myself again. I'm just very positive about things. you know, everything feels back to normal to me. I almost, like, until I thought about this, like, I almost literally forgot about that terrible incident.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, like, you're welcome, but I'm sorry.
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, no, it's fine.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, again, like, I look at it like you just said, like, yeah, it was a $2.5 million like less than it was four year jail sentence that I had, but yeah, that's a good way to actually look at it. And because that that prison, we can, we can be put in prison of different types and it can be mental, it can be emotional, can be partners, it can be spouses, it can be health, it can be all kinds of things. I think, but when we, when we realize that we're in a prison, then you want to get out and you, you want to do the things and I'm glad that you recognize it. dies that the bitterness doesn't have to be there and doesn't have to stay there because that's a choice. People can stay bitter for their whole lives but if you can find what it did for you and make it count for you for the rest of your life but also you get to teach those lessons to other people and that's amazing. That's a gift that you'll be able to keep giving so those really suck. Have lots of those in a different type of way but that's good to know. So how long have you and your wife been together so I have perspective too about how these changes happen?
00:34:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah so we met in 2018 just as my clinic was still not open because it was delayed so she saw me through that period of time when the clinic was supposed to be open I had quit my job I jumped off the cliff already and it wasn't ready to be open on the business side.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have an amazing wife that's very very loving and nurturing.
00:34:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah yeah.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because if that didn't scare her away, you feel to that.
00:35:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That pretty much still be a lot of advice to be like everything that happened in the business prison, I guess, is a good, excellent way. I don't really let that, I really didn't let that into our relationship until it was inevitable that, know, 2022 it was going to, but, you know, she saw all of that, you know, through that whole time, I was the happiest person ever. I had a clinic, you know, I thought we were doing well, so, you know, there wasn't really a hard time until 2022 when I realized this isn't right, like I shouldn't be putting a million and a half a year into a clinic that should be on its own feet. So, you know, if you had met me in 2020 or 2021, you would never have believed that anything was a miss in my business, and that's how positive, how little due diligence I did.
00:35:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If we had worked together before this, it never would have happened. because I'm going to teach you to ask all the questions, to look at all the things, to have a process for it. I'm going to ask you so much that you're going to be so annoyed by it. And when you're late with responding to things, and you say, I want to get all this done.
00:36:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I'm like, but you didn't do your work. Yeah, I actually wrote that in the first part of my reflection that I've actually had. Now, when I was thinking about it, one of my friends and I during COVID, we were trying to hold each other accountable. That was 2020, right? Right, when my business, when I thought was OK, but it slowed down to COVID. But one of the things I found was that I knew she didn't know my business. So when we set weekly goals, because I wanted her praise, that I would change the targets, I would lessen my goals so that I could hit them. Or if I didn't hit them, I would tell her on the phone that we owe. Did this I did this to make it seem like I got close like I know that's a problem I have like I crave people's love and attention so much that like that's the kind of I did and mark, you know, I didn't tell mark this but like I'm really gonna make a effort to like be straight with you and not, you know, and not well not to do that but I'm just telling you that's in my nature so I'm really happy that, you know, Mark said that you'll probe your push and like I really want that because, you know, my mind I could think of things to say that makes it sound like I did it but really I didn't, you know, so.
00:37:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark, by the way, does the same thing and so for the first like year and a half he kept giving me answers and I said that doesn't add up I want to see it. We're going to screen share you're going to show me because this is not true and we're wasting our time. I have fired clients. I've not been fired. But I have fired clients because if there's no point, I don't want to get paid and feel like I'm not doing my job. Because there's plenty of money, there's plenty of clients. want to know, my thing I need to know that what I did made a difference.
00:38:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Otherwise, I'm wasting my time. So that's my kind of, competitive. that was one of the things that convinced me to do this because I was like, know, if someone would hold me and I knew my other friend was trying to hold me accountable, but she didn't know my business, right? And I could, I could spin up a story and tell her, oh, I hit my goal this week, right? But, you know, I told Mark, like, and I was thinking, like, you know, if coaching, if I can be held accountable, like, even a little bit, that would just, it would help my revenue would help every, you know, anyways, I put that as one of my goals, think we'll figure it
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out what works for you. I had one client. He told me the only time I've ever got to do things on time is if you threaten me with money. So if I don't have this done, I owe you $10,000. I'm like, whatever. But it works for him. I've never done that with anyone, but it worked for him. And then one time he did that and didn't pay me.
00:39:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I said, Okay, I'm not working for you anymore.
00:39:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wasn't kidding. So he paid me. And I was like, and now you know, I'm serious. I don't my kids know I don't threaten. I if I say it, I mean it.
00:39:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm willing to follow all the way through. That's funny. No, I like it. Yeah. And I think just no one's ever held me accountable because no one probes me. Right?
00:39:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, if you ask me one layer deep, I probably have an answer.
00:39:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. level deeps. I can think of an answer. then if you start going third level, fourth level screen sharing, know, those are where I fail. And I would be held accountable at that point. no one in my life has ever challenged me that much where it got to the point where like, I can't lie anymore, you know, or I can't, I'm not lying.
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, no, no, no, I, yeah, you're, you're, you're choosing the perspective or purpose. You're, you're controlling the perspective. Yes. I'm very happy to know that on the first call that I'm so happy that you will work on holding me.
00:40:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If we could do that one thing, that amazing.
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, we have this recorded. I'm going to go back and listen to this. So if you ever just like try to blow me off, I'm like, wait, did you not tell me you wanted this?
00:40:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. And like, the other thing I'll tell you is like, I crave love and attention. And, you know, people to look at me highly, like that money thing, 10,000, I would literally happily, happily pay that if that's still made you think, if I still made you think that I'd hit my goal. That's how like, know about money and how much I care about like, it's true. Yeah, I know I get it. I would use 10,000. $1,000 to make one of my friends think that I hit my goal for that week Like that is how much that's how little like I care about the money Yeah, it's I don't understand it about me But that I'd rather have people's praise and love and think that I'm a badass Then to have 10,000 a week like yeah, it's crazy like That's good too though because that means like money drives you, but it doesn't own you That's what's really important like the fact that you can compartmentalize like so You know, I grew up really really poor and so I had to get over the mindset issues of Money as evil and if I have a lot of it I'm gonna become a bad person and then you know, I And I still I've never worked a lot because my priority has been mom So I work enough to live very comfortably But I don't chase but but really I've averaged 10 hours a week for the last seven eight years
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can make a lot more. And if I was driven by the money, I 100% would, but then I would be here for the girls. But I have created startups with clients that have generated millions of dollars within the first year or two years on repeat. So having to learn how to do that, but I've also fired clients and had nothing while being a single mom of four kids, because I just didn't who I am and what I'm made of if I hadn't been tested. So because you've been tested, you know what you're actually made of. And we only get these defining moments a few times throughout our lives, where we get to see if we are who we say we are. So I really love those moments when they come. When the fire comes, I look at it and go, I hate you. I can't wait for you to be gone. But when we're done with this, I'm coming out victorious. Because I see you. I know what you are and you can't beat me. That's that's just it like I Really know like I'm willing to die for certain things and not stupid things but certain things So it's good. It's good that you are that you know who you are. You want to be held accountable I Want to make sure like so the very I know who I am. I I'm talking about know parts of it You know partially. I don't think any of us even by the time that we're done really really know Everything about who we are.
00:43:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We are so complex.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and 100% and who we are I think a lot of it is relative to where we are and who we're with so like I don't even think there's a specific definition. It's all we're symbiotic and It's so complex, which is why you know, it's just it's just information which is why the probing is necessary. So I might ask the same question three or four different ways, especially if you're not, if I could tell, like, you did not give me a definitive answer. You gave me a nice sounding answer. But you said it, and like, I'm very good at pulling apart the politics and going, but no, okay.
00:44:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So that's very good at giving good answers that I think will make people like me.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I bet. Very good. That's your main driver. Then you know how to do it. And you'll be very persuasive and you can get people to also probably tell you what you need to know and want to know. And are you good at getting people to do that?
00:44:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think I'm good at that. I'm good at people of my enthusiasm. I wrote that from my notes. Like, I'm very excitable. I'm very passionate when I believe in something. And so I think I'm good at getting people to feel my enthusiasm. But I don't think I'm necessarily good at getting what I want. want other people. I've never really been good at asking.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ever get depressed and anxious? No. This needs to be a really honest answer.
00:45:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, I don't think I do. I've never really been depressed. don't. The only times I've been anxious was in 2022. I thought there was a period of about three months when I thought my business partner was going to sue me for closing clinic on us because we're 50-50 partners. And that turned out to be a dumb fear because I realized that he wanted to close it too. But I think I was really anxious in that time. That was probably the most anxious I've ever Yeah, that's probably the most anxious I've ever been in my life.
00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you don't just ever like just shut down and withdraw for periods of time? Okay. No. And your wife would say the same thing? Yeah.
00:45:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Have I ever done that? Oh she has it.
00:46:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, good.
00:46:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You want to meet my wife by the way.
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, not too.
00:46:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it works from home, Oh, hi. Oh, you're beautiful.
00:46:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love your name Esther.
00:46:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love the story of Esther and the story.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doring her out.
00:46:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Exactly.
00:46:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister is named Ruth.
00:46:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I'll tell you how religious my parents for my parents. Oh my gosh. And you do not look like you're about to have a baby in a couple of months. I know you get a child.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
look at her from behind you.
00:46:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh my gosh.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you can have a look at her.
00:46:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you click on the video link, you should be able to change the while you might not want to do that. oh, look at yourself. It's a new. Yeah, we're getting there so. Yeah, and thank you. I'm so glad you guys are doing this. I think food just always have been, you know, there's only so much I can help him with. Yeah, it's helped a lot like my mentality and my empathy for others. But I'm really glad he's, you know, got on a recommendation and there's someone that he can connect with to really work with him on all things he wants to work on.
00:47:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, I'm like, I'm just smiling ear to ear and what you don't know, Fuji. Well, I kind of, I think I talked about it on our, on our original call, like I guess you would call the sales call. don't even know. But my, my joy, my greatest joy about the word that I do is actually the family impact on it. I have, mostly I work with men. I'm trying to get to more, more female. But it, it's harder because strong women have had to fight for so much. that they don't know that there's other strong women that they can lean on, because the higher you get, sometimes the more mean women can be to each other. But anyway, but my favorite thing is when the fathers get more time and less stress and more happiness, and then they get to go spend more time with their families, and that might not be an issue for you. I don't know how much you work, but for me, I'm always thinking about the wives, and I'm always thinking about the children, and I'm thinking, how can what I do have an impact on the family, because family is everything for me, and because I've been a single mom for so long, because I've had my childhood trauma, because I had bad marriage and all these other things. It's just, this is my life work and mission, is I do it through the business, but the families are always kind of my thing. So to be able to get to meet you and see your beautiful face just makes me happy.
00:48:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that's wonderful to hear. I'm really glad. You know, luckily I, you know, nothing that Bougie says since I kind of walked in here and working at my desk, you know, is surprising, you know, heard it all before too. But, you know, I love that as well. You know, family is really important to us too. And that's part of the reason why we're building our businesses so that we can have the time with our kids when, you know, they start going to extracurricular activities, you know, we really want to be here for them. I mean, there's still little right now, you know, one's not born yet. But yeah, just, you know, kind of just trying to build that future for ourselves. you know, we look at other families right now and I feel that we're extremely, extremely fortunate already in a lot of ways. And we just want to continue making that better. So I really love to hear that this is the kind of work that you do is, you know, you want to just have an impact on families. And I'm like, man, if there are other, you know, so far, other friends. can use in this coaching too so they can have more time with their family one day too.
00:50:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's amazing. Well, I'm not always looking for I do actually have a couple because so I'm transitioning. I've got four daughters, one's 23, one's 21. I have one grandchild and one on the way. I have a 17 year old and a 14 year old my 17 year olds about to leave so I've gone from chaos so yes, yes. I wanted to have a soccer team okay football or soccer whatever I wanted a whole but my body couldn't do that and I married somebody not very nice. That was difficult. But so I'm transitioning into empty nesting and I've gone from having all the time for the kids to I need to redirect that mom energy into something else that having to grow and feed and nurture. So if you do know other people that are looking for it let me know the match is really important because of the whole. holistic approach because the kind of family orientation. I'm not the person that's like, okay, I want to be 10x by the end of the year, so I could buy a new Ferrari and a new plane. And I want to work all the time. And because we can't connect, I can't relate with those goals. I can't support those goals really well. But I can support that growth and taking care of your body, getting enough sleep, eating well, being happy.
00:51:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's what I put on my email is that if I can learn to sleep, like I wrote that on my first thing, like, if we can hold me accountable and get me good sleep, oh my god, that would be the biggest one.
00:51:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was actually one of the questions I was about to ask you and you've got Esther.
00:51:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love the name Esther.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yeah, so I have just about eight more minutes before I get a jump on the call with Mark and I want to make sure and answer some questions.
00:51:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Esther, do you have any questions for me? No, I'm good. Yeah, you guys, you know, your time back.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just wanted to pop in and say hi. I'm so glad you did. I don't know if you can hear this smile but I'm burning ear to ear and I'm just so glad for this but the special thing for me today.
00:52:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I'm not depressive.
00:52:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No he's not.
00:52:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I've seen depression you know I've experienced little bit of it myself. I've never seen him depressed. He's like the happiest. His baseline he's like the happiest person you know.
00:52:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. You seem like that but there are people that are like that and then absolutely flip opposite when nobody's looking like they're on and then they're completely often so I really needed to know especially because of some of the things that you've described. I needed to know that that was or was not you because you know that would handle we'd have to create a different pattern solution systems around you if that was the case but that's good to know.
00:53:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I always tell people, my friends, like, you know, the thing that I love about food is like, once you get to know him or, you know, even if you don't know him too deeply, he's very, what you see is what you get. So, you know, even with, you know, I'm hungry, dating, there was no guesswork, there was no guessing, you know, what's going on in his mind or what's going on with him. Okay, this is what I think and take it or leave it, you know.
00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's what we're asking about your business numbers. Is that right?
00:53:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right, here.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you guys have your time back.
00:53:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I asked her.
00:53:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't nice to meet you. I don't think I'm depressed. That was awesome. Okay, let me rethink about where we're going. Um, okay, just goals accountability. Sleep.

Go ahead. Oh, it's sleep.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:54:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, through the goal setting with you accountability and sleep.
00:54:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I listed as that.
00:54:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, sleep goals and accountability.
00:54:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So tell me about your sleep real quick.
00:54:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I just, I will scroll for 30 minutes every night. literally can't sleep before 10 p.m. I will literally find reasons to watch YouTube videos for like half an hour to an hour, sometimes to every night, no matter how tired I am.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you're an ADHD person? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right.
00:54:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I do lay in bed at 10. I'm like, man, I wish I could go on this trip. Oh, I should start planning that trip. Oh my God, look at this. Like, cool house.
00:54:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to buy in 10 years.
00:54:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How do I start another business? I can support that. Do you think my current business can double or trip?
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like you don't have to explain it to me because I have that same brain. So yeah, 100%. How much do you sleep?
00:55:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Seven hours a night probably.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And have you ever had anything measure your sleep for the quality of it? How deep your sleep and?
00:55:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's good.
00:55:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you sleep?
00:55:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
When I sleep. Yeah, I've been tested for like sleep apnea. I do have like very mild sleep apnea, but when I wear like my orang or stuff like that, it's good sleep. But just not, I don't, I have to do something to wake up, you know, or it ends quickly.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have to do something to wake up or it ends quickly. Say that.
00:55:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What do you mean? Oh, like if I have to work and I have to wake up at seven a.m. I'm getting good sleep right up until my alarm goes off.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so do you have any signs of sleep deprivation?
00:56:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. Right now, I'm terribly sleep deprived. I would explain how that manifests. would use, well, I'm just not as enthusiastic. I'm very procrastinated. work is slower. My overall productivity is less. My like emotional range is like limited. Like, yeah.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you ever considered napping?
00:56:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have and then it just makes my sleep worse. Like, if I sleep, if I nap from like 12 to 1 or that night, I won't be able to sleep till like 1 or 2 or 3.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's awful.
00:56:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And how much maybe what's coming through my window right now.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the first thing I would say is, please try to get at least 15 minutes of sunshine every day. We'll talk about this a lot. I've sleep packed a lot.
00:57:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yes, we love to hear this.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, with myself and with other people and I will tell you Sunshine has a huge impact and it's different for everyone, but also can help regulate your mood and whatnot and of course there's the blue light blockers at night and things like that. But if you are ADHD, you we know that neurologically you just operate differently than some people. So there has to be some allowance and understanding for the physiology. You know, you can optimize but you can't control. You can't change your physiology completely. Although it's pretty amazing what we can do. can change a lot. I think few people ever actually like there are so many different variables that go into who we be and how we show up and and even the fact that we can modify our DNA and that we can change ourselves at a cellular level for good or for bad with different things, you know that that's really powerful but there's because there's so many variables it's really hard to isolate everything all the time you can't do it you can't have a clean algebraic expression and just go you know this this this and this and then only test this you can't do that that's not life so it's a really long process so we will ask questions about that I'll make sure that include that in things but the goal is to figure out contingencies basically so you'll have kind of a set this is my thing when this doesn't work out this is what I need to fall back on when that doesn't work out this is need to fall back on. And when none of those work out, then I need to re-regulate and come back to center as quickly as I can and just lean into the fact that your body's like, no, not today. Cool. It's not super exciting, but excited to get to work. No, yeah. Okay, so I have lots of notes to go through. I will formulate questions for the next call. already have a bunch of them. So like I said, there's a lot of like getting to know each other. I get to jump on this call with Mark.
