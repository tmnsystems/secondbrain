00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're muted. don't know if you know that.
00:00:09 - patrick
Hi, how you? Doing good.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing? I don't know how to paint. No, I just have chronic pain issues from time to time. It's stupid. I want to punch my pain in the face. It's annoying. If I had willpower, be like, knock it off. Yeah. you know what's weird, though, is I did not get notifications about your guys' messages.
00:00:49 - patrick
From the computer.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I even searched to see if they came and I didn't. So. I'll figure that out because my brain with the pain, that's the biggest issue like I can, I can deal with pain and push through it, but my brain just kind of goes, it's not very useful. Let's see, so friction point of LCA. Yeah, so that was really good awareness and insight. How, how many times do you think instances to know that that's a pattern or do you think it was just you know, just something you saw and maybe it was an exception?
00:01:40 - patrick
Oh, it's got a lot of, I'd say like a handful, but I didn't notice that it's usually only on the smaller claims because it's so easy to, you know, the client says, you know, I don't it. So it's extra stuff to reach out to them and explain why we want to get it done. And on the bigger ones, obviously, there's more incentive for us to push it because it's going to be a high value settlement, whereas the small ones, when the clients are kind of flaky, you kind of lose interest in that case because it's not going to be a big number anyways, but that's not necessarily how I treat the cases. treat them all as if they're really important cases to us. And like I said, on those small ones, it's more important to get as much treatment as possible because one more consultation with a pain doctor can shoot that offer up another $1,000, which makes a big difference.
00:02:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry. I'm going to cut you off. When you're done, I have words. Um, it made me think of a, and hello, Lorenz, I'm just gonna warn you guys, like, my brain will lapse in, uh, so please bear me a second, but it makes me think of a saying of there's no small jobs, only small people. Number one, um, number two, um, to, to, to treat people that way almost to devalue a person because of the lack of money and, and, um, because if we're saying that the reason that we push for all the treatment is because it's in their best interest to make sure that they get everything that they ought to, to take the best care of themselves that can be paid for by insurance, to treat somebody who is worth less money to us, um, is, is to say that they have less value as a human being. or were out of integrity and only pushing for more money, not for more, for better care for people. And I would have a very clear conversation about how you feel about that. And then brain come on, work for me. Oh, yeah. So, like, if the difference is roughly, well, here's another thing. Elsie's an hourly employee. So, she should bring her quality every hour, no matter who she's talking to. Um, period, you know, her, she, everybody should be giving their best at all times. And um, what sweet law makes is irrelevant. You have a job to do, do the job. and do it well. Now, again, I am not in the position to be talking the way you should talk to her. Use some talks, but there's a lot to be said for. So, one of the tactics that I like to do is asking questions. And for example, in this type of situation, I might ask, and again, my brain is not optimized right now. so, do you think that somebody who is not going to bring as big of a return to sweet law is less important? Do you think that the reason that we push for maximum doctor visits is because we're just trying to get money? Like, I would ask all the questions that instead of telling her what it seems like, I would ask her the questions. forces her to reveal what it looks like. Does that make sense?
00:06:04 - patrick
Yeah.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because first of all, those questions, she can't not answer them in her head. Now, people get uncomfortable and they may not answer them out loud. may just like look too blankly like, I hate you right now. Like, why are you calling me out like this? But the thing that they can't avoid is answering that in their head. And they can't, because you pose the question and the question will remain in their minds. And the question will pose itself to them again mentally. Every time they behave that way again. Unless they're very good at dissociation or they're associative path or psychopath and just can switch into a mode that justifies acting that way, right? So questions are really powerful. in helping somebody catch themselves in behavior that is out of integrity, and just kind of hold themselves accountable after the conversation has already happened, whereas if you just tell them that's bad, now what they're dealing with is your judgment and your opinion and your answer to the question, but when you pose the question to them, their brain automatically answers it, so that's what they have to wrestle with, and they can't wrestle it. Have you ever heard the book? I'm sorry, I don't want to laugh at her. I'm in punishment by Dostoevsky. read it in high school as I'm a nerd, and I've always been a nerd. But there's this guy, and he was a he was a professor, and he... trying to think but basically he he figured he thought that he could he was smart enough to kill somebody and get away with it it was it was so long link this was 30 years ago i read this book i don't you're not even 30 years old i don't think you are are you right you're 27 or something 28 28 yeah Lawrence do you know the book you got cut off when you were saying it crime and punishment oh i love that i'm a big guy yep dostresky so anyway he thought he could get away with murder because he was smarter than everybody else and better than everybody else and he basically was like um you know these these people just don't have any worth but what happened was he humanity kicked in and it took a toll on his soul he stained his soul and it was um the punishment was internal and it was unavoidable and the reason I'm bringing this up is because the that's what happens when you force people to face their behavior through a question. So it would be one thing like I said if you put the judgment on them they can fight it off because that's not their own voice and that's not their own judgment but when you ask them a question like so do these people deserve less care and less effort or are we only trusting for them to go get treatment because they're a dollar value you're forcing them to answer in a way in how they really feel about it and once they've answered it they cannot avoid it their conscience won't allow them to like I said unless they're sociopath, psych class, Does that make sense? Yeah. So I love questions for readership because because of that and I'm sorry I'm being redundant. Anyway, um, so, hold on a second and then the other thing was that, wait a minute, hold on, want to make sure I don't know it was, it was Karen that's been been pushing me. Okay, I was mixing that thing. Okay, so else he's not pushing. She just needs to treat people consistently. So the job is the job. The quality goal is the quality goal. It is irrelevant of who's on the other end of the line. After you've asked her the questions and she has answered, then you tell her what the expectation is. We treat everybody with equal respect and consideration and value. We push for them to get max treatment because. We don't know what's going to happen. on the road and this is the window that we have to ensure that they get treated and it gets covered, period. Do they need it? Nobody knows. The doctors don't know. Bodies are crazy. can show up later and that's not our area of expertise. That's the doctor's area of expertise. Do we get compensated for them getting more treatment? Yes, but that's not the reason to do the job. It's an added bonus but our concern as an advocate, right, we are attorneys, we are advocates for them should be to advocate for them in every way that we can to get reparations and like restitution, payment, whatever, for what they need and then also to make sure that they get the care that they need in the window. in terms In terms of LC, that's what I would say about that. Let me, while my brain is semi-working, get to Lorenz and then you guys can let me know your thoughts and then we'll wrap up because I'm just, ooh, that's so great. The system between John and Karen has been going well, few clients are going back to treatment, that's good, good job. Needs a bit of training on talking to older clients with a softer touch. That's Karen, right?
00:12:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can you tell me about Karen? she younger? what's her background? Give me a little quick one, John.
00:12:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's good. She's about, she's in her, I don't know, mid 30s. She has nine years of case management experience.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did she work for an aggressive firm before, big firm?
00:12:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think she was at Sweet Jane's before.
00:12:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay, that pretty much answers almost everything.
00:13:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and, you know, I find a lot of case managers that are coming from a California background. It takes them, it does take them a few months to adapt to the airspeed, which is, it's a little bit slower. People like the human touch, you know, you can't just text them and, you know, wash your hands and say you're done with contact. like.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They like talking and, you know, with those older, we have a lot of retirees, just, it's Arizona.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
lot of people.
00:13:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. And so older people, they, they like having a conversation. They don't want, they just, they don't just want an update. And so there's a balance to be had and because you can't stay on the phone with them forever, obviously. But at the same time, I think there's a couple of clients and last two weeks that I've gone feedback from providers that are saying, know, Karen really, you know, she really annoyed me because she was pushing hard for me to get injections even though I said I didn't want injections. I'm scared of needles. And her intentions are in the right place, right? Because the client, it's not like the client isn't hurt and we're pushing to get more money. The client has like a five millimeter bulge. And he's clearly in pain. And the doctor has tried to talk to you about injections. And she was also pushing for injections, but she came off as a little pushy. So I think maybe it's a matter of culture, know, California culture, Arizona. And kind of like, tell her that it's going to be a lot about listening and a lot about like making a call of whether to push her or it's not we can't just always push push push sometimes we have to demand a crappy offer show them this is the offer we're getting you know I really think if you got at least an estimate we would be able to push that offer up little bit and then demand again and it takes a little bit more soft touch.
00:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So two thoughts that I have here number one is depending on who the doctor is you know do they have a tactic where they can um help the patient can they put on a topical numbing cream first before getting the injection does that help with it very slowly because you'd have to have a doctor that would take time so it would be a set of injections to numb first topical then you've got the low level first numbing injection let that kick in and then they go a little bit deeper with the next level um numbing injection and so on because those those injections can be deep and so it is there is going to be pain but there's a process to minimize it and You know, if we have a doctor that's willing to take the time to go through that slowly maybe we can help them overcome that fear of pain because I mean a five-inch bolt sounds excruciating and you would think that that hurts way more than an injection, but fear is Real like it. It does a number on your brain. So that's just a thought, you know I don't know but the other thing is what I would love for you guys to do Patrick and Lorenz is Come up with a list of the types of Objections you get because when we get some call control training, I would love to be able to have whoever is offering the training Give your teams specific tactics to handle Some of those objections that we might not have thought about and the other thing is at least I can take that to mark and go Okay, so you've come across this You know how people feel you've been doing this for a while like what is your stance? If somebody tells us I'm terrified of needles, is that it just you don't push them because that's fear and that's definitely going to affect how they feel about us if we're pressuring them to do something that they're really truly afraid of? So I need you guys to come up with specific list of objections that people might have where it gets in the way of progressing the case the way that I ought to but also you can't just plow through it does that make sense?
00:17:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah well I mean you know it's this is like the third but so the doctor talked to him, Karen talked to him, I talked to him I just like he's scared of needles it's like thinking of needles he goes into a full panic attack yeah so he's probably somebody we should not be pushing because um
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, you know, that's a scenario that can be drawn very specifically, right? It's kind of an if-this-the-not, like if they say this type of thing, then we try this approach or try that approach. If they say this type of thing, we just like, okay, we respect you. You know, I just want to tell you one more time that really think that it would be less painful for you, but we understand that it's traumatic to you. And it just may not be something that you can bring yourself to do. Like, we should have somewhat of a scripted response within reason, right? So we don't want to be robotic and read a script. But something where our brains can go, okay, this is the type of way to handle this kind of situation. Because the odds that you're going to get something that is just completely new and nobody's ever experienced it is slim to none. And so I really think that this type of stuff, skill is finesse, you know, it's diplomacy, it's leadership in a way because you're leading and stewarding this client in this case towards, and even shepherding is potentially a word for it to their best good and where they need to go as a result of the trauma that they've already been through. So, if you guys can, and ask your teams, please deputize them and ask them to come up with some of the things like, I don't even know what to say with this and my success is not that great, and I would love to know how to handle it better or what is the ideal, like what the sweet law, you know, culture dictates that we do, that type of thing. How you guys feel about that?
00:19:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, come up with a list of common objections.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. actions or friction points? Yes. Something that the client will say that halts or slows down or bottlenecks, however you want to look at it, the progress of the case, diminishes, you know, because there's different things, something could slow it down, something could just be like cut it off of its knees financially. So there's different types of things will come up right in the way that it impacts the case. But anything that a client can say or do that would negatively impact the case, let's come up with a list of those things that your team finds frustrating or maybe they found frustrating and they found a way around it that works really well because there's there's multiple aspects where this comes in distributions, right? Treatment, maybe it's I don't know what else. I know those two things are probably significant treatment and distributions where there's going to be some difficult conversations that come up that have to be finessed. So if we can get as thorough of a list as possible, the timeline is probably roughly a month minimum. The only time we tried to get some corporate level training, it took months to get. I'm hoping it doesn't take that long, but because we're going to holidays, it's entirely possible. Although the other thing is because this is the slower time of the year through roughly February. Now is better time to try to get some training. So if you could make that a priority, I'd really appreciate it. I think that it would be great. here's the thing to remember and keep in mind, is that when you, so there's two ways that this makes an improvement for you and your results. one, If they're better at persuading people to do the things that is best for the case, there's more revenue, right? But the other thing that will happen is there'll be less friction, which means much less lag time, which means more hours available to get to the next thing. It will improve efficiency on a time level as well as a revenue level. And then the compounding effect kicks in because if we're teaching these level skills, the more practiced people that it, the better they become. So the sooner we get to that training, that level of training, the better. also when we remove the friction in the case, we remove it in your people's day. They have less stress. And that is always something that I'm looking for is how do we improve the quality of lives that the people I'm working with? How do I help you feel less stress? How do I feel? How do you feel more? and control and a little at the work that you do and and so this is one of those things where that has that kind of impact because you're helping reduce friction that they feel as well. Makes sense? Yeah. um sorry pain is exhausting. I think that's really all that I have. My brain is not working well so I would love it, know if you guys have any thoughts or things you wanted to share in addition to this let me know.
00:23:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah no I think you know it's all controlled be good I think you know we've talked about it for a few weeks and so I think a list of objections would be good so that we can focus the training on those I think. You know, there's different issues like, you know, length of call, the ability to schedule calls, focusing on being able to triage calls and things like that. Those are all issues that I think training would be useful for my team anyway.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you just please put that as an additional journal entry, both of you, your responses to my request and that way we just have it all in one doc and I would love it to be bullet points, specifically like for call control training so that I'm easily able to go skim that and find that. And then that will give me something to have a conversation with Mark to you because a lot of times he'll have some insight but more importantly. He's the one who's going to go hire the people that are training us.
00:25:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
we want to make sure that they are able to Give us the support that we need Yeah All right I think you should probably get some I'm feeling bad right now for even taking your time.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Actually, I feel miserable, but I actually hurt a little bit less because you guys are awesome and Cool people are a natural analgesic. I've learned that it's pretty cool Um, but thank you. Um, Patrick, did you have any other thoughts?
00:25:44 - patrick
Oh, I think the cost of us it's good to work that because You know, we're all on the phones all the time and Mm-hmm. reason you don't want to take a call is because you know, it's something that's negative or some sort of push Back right like if you know things are going great with the client you pick up the phone Because you know the conversation is gonna go well But as soon as you send out a distribution with this Client you know is gonna give you for the 40% you're like I don't want to take the call But if you know we have some things that can help us Make those calls smoother like legitimate reasons as to why you know, you know, we deserve the 40% things like that You know, we're like you said, it's less stress. You just pick up the phone and have the conversation Case managers they're taking calls all day. So I'm sure that if they have the tools to you know handle 90% of those calls in a Good fashion. They'll be less stressed out every day for sure.
00:26:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I think it's a good investment for sure Um, have you guys I haven't looked to notify how are you guys doing notice any improvement in your stats? It's just In a week, it's not a big marker, but.
00:27:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, three days, three business days in the month so far, but.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, well, you could look at like your time to close over the last 90 days versus what we looked at last week, that type of thing.
00:27:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's okay, if you if you haven't, I do want to make sure that we're we're looking at that every week and just we don't have access to those. Oh, we. Okay. We're still we're still working on that. And also Isaac is going on paternity leave and he facilitates a lot of the stuff that we're working on and letify with this other guy. So hopefully, we'll be able to get that going. Okay. So, please continue to think about the structure of your day, reviewing your cases, make sure that everything's getting touched, do you feel like you guys are staying on top of that?
00:28:17 - patrick
Yeah.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consistently. Okay. And your team as well, I'm definitely losing steam. So, the last thing, let me ask, Lorenz, how's Carrie doing?
00:28:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's better. She's decided to just do some physical therapy at home for about a month. If in a month, she's not feeling better. She'll try a different type of injection, injection, I guess.
00:28:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That really, like, it hits home, it's hitting home, but how does that impact your thought about what you do in your job?
00:28:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Like, this is literally what your clients go through. Yeah, well, I mean, I was re-rounded a year ago, and I went kind of through it also. And so, yeah, you know, when they tell me, you know, they're hurting, but it's not that bad, and I don't want to do, like, I don't want to burn my, the, my nerve endings off just because of the, I don't feel like the level of pain justifies it. I get it. I felt the same way, you know, but I can tell them, but guess what, I'm still in pain. I decided not to do the injections. I settled my case for less than it was worth, even though I knew better because I've been doing this for 10 years. Yeah. I'm still in pain.
00:29:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, that might be worth if you ever have group, sweet law meetings, you know, something to share that perspective and anyone else that has that because that's internal knowledge that the collective can benefit from, like, we've got one of our own. Like, we know with this, this isn't somebody's just hypochondriac whining about. it up like that.
00:31:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it's tough. But you know, she's not as bad as she was. it's healing, which is very slow.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, the one thing I'll leave with you guys too, and it's relative to to the healing and for Carrie, but also for the work that you're doing is my favorite review period is one year. I've never looked back one year and go anything other than dang. That's amazing. at how far we've come. I can get to eight months and be like, there's just something that happens at that year mark when you really take stock of where you were and really get good at itemizing the improvements and the growth that happened, especially growth as a result of opposition or trauma. Because after you year, there's always sufficient healing where I can go. You know what, I can see what was a blessing out of that, not that you would ever wish it on yourself, that type of thing. But when you look at your teens, when you look at your systems, when you look at your revenue, when you look at your stats and you look all of that a year ago, it's, I've never seen anybody that shows up consistently and does their work that doesn't just go, wow, that's really pretty incredible. The problem is, generally, we look too narrow and we're looking at the here and now way too often. And you got to be in the present, right? But we simultaneously zoom in and zoom out and look at that and go, yeah, you know what, but you can do that every day. You know, you don't have to wait a year from now to look back a year from now. You can every day look back a year from now. My close time was like 390 days and now it's like 320, like that's a big deal, you know, and retainers and the way that your team performs and how you feel about your role in the place. There's so many different things that you can measure and a matter of fact, and other assignment, I will get it from the fathom notes because my brain can't even write it down and it doesn't necessarily need to be by next week, but it's something I'd like you guys to work on is, what are the things that you notice that you've made improvement on this year from last? What's better? And obviously Patrick, you know, or so it's going to be different, but then and also what are some of the things you'd like to see be improved a year from now? Because when you start getting in the practice of looking at things like that, you get less afraid, but I'll tell you what else, it becomes a great negotiation. I think if you ever feel under fire when you go back and you look like look this is what I brought to the table this past year. First of all a few people ever take that kind of stock and they ever they they fail to have it mentally ready but you're not going to catch me sleeping like anybody like I've had a client like well I was thinking about this and like okay if you want to quit and it never comes up anymore because I just make it I just bake it into my practice of reminding people where we've come from but like here's what happened this is the growth that we had and this is you know I told you this you did this I told you this you did this this is what it did for us monetarily this is what it did for your time wise this is what it did for you energetically that type of thing so you can read that to the table and like this is how I improved Elsie this is how I improved Karen this is how I improved my you know what I mean like this is how they were performing before this how they're performing now because I was working with them when we did this. So if you ever get faced with a situation and it could be anywhere, it could be inside your team. Maybe somebody is like, well, Lorenz is annoying me. Yeah, okay. Well, this is how I've served you this way. This is how I've served you this way. This is how I taught you. You know what I mean? but it's good for you too, and it does as it keeps doubt at day. Because I'm telling you, there is an adversary to all goodness, and he will try to get in your head from time time and tell you, like, you're not good enough or, you know, something's wrong. So taking stock of the things that you do good, it's the same concept as accounting or blessings, which is I'm in a habit of as an asthmatic. I'm like glad for Erin. My love moves every day. You and I am going to go get some rest. but thank you for being amazing because I was able to show up and do work just because you guys are awesome.
00:36:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, thank you for showing up. Appreciate you.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Appreciate both of you. All right. Oh, wait, wait, Does anybody have any cool Halloween stories from last week, like pictures?
00:36:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Anybody kids with with a different group of friends?
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you have to track them down through like three different neighborhoods. it was, but one of my kids got like 10 pounds of candy. So Dang. Yeah, he's not eating all of it. Well, what about Patrick?
00:36:49 - patrick
No, just some stuff at the office, but Did you get a trick? I heard there was a there was a party and then Mark's
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for six. So here's just like, yeah, we'll hold different things. Adulting. All right, you guys will have a good week. Please remember your assignments. If somebody wants to email me and remind me to send you the notes, I will do that. But I'm going to get the second I'm off the call because I think I'm going to go pass it all.
00:37:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sounds good.
00:37:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right,
