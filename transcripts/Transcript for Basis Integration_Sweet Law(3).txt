I'm sort of happy with it. That's okay.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're an early bird.
00:00:14 - mark sweet
What's up with that? Well, I told you I was going to be here for it. And despite me not having a time change totally.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:00:28 - mark sweet
Yeah. Oh, I forgot.
00:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I didn't think it was that early for some reason.
00:00:34 - mark sweet
It's 5 a.m.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought it was 6 a.m.
00:00:36 - mark sweet
for some reason, but I can't do math.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:00:42 - mark sweet
so excited to accept.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm also like trying not to be mad because I have to drive an extra hour. So it's a total of like six hour drive in the snow. It's going to be an all day thing. And. That's hard for my girls. It's not so big of a deal for me, but I don't want them to be cranky because they're in the car a lot. Anyway, also, we got a ton of snow and I'm just, they told me I'd be at a different airport and he wasn't supposed to, like, tell me that. So, I'm a little just girl, but also peppy.
00:01:26 - mark sweet
Yay.
00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, Dan. morning.
00:01:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm tired.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that makes three of us, except I get a puppy Wednesday, so I get to, like, draw some energy from that.
00:01:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, there you go.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I walked out this morning to go look at, because it's a snow day. I woke up and found out it was a snow day. So I went to go check the roads and right outside my window, like, immediately two feet away from my house. There's a buck just napping. And I look at him and he turns around and he looks at me and he yawns.
00:02:10 - mark sweet
Is that threatening?
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, no Now I saw my sister dear videos all the time and she sends me a video back with like Snow White talking to the bird.
00:02:21 - mark sweet
She's like, this is you and your dear. Yes, right.
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. Anyway. Wait, I didn't see a month to date.

00:02:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We're in Japan.
00:02:42 - mark sweet

00:02:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it was crazy. You say 12 wagu.
00:03:00 - mark sweet
e12 like basically everyone always thinks of the best of the a5 like now that's like the low end of the high end here a7's like where we started this is a play set how different is it it's like melting space cow jam I don't know better way to say it how jam is really like it didn't really soft and tender yeah because like really good wagyu like most in your tongue right it like just disintegrated but like space juice I don't know what to say gypped is like it's a slurp in gypsies man man anyway it's fine Dan, are you a gypsy?
00:04:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like by blood?
00:04:04 - mark sweet
No, my choice. Are you a dog in the gypsy culture?
00:04:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I've been known to gypsy.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, don't you have like a psychic?
00:04:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a gypsy? She might be. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I do that sort of gypsy stuff. I also get my crystal thing that people send me. I don't know why. I don't know why they think I'm into crystals, but I get of a gigantic crystal right across the river from me.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, somebody has told you you're a witch, right?
00:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the person that sent me the crystal.
00:04:41 - mark sweet
This is all true.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm still waiting. So, well, Dan, do you have anything to report just to get us started?
00:04:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, would they just send over the last two pieces of The content that we bought, so Abbachek and BJ will turn those into pages, and then that's going to let us roll out the new SEO-ified homepage. We finished the 10,000 plus blog post categorizations on Friday, so now Abbachek and BJ, I think they this task on Monday. No. What the whole day is it? So when did they? must have been Friday. Hey, God, I feel like I'm living a second Monday, like isn't today? only thing missing there was the blog category pages, so we have the design, so they're building, I think they're building one, and I just have to make sure it's what it's supposed to be, so that that would to like, basically it's if there's 30 categories, then there's going to be 30 category pages. And then on that page, it will list the most recent, I think it's like 10 to 12 news posts that are in that category. So then pages are always updating. And then those, then I'm going to send all that be like, all right, here's, we classified all the, all the news posts, here are the category pages, make sure that we're linking them correctly, because I think he wants that I think that each category page has to be one click away from the page, which means we probably put something down near the footer, or it can be two clicks. If it's two clicks, it's easy. So once he says, yeah, that's linking structure, then I hit him with, okay, now let's talk about Getting rid of old post cuz he says that's What drags down the site the most is just having you know 2000 posts from 2018 or whatever it is So once he saw that he'll tell us how he wants to go about that which I'm sure is gonna be some sort of combination of redirects and deletes But I don't know and then they we have five pages for SEO content that They requested today, so I'm going through right now. I'm going through the old AdWords keyword data to pull five five keywords to finish up the content package that we Yeah Check the that top impression share strategy. I just tweaked it, but Google Google. Oh, yeah, this is what it's for. It doesn't work as well as what I was already doing. But I just tweaked it to see if it can be. But I mean, it's losing. It's losing in the way it's not supposed to lose, right? If you're supposed to get top impression shares, the goal, it's not getting that the old not toss top impression chair bid strategy gets more. So I don't know. It said it was being restricted by bids. And I'm like, I don't know how much more you want me to bid on our own brand, but I like doubled it. And then I increased the budget. So I just did that five minutes ago. So we'll see if that actually ever works. I've never done it. So I don't know that it will work.
00:08:52 - mark sweet
5050.
00:08:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, it wasn't costing more, but that's what was it? So did not go. Us more, but it got worse results. Like what's the point? Hopefully you're not buying Bitcoin as well.
00:09:12 - mark sweet
I've not bought more Bitcoin from a long, long time ago.
00:09:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's about it. That was not the time. There's a correction coming. That's your chance to get in.
00:09:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so still no report, though.
00:09:29 - mark sweet
I just had said. OK, so I apologize the little boy. We have a lot of our dinners out Friday. Last week was a good week, a poop show. No, of like chaos and craziness, because we had like care for attorney party or holiday party. We get everyone on boat and then we signed a case that we got them to wait till Friday morning, but I had to fly to Phoenix to go sign them. But if it's everything they say it is, it's like a $10 million plus case. So UPS truck, a guy in a motorcycle. He's in a wheelchair right now. They're not sure he's going to walk or not. He's got a compression of fractures in his lower spine, broke two arms and had to have tendon surgery.
00:10:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What happened? He's 20 years old. Wait, sorry. What'd you say?
00:10:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's source. I don't know what the source is.
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who got who got the outlet? Oh, yeah.
00:10:27 - mark sweet
Felipe.
00:10:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, but they'd already met with like two attorneys and one team like the hospital and stuff. So it was not an easy sale.
00:10:39 - mark sweet
This is why I had my on a plane after being, you know, not playing.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You really won that.
00:10:47 - mark sweet
You didn't tell me that part. Because again, we've been up to like six a.m. on Saturday to come to Japan.
00:10:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So um, I know he doesn't mean last week and didn't tell me that like that they
00:11:00 - mark sweet
Seeing other people. Oh, yeah. No, but I'm really good at what I do.
00:11:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So it's not drinking really pays off.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is also true.
00:11:10 - mark sweet
Yeah, this is also true. So we have an appointment on the 19th to walk in and pick up the report.
00:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To find out the police station.
00:11:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, because the motorcycle burned to a Christmas, but in my experience, that's not a great sign.
00:11:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, but we'll see. The issue is whether or not he's at fault.
00:11:40 - mark sweet
Yes, because my experience, the super fast motorcycle rider. Yeah, he proposed the UPS truck. Yeah. if it's UPS, UPS truck could be great, but you know, nice kid. runs on like, taco stand. There's like hot dogs walking tacos and stuff, so good. They're nice people, so really, really, really hopeful. But again, 20-something spike fast, Ben.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was that kid. I just didn't get my accident.
00:12:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, so, but all good stuff. Hi Japan. Yeah.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, from Japan. When did you guys get it?

00:14:05 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three Felipe. I mean, Felipe, like, kill him if you get that one now.
00:14:14 - mark sweet
Yeah, it worth it. But their cost is crazy high. But yeah, that will make it basically always worth it. It's just messed up to say, but yes.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it's the nature of the business and we take one here and come. so look at this. Oh, east. So how many walker total of nine? 14 total walker, seven monkey monkeys coming back a bit then.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's definitely up in nine minutes.
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's coming back. Yeah. And valuance still only at three.
00:15:00 - mark sweet
Yeah, then we got like two out. So not bad. put some on pace for, you know, 10.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:06 - mark sweet
Yeah. So that wouldn't be terrible.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Lorenz CC you on his state of the union email or did you send out yet?
00:15:26 - mark sweet
No. No.
00:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a good email. It should be coming. think maybe, maybe he said he's going to send that Monday or today. no. But if you see it, I think you're like, let me know what you think about it when you do see it.
00:15:44 - mark sweet
I was like seeing them last week. Sounds good.
00:15:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, did Carrie talk to Chona?
00:15:51 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did Chona have any help for her?
00:15:57 - mark sweet
I don't know.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And well, Lauren seems pretty defeated about it and I was really, as she doesn't really, basically want to get help anymore. And I was hoping that maybe Chona would have some advice than how, because it's been a long time and it's just blah. Anyway, so I was wondering, but I did an interview, I just asked if I could and asked Chona if she could look into it or whatever, but she's like, no, no, no, no, no.
00:16:31 - mark sweet
When she wakes up, I'll last.
00:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:16:35 - mark sweet
When she wakes up, I'll her.
00:16:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you say?
00:16:40 - mark sweet
When she wakes up, I will ask her.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to point that. All right, um, yeah. Anyway, she had a really, you probably know, anyway, it does every time I honestly wasn't that bad.
00:16:58 - mark sweet
I don't know why they got hurt from it.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, she's basically, like, immobile and depressed, and I can see it on Lorentz's face every single time I talk to her, so, what sake of sweet law as well, you know, the family. But, yeah, anyway, this whole end of year, oh, wait, and did you tell me, no, I'm waiting for that report this week? He's supposed to tell me how many of the cases that were in, what's the word, where's that? Um, what, like, when it's, um, I'm kind of holding for a long time, I can't remember the word. Um, what the heck? Anyway. Okay, things settling that have had been there for a long time that are missing his start for time for closing, like there was a bunch of them. so he said a bunch and I said, I need you to quantify that and go tell me exactly how many that is because then I'll throw those out and update the numbers and see because I don't want it to be an excuse, like I need to be able to measure that he's not going backwards with everything that's happening. So that's what I'm looking at. All right, hold on, me go down here. Did you end up calling any of the places legal converse conversion center or legally? I didn't I kind of in there. Renz's team is looking forward to that for sure.
00:19:10 - mark sweet
Yeah, this going to rolled out to intake first. I'm. And sickly worried about how we're going to have to segment it out for. People said, we'll figure it out, but. It is a concern.
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dick, can elaborate on the concern?
00:19:28 - mark sweet
If you record something that is between turning the client, there's potentially a break of setting my privilege.
00:19:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:19:45 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's okay. It's okay.
00:19:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wonder if. If I'm like, and this. It'd be a lot of work, but it had to be like, would know because it'd be tone, but redacted call script and then have that be run through AI.
00:20:11 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we'll see how that would violate privilege if you took anything that you do that direct the records is that. Oh, yeah, because you'd have to record it anyway to even get a transcript. Oh, all right. Um, what's the status on doctor's office gifts?
00:20:39 - mark sweet
Um, so we got out. Uh, I don't know if got to meditate yet. Um, the blacks were before they were doing last year, like you won, right. factor of distinction of the year, whatever, like the same kind of crap we get. Yeah. Uh, we decided not to start the monthly subscription service and to only be getting in the year before. is honestly everyone's getting flooded with Christmas gifts and so it'll just kind of get lost with sauce. So that's why we didn't do that. But what we talked about last week, what we determined was each doctor is going to have to have their own thing.
00:21:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, as you know we're talking about it, no idea.
00:21:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So really good at coming up with ideas, but turn with follow-up and follow-through.
00:21:36 - mark sweet
After like a month or two. Yeah, shiny ball. The easiest way to continually touch doctors without going to jail is to send them things every month, right? And so we've been doing that for like a month or two and then dropping off massively. So instead of dropping off massively, we're just going to sign up for those monthly subscription services like to Harry and David or Mexico or One Club or whatever. That way it's automatically done.
00:22:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Here you go.
00:22:08 - mark sweet
So that way we'll look at it every like quarter, three, six months and if it's not performing, just cut off our subscription.
00:22:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly.
00:22:21 - mark sweet
So we outsourced the problem, I guess. I think it comes with outsourcing.
00:22:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It definitely does.
00:22:28 - mark sweet
Cool. I like that and that'll be good. And again, just trying to stay top of mind. competition level keeps going up and up for these underrepresented cases. The doctors like us and they work with us. enjoy it. get paid well. They know we're picky, but overall they might working with us.
00:22:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:22:49 - mark sweet
So when she goes to top of mind. Okay. Okay.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got a message back from Stacey about something I said. last week. And I just noticed it. Wait, damn. Automating a proven methodology or automating a figure out strategy. This is a figure out strategy. Okay, so we have all the doctors offices and all the contacts that we communicate with that office under a company. okay, this was a this was a a suggestion, trying to figure out how we could automate doctor follow ups. When we you were here for the first version of that call, Dan, when we were talking about like, cleaning marks, phone number, and the second version of it that we talked about last week is maybe having sent net tracks. When was the last time that we communicated with the doctor's office? Was it because they sent us a case? Or can we run a script that goes, has there been any interrupt?
00:25:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
the generator, if it's generated, let's say it's from Lidify because we got a case and it's got Dr. so-and-so. So that happens, right? That happens essentially passively, right? That would be like new referral, whatever. But where does that get registered so that a system says, Oh, I don't need to do this step because they've met this criteria. Similarly, if somebody, if it were to send a text, then it would be, you would have to track, oh, text was sent. So therefore, time, if this thing comes around like every week or whatever it is, whatever the time table is, it would have to run through a series of checks and say, hey, there's five different things that count as a touch. Did any of these occur? And then And it would all need to feed into lead flow, basically. your own, your one outside system is, uh, litify, which would speed in probably only that a case got signed. And then everything else would have to. Probably, like, I mean, if somebody ever manually texted them, like, how would you know that? Is that even a scenario that would happen? Like, is there ever going to be a human that can step in and essentially need to be accounted for, if not, that's simpler. But if a human does engage, then there would need to be a process for the human to be like, Hey, I did this thing, this thing occurred. And then the system knows it happens. So when the system comes around to run again, it goes, Oh, I don't need to do it because this human told me that they did it two days ago or whatever. And the other bit is that high level doesn't work the way there is no, hey, these contacts are from this office, right? It's the way it's set up is there's the company is sweet law. There are no, there's no sub-companies or sub ways to create entities. I mean, there are, but it's not, it's not, it's not a feature that it's, it's quasi-custom. They actually just released it like a month ago, maybe, maybe not even a month. So you, you can create essentially, I think you could create a doctor's office, let's say. We've, I've never used it. So you, and then I don't, I don't know. Assume that you could create that and then you would use it to associate like Several contacts and say these contacts are all this So I think that part's all but the the real thing is how do you build the system around something that doesn't Exist or I mean you can build it on the floor.
00:28:20 - mark sweet
So this is a little simpler than that potentially It's probably better as his own separated out system The whole idea is just to create more contacts with doctors that looks like this personalized like I'm texting them But that not each doctor gets the exact same text That's easy because you could use chat GPT you could use exactly, but how do we automate it? So marks just putting it in automatically or well That's easy because you could say you could write a prompt that says hey You're this is too.
00:28:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're gonna write a tech a reach out text Bladley Blah, right?
00:28:58 - mark sweet
You could you could like wish
00:29:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
say right before Christmas I decided when it takes like hey I hope you have an amazing holidays I'm here in Japan having fun and XYZ right and then I want to set it out to 30-40 doctors that looks like it's going for my cell phone but each doctor is getting a slightly different text and hopefully at slightly different times other than if it's not as mandatory what's a little more uh so okay oh my god I did not sneeze I don't know why you're here go away um how does it really even be different in in text because yes even if listen just listen even if it certainly could be but that would be like how do you trigger like there's a way where you could like I'll bet there's a way we could be like you want to send a text to the doctors like you text the app and then the app It goes, OK, now I'm going to take it from here, right? So you wrote that, you write that text. It comes in, the app captures it and goes, oh, Mark wants to send a text to all the doctors like this. And then it rewrites it and sends it out to everyone. But it's like, how would you trigger that around the holidays are coming up, right? It's like, that's, you could probably say, I have to manually do it.
00:30:23 - mark sweet
I just manually create a, what's called, base text, and just write it to my calendar. And then it goes from there. So it doesn't necessarily have to on a schedule per se.
00:30:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
would certainly be better for me.
00:30:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that could be interesting.
00:30:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make.com has, I'm trying to think of it. It has a, OK, let's say there's all the doctors list and you give it a list. And it's got a text partial that can spread out each of them. And then there's a call where you can connect it to different apps. one of them can be chat GPT. And then you can give it a prompt. inside of the mate.com recipe that says send a unique email that is like this. There's a possibility that some might end up being the same. I don't know how you you it's not going to be perfect and that's okay but it should give variations according to your voice and text because it's tied to your account it should you should be able to say in my voice like if you have trained it at all and asked it to identify and have your voice saved in memory. It should be able to say maintain my voice right but make a slight variation and so that every version of this is unique. You should be able to do that in mate.com and then if this does not or Zapier but what I would do so that we get there the fastest is actually contact their support whichever one you want to try. I and say, what is the fastest version of this to ensure as much uniqueness as possible and as few glitches as possible, but I'm pretty positive that you could integrate this, either make or zap your to do that and have chat sheet be to it, do it, even if you didn't build an app in high level.
00:32:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't think it'd be very complicated at all. Not continue upon what's happening in Lidify, so this is more like a nerdy usefulness. All right, if this is more just like touchpot, right, it's like just designed to I like that name, the good one, actually. That just felt touchpot.
00:32:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
probably watch big being very too much because that just sounded naughty to me.
00:32:50 - mark sweet
Wow.
00:32:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just the way that Mark described it in my head, that translated to, oh, okay. and you create predefined events on a calendar and then in that event put a note so that when the event hits that's the trigger in the automation and the automation goes okay now use the note the note is the text and then you take that or the sample the sample message and then you take that and you feed it into to chat GPT or in automation and you say hey here's the text I want to send everyone make it unique and send it out to these ex people something like that that might be possible honestly I think this could be good for a lot of different things like they see Jonas getting out to a lot of them she works with or Fuji sending it out to the case managers or people that he's closer with because again it's not just any business anywhere yes yes touchpot it's gonna take over the world touch the world I think the trick would be No, I think it actually might work because as they each would pass through that step separately. and it should like, so you might have to put a delay timer so that it definitely has time to like rewrite and then send it and then send it.
00:34:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then, okay, so because sometimes they fail, unlike messages don't get delivered or whatever. So it can also, I know May.com could do this like, let's say it does that and say, okay, when you finished output a report to a Google Doc or spreadsheet and update that. And then when it runs again, so it can run every 15 minutes, every hour, every day, every week, every month, whatever, go check the spreadsheet that you last reported anything that failed, right? So maybe in 24 hours, check to see if anything failed, then run again for anything that failed. And then anything that was did not fail. Even if it didn't, it wouldn't matter what database you're using as long as that could integrate with either Zapier or mate.com and it could go get those contacts for you.
00:36:17 - mark sweet
Okay. Sorry to make this happen.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you'd have to decide who's in charge of it. But you guys use Zapier a lot, right? Eric look into this if we gave him the transcript of what we just talked about?
00:36:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So he's got instructions. Yeah, we have to map it out. don't know. I mean, in my head, I'm like, I don't know how you would do that with Zapier. I mean, I have parts of it. Yeah, a little bit.
00:36:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure about. Yeah, I mean, so you have all your doctors and let it by, but I don't think I don't know if Zapier connects to that.
00:37:00 - mark sweet
I don't have problem manually putting it in because the doctors and the fight are their office numbers, not their cell phones.
00:37:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we already have doesn't America already have a spreadsheet with all doctors?
00:37:13 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:37:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so being able to do that, I don't it's list of doctors and then you could have columns with contact date. Like you could have you could have a new document that pulls data from America's original thing. So nothing is writing to her document. And it pulls and prints basically like makes a call to her document to get the doctors names, their phone numbers to text. And then so that would be like column A, column B, and then column C could be contact date. and message ID, and the message ID would be correlating to each week that we're sending stuff out, right? So we would have another tab in that same spreadsheet that lists the messages and the message IDs. so like when you have your chat session with chat GPT, like, okay, help me map out, you know, all of January or maybe that Q1. And so they're really short, simple messages. So it's not gonna be an issue containing it in a spreadsheet. And then you just assign message ID and it could be like J-W-W-1. And so January, work week one, 2024. That could be the message ID. And then so you would be able to do that, just drag it down because Excel should be able to predict that pattern or W-W-1, 2024, W-W-2, 2024, something like that. Anyway. Oh, you've got all the message IDs and then you've got all the messages and so that should be enough information to integrate with Zapier because it's got the doctor, it's got the phone number so and doctor's name and the phone number. It's got a message ID and the text for the message. So it has all the things to assemble the message and then if it's got read right access to the document, it should be able to say, okay, message sent successfully on this date. And we specified the column. Dan, that's, that should work.
00:39:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
In theory.
00:39:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, of course.
00:39:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sounds overly complicated, I'm being honest, but I'm.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does that sound complicated?
00:39:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's a spreadsheet with like a few. A time of zaps is what it's going to happen.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think so.
00:39:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You, you have to zap in every time. update a column and then you know it's oh oh like the actual okay got it we have to connect to Twilio you're gonna have to like whatever your SMS provider's gonna be you're gonna have to zap into the sheet you're gonna have to so multiple steps you're gonna have to I don't know what you'll get but you know it's I get what you're saying but I just don't know where it breaks right it's like are you gonna get a response from Twilio can't you know I don't know I don't know what you get with Twilio's apps right I've used them but I've used them to just I think the only thing we use them for works using sweet laws we have a telescope it's a landline to result on like that's I've done that but I haven't I've never sent a text with the zap because I haven't had to yeah well I mean the one thing I would say and this is more for you mark because I feel like innovation is kind of uh
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and part of your personal culture, the marketing, the tech, and the things like that. So we could explore it, we could look at whether it's with Dan, if Dan hasn't any interest in it, because we didn't ask you if you're interested in doing that, or hiring somebody off of Upwork, or asking Zapia or Adia partners who might be able to do something like this, that type of thing.
00:41:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But it's just a matter of time before someone does it. No, but I think you can build a 90% of it with high level, and you would get the thing that I see failing there is when a message fails, they don't know that they have, you could add a tag, but imagine that this is going to be a huge automation, if a message fails, You get a notification that the message failed, you wouldn't you could maybe write them back, but you'd have to It's fine.
00:42:08 - mark sweet
As long as you get a message it failed. And we know that the cell phone's bad, which don't tend to up their cell phones very often.
00:42:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. The reason they fail is because the cell phone's bad. You're gonna get that message whatever the so that then it becomes it's like a big automation that has all these events in it, right? You predefined that these events holiday event. right. Here's your Christmas message. Here's and you want to week.
00:42:36 - mark sweet
It doesn't matter what it is. Mm hmm.
00:42:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Then it's then all the doctors get loaded into it and then it's like Plinko. They just go down the whole thing over the course of the year. There's just a couple things of like, can you use the notes of the event to populate the query? I don't know. It's not How do you how do you get the pre the predefined texts to be read and use part of the thing? I'm sure there's a there's a way, but I can and then you'd be able to go in and see at a Contact level right you would you tag these people as doctors then you'd go into their record and you'd have the universal You know high levels got the whole stream of all the communications, so you'd see every text that went out you'd see If they responded you could respond through the app, but it would also text you And we can call my cell phone number, right? Like we can change the app on over to look like whatever we want to look like we can we can make it We can associate every one of those records with you So then it would text you So it would look like a game and then the response would go to you
00:44:00 - mark sweet
Got it. Because yeah, the follow up once I get a text is not hard for me to do. just the initial text and remember like, hey, I'm doing something cool.
00:44:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
should make friends with people instead of spending hours at dinner or golf and have AI take over, but I wouldn't jump to that.
00:44:15 - mark sweet
Not yet.
00:44:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Then they just start marking AI like, yeah.
00:44:23 - mark sweet
When it says kill yourself, that's a new problem.
00:44:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, that's gonna be wrong. I've seen some impressive AI conversations, but I don't know if I'd let it take over me.
00:44:33 - mark sweet
Yes, sir.
00:44:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, so I mean, I get it. It's just going to be a matter of like, there's always point where you're like, I mean, it happens to me. I'm like, oh, we'll do it like this and then you go in and you go, oh, you can't do that. That doesn't exist. But I get, this is simpler than what was then the multiple touch points, the multiple touch points. And maybe you expect and into that after. Start with same principle or just start with a touch point. Hey, we want to have this text touch point. It's the only one that's going to be tried. So I want that needs to be dealt with. makes it easier to do.
00:45:18 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:45:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And then later on when it's like, oh, we got a referral, you could go, hey, send a thanks. Anytime this happens, send a thanks for the referral from Mark. Done. That's easy.
00:45:31 - mark sweet
Yep. Yeah. I mean, that one's a little less concerning because we already like by the moment or whatever else. So we have a system for that. It's manual, but we have a system for that.
00:45:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So next step.
00:45:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'll talk to Eric about it. I mean, I have a pretty good idea. I mean, I can see 80% of it. Like. in my head in an automation.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I think that's a good start. because, I mean, when it comes to technology and innovation, the odds that you actually see everything correctly from the beginning are pretty much non-existent. So you have to take a step forward and you have to start building just to see, you know, what the landscape actually is and what the possibility has.
00:46:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
yeah, then the other bit is that I have these developers, right? So they can, they can extend high level now. And I've been doing some cool with them. So, you know, that's another thing that I run into is like, oh, you can't do it like this. And then I go to those guys and go, hey, can you build me an app that does XYZ? they're like, yeah, it's 600 bucks. like, great.
00:46:47 - mark sweet
As long as we go for 600 bucks, I am all about.
00:46:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, it's dope. Yeah. mean, do. Yeah, we get it on our own server. And that's it.
00:46:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, And on our fees for going and hiring people because he gets the best deals.
00:47:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
These guys have literally like now that I've yet to come up with something that we haven't been able to get around. Like there's been a couple of things with high level that I was like, Oh, it doesn't do it. And it legit there. There's one I still there's one I haven't gotten over, which I don't think I'm going to get over, but so 99% of the things we've been able to figure out of them.
00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Dan is going.
00:47:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Pudge bot.
00:47:37 - mark sweet
We're naming it.
00:47:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, we are, for sure.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right.
00:47:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, that is a hundred centred snake because there's like four or five people outside my head who would definitely want this.
00:47:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is it time to talk about Tina getting a raise? I'm just kidding. That's what I do.
00:48:01 - mark sweet
This is going to help you pitch new clients.
00:48:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't like you.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want new clients.
00:48:05 - mark sweet
get Tina and touchpot.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want new clients. I'm actively opposed to getting them up.
00:48:12 - mark sweet
Yeah. You get T squared. Tina and touchpot.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds wrong. I cannot with that name. Yeah.
00:48:22 - mark sweet
It's going to grow on you.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's a weird idea.
00:48:27 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My brain.
00:48:30 - mark sweet
Stop it.
00:48:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't hear a dense word I do before I forget.
00:48:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often?
00:48:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because Tina will know this too. How often do these lawyers internally run into like, how do I? What is this? What do we do this for? Where it's something that they could be in a central repository. They don't need to talk to you or they don't need to talk to Salco. Or it's like, hey, this is something that everyone should know. And this is where you can get it now.
00:49:03 - mark sweet
So there's a certain thing.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's who's a lot like a client? have a question about a case, but I don't need to talk to somebody because there's a knowledge base and I can go ask the bot.
00:49:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep, like you build bots for intake and bots for the lawyers using Delphi, right? Because Delphi is as smart as you make it.
00:49:32 - mark sweet
I don't have any mission training manuals. I get what you're saying. We're basically just using making a chat bot based off of the document so they can find the answers to their questions of the document. So I get what you're saying. Theoretically it's helpful. Yeah. Theoretically, but the amount of work it would potentially take is probably not worth it at this point. But I came up on that AI conference like for HR.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
This like replaces HR people.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, somebody's going to do it and back to the point of our goal needs to be to increase margin.
00:50:09 - mark sweet
Well, hold on, this brought me down a weird idea when I was on the airplane thinking about this because we have a large amount of knowledge and if we theoretically put it all down on a piece of paper and trained a bot basically of how to do pre-litigation and then sold it to people as a self-service model where you could just ask a question of what to do and where you go and how to do things.
00:50:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like that's Delphi, right? bot is as smart as you make it. So we just Delphi, is this company that a buddy of mine's been consulting for. I've sort of been consulting for them, I'm supposed to run their ads in 2025. But their whole thing is that they create they call them clones, but you can feed all kinds of different information and then it's as smart as like how you construct the knowledge base, and it's also going out to open AI, I believe, or some, some AI, but we did it for the one section of the exam, and it's insane how good it is, how well it knows the stuff, but it should, because that's what we gave it, right? So it's like, we gave it our content and our content, the answers are in our content, therefore it can give the answers. So, like for the music project that I'm working on with these guys, we're writing this book, book keeps getting longer and longer and longer, but the book's packed full of , well, if you need to know how to release a song, we're just going to make the A&R bot and go, you have any questions about how to use software, how to promote yourself, just ask the A&R bot, and it's going to give answers from the data set that we gave it, and the answer was will be great. So it's like, is there stuff? I don't know. That's a thing. Then the lawyers could know or should know. But rather than go to a book or whatever they can hit this thing and then go, Oh, , there I didn't think about that. I mean, I'm amazed that some of the kicks out and I go, Oh, I didn't think of that. Yeah. Then I take it and go, Oh, wait, I can do this.
00:52:32 - mark sweet
Just a random thought.
00:52:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Spoke it in.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I rather than thoughts do some good things.
00:52:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I just can't.
00:52:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just can't. Does anybody want to make theory?
00:52:49 - mark sweet
I'd use it. don't know what it is, but no.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, Howard invented a robot and that robot was used for something. Let's see. Okay. Any updates on vendors?
00:54:11 - mark sweet
It's a random one the other day, and I'm trying to figure out how they got in contact with us. Like they try to send us a slip and fall. It's very odd. I don't know if it's like some weird hook or what it is. So I'm trying to dig into that. But no, I've moved the Tom and Mike stuff to January because they want 22 grand for filming, but I wasn't grand for filming. But I still think it's worth it to give it a try. But until prior to the later half of January, Lorenz and Hank are actually really excited for it. Hank's like, I didn't want to tell you this, like I secretly always want to be a lawyer on TV. one of those.
00:54:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it for you.
00:54:55 - mark sweet
Kind of. So if that works, we can roll it out to other states, but Arizona just makes the most sense. Because one, I want them to feel like there's buy-in. Two, these clients basically want to meet Laura this on to be far more often than anything else.
00:55:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think we'll be fine. I haven't met Hank and don't know anything about him, but Laurenta is a great energy, so that should actually be good for you.
00:55:18 - mark sweet
He looks younger. mean, he is young, but he looks younger. See, I think looks older because he's 40 and I thought he was closer to my age. No, no, Hank, When everyone's looks older. Yeah, having that many kids will do that to you.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Stop. I have four kids.
00:55:35 - mark sweet
Yeah, well.
00:55:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Shut up. Don't say another word. Just don't.
00:55:40 - mark sweet
still like Tina. Tina. Bye.
00:55:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Bye, B.
00:55:44 - mark sweet
Also, I think just tall people age faster.
00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just tall people?
00:55:50 - mark sweet
Tall people. He's like six, five, six, That's a tall mother of her. And Carrie's six, one.
00:56:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the creative for these commercials.
00:56:06 - mark sweet
They mostly do infomercials and buy up remnants. So they're just running all night.
00:56:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What's the commercial?
00:56:14 - mark sweet
Like infomercial style, where they like ask them some questions, these people, they got phone banks, like answering phone calls, like, Hey, if you've been injured or blah, blah, blah, like call, I'm going to freak out this issue.
00:56:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And this is based on them saying this works.
00:56:28 - mark sweet
It's apparently works on the country. Okay. And it's been around for 15 years, which the legal world is forever. Right. So you don't?
00:56:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We're going to run it your way and we're going to do it out. Yeah.
00:56:43 - mark sweet
In the last case, we're on the creatives.
00:56:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:47 - mark sweet
So we can always cut it up, use it somewhere else, put it through YouTube, put it through some else's professional. So maybe if we were to do it on our own, it would be like 12, maybe 14, know, with all the actors and everything else and whatever. Yeah, we're paying a little bit of a premium, but if it's done and they have a way to make it better, fine. If it doesn't in the worst case, we just have more content than we can use for number of years.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that investment is worth the content anyway.
00:57:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I've never heard a lawyer, well, there's Hulu, which I brought up before, never single lawyer out on Hulu. And then the other day, was like, podcasts, right? So you can add on, what is the network, the iHeart? Yes.
00:57:33 - mark sweet
iHeart.
00:57:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like, I'll bet those are cheap as . And they've got to be targeted.
00:57:39 - mark sweet
They must be really, they're geo targeted for sure, but they're easy to skip, really easy to skip.
00:57:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, Well, so let's say that they're running it on network TV in retirement homes and home hospitals.
00:57:56 - mark sweet
a lot of hospitals. And they're gonna
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They tell the people that are they just have it on because there's older people and I think I think that there's enough awareness grandparents, you know, passing on. Oh, I just saw whatever. I imagine that there's enough eyeballs on it that matter that for that investment in the return on it. It's probably worth it. Even if it's just a very small group because it is geotargeted and you've got people who are just doing, you know, nothing and they're just consuming whatever on TV.
00:58:41 - mark sweet
Yeah, look, it's you were just trying to find these people at their time of need. It's never like I got this and turning my back pocket on a thing just in case it's always, yeah, you need this. So it's just it's literally, I don't know an attorney, which whatever and I need it right now. The person popped up. They're on TV. They must be good if they're on TV. There's a lot of logic that goes that way.
00:59:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Okay. Oh, Dan has a call in one minute. Well, Dan and I have a call in one minute, but I'm probably figure out a touch spot.
00:59:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, that calls canceled.
00:59:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay, good.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You just found out I'm a different one minute, but I got to go.
00:59:25 - mark sweet
Okay. Okay. Bye, Dan.
00:59:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I robbed it.
00:59:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for a Fuji call and go say hello to my child.
00:59:35 - mark sweet
you want to pitch touch bots a Fuji?
00:59:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause I think he'll be in. I don't know what to call a touch bot.
00:59:42 - mark sweet
Okay. I'm going to slow. I'm going to say no, going to ask you about touch bots.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause Toronto for sure needs this nurture bot. Mark, I think that you need to do like a focus group kind of poll on the name.
00:59:59 - mark sweet
Nope.

That is a bad business practice to do something just because you like it.
01:00:07 - mark sweet
It's got to be this far.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Damn it. Oh my God.
01:00:13 - mark sweet
He's stuck in your head.
01:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:00:15 - mark sweet
Did you pick a name for the puppy yet?
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His name Okay. Are you sure? Yes.
01:00:22 - mark sweet
Okay.
01:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I could see the dog to like totally make sure that you want that. Nope.
01:00:27 - mark sweet
Nope.
01:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. I have better intuition than that. Like it matches and he has a matching collar and leaves. Oh, Ty. I know. already have it.
01:00:37 - mark sweet
Oh, by the way, they have insane and I have cute stuff for dogs in Japan. It's ridiculous. So I'm trying to get a kimono for Ronan, but like I'm trying to figure out how big of a size he would need.
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he's like a five year old child size. Get your mom to give it his measurements.
01:00:52 - mark sweet
Get it right. Oh, also we're just fairly determined that he's a Victorian child.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just stuck in a dog costume. he has human eyes so yeah he's the best okay well when your mom send you pictures send them to me okay yay please thank you i will return with puppy pictures i cannot wait puppies are so cute because they're trouble but they're super cute so i'm so excited okay i will talk to you soon wait did you want to tell me the sweet james meeting or no yes okay good okay you're up to do that that was that's a huge huge deal and a huge catalyst for her moving forward because that will help her get the resources she needs to get she needs to get done and she was really good about it but i gave her a good step talk and i think that she's okay now it'll be fine it'll be good but this way she'll get the resource she needs to get where she needs to get to so very excited for that yeah and we did some math too so um how do you get to where you get because that was how we i helped her not be stressed out so we did the math of like what you actually needs to have. And she's like, worst case scenario, you know, I don't do the clinic in the hospital. But I think we actually figured out something where she could potentially do that. So, but I told you the biggest thing is don't worry about that because you're not going to get there overnight. You'll ease into it. And we're going to be strategizing the whole way through.
01:02:24 - mark sweet
So don't worry about it.
01:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I know that when she worries about it, then she checks out. And so I'm going to let her do that.
01:02:32 - mark sweet
But one of the really, really good things is one of teams that they're giving her to work with versus dreams is their commercial team, which means it's a case that's worth at least 250 ground, which means every single person's getting an injection and more than likely they're getting a surgery. Those are high ticket value items for her.
01:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that was part of our conversation too, is because when we did math, it wasn't taking in those potential numbers and things. And when we did that, I'm like, you're, it's going to be half what you think it is, ultimately, just to get to a million. And what you can decide is, is it really a million? Do you want it to be more?
01:03:09 - mark sweet
Do you want it to be less?
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, don't be rigid about the number, be rigid about just showing up and doing the best work that you can and be okay with adjusting the goals or the pace of it as, as you get there. But I told her, I said, you 100% can do this. You're surrounded by, you know, smart people, innovative people. She is innovative and strategic. so as long as she doesn't psych herself out, it's going to be fine. But I won't let her psych herself out.
01:03:44 - mark sweet
Good. But yeah, no, super excited for that.
01:03:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but Wednesday is what I'm getting. So she and I are supposed to have a meeting on Wednesday, but I told her, I don't know when I was getting Hudson and it's going to be in the way.
01:03:56 - mark sweet
So we're going to have to understand who is under your schedule. Because ao can her book.
01:04:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what she told me, but I just want to make sure I did message her, but I forgot that you guys would be there already. So it's okay.
01:04:10 - mark sweet
Later, the evenings are just going to be better, like evening your time. Okay, because that's like still morning here, but not how they am morning.
01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we'll figure out something for this week and for next week, she and I already decided we're just going to do like audio messages back and forth.
01:04:27 - mark sweet
Perfect. Yeah, with Christmas and everything that since then we're back on the 28th, so we'll be fine.
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep, yep, we worked that out.
01:04:34 - mark sweet
Okay, let's say that.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I thought you say we're going have a good day.
01:04:41 - mark sweet
Oh, we're gonna, it's gonna be great. You could send me pictures. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye.
