00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Esther: Oops! Can you hear me or see me.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Tina Marie: I can. How are you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Esther: Okay. Good. How are you?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Tina Marie: Good good morning, Esther.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Esther: Good morning, Tina. Thank you so much for moving. This meeting worked out perfectly. And I just spilled a bunch of water on my desk.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Esther: One second. Let me get a towel to wipe this up. Yikes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Esther: Okay. Oh!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Esther: I'll be right back.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Esther: Oh, let's see! What this is, what.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Esther: Okay, going on here. Just go to some newspapers.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Esther: How is your morning? Otherwise.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tina Marie: It is quiet. I woke up.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Esther: 4 days.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: So groggy, but I actually really slept good. And so I've just had kind of a.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Esther: Good.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Tina Marie: Contemplative morning, which is how I like my mornings. I feel like I've got the best. Days when my morning starts slow and just.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Tina Marie: Meditative. As I go through my preparation. And then it picks up energy throughout the day until about 11 Pm.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Esther: Did it take you a while or some time to kind of figure out. That's how you want to work. Or.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Well, 1st of all, it took me the freedom to even have the access and the opportunity to. Let it even happen.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Tina Marie: Because you know, as a student. I went to school. By the time I got to high school I was going to school from 7 to 7.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Tina Marie: Because I had all the extracurricular activities and sports and leadership.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Esther: Yes, I hear you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Tina Marie: And then. You know college. I ended up. I was working full time, so I dropped out of school. I was taking 17 credits because I loved school.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I love school.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Esther: 18.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Tina Marie: I overdid it. And then I just um basically sabotaged myself. And then. Life hit hard, and I just tried to dig myself out of the financial pit. I got into.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tina Marie: But then it took around. I mean honestly, it's been the last.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: A 9. Maybe 9, 10 years that I've even been able to do this.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Tina Marie: Because I had children. Children aren't compatible with that type of schedule. They're like, let's go 1st thing in the morning, smashed in the face with a zippy cup or something like that, you know.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Esther: It's. Yeah, you kind of um.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Esther: It forces you. If you're not a morning person you will be, you will be forced to become. I mean, you'll be forced to have the schedule of a morning person. That doesn't mean you're still, that still doesn't mean you're morning person. Yeah.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Tina Marie: I have always known, though, that I have more energy. Um! Um, it's it's kind of different. So, sun energy. I want to use my body more.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Tina Marie: Um and moon energy. I want to use my brain more.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tina Marie: My brain is activated. So. When the sun is out I get annoyed if I have to sit still.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tina Marie: So working sometimes isn't really compatible with that. But what I do is I take my meetings.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Tina Marie: In that kind of dip period. So it's not 1st thing in the morning.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. And it's not.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Tina Marie: You know, later in the afternoon. So between 10 and 2. My brain is good, my body can deal with like I don't get to move, and then I go do like housework or something physical, and then I come back to like.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Tina Marie: Focus brain work. At night.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Tina Marie: So I did know that I've kind of always known that, but being able to have the routine that allows it. Is nice, though I wouldn't change the.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: Kids and the baby. But I also can be a morning person. Um! I have to, but I but I but the thing is I can't go to sleep. If the sun's up.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Tina Marie: Very well, you know, with blackout curtains like.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Tina Marie: The energy too much. So, yeah.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I know that's a long answer. It's because there's. Kind of nuance to it, because then it's also a value.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Tina Marie: Right. Yes, I might.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Tina Marie: Operate on a physical level, that well. That way.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Tina Marie: But when my environment is a particular way. I operate best when I'm in sync with my environment. So.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Tina Marie: My environment right now is, I've got a teenage daughter.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Tina Marie: Up late at night. She doesn't sleep very well. She sleeps in during the day, and so matching my rhythm with hers means I'm not getting interrupted when she.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: When I want to go to bed at like, let's say 9 o'clock, and at. Midnight. She's like I can't sleep. Can we talk.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Tina Marie: You know so. I've I have shifts, and most of them tend to be around my children when they're grown up. I'll probably go to bed earlier and get up earlier, and feel just as content.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Tina Marie: Work. Mostly as well, so.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Esther: It's interesting, cause I I'm always curious how people. Kind of trial and error and kind of figure out well what.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Esther: And you know, and it's like you said it might be a while before you figure out what actually works best for you, because you don't have. The opportunity to explore, especially when you have children right.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Esther: Um. It's like they're they're gonna dictate most of the schedule either way, anyway. So it's not like you have a lot of um room to figure out.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Esther: Um what it is. Yeah. So I mean, I know that Fuji and I, we to some extent we just. At least for me.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Esther: I operate so much better at night. And.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Esther: You know there, there could be a number of reasons why. Um, anyway.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Was it always that way?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Esther: I feel I mean. I've always we've always gone to sleep late. It was always surprised me when I was younger that I had classmates going to sleep at.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Esther: 8 pm. And I was like what I didn't understand that. You know, and.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Tina Marie: I. I have a hypothesis for that, a theory, I guess.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Tina Marie: A huge part of it. My sister and I talk about this is probably because that's your free time, and you need free time, so much so as a child. Your schedule was dictated. Probably all the way up until time.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Tina Marie: So your body and your brain would be like. Nobody's telling me what to do right now. I will do whatever I want.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Tina Marie: And so you got to think about what you wanted to think about, and kind of be what you wanted to be in your own space, I would imagine late at night you could be in your room. You weren't. You know your your energy could be your own.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: As a mom. A lot of times. That's the only time when the kids are down. It's like we can release.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Tina Marie: I can still with a teenager. I don't unwind until she has been asleep and a quiet for a while, but I know she's not coming.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Tina Marie: And it's not that I don't want to have that time. It's just. I know my time is not mine.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tina Marie: It. It can be interrupted with somebody else's words. Thoughts, motivation, whatever.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Tina Marie: And nighttime is the only time, like when everybody else has gone to bed, and I've outstayed them. That I know it's mine. Does that make sense.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Esther: Yeah, it does. And I kind of you know it was until I became a parent myself that I kind of understood, maybe why some of my classmates in friends that I knew went to sleep so early, because one, either they were. Sleep trained that way. Uh you know they're sleep trained. Um.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Esther: You know, to have a full 12 h of sleep, and also the, you know. With that, you know. Their parents also caught that chunk of time at night. Um. My family knew nothing about sleep training. Um didn't bother, and I was always up till about.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Esther: 10. And just exhausted as a kid cause. I'd have to get up at 7.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Esther: You know, for for school, and they would just be yanking me out of bed anyway. So. I think all that to say is that there, you know um.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Esther: I had been kind of digging into, and uh I wrote some stuff, but I forgot to tell you that I was working on it last night, so we'll just talk about it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Tina Marie: I know I was looking for it. I was like no, she definitely didn't add anything for me.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Esther: No, I didn't. I? I didn't start adding stuff until about 1130 Pm.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Tina Marie: Well, it doesn't help that. I didn't give you notes. So I wanna remember to do that right after this. But I'm building an automation to help me with that. But basically, soon as we get off the call, I start thinking about it, anyway. Sorry.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Esther: Yes. Yeah, no, no worries. I mean, we were so busy last week, and this weekend, anyway, that I literally didn't have time.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Esther: I wouldn't have had time, anyway. Um. But I did have an opportunity. Um!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Esther: You know, to um kind of just start digging in a little bit after you know the day after. Well, okay, more, a little bit more last night, and I realized that you know that fight that I had my parents the other night. I actually don't know which day it happened. Maybe it was before. I.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Esther: Synced with you. So I did tell you about it. You know it did set me on edge for a few days. My energy was just a little bit off. At certain times. Um, you know.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Esther: And um. Yeah. And so it did. You know it? It's kind of like, you know, after all these years.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Esther: I can't help the reaction I have. Sometimes I mean, it's really tampered down. So I'm not like freaking out and having Ptsd, but you know it still does set me on edge a little bit, even though I'm physically away from them. I'm physically away from the situation. I know that no one can like hit me or anything like that. But as children. You know, you probably just.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Esther: That that kind of thing probably just never goes away, you know.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Tina Marie: It can.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Tina Marie: But only with a lot a lot of work.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Esther: Yeah, I think, though, that um. You know. Um, it's I've worked through so much of it, though in the last.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Esther: Like. Like 1015 years. I think that you know I'm you know it's it doesn't bother me from day to day. And also I'm not one of I.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Esther: You know I've been through depression, and I'm not, you know, and I I luckily I'm not one of those people that has just. Depression, like low level of depression, that just kind of underpins.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Esther: Daily life.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Esther: Um. The kind of depression that I went through was more like acute, just like specific events.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Esther: Would really throw me for a loop. For like several weeks or something, and then I once I some worked my way out of it, or created distance from it and stuff. Then, you know, I'd slowly like Bounce back.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Esther: Um. So. But anyway, long story short, it's kind of gotten to me wondering if I possibly have some form of Adhd.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Esther: I think that you had mentioned. I could have sworn I vaguely remember you mentioning it, or maybe it wasn't you.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Tina Marie: It was me.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Esther: During one of our very 1st calls. Because you said that some of the things that I was expressing sounded like symptoms, or you know things that sound like they might be Adhd. And then I had another friend, actually Michael's cousin, who, when I was talking to you, know.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Esther: A couple of months ago. She's like, Oh, have you looked into Adhd? She's like cause I have it, and I was like, Hmm! Let's put a PIN in this, and I'll come back to it later. And then. So I really started thinking about it a little bit more last week.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Esther: Somehow, after our conversation. So um. I made an appointment to see the PA right away last Friday. Um, got a referral. So this week I'm going to be looking into just psychiatrists who are covered by our insurance.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Esther: Um just to see what's going on. Am I borderline.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Esther: You know? Yeah.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tina Marie: Well, something to keep in mind is that highly intelligent women mask. Very strongly.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Tina Marie: Very very strongly. And so most of the reasons why Adhd has gone undiagnosed in women is because it shows up differently.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Tina Marie: Um. Partially because our brains are different. So so it shows up differently. Period.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Tina Marie: But. It also shows it differently, because we're masking all the time. And so you have to be conscious of.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Tina Marie: What? Your natural tendency is, but also the fact that it doesn't get to present itself.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Tina Marie: So presenting as in terms of like a symptom. Right. That's how we. Describe a symptom that it presents itself.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Tina Marie: The rustle is really what presents itself because everything else. So, for example. Stimming.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Tina Marie: Um. Do you know what that is?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Esther: No. Can you say that again.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Tina Marie: Stimming.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Esther: Stimming. Okay, let me turn it up. Why did I turn my speaker a little bit stimming? Okay.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Esther: No, I don't. But does it come from.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tina Marie: This is uh. This is, uh always have to be moving, always making a sound always. Something like that some kind of like. If you catch yourself just.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Tina Marie: Making a sound on repeat, especially when you're quiet and by yourself. Um, or, you know, just a constant move or wiggle, or a thing that you do.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Esther: Mhm, Mhm.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Tina Marie: If you have a hard time sitting completely still or standing completely still, something like you must be thinking about something. You must be moving. Engaging.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Tina Marie: Um that stimulation.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Esther: Yeah, I, okay, that's where it comes from. Yeah.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Tina Marie: So. Stimulation, so.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Tina Marie: But but it is not a blanket statement, so if something is fully engaging your mind. You're fully stimulated, so you can be still so you can be quiet.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tina Marie: So it's not attention. Deficit. It's that you have a lot of attention to give to a lot of things.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Tina Marie: So. With a lot of things like if you study psychology and you look at the Dsm like, and if you just know medicine.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Tina Marie: We name things according to our understanding.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Tina Marie: We also know that most of the studies are done on men. Because they're cheaper.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Tina Marie: Um, they're less complicated. That's why they're cheaper, right? They're less complicated. You don't have to go through all their cycles and all the other things that women have to go through right. Men are more the same throughout life. It's not to say they're not.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Tina Marie: Complex, and have cycles also, but not on the same level as women. They also don't face the same kind of barriers as women do. If you get to people of color now, you have a little bit more nuance right? But generally it's white men in the studies, and so that creates a huge limitation on it.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Tina Marie: And they're the ones creating the naming structures and naming things like. Like hysterica, hysteria.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Tina Marie: And women being hysterical. Guess what? You're an asshole. That's why I act this way. I'm not. You know what I mean, but there's no outlet.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Esther: What?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Tina Marie: So it's really important, too, to consider medicine and what it is. And it's and and that it's kind of like Western medicine. Specifically, a good old boys. Kind of thing.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Tina Marie: Now, traditional Eastern medicine is a whole different thing, like there's real wisdom. It came from men and women. It may have even come more from women than men.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Esther: Oh, absolutely, I agree.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Tina Marie: And you know so what a here come the emotions! It's just. Anyway, people need people. We need all the cultures we need all those.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Esther: Oh, absolutely. I mean, one very obvious example is just. Um. The lack of postpartum care in this country.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Esther: I mean every other country like except us, and maybe 2 other countries. They just found paid family leave or.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, bye. Good luck!

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Esther: You're welcome. You know, and um, and the more I learned, you know, I was really sheltered as a kid. So you know, we always talked about um like in in Chinese culture, we have a 30 day sitting period or a 30 day confinement period for new mothers, and I used to just scoff at that, you know, because I grew up in a Western.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tina Marie: So much wisdom in that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Esther: Needed. Huh!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Tina Marie: So much wisdom in that.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Esther: There is, and then it wasn't until I became a mother, and I started. Seeing that. No, it's not my mom's.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Esther: My parents like backward culture or anything. There's so many. Virtually every single culture like has something like that, like Indian culture, Latina culture. Um, you know they have something, some some type of a confinement or recovery period for women, and you know. But obviously I thought, like my mom. Oh, they're just being judgy again. And yes, they are being Judgy, you know one of.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Esther: My cousins who she's from Laos, and she went out, like, you know, on week 2 to get some fresh air walk the dog, and, oh, my God! The comments I heard from my moms and my aunties. You know, for me I was, and then I was like, Oh, no, they're just being like.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Esther: And bigoted bitches again, like blah blah. But you know, on on the flip side. Yes, you need to let your body recover.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Esther: But recovery looks different.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Tina Marie: But we all covered different paces.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Esther: Everyone recovers differently, and you know, maybe she felt like if she needed some fresh air. It's like, Oh, my God! She, you know, cause they were like. Oh, you can't have any breeze blowing on you, and. It's crazy like, if you get really into some of these, it's it's nuts. You're not supposed.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Esther: To all my cousins, the ones who are like super traditional. They did not wash their hair for 30 days.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Esther: They did not eat salt. For 40 days.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Esther: And I, my mom and I had so many fights. About that, and I took a shower at the hospital because I didn't want her to know that I took a shower.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Esther: Right. This is not. Kind of stuff.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Esther: But anyway, that's just another thing to say that. Um, you know, there's a lot of disagreements. There's a lot of. You know, whatever it is, but I do agree that um.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Esther: You know, when it comes to Western medicine, particularly. They're just.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Esther: Yeah, like. You know. Uh, women are just not represented enough. I agree.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Tina Marie: There are 2 things I want to bring up, because it made me think of um. So I want to make sure we get back to the Adhd thing specifically.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Esther: Huh!

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Tina Marie: Um, but also in terms of. The that culture. And and it happens in religion, too, and just.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Tina Marie: People in general. There is the difference between, and and I'll use religion, but but but it changes, but but it has so much application, so letter of the law versus spirit of the law, right.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Tina Marie: Whether the law is government, whether the law is cultural or medicine, or whatever. People tend to get bogged down by the letter.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: Missing the intent. So the intent and the spirit of that 30 days is, give Mom a break to recover.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Tina Marie: So that she is well, so that she can be the best version of herself.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Tina Marie: So it isn't that you give. Homage. Basically, to that 30 days you give homage to the mother.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tina Marie: Whatever the mother needs. If the mother spirit says I need sunshine, I need fresh water. I need salt, because my electrolytes are low. Then that 30 day period is for her to get what her spirit tells her to do right. That would be.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Tina Marie: The spirit of the law.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Esther: Yeah, sure, absolutely. I agree with that. Like.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Tina Marie: And. And we find that it shows up. So just thinking about.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Tina Marie: It's um. I like to run things through that. So maybe just looking at things in life and find where you find people. Um kind of slaves to the law, whatever the law is, right.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Tina Marie: Whatever their their thing is that they're attached to. And one thing that you can do for yourself and for other people is, ask the question. Are you more concerned with the rule.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Tina Marie: Or the reason. The rule existed.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Esther: Is this right? The reason behind the rule, like, are we missing the point here?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Tina Marie: That's the freedom question is. And it's also because, Esther, most people don't ask themselves those questions. So most people are on autopilot.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Tina Marie: They do what they do because they do what they do, because they do what they do.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: They cut the ends off the ham every year for Thanksgiving, not knowing that the reason the tradition existed is because Grandma great, great, great grandma's pan was too small for a whole ham. Not because that's just how you cook a ham. Do you know that story? You know what I'm talking about?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Esther: No, I had no idea.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So there's a story. And it's a 3 generation family gathering. And they're they're cooking the ham, and they're um getting it ready for thanksgiving. And so the mom is teaching the daughter. This is what we do. We cut off the ends of.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Esther: Wow! And she's like, why.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Tina Marie: But in there exactly, she says, why she goes. We bought. We just that's just how we do it. And the daughter's like. Why so? She asked Grandma. She goes well, because when my mom cooked the ham, the pan was too small, and so you had to cut off the end so that it would fit in there. There was no reason to throw all that bean away. There's no reason to cook it that way, except for the limitations that existed at the time.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Tina Marie: Um prevented you to be able to have the whole ham. That limitation doesn't exist anymore.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Esther: Hmm. Mhm.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Tina Marie: And so a lot of traditions are, because that was what we dealt with at the time. Those were the resources we had. That doesn't apply anymore. And people aren't.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Tina Marie: Even considering they're not asking the questions. They don't know their history, you know this. You don't care about their history. They don't care about their origins, they don't care about their heritage. They don't want to know. Why do we do what we do? They don't want to think they want to be entertained. They want to be fed. They want to be.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Esther: Yeah. I absolutely can.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Esther: They wanna be told what to think. It's easier.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Esther: You know, and I and you know just one last funny comment on that. Because I I thought about this a lot when I was going through postpartum and stuff.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Esther: Especially my mom and I were fighting about the not showering or washing your hair for 30 days.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Tina Marie: I would just.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Esther: Not, you know, bathing right. And um.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Esther: And I was, and I was like, you know, and I tried to do some research on it. You know my best, and I said my best conclusion. Is that? Yes, after such a.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Esther: Traumatic events, such as birth, where you know you have. You might have vaginal tears, or you have whatever it is. Your body is literally being split open.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Esther: I wonder if a lot of that tradition came from the fact that there was no access to clean water. There's no access to clean water, you know it's you're prone for bacterial infection. If you do wash.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Tina Marie: That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Esther: Something that's an open cut, or whatever it is.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Esther: Maybe that's where the tradition came from that you don't wash your hair. You don't shower because there was no access to clean water like that is the best scientific answer that I can come up with.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Tina Marie: Now.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Esther: Um, and I was like, but that, like you said that limitation no longer exists. You know. So it's you know, it's interesting. But they're they're just real sticklers about, you know, keeping that.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Esther: So yeah, I mean, anyway. Sorry. Back to the Adhd.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So the thing is.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Esther: Um.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Tina Marie: And I feel like you. You could be prone to this.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Tina Marie: Um, because I think that you've done this to yourself, and it's labels. So most people want a label to define themselves so that they but then they excuse it. Now I know that that's not you, but but also the labels can make us feel limited.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Esther: Huh!

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Tina Marie: Right. I also don't think that that's you, but I do think we have to consciously guard ourselves against it.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Tina Marie: So. And we also have to be aware that a whole lot of, because if you start following any topic on social media, you'll get all kinds of people explain all kinds of things to you, right? And so you really just kind of have to trust your gut and be like, yes, this is me that's not me.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Esther: Oh, absolutely!

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Tina Marie: What difference does it make? You know? What do I learn from this. So.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Tina Marie: Basically just. The the whole point is, how do you understand yourself better.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tina Marie: And what you need, and how you present. And like, for example, I am a high, masking person. I am not myself all the time around most people.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Tina Marie: Um. I do make weird noises. I do need to be fully engaged and simulated at all times, and. Um.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Tina Marie: And for me. The thing that I got to learn is that it makes sense that. If I'm deeply engrossed in something mentally, why, I might feel physically calm, and I can be still.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Tina Marie: And other times when I can't, because, you know, if somebody wants to watch something stupid on TV, and I'm there with them like I am. I'm uncomfortable because my brain 1st of all, I see the punchline coming a mile away.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Tina Marie: I'm literally in the audience at the movie theaters, laughing before they've even finished the sentence, because I can see where they're going, and I see the humor in it before they finish the sentence, and I laugh loud. My daughter loves to make a crack because she's like if I go out and go to the bathroom. I can tell exactly where you're sitting, or if I'm with my sister because we're the loudest laughers in the bunch. Um.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Esther: I love that actually, I mean.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Tina Marie: So I can't watch the office. It is so dry it is so like it's just cringy and painful for me. But like I see it all about the way I'm like, how like this is not stimulating to me. So I get anxiety in my body because I'm like it is stupid. I feel myself losing IQ points.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Esther: Okay.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Tina Marie: Watch you meant.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Esther: That's hilarious, you know. People I talk to either love the office or they hate it.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: Polarizing things, though I will say I'm a polarizing person. I do love polarizing things. It's I mean, I'd rather you be this or that.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Esther: Look, you enjoy what you enjoy, and and humor is so.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Esther: Personal, to how people enjoy things.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Tina Marie: You need. Mhm.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Esther: Like um. I enjoy very dark crass humor, Michael, doesn't. I enjoy really dry humor like the office. Pleasant.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Esther: You know me and his friend. Thought Archer was one of the funniest things we'd ever seen. Michael's like, this is stupid. I'm like, Okay, that's fine.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Esther: But.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Esther: Anyway.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Tina Marie: But thank goodness for all of us, because the thing that I have learned Esther, is, we literally need all the types.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Esther: Oh! Yes, that diversity is so important that diversity and I love.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Esther: Seeing that. And I it's fine. I don't need to. We don't need to all enjoy the same things. That's kind of, you know. That's the I think that's the beauty of.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Tina Marie: The work in the world would not get done if we all wanted the same things.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Esther: Exactly.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Tina Marie: So like, where would business owners be if there weren't people who were pacified. Just watching TV, showing up to work, getting their paycheck and going home.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: The world would not exist without the operators.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Esther: The world would not exist the way that we know it. And we've found everyone has kind of found their kind of role in it, and where they fit in society. Um!

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Esther: You know, it's yeah. You have content creators and you have consumers. I don't create content. I have no interest in creating content. I don't post on social media. I. Like. I don't even take. I don't even.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Esther: Like. I don't take pictures or post anything, and, like my friends, take pictures, they'll post something I was like. Oh, I have this running joke between in our group. Oh, oh, we'll just wait for Carmen to post, and then, like we'll just. You know, repost what she posts.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Tina Marie: Right? Share? It. Yeah.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Esther: Share it, you know.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Tina Marie: That's the thing, though I noticed that. And apply it to where you want to spend your time. And what are your goals.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: You were saying. You don't even know if you know. How to want.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Tina Marie: Part of it is just going to be. Start with wanting to be. Okay, being you wherever you are.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: So that means filtering out the things, the places, the people, that you cannot be yourself.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Tina Marie: Now. We all need to show up to some places where we kind of have to mask right.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Tina Marie: There that, and and that. And I'm thankful for Eastern culture and other cultures like that.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Tina Marie: Um, where we understand it cannot be about us all the time, and our comfort and our happiness all the time. We are part of a collective. We all need each other. We have a duty, I feel, and a responsibility to participate in that.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Tina Marie: But in that we can still call people up to. Um better behavior.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: Better Rulemaking better Governing.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Esther: I'm good.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Tina Marie: Better, everything. Right. What I don't think we ought to do all the time is cut everything off that we don't like. I think.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Tina Marie: That it's important to kind of. Keep the tethers.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Tina Marie: But. Control the tethers.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Tina Marie: Meaning that, and that they don't control you so. Um. A lot of the world's response now is just cut yourself off from everything. And that that's okay.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Tina Marie: I don't think that that is good for us. I think we grow from all of that opposition. I think, where much is given, much is required.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Tina Marie: And. When we know better.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: I I have come to feel like I was born into my family that. Is so messed up in so many ways.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Tina Marie: So that I could learn how to heal so that I could try to teach healing. But I had to be wholly healed.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Tina Marie: And fortified.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Tina Marie: Before I went, and do that. So.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Tina Marie: I'm not fully there yet. I still have a child to take care of. She gets. My everything.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Tina Marie: I have. I have 4 children. I only have 2 that actually really want to need any help. The other 2 are married. They have their lives. They're established. They have very supportive spouses. Bless you.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Esther: They have. What sorry I missed that I've.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tina Marie: Very supportive spouses. Um.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Esther: Okay. Good for them.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes, um, not abusive. One of my main goals was break the cycle of abuse that's gone on for generations in my family. And so I feel like that has happened.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Tina Marie: But.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Esther: Congratulations.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Tina Marie: Things. It's life is so complicated.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Esther: But it's also a continuous work in progress, right?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Tina Marie: Yes, right? So so it never stops so. But, like my mom, is very lonely. And most of that is her own doing.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Esther: Good.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Tina Marie: Um. She's very judgmental. She cuts people off, you know. She abused me. My sister can't even comprehend the things she did to me.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Tina Marie: I love her, I want her happiness. I will take care of her like I promised her when I was little, but not right now right now my priority is. Growing, this child.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Tina Marie: That I took. Stewardship over when she was born to me.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tina Marie: That that's my priority. And so. I don't completely ignore my mom, but I barely talk to her. I do let her know every now and then, just you know I love you, I think about you, I pray for you. Um!

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Tina Marie: I hope that you're well. Um, you know, like I just. I'm really focused on this thing in my life.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Tina Marie: And my mom has finally stopped, you know, trying to give me that manipulative. Well, you must not, whatever. It's just some kind of passive, aggressive jab. She still does it to my brother and my sister. She has learned not to do it to me. She hasn't done it to me for a few years, because I would just not talk to her for months on end.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Esther: Set, your boundary.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but I've been setting that boundary for 15 years before she finally learned. I give 0 inches.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Tina Marie: 0. That is the thing that I learned in counseling with my children is that.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Tina Marie: You have to have some boundaries that are automatic. You don't get warnings for certain things.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Tina Marie: There are. Consequences immediately for certain things.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Tina Marie: So I had to decide what they were. If you.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Tina Marie: Insult me intentionally or intentionally. Try to harm me. It's pretty obvious when people do that.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Tina Marie: Like. If you know you say something. To wound me.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Tina Marie: I'm not going to talk to you for a while. I'm going to tell you right then and there. That's unacceptable.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Tina Marie: Um, I will point out what it is, so that there's no confusion, and and wondering what just happened. You just said this to me. This was inappropriate. For this reason.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Tina Marie: I'm not going to ask you how you feel about it. I'm not going to explain anymore. I'm not going to talk to you for a while.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Tina Marie: You can decide. If you want to improve that behavior, or you can accept the fact that I'm not talking to you for a while.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Tina Marie: But that's the end of the discussion. We're not talking anymore. Period.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Tina Marie: Now with children, the non-negotiables were, you don't hit. You don't call a person a name or scream at them. Those are automatic. You get your favorite thing taken away from you for the rest of the day only for the rest of the day, not grounded for multiple days, because there's no motivation to be good that day. If.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: They're still dealing with the punishment from the they need a reset.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Tina Marie: So. But anything else they got accounting because they needed time to be able to, and a space to be able to make a decision and to feel like they had space.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Tina Marie: To make a decision. Do I want to get in trouble? Do I really want to do this behavior? Because sometimes Esther. They really just wanted to act out, and they needed to express themselves. And so they took the consequence.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Tina Marie: Knowing that that was going to happen. But that allowed them to have some choice over themselves.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Tina Marie: So anyway, that was a whole like. Another tangent, but learning how to get rid of the.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Tina Marie: The power struggle in my life. Where? Because the finite willpower right wherever there's a power struggle, I don't have a lot more willpower after that. If I had a spiritual.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Tina Marie: Power struggle with another person where my heart was involved. Because they had the power to wound my heart.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Tina Marie: I'm done for hours. You were done for days, some of those I'm done for days like I am.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Tina Marie: Hurting. For days I am draining bleeding energy. For days because of that interaction.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Tina Marie: That's unacceptable to me.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Tina Marie: So it has to be something that I have a process of dealing with. It doesn't mean that I'm still not going to have those things, and they're still not going to drain me for days. But what it does mean is, I'll have less of them.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Tina Marie: And. I'll have peace, knowing that I've set that boundary. So if it happens again because I've I've said you can't speak to me this way this way or this way, and they chose to do it. Anyway, I'm not going to feel guilty about removing myself.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Tina Marie: Because I was clear about my expectations. And they made their choice.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Esther: No, it's very interesting that a lot of um. You know a lot of my.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Esther: Um hesitation to, or a lot of my like high tolerance came from. You know it was.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Esther: Kind of complicated right? My mom doesn't believe in divorce. She, you know, believes God hates divorce. Like point blank. No argument brokered that kind of thing like.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Esther: Even though it's like um. The stuff he did. He!

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Esther: This man should not.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Tina Marie: Does God not hate? When a man abuses his child.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Esther: Anywhere, around that. It wasn't. What is Tatino?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Esther: So it was always one of those things where, you know I even though I moved out of the house. I was afraid of cutting him off, pissing him off because I didn't want him to hurt anyone else that was still in the house.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Esther: So that's why I still put up with him for so long, you know, during those times I mean um.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Mm.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Esther: You know, for all intents and purposes. Now, though I mean whatever maybe he's mellowed out. But. You know now I.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Esther: I can't. I just realized I don't have. The energy. Nor is it my responsibility to feel responsible for that.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Esther: You know. So you know, like Fuji said the other day, he was like, oh, he was like, you know what you should cut that conversation off like. 5 min ago, like 3 min ago, as soon as he started, you know, like raising his voice, and I'm like, you know what.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Esther: You're right. Oh, hello! Pippy.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Tina Marie: He needs a hard cut.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Esther: Happy. Um.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Tina Marie: Sorry fighting things.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Esther: Oh, no, that's okay. Though, you know for me, I was like, Oh, yeah, for sure. You know it's um.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Esther: You know. Yeah, next time. I'm just not gonna let him even speak. I'm like, okay, you're gonna act like that first.st Okay, I'm hanging up, not talking until you calm down also. You don't get you guys don't get to see the kids for a while, you know. Like, when we got there on Saturday I could hear shouting.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Esther: Downstairs. When my, you know, when I walked down into the house with Emmy.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Esther: And I could hear my dad and mom like shouting. Or him shouting about something, and then I was like Ooh.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Esther: Don't want to be around this. You know, and I actually almost like picked her up and left. But it actually stopped. And I kind of like.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Esther: It's like, um, okay, you know. But it is one of those things where I'm just like. And we're actually there to do something. That day we were there to move the beds, and we didn't stay that long.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Esther: But again, it's 1 of those things where I'm just kind of like. Oh. And there are days where Emmy like says, Oh, I don't love Daddy, and I'm like, why, oh, why not?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Esther: She's like Daddy is scary, and on my mind I'm like, Oh, child, no idea what scary is.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Tina Marie: You have no idea.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Esther: But I'm also so glad that you have no idea what scary actually is, you know. But you know she's only saying that because Daddy holds his boundaries, and he doesn't let her whine or or whine, or throw tantrums to get what she wants.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Esther: You know, and mommy's a little softer. But mommy's working on that boundary, too. But it's it's it's more that, if anything, she she just doesn't know how to describe it, as she just says.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Esther: You know. But.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Esther: But I agree with you in the sense that um while labels, you know, they might help us understand. You know, whatever it is, you know, if I get an Adhd diagnosis, I'm get diagnosed one way. I just take it as any other sort of personality test. Maybe.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Esther: Like where this is just.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Tina Marie: Information.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Esther: You know, a system that's set up to um test or account for one facet.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Esther: Of my personality or me as a person, you know, and I've always told my therapist that I. I I don't want medication.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Esther: I always thought to myself, you know I am such a multifaceted human being. Yes. I don't know. Maybe there's a slight chemical imbalance, or whatever people want to call it.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Esther: But. You know it's 1 of those things where? Um, I I believe that.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Esther: If I am able to do, you know, and this might not be for everyone. Maybe some people do need a little bit more help along the way right? Um, but I know myself, and I know that I can do the hard work and not rely on a medication, or whatever it is. Even with, like, you know, some of the things I looked up about Adhd. And you know, hyperactive like Adhd or blah blah blah, I'm like, Okay, these are.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Esther: Maybe the 3 major categories. But again.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Tina Marie: Actually 7.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Esther: 7 or whatever it is right, like, okay.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. It's a lot.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Esther: This is just again a facet of even like the Myers-briggs test. You know, there's like.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Esther: How many permutations of that.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Esther: And I'm like. You cannot fit. Are you towns like? Are you telling me really, that you can fit.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Esther: Like everyone's personality into these. 60 categories. That's.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Esther: Crazy. That's impossible. But you know I understand why something like that exists. It exists for us to kind of. As humans sort of organized makes sense.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Esther: And you know, um, start to organize and make sense otherwise. It is definitely hard to target. Um, you know certain things. Um, you know, you know, 8 billion different personalities.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Esther: Right.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Esther: So um, yeah, for me. It's you know, I'm going into this the way I went into therapy like, okay. I like this to provide me some insight. I don't want medication, you know.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Esther: Maybe cognitive behavioral therapy or something like that. Give me something to do that I can kind of work on on my own that I can, you know, train myself.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Esther: Out of, you know certain things.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Tina Marie: Cbt. Has the best success rate of all things across all. Um. I can't think of the word. I will say disorders, but that's not the word that I'm looking for.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: Which is fascinating to me. Because of some.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Esther: Your most powerful medicine is your own brain.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Esther: Your own chemistry.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Tina Marie: So. One thing, though, one thing to know about a a trend and not a trend, but a um.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: Something that is common in all the versions of Adhd is dopamine deficiency.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Tina Marie: So, and.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Esther: For a dopamine like imbalance or.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: No deficiency.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Esther: Efficiency. Okay?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Tina Marie: Deficiency. So one of the things that you can learn to do is learn how. Certain amino acids are not produced in certain bodies.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. So, like most of the medicines.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: You know how they work. They just. They do one thing, they break 4 or 5 different things. Or then there's Ssris, which don't actually create.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Tina Marie: Neurotransmitters. They just change how you use them. But the issue with people with depression is they lack. Neurotransmitters. They don't create enough.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Tina Marie: Of the chemicals that their body needs. So most of that can be handled with like Gaba.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Esther: Okay.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's see. Hold on a 5 Hcp. What.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Esther: Grab a pendant. You have a pen, tip.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Tina Marie: No gaba um. GABA. I hold on a second. I have to remember what is.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Tina Marie: I don't remember what it's. Gamma amino, butyric acid.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Esther: Why is that? Oh, gamma, amino, butyric acid. Okay? Neurotransmitter, okay?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Esther: Um. Okay, yeah, that makes sense to me, you know. Like.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Tina Marie: So. One thing that you can learn uh is just, I know, because we're running low on time. So I want to tell you a few things, and then make sure that we get some time to talk about everything else.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Tina Marie: As quickly as we can. And hopefully, if you journal like, we can just do more time through the interaction. Um that way this week.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Tina Marie: But. Um.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Tina Marie: And like sleep. You talk about sleep, sleep, hygiene, and just how you feel. But if you're interested in, when you learn things about your brain, looking at what different neurotransmitters, deficiencies, or imbalances, they're not necessarily the same, they kind of are right. If you're deficient in one, there is an imbalance.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Tina Marie: But that doesn't mean that one is excessive. It just means that one is lower.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Esther: Huh!

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Tina Marie: And the other thing is is that there can be cellular damage. So maybe you have all the neurotransmitters that you need to have. But let's say your dendrites are jagged, and they're lacking phospholipids.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Tina Marie: So phenylaniline is a phospholipid. It basically lubricates your neurons. All your cells.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. So that the signals.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: Those neurotransmitters can. Flow more freely.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Tina Marie: So let's say you have all of the chemicals, but they just can't communicate well, because the cells are degraded and damaged, and they you lack phospholipids. So there's a lot to understanding the brain like, if I could get 2 degrees.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: The 1st 2 would be psychology, and the second one would be neuroscience, and then quantum physics, and then Hebrew. And then, anyway. If I had all the time I would learn all the things.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Tina Marie: Um anyway. So. But what was interesting to me as I was starting to learn about what the different neurotransmitters do, and then the things that they need to even be able to function. And the fact that we actually have neuroreceptors that are very specific.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Tina Marie: To those like, they can only receive that chemical. So sometimes those receptors, we have less receptors.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Tina Marie: So you can't make more receptors, but you know what that we can make. We can make more neurons.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Tina Marie: By learning. More neurons. Neurons are cells. They're brain cells.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Tina Marie: So you know what I mean like, it's amazing what we have the power to do. Just by changing. So you can change these neurochemicals.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Tina Marie: Through diet, you can change them through supplementation. You can change them through light therapy, getting more sunshine. A lot of this is just we're, we're basically plants in a lot of ways like we really get a lot from the sun.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. As you're going through this, and you're exploring, thinking about how you feel. Study your brain.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Tina Marie: Esther, like you said. Your brain is in charge of everything. If you start understanding what it needs to operate.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Tina Marie: And you give that control center of everything that is you, whether you know, physically or emotionally. If you would take spirit into it. But I think that you just believe in the the physical and emotion either way. That container.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: All goes through your brain.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Esther: I mean.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Tina Marie: So if you optimize brain health and function. For the way that you want it to be.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Tina Marie: Every other thing that you experience in life goes through that central. Thing.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Tina Marie: Will be improved. For that effort.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you. That really gives me something to think about. Um.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Esther: You know. And.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Esther: It's very interesting, like. I feel like.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Esther: You know this. I'm going through life right now, and I've.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Esther: You know, and every every few years or so I kind of. You kind of hit the next slope right, you know, and you're struggling up that next step, you know, if we think about.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Esther: Life as as a mountain, and you know I started down here in a terrible, terrible couple of terrible situations. And, you know, worked like worked really hard to push up that 1st slope. And then, you know, things were going great for a while, and here I've.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Esther: Come across another slope and another slope. I mean, I'm at a I'm at. Kind of that. The.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Esther: The bottom. Of another big slope.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Esther: So um. And it's, you know, another big slope where I'm just like, okay.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Esther: There's these things. There's these struggles that are coming to light. Now that I'm a mother that I probably wouldn't have experienced until I became a mother became. Um, you know there's another layer now added to my identity. Um.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Esther: And. You know, it's just another thing that challenges growth, that challenges.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Esther: Like challenges you to grow.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Esther: And. You know it's brought things up that you know. I've either been able to get away.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Esther: You know I've been able to um be. Um pretty successful, you know, while still.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Esther: Fascinating like hell. You know. Like, how did I get to where I am?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Esther: With this like tendency to procrastination, Fuji's got a tendency to procrastinate, and he's extremely successful. You know so.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Tina Marie: That's because you get more done than most people in the pockets that you work. So I used to think that I was lazy, too, and I used to think. No, yeah, I get 10 times more done than most people in an hour. I'm sure that you're the same. So what it is is recovery, and that's your balance.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tina Marie: It's not necessarily a bad thing, anyway. But yeah.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Tina Marie: Sometime.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Esther: It's and it's very interesting. When I start learning more about, you know. Pro, you know, I'm I've been procrastinating like since I remember since I was a kid.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Tina Marie: Adhd. And executive dysfunction go hand in hand. Oh, say, add, it's not always adhd those labels, whatever, and it's not even attention deficit. But let's say, but but in a really active mind, right? A thing that wants to go. Bing, bing, bing!

00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Tina Marie: I'll give you an example. My sister and I have conversations, and they go like this. This, this we always come back to center. I can't. Most people can't follow my line of thinking. She can see that that I can be here, and I can see 5 different things that relate. And I can talk about those 5 different things, and she can see the relationship. A lot of brains can't do that. That's not disordered.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Tina Marie: That's not disordered. Um! And the other thing is, though but executive dysfunction. Dysfunction.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Tina Marie: So. I hate paperwork. I will put it off. Fuji hates making sales calls. He will put it off.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Tina Marie: Does that make him less brilliant? Almost all genius, people.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Tina Marie: They really have like a zone of genius, and everything else is terrible. Sometimes they are just socially the most awkward, stupid, weird. Freaky kind of people. But where would the world be without their gifts? Are they disordered.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Esther: Genius.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Tina Marie: Or are they specially ordered. Do you know what I mean? And that's the labeling.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Esther: Well. I mean in society, in society we'll label it one way or another. You know what you know. Do these geniuses? Does our society.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Esther: Accommodate. People with very different we talked about. We talked about neurodiversity, right?

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Esther: You know, um, and just like, you know, the discussion about around neurodiversity. And even when I was at my old job, um. Corporate, American Corporate culture.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Esther: Rewards. Um rewards characteristics that are.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Esther: More prevalent among white Caucasian males. You know? How do we? You know? But.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Esther: Are there? There are many other forms of leadership. Let's just say that shows up in a lot of different ways in different people. And.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Tina Marie: And greatness which are not necessarily the same thing.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Esther: And it's greatness. Like you like you said, but we've been so conditioned.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Esther: View it a certain way, or you know, and. You know, women who've managed to get to those like C-suite levels.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Esther: Because, you know, they they fought hard to maybe some of them, some of them. Come now, it comes naturally, but. It rewards these very, very specific characteristics.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Tina Marie: And behaviors. Yeah.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Esther: And and behaviors right? So anyway, um. I love this idea, you know, and you know these ideas are all so.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Esther: They're so um! Attractive to me. And so, you know, I makes me curious. I want to learn more especially, you know, 1010, 15 years ago, when I really started to.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Esther: Learn on working, working on myself. 1st I told Fuji this for the 1st 20 something years of my life. I had this conversation with them last night. I was like Guji. You have no idea how repressed I was. We haven't even I was like we haven't even scratched the surface.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Esther: Like the things you currently know. We haven't even scratched the surface. And you know, and Matt and I described a couple of situations. With him.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Esther: Why am I so. Like, you know, I'm not an outdoor person, but I wasn't always like that love going outdoors. I told you right.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Buying Trees Mhm.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Esther: Outdoors equals fun, and then by transitive property. At some point, fun equaled bad.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Esther: To me. Fun eat means I can't hear the garage door open when Dad comes home. I don't know if I'm gonna get yelled at. I'm gonna get hit, or whatever it is.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Esther: Oh! And I asked him, oh, was Christy allowed to play with boys when she was a kid? He was like. Yeah.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Esther: Like his sister. I was like, oh, I wasn't allowed to play with boys. My parents were already sexualizing me at age 7. You know, I was like, Oh, yeah, I got. I couldn't play with boys. My dad caught me playing tag after school once I got my ass whooped when I got home, you know, you know just things like that. And I told him, like, you have no idea. Then imagine that going on for 20 something years.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Esther: Of my life. Yeah.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Tina Marie: I want you to pay attention to one thing. I want you to. I want you to practice all week long. I just want you to look for one thing.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Tina Marie: I want you to. Look for repression.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Esther: Okay.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Tina Marie: So. When you see something like.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna use off the wall examples that aren't going to exist. But you'll know what ones will come up. So let's say. You were in Disneyland, and somebody's eating cotton candy.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Tina Marie: I want you to watch for that. That looks yummy. That's bad for me. Instantaneously.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Tina Marie: I want you to look at somebody just. I don't know.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Tina Marie: Having the time of their life, and feeling completely free. I want you to look at that, and I want you to see.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: What judgment comes.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Tina Marie: And then just look for. The judgment and ask yourself, Is that mine.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Tina Marie: Or is that programmed. And then I want you to ask yourself.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Tina Marie: Because here's what you're gonna find is most of the people that we judge. Um, we judge, but they're free.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Tina Marie: They. They're doing what they want to do because they want to do it.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Tina Marie: Everybody wants to be free.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Tina Marie: Um, now. That's not to say that all free type behavior is healthy and good.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Tina Marie: But a lot of it is. It's not harming anybody, somebody wearing some really bright red lipstick and way too much makeup, and whatever and all kinds of weird colors, or just saying whatever's on their mind. You know. Um.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Esther: Oh, yeah, I I look at people now, and I say that that person is having fun.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Tina Marie: Where.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Esther: Good for them. And do you know what a lot of that came from, too? I got part of it through. A lot of the, you know. And then the healing. The last few years really came. A lot of some of it came from Fuji's family.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Esther: His mom would just be like, Oh, good for that person, you know. Um! Oh, sometimes, like even the kids are doing something I'm like, oh, that's a little dirty! I'm like she's like, Oh, look how much fun you're having! I'm like, oh, that's.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yes.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Esther: Way to see things. Okay, I'm gonna start doing that.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Esther: So. But yeah, um, no, and I agree with that. Um, I'll continue doing that, and then.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Esther: Yeah, I try to trust myself.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Tina Marie: But the but the. The underpinning, though, that I want you to look for is.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Tina Marie: What does? Esther, like.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Tina Marie: Want to do, and then immediately pull back.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Esther: Okay.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Tina Marie: What? What do you like? Feel like? Oh, that looks like fun! And then you.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Tina Marie: Talk it away so fast. You don't even notice that you do it.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Tina Marie: Like. Is there a thing that you want to wear or do?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Tina Marie: Or look like some days, and just be like, Yeah, but I'll get comments. I love wearing dresses. I love wearing makeup. I love doing my hair, and I would get comments. Well, my ex would tell me I look like a Mexican whore if I wore red lipstick.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Tina Marie: Where I'd wear dresses, and people would come to the door like, why are you so dressed up? I'm like. I just.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Tina Marie: I want to. This is what I like. This is what I feel like. And they'd be like, well, if I work from home. I just wear jammies all day. I'm like, yeah, but we're not the same, anyway. But um, you know, and I don't have any judgment. When I see somebody all natural, I look at that and go. You know. I wish that I felt so comfortable in my own skin that I just.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Esther: Yep. Yeah.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Could be that natural. And there are days where I'm getting to be like that. But I also like makeup. I like the whole gamut, and I don't want to have to explain.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Tina Marie: Why, one day I don't want to wear makeup, and I didn't wash my hair, brush it and clean, but like. You know.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Tina Marie: All these things. I just.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Esther: Like you. Okay, we don't want even want to explain to myself. I'm just like.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Tina Marie: No.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Esther: Oh, I'm gonna do!

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tina Marie: Today I feel this way. So there are days. Where like I really like to be clean all the time. But there are days when I wake up, and I feel so like.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Tina Marie: I want to clean the house. I want to be productive. I want to do physical labor, and if I stop to clean and shower. I'm going to want to do hair and makeup. And you know what's going to happen. I'm not going to feel like doing all those other things. So some days I just throw on scrubby clothes, and I just get to work.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Tina Marie: And instead of saying. I mean, how dirty am I going to be in 24 h, or, let's say, even 48 h in between showers? I'm not going to be filthy.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tina Marie: But I. Know I feel kind of judgment if I see people all clean and put together, and I'm like I look terrible. But what I do is go. You know what.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Tina Marie: I got all these things done today that I really wanted to do today, and I feel so good about it. And tomorrow, when I get up and shower and put my hair and makeup on. I'm going to think about the day before and look at my clean house, or that new project that I did, and that organization I'm going to feel so good. And nobody else is going to remember.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Tina Marie: How I looked, or thought, or whatever.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Esther: Hmm.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Tina Marie: But I will have done that thing. I will have had that experience. Or um sometimes like I love red lipsticks, but I put them on, I'm like, Ah, that's too much.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Tina Marie: And I don't do it. There are some things I feel like are too much, and. But I'm a big energy girl, Esther. I am too much sometimes.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Tina Marie: And I want to be free to do that. So just what are the things that you're just like? You judge yourself.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Mhm.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Tina Marie: And don't let you have the fun. Because of what it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Tina Marie: What questions you might have to answer. What explanations you might have to have, and.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Tina Marie: Just train the people around you. You know what? Today, I'm gonna do something because it feels fun. I won't talk about it.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Tina Marie: If you have anything negative, say, don't say it.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tina Marie: If you have things supportive to say, you can say I love that for you, but that's all you get to say. And then.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Esther: You know. Yeah, okay.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Tina Marie: See what happens.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Esther: No, I think that's really. I think that's a really great point. And um.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Esther: I will try to do that more. Now that you specifically. Pointed it out. I had been doing it bits and pieces there.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Esther: That. With not as much intention as you're describing now, like, for example, this morning I got up. I'm like, Oh, uh!

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Esther: If I put on makeup, Emmy will be a little bit late for school. You know. But this morning and then I was just like, Oh, you know, is today a day where I put on makeup, or just like, go without makeup. Today I was sitting there wrestling with myself. I'm like, Okay, but I don't just like you know what.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Esther: This. I'm just gonna wear my makeup because it makes me feel good today. It doesn't matter if I'm doing anything. I'm not wearing makeup, because oh, I have a call today, or you know, I need to pick Christy up from like, you know, and I gotta look good. I'm just like, no, I feel like wearing makeup today. I just do.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Tina Marie: Right. I put it on when I'm not seeing anybody or going anywhere.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Esther: Same here, and I I feel like I finally have. This environment in my home where I won't get comments if I do something different, or whatever like.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Esther: Fuji is always like. You know. Um, he, you know he's he's so much.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Esther: I'm gonna do it because I feel like it. Oh, I feel like getting a massage.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Tina Marie: As well.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Esther: And it's not like, oh, you know, are you feel? Do you want to get a massage. Because you're in pain because of what he was like.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Esther: I I just want to relax. It's fun. I want one, and I'm like.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Tina Marie: It's still, okay.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Esther: And whereas for me, I'm I'm just. He had to literally push me out the door the other night they go to a different massage place that we I've never been to, and he's like, Oh, I'll get the kids down. They've eaten, anyway, you know. Um, you know, Emmy.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Esther: You know, she and I was just like you know what he's right. I should just go to this. And he made he's like called 2 different places, to find.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Tina Marie: I love that go for you.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Esther: A place to go. He's just so wonderful. And then I have a nanny now who you know every day she's like I'm living my life, and she's like, oh, I felt like having this last night for dinner. So I just went, or I felt like wearing pink today, or you know, and it's just that.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Cast.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Esther: Energy to be around these 2. That's so different than that energy. That I was around all day when my mom was here.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Esther: You know, like not that she would say anything if I mean if I like wore something nice, or whatever. But. I just can't. I just can't disassociate or disconnect her from that.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Esther: That energy that she's always had in my life right that negative. Even when I walk into their house.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Tina Marie: Judgment.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Esther: I don't even live there anymore. I'm barely there. It's. It's that energy, you know.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Tina Marie: I. So you want to be free. I want you to be free. That's actually something that I want for everybody. And one of the things I try. To work on like my fiance is a person is very just trapped in a lot of.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Tina Marie: Thoughts and um judgment about himself. I see that in my girls and. Uh, I'm not fully free. But I I have really gotten some momentum there, and I want it for everybody, because I know that if we're if we're free or we're happier.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Tina Marie: But if we're free, free people don't want to imprison other people.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Tina Marie: It's misery that loves cat um company.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Esther: Company. Oh!

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Tina Marie: But but free people, just happy people just want everybody else to be happy and be free to be happy. You know they don't. They don't seek other people's misery.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Tina Marie: And so it's a great gift to have, not just selfishly, but for everyone around you. When we're free and happy, we energetically.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Tina Marie: Give other people permission. An inspiration as you've experienced.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Tina Marie: To do the same.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Tina Marie: So it would be a great gift and lesson to give to your girls, because. Kids are amazing. They pick up on things that we are not even telling them. And sometimes those are negative things like.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Tina Marie: Hold back! Repress.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Tina Marie: Be less so that other people can be more comfortable. And we don't want to give them that.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Esther: Yeah. No, I I completely agree. And I've been telling Emmy things like she's like, Oh, mommy.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Esther: Um, are you going to tuck me in tonight? I'm like, no, I'm not gonna tuck you in because I'm gonna go to a massage. Daddy found mommy a massage to go to. Oh, but why? I'm like, well, mommy's shoulder hurts. And I I needed.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Esther: Take care of myself. So I can. If I take care of myself, I can take care of you better.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Esther: You know, and. It's 1 of those things where these things were not sent to me as a child, because.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Esther: You know, you know, I'll say in particular, Asian parents who sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice, they don't take care of themselves. So when their kids go off and don't want anything to do with them anymore. They've given so much. They have nothing.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Tina Marie: The giving tree. You know that book?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Esther: Huh? The giving. Yes, I you know, the 1st time I read that book Fuji showed me at his house, and I was like.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Tina Marie: The giving tree.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Esther: Michael. This is a terrible story. This is like.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Tina Marie: It's real.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Esther: It is real. And he was like, Oh, this is what my mom is like. I'm like, I can see that. And I'm like Michael. This is an abusive relationship. This is terrible.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know he was like, oh, this giving tree reminds me of my mom. I'm like, I can see why, you know you should just give.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Tina Marie: But. There's another lesson in there, and there's something for people to understand. So we see that the tree.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Tina Marie: Lost itself.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Tina Marie: But we also see that eventually the boy. Realized.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Tina Marie: That. All I needed was this love and this safe space.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Esther: I was very bothered by the book, the or at least the part where the tree just kept giving and giving and giving right.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes. And and and then, just being abused like it was, it was terrible to watch, and so.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Tina Marie: I, but I think the lesson is there for. For the giver to go.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Tina Marie: I'm not. This is not good like I you. It didn't even have anything left to give. That was that was part of it is like. All I have left is the stump of who I am. But but then there's almost this realization. That's. All that was the value. In the 1st place.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Tina Marie: The tree just being the tree. And eventually the boy had to go through his lessons and realize that. But but the tree didn't have to give itself. For the boy to do that. The the boy had the experiences in life.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Tina Marie: Outside of the tree. He wasted everything that he had, only to realize that all he wanted was. Home.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Tina Marie: The tree didn't have to sacrifice itself for that to happen. So. The like. We don't have to sacrifice ourselves like we can learn from that lesson that it didn't change anything, the tree giving everything away. Only change the tree, not the boy, but ultimately, though, that these selfish people.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Tina Marie: They can learn. It may take them a whole lifetime. But the example that we set can make it happen faster. You can be somebody.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Tina Marie: It's not too late. There are things happening in people's lives, Esther. Even your dad can change. Even your mom can change. It's not your job.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Tina Marie: To stay there and handhold them and try to make it happen. Your best ability to facilitate that change is holding your boundaries.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Tina Marie: And living your best life and being the example. It isn't the words. It isn't the lessons, it's not the philosophy, it's not the conversation.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Tina Marie: It is what you do. And the other thing for the kids is that kids will not treat themselves the way that you treat them.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Tina Marie: They'll treat themselves the way you treat yourself.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Tina Marie: So. That's what we can do. Just be free, Esther.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Esther: Hmm.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Tina Marie: Be free!

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Esther: Thank. Yes.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Esther: I'm. I'm so happy! We had another wonderful conversation.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Tina Marie: I love you! Ah!

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Esther: 2.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Tina Marie: It's probably not professional, but whatever I don't care.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Esther: That's fine. There, you know.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Tina Marie: I'm free. I can say whatever I want to say. I'm free.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Esther: Yeah, it's well, and it's like you said not every single one has to be a professional conversation like Fuji and I had our like. Discussions last week with what was going on with team and and things like that, you know. So um, yeah, this week was a really um.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Esther: Who on like working working on stuff. Like.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Esther: Some of this stuff. I I realize that there's a lot of. Again that that slope that I'm hitting right now, and I told them. You know it's so important for me.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Esther: To address these things, because, I said, You know this. In some ways.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Esther: It. It impacts the way that I, parent so much. You know.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Esther: So I said that this is like. Critical, you know.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Esther: And and you know he's not sitting here like oh, you need to help more with the business. He's like. I just want you to do what you want.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Esther: And I'm like. I mean, how many, how many, part.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Esther: How many partners like can say that can do that?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Tina Marie: Loved it.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Esther: And I'm like, you know. But I I told him I can still see that you're spread thin. So, you know, let's.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Esther: Not let go of the conversation yet. When you get back from. Lodi this week. Let's.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Esther: You know. Let's talk about this a little bit more.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you know, and we can all meet together. If that helps to facilitate it.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Esther: You know, and you know I agree. Yeah. Well, um, that's what I told him, too. You know we could also find some time to meet with Tina. He did tell me.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Tina Marie: Um.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Esther: Uh to yesterday. He did fill me in on a couple of like. Highlights about what you guys talked about with Mirka and everything. And I'm like, Mm, you know, I'd have to agree with Tina, cause I was like, Okay, you really don't feel comfortable paying her 1,500. But I was like, you cannot drop her down to 13. You really cannot find.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Esther: Negotiate 14. But you know I liked your idea better at just keeping her at 15 what he promised her, because that is also an acknowledgement that. Yeah, he he kind of screwed up a little bit.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Tina Marie: Well, no, but I don't know if he told you, but I asked him. What did you get out of it? I said. Did she take on any new responsibilities.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Esther: Yes, he told me that part, too, about how many hours he's actually she's actually saving Paul a day.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Tina Marie: And he said, Yes. 15 a week.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Esther: Yes.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Tina Marie: I'm like Guji, that's $300 earned. Okay? Like, that's a no brainer. Right there.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Esther: Yeah, and.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Tina Marie: I said, you have to stop comparing to what other people are doing for that wage. It's not the same. They don't have the same job. It's irrelevant that somebody else did that. And like, Why are you gonna like penalize her? Because she didn't do the thing? But she still.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Tina Marie: Bringing you back. Yeah, anyway.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Esther: Bringing him value in some other way. Yeah.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Tina Marie: Um. And then the lady that can't speak English. I'm like, I hope he told you I was like.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Esther: Oh, he told me about that. Yeah. Well.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I'm like your your team should have prioritized the company because the company is what takes care of the team and everybody else by. By prioritizing, giving a friend a job.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Tina Marie: They put everybody at risk. And so they should have known better. I said. You should have not let that happen. You advocated.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Esther: Yeah. I did tell him that I told them the same. I was like.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, he told me he's like, yeah, that's what Esther told me, too. I was like, well.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Esther: Um. Well, I think at the time I think they were already close to making a decision. But I was like, Okay, well, now, you learned. And also I told him, Fuji, I think you know, and this is something that he and I will probably work on together. So I really think that you need to have a 90 day probation period and set.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Esther: What those things are, especially you have Paul, who's right hand man, but he's also trying to take care of his friends, too, so he's pushing you to do things. That may not be the best interest of the company while he brings a lot of value. You also need some sort of system and some sort of mechanism to protect.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Yep.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Esther: Against that. You have to remember Michael. He is not your partner. He is your employee. He doesn't, may not have, he doesn't. He's not incentivized by the same things. You and I are.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Esther: You know he wants to take care of his friends, get them good jobs. You know, and everything like the company is not his prior priority, like he is not your partner. I'm your partner.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yes.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Esther: You know. So like I was like, yes, but you know, let's think about that. I told Fuji. You know I that's something I can work with you on. You know, whatever.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's let's. Let's have more conversation throughout the week. If you have time. If you don't, that's okay. I, my sister, just called. I just realized the time I gotta call her back.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Esther: Oh, sorry! Okay.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Tina Marie: But um uh, I mean, it depends on what happens if you're just con contemplative and and reflecting, that's good. We can schedule some time with the the 3 of us. Whatever you like to do. Um.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Tina Marie: You know. Pace is what it is, but.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Tina Marie: You. You can use me more if you want to, but I also know sometimes it just gets really busy being mom and. And doing things. So just know that I'm here.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Tina Marie: And we don't have to wait just once a week. Uh! If you want to put something in your journal, just ping me that is there, and I'll I'll go over it and.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, anyway.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Esther: Thank you.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Tina Marie: It was great talking to you, Esther.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Esther: Appreciate it. I hope you have a great time with your sister.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Thank you. I'll talk to you later.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Esther: You too.
