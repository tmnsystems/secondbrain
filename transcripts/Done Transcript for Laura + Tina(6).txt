00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Tina. Hi, how are you?
00:00:03 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, except for I can't find. I don't remember the name of the high level account that I had because under my friend's domain, I think I shared it with you.
00:00:20 - Laura L
Yeah, you did. Let me shut its name. Okay. Okay.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes, thank you. That's how little I've been in it. I really wanted to be prepared and have things organized for you, but this is the thing. I'm starting to get to a point where, oh, I could stop my video. Sorry. uh where I can't do things by myself so much so I'm a business consultant and what I do for to earn my money for the most part is um I get on meetings with clients who pay me really well and I help them with their systems and their teams and their operations and their mindset and all kinds of things I take a really holistic approach to business so um I've been doing that for 22 years but um and everything I've done has been 100% word of mouth and I get paid really really well and it's been amazing and it's been a blessing um and I've been raising four children by myself for that same amount of time but now I in this background is relevant so that you understand just kind of like um a little bit about me and understand where um you know what you could offer what how you might be helpful and because I would really like, I think there's a potential for a great long term arrangement. But I think that it's helpful to understand the background. So two of my daughters are fully grown now and I've got a 17 year old and a 14 year old. And so I needed a lot less and the reason I chose the work that I did and the reason I got good at what I got good at was because I needed work to be very efficient. I needed business to be very efficient so that I had plenty of time to be mom. And because I got good at that, I was able to train it to other people and that's what they came you up for. But I only worked about 10 hours a week. And I mean, that's how good of a business it is that even in 10 hours a week, I could still take really good care of my family. So I'm good at what I do. But I need to work more because I'm a mama at heart. and without little kids at home to take care of, I really want to put it into business right now. And so I want to help more people, but because my business has always been 100% word of mouth, I can't just grow it. I don't have a marketing engine for it at all. I've never run ads for it, I've never needed to. And I've never had, I've never launched a course, but I really felt called because my approach is so different. You know, I'm not about the hustle and grind. I'm not about, you know, make as much money as you can, just because you can. It's really about using business to help you have a full fulfilling and happy life. And that looks different for everybody. Everybody's brains are different. Everybody's skills are different. Their finances are different. Their family time is different. You know what I mean? All these different things. And so I'm able to teach people. how to build there and optimize their business based on their own values and their own resources and things like that. So there's a couple things going on. One of the things is I'm working on building that course. I'm having somebody help kind of extract information for me. I'm using AI to help me just organize and take all of the stuff that I've been doing on repeat for 22 years. And productizing it so that I can offer it to people who can't afford $500 to $1,000 an hour to work with me. So that's part of it. And then the other thing is though I would like to also build a system that can help me find the higher level clients that I have and they are going to be know multi seven figure earners. I've got doctors, I've got lawyers, I've got market I've got copywriters, I've got, I've had property managers, I have lots of different types of people. So working on all of that and inside of that, because I've been working on building businesses with other people, and also because when I first got started, it wasn't as a consultant, it was, I did web design, I did graphic design, I did copywriting, I customized WordPress, I customized PHP scripts, I built automations, so I have a lot of the, I know that there's a lot of great things that we can do just to kind of build a really good engine and machine using technology, and I want to leverage all of that. But I don't want to be the one doing the work and thinking about that, I want to stay in my own lane of helping the business people do their job well. So when you said automations make your brain light up, That's awesome. That's so fun. And maybe it'll be something where you'll look at things and go, oh, I see we're doing it this way, you know, have you thought about doing this or incorporating that? And not necessarily immediately, but just thinking about what I would love is if I give you a task, if you have a thought about it, like I think, you know, have you thought about doing it that way, right? I think maybe this would be better or this is a potential problem I see.
00:06:35 - Laura L
Like I would really love to hear from you. Okay, I'm sort of a collaboration.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I would really love that. That would be the most useful thing to me. I'm not afraid of making mistakes. I'm not afraid of wasting time. I'm not afraid of wasting money. The only thing I don't want to do is be stuck doing it by myself because then I'll just be like, I'm not going to get it done because I'm I am social, and I work socially, and I don't want to disappoint somebody working for me. if I tell you I'm going to do something, then I'm going to do it. If I can, you what I mean? So that really helps me be able to get my stuff done. So to begin with, I thought that maybe I could just kind of screen share and like walk you through some of my assets and show you what's existing and kind of tell you the framework of where I want to get started so that we can get some traction because I think if I build the house, then it will be easy for me to put the furniture in so to speak. create a membership area with the sections and then I'm like, okay great, here's the content for that section, that type of thing.
00:07:52 - Laura L
Make sense?
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. cool. So let me go ahead and screen share. I'm just like super
00:08:00 - Laura L
dehydrated all the sun. Is it sunny there?
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, no, be kind of the sun is going down. It'll be down in about 45 minutes.
00:08:12 - Laura L
I see. Well, it's really hard hearing the Philippines.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's not fun.
00:08:18 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to me, think about where they're at. I have a couple of these that are working for me in my Etsy shop. And let's see. Lee is in. I don't know where she's at. It's 11 a.m.
00:08:38 - Laura L
time. Yeah, I think we're at the same time.
00:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is all of the Philippines in the same time? Yeah. I mean, oh, I'm going to stop sharing just for a second. Well, it doesn't really matter. This is my ADHD brain. I go all over the place and but eventually we may all be in the Slack channel working together.
00:09:12 - Laura L
Hello.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And okay, so I've got, well, that was what I was not showing. Profitriders Inc is my main website. I don't do anything with it. Like I said, everything is word of mouth. The only reason it exists, what is this? Is because sometimes people look me up and I just wanted to have a place where they could find some things that they look me up because I do do some podcasts, interviews with other people on their podcast. And I have had, this is terrible, this is terrible. I have had people 26 years business that's not well actually it's 28 yeah because I had six years in corporate. So that needs to be updated somebody else built this website for me so and it currently is hosted on Presidium have you heard of Presidium oh not yet okay so it's just a WordPress hosting service that is pretty quick um is it a page builder no well no it's not they but they do have it's just WordPress hosting so well actually let me go I don't want to go to the dashboard I want to go to Presidium.com as reliable secure managed work press hosting so
00:11:00 - Laura L
Okay.
00:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do have great support and I do want to share that with you. So let me actually do this. Is that right? No, that's not what I want to do. I have, there's things that you can't see because it's not being shared but it's the zoom controls and they keep getting in the way. So, okay, share securely. Open. And I. Okay, so we'll share a procedure. So then you will have access to all of my current hosting. I don't Is that everything in there? All the sites. Okay, so these are the domains that I have that are hosted here. I'm not really using that. I do have something on. Hey, it's Tina Marie because I try lots of different things. I'm just going to show you. I really am all over the place. Oh, and what I did have is an existing anymore. So that's fun. I don't know how that happened. I had it. So that's something. If you, we could use either like a shared Google Doc or something. I don't know if you like project management suites, how you like to organize tasks that need to get done. I can use any of them, you know, Trello teamwork, we can use a Google Doc, we can, I prefer not email, Slack has a new thing where you can manage a project in there.
00:13:14 - Laura L
But, yeah.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What would you, what would you prefer for getting assignments and keeping track of them? Do you have any preference?
00:13:22 - Laura L
Yeah, right now I'm using Trello, but it would be convenient for you to use like them.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I could also do that. Okay, I do like Slack Trello is totally okay too, especially with the Canban boards where we can move things into in progress. Do you have something that you could share, or would you like me to set up an account and share it with you?
00:13:48 - Laura L
Yeah, I can do a set up the one so it would be easier, I mean convenient for you.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that would be great.
00:13:58 - Laura L
Maybe.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could just have boards like to do and then progress road block and completed something like that. That would be perfect.
00:14:09 - Laura L
Okay.
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, let's start with this. Okay. So profit drivers right now is hosted here. Now, I, I am going to use high level, but it's not great as a host. It's great for texting and automations, but not for hosting, but I am considering. So one of the things that I get blocked on a lot, Laura is where to host a membership site. I have a bad habit of overthinking things and wanting it to be really perfect in terms of a user experience. The biggest thing is what I would like to be able to do is. serve content that a person does not have to log in to see. So like if we send an email and say, hey, module one is ready for you, if they click that link, I would love it to automatically log them in. They don't have to put in a username and password, and they can just go see their content because every step where there's a roadblock of any sort reduces the likelihood that they're going to consume the content. And I want like everything about what I do is to create and make things as simple as possible for people so that they can get the most important things done. Are you familiar with anything that, because I think you can do that with entrepreneurs, but I'm not going to pay for entrepreneurs because that's it's crazy expensive, but are you familiar with any other platform or even if high level, if you. can if we can create links that automatically log people in so that if I email them a link, they can go straight to their content without logging in.
00:16:11 - Laura L
I could actually check because I'm not really that 100% sure yet for a high level, but other than that I tried cartra, but it would be also the same with on-chip port. It's pretty expensive. So yeah, I could go ahead and look at go high level if there's that dynamic URL that they would take you to the content right away.
00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I would love because the one thing I know about high level is first of all, they have like Frankenstein code. They purchased their code from all kinds of different sources and kind of pieced it together, but they keep working on it and they keep evolving it and they evolve it quickly. And so if we put that in as a feature request, that might be something that it could actually provide. very quickly. So I would love it if you would take it obviously billable time and see and talk to their support and find out if that's something that's an option. And if not then finding out like there's searchy.io there's circle there's all these other platforms that are just content based sorry my dog is just barking her head off. And we could put it anywhere. I do want it to be simple. The biggest thing I think is that I want it to be simple access. So there's also school. I'm not a fan of it but but I really need to get over myself. So one of the things that would be super amazing for me from you and I shouldn't need it because I'm 47 years old and I should know better. But I need encouragement. I just need to hear this is going to be okay. We'll make it work. People will like it. it, that type of thing. It's, it seems like a really silly thing. But honestly, I can almost cry right now. Like, that's just, that's ridiculous. But that's, that's what my roadblock is. There's nobody that does that in my business. I do that for people all day long. So if that was something you felt comfortable doing with, that would be amazing to me. And you would be invaluable. So they're sad. Great tip. Yeah, yeah. and one of the things about just hiring you is that I, when I looked at your, your reviews and the feedback that people left you and I saw how long you, you worked, I feel like your person that enjoys being a part of a team and enjoys the work that you do and is very supportive. So, but also you, you are smart. You articulate. You really take a lot of boxes. So I, I'm really looking forward to this and I would just want to encourage you to just use this place with me to explore things maybe that you don't feel like you get to with other people because one of my favorite things is to see people grow their most like I don't have ego it's not a hey you work for me lady kind of thing it's not like that you know I might pay the bill but you do something for me that I can't or won't do for myself so I have tremendous value for you already and if there's a way that I can be supportive to you in your growth or even just allowing you to experiment with things let me know because I love I love being able to offer that to people well honestly I really love this kind of opportunity the first I met you when you shared your story because I actually planning to then sort out like a
00:20:00 - Laura L
the aid services here in the Philippines, the people here like my colleagues are struggling, finding jobs as they want to experience the same thing as my experience, like working from home and not missing out the milestone of my kids. So I'm kind of wanted to make this work out so I could also help them. I want to share the blessing of, you know, having the opportunity to take care of the kids at the same time earning.
00:20:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. Yes, I would be happy to help you in any way with that. Helping grow and start businesses is my area of expertise. cheapest client pays me $500 an hour to do it. So I'm good at it and I, but I do it for free. I sometimes just donate services. and help people because I really do love what I do and I feel like it's my calling. So if like sometimes if we just want to have a call about what you're doing and just work on that, I'll just give that to you.
00:21:14 - Laura L
Well, I'm still struggling though of finding my calling yet, but yeah, I'm actually trying to taking the time to really find it.
00:21:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I feel like, especially as a mom, it took me a really long time to be clear about things and be clear about what is and what is not for me. And a lot of times what became clearer first was what is not for me. So it was easier for me to find what is for me by finding out what wasn't. Because there's so many things that can be, you know what I mean, but by finding out the things that they're not for me either because they aren't compatible with me. my values or with my faith and or with being a mom. I'm not compatible with the schedule or like a lot of the reasons I don't do marketing is because so many women, they use their bodies and they draw attention in a way that I never wanted to do. And it's not about judging them, it's just it's not what I wanted to do. And so that was what I was like, okay, that's not for me. So, you know, it was it was a lot of that. But what I found is that every time I would get excited and want to do something, it would be like, God is like, okay, you get to do that, but not yet. Right now, I need you to take care of babies and I need you to be available for them and just be patient and your time will come, but you want it to be mom. So, you know, there's this. And so it's been really fascinating to go through that. I've been a mom for 23 years. And now I am almost almost like all my babies my my baby is going to be 15 in November.
00:23:05 - Laura L
So she's almost young. is 15.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She'll be 15 in November.
00:23:10 - Laura L
She's 14 right now. Okay. Well, that's so fast, right?
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they are all growing up. And I'm a grandmother.
00:23:22 - Laura L
I'm about to have my second grandbaby.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:23:25 - Laura L
Yeah. So this is what? 23. Oh, wow. So you already have two grandchildren.
00:23:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she's 20. She'll be 24 in December. And she's not even the one that's a mom. It's the the one under her who's 22.
00:23:42 - Laura L
I see. Yeah. Well, I also get pregnant when I was 24 and my eldest is now 11. It's like a 10 year gap between my eldest and my baby now, which is one year old.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow. That's awesome. I have there's a nine year gap between my oldest and my youngest. my youngest was born in 2000 when I was 24 and my one of my oldest and then my youngest was born in 2009. So they're nine years apart, but then there's two little ones in between. How fun. Okay, so the first assignment then is to set up the Trello account for us. Okay, the second assignment would be to find out if we can get a login less, basically access to membership content where somebody can just click in the email and access their content without having to click a login to any thing. Okay, so that's the second one and then after that it would be to To take a look at this site and see if there's anything that you notice needs fixing like that formatting is terrible, terrible, terrible. I hate my pictures, but people want to see faces, whatever. don't Want any branding guide. I don't. I've never done that. And if, but I do clearly obviously have colors. I really don't care about them, but I have them. That's the blue, the green and the orange, this, this blue. This is a dark blue in here. It's not black. It's actually a navy in the orange. So there's these four colors. I do have it in Canva. I do have my fonts there. So I kind of do. Let me show you my canvas. I think I also have a slot for another team number. don't know if that's even relevant, but. um profit drivers and wait our out brand kits that's it yeah so my logo's in there um the i don't know what this maybe the color that you have in the website but well it was something i was thinking about after 2020 that's a look at that okay anyway so um yeah logos uh let's see fonts title i think that's right um one test rod i'm not sure actually what this font is i thought it was railway i'm not sure what it is um but i don't really use it anywhere else and um do with this open sand cutting, yeah, I'm not sure I could find that. If it's needed for anything, the other thing is I do actually have a what do you call it. icon a favicon, but this is not using the right one and I don't know if it's in here, but I do have that so I would like it to be using the correct favicon. And so that could be a task as well, and then making sure that these forms work. So another thing that I would want to share with you is get response because that is the CRM basically that I have the email service provider to. And. Where's my code in here. If I can find it. I have nothing getting codes, wait where did it go, did it go to my email, so it to my email. I have a brain, it's just sleepy. Okay, there we go. didn't even need to do to share this with you, but I should do that. Share with Laura.
00:28:38 - Laura L
Hello real. Yeah, that's.
00:28:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, I don't know which one it is actually connected to. It might be 10 ways to 10k. Yeah. I drive no traffic to it, but it still gets traffic. One of the things I would like to have is Google Analytics, working, GA4, are you familiar with it? Yes. Great. Because I was having problems getting it integrated, I may have it, I may not, so another thing would be analytics.google.com. If I could add you here, would it be the same email address?
00:29:44 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. I've got drivers. Um, I've never been very good at navigating this. Like, I don't know where to go to add you. So I would like to add you to everything that I have, but you could, I probably set up other properties and if you get stuck somewhere and just tell me, look, I need you to add me to something.
00:30:11 - Laura L
Yeah, I think it's an admin setting. At the bottom where there's a. Yes.
00:30:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Set up these. Count details and access management.
00:30:26 - Laura L
Yep.
00:30:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Add users. Oh, Laura.
00:30:33 - Laura L
Laura. Yep, two, five, eight. That's you know, yeah. I think you also have to add the role.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'll just add you as administrators, but you can just have full. Okay. And then that. So. So then another assignment is just to check to see that GA4 is installed, it's collecting data, set up correctly, that kind of thing. checking the forms, checking the form matting on the home page, that is weird.
00:31:21 - Laura L
Are you not using Google Tag Manager or just the analytics?
00:31:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm probably not. I 100% neglect everything in my business, other than my clients.
00:31:34 - Laura L
You can assume it's not done or not done right. Maybe we could use the Google Tag Manager because we could also put all the tracking in there and yes please.
00:31:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It all in one place? Yes. I love analytics. It's been a while since I've looked at it because basically since it went to GA4 we've all been like what the heck is going on. And I don't spend a lot of time in it. I spend most of my time doing all kinds of other things in the business, but I used to be very familiar with analytics. I would look at heat maps. I want to know the conversions. I want to know the metrics. I want to know my balance rate. want to know my speed, the page loads speed. want to know all of that because that has an impact on how long people stay on the site. I want to know what they're engaging with. I want to know what's turning them off. So analytics is really important to me, but I'm never going to be the one to do anything other than pay for somebody to do it well because I've got too many other things in my brain. And it's another reason I'm really excited for you because I feel like you're going to be super helpful.
00:32:48 - Laura L
Yeah, that's also the problem for me because I feel like I kind of have that general thing like by actions, like, yeah, say they would want this. You know, I could like do and do that stuff because I also really love learning at the same way.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. mean, it's like the best teacher. Yes. I am the same way. I'm a nerd. And if I have a question, I'll spend five hours learning about it and become an expert.
00:33:19 - Laura L
And even if I never do it ever again.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know a lot about it.
00:33:25 - Laura L
And if you ask a question, I could teach it to you. Yeah. Yeah.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So I feel like that is a few things to get started on that will be at least probably five hours. If you run into a block and you need more time, we can do that. It's not urgent, like, I'm never going to be like, this has to be done really quickly for the most part. But I would like to go kind of quickly to get things at least to a baseline, a membership site where I can put content. tend to. So the priority, this is one of the things we should always do on our calls to, is decide, okay, of all the things that need to get done, what's the order of priority, what first, what second, what last, and so on. That way, I know that the thing that was important, that was most important to me is getting worked on. So if something doesn't get done, it's not going to be the most important thing, and that will be really great. So the priority really for me would be to make a decision about a membership site where I can start putting content in, and then the second thing would be analytics, but you have to decide is the website, like, do you know enough? Do you need to dig into the hosting a little bit, know, make sure that certain plugins are there, whatever, like, so that's up to you in terms of what you feel like you need to do for a baseline of making sure that the site is workable for you, make your suggestions. about we should have these plugins, we should not have these plugins, whatever. Yeah, so do you feel like that's kind of a clear starting point, especially with getting the Trello would be like step one, obviously, so that I can look at it and go, okay, here's the list of tasks that you captured. Yes, that's right. Then I can drag them, you know, in order of priority, if I change my mind or something, but the top of it right now would be membership site, second would be analytics, and then the other thing was just, you know, cleaning things up and then checking the forms, making sure that they work. So that's a good starting point, you think?
00:35:44 - Laura L
Yes, it is.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. Good.
00:35:47 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Ah, really? Me too, really excited to get started. And also for the members should site just to clarify that would be hosted in Go High. I level so just only the membership it could be.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know where I'm going to host it yet. If go high level can work in a way where it's really easy for people to access and they don't have to log in then I would host it there. If not, I want to look at some other options and see if there's a way for no login access. Do you know what mean? Like there's an automatic like the the URL is pre-coded for them to log them in. So that could be the second step. If it can't be go high level, is there another option that does pre-coded that isn't a CRM like on support or cartra but is a is purposefully like a membership service like Circle or Searchy or School or any of those types of things.
00:36:52 - Laura L
So I mean how do I let this govern maybe thinkific or yes yes yes anything that will do it.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm happy to pay for your research time because I do it and then I get frustrated and then I start overthinking things and I go down rabbit holes and I've wasted time and then I'm frustrated that I've wasted time. So yes, if you would do that, I will pay for the research time and then if you would make your recommendation and give me the data so I can make a decision but with your help, that would be amazing and then we'll just make a decision and then go with the best thing that we can that's also cost-effective.
00:37:36 - Laura L
Okay, yep, we'll do.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, do you have other questions?
00:37:41 - Laura L
Yeah, I'll do it now.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, I'm so like I feel relieved, I feel excited and also I love that you want to build something. know that that'll take a little while to do but if you wanted to like right out what you envision and then what I really start with Laura is I just ask people questions and as I ask the questions sometimes they don't have the answers and they're like oh I never thought about that let me you know and so it starts to kind of take shape and and it goes from there and it seems it's a it's really a simple process but it's as you know I'm sure it's just so much easier when somebody else puts their brain on it and looks at your blind spots or even maybe just encourages you and says you know what it's actually not as complicated as you think it is you could just do this or you could just do that so I would if you have a google doc and you start writing things down we could spend a few minutes and it would be you know off the clock obviously but I could give you some time every week to help you with that if you'd like well that's but I'm kind of really privileged to have you doing that for me because you know you're too busy and yeah it would be my pleasure it would be my pleasure honestly it's it's a great service and and one of my passions and missions is helping moms find work i've been so blessed i don't want to cry i've been so blessed to be able to stay home with my daughters and they have no idea that like they just think that this is life that moms can have time and they can have money and they can be there for everything and i'm like that is not what it's normally like whether they're married or not but definitely not for single moms and they don't know because that's the life that they had and i just think what a blessing that's been and i want to share that with as many moms as possible and what you're doing is a great way for me to be able to just add um add to i don't have to be the one in charge it doesn't have to be my thing i yeah because that's also the pain points that i'm seeing with all the
00:40:00 - Laura L
colleagues and friends that asking me what are you doing and then they could they would say I wish I could also what you're doing something like that so yeah that's also what I'm trying to I actually pray that I could also help them yeah yeah my thing that I ran into that was really hard is that people would ask me what I'm doing and then I would tell them and they wouldn't do the work yeah I would tell them all you have to do is like go apply to Upwork or go do this and like it's not fun sometimes to go right right for somebody else or to learn a new skill and you're not getting paid a lot of money but like you don't get to the good stuff quickly you have to work your way up and nobody wanted to do it like almost nobody this whole time 22 years Laura not one person actually followed through not one yeah that's it So the problem there is you wanted to help them, but they also not helping themselves.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:41:06 - Laura L
I think they are what they're saying is that they are afraid of talking to clients. think the advice that I give to them is just be yourself. And then yeah, I think the client could see or could feel that if you are talking, I mean, you're from the heart and just honest of what the things that you can do and what are the things that you are willing to do like learn.
00:41:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and the other thing is I teach people, I mean, you can be afraid people want to avoid pain. And that's not that doesn't work because things are going to be hard and things are going to hurt. What you need to learn is that you can get over the pain quickly and the hurt won't destroy you, but it will teach you and it will be hard, but you'll be smarter because of it. And you'll be stronger because of it. And then you'll have amazing blessings because of it. And the other thing is, like if we were working with somebody that believes in God or as we're commanded fear not. We're commanded. not. It's not a suggestion. Fear not. Because God will help us. And so, like we don't have to be afraid of the hard things. We need to be willing to do the hard things. a lot of people just aren't. But sometimes maybe they just need to be encouraged. It's okay. some things are going to go wrong. And you're going to have some bad experiences, but you can't have the good ones if you don't try, you know?
00:42:39 - Laura L
Yeah, they're afraid. Oh, I mean, they are afraid to try.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the thing. Yeah. And you can't fix that. But you can at least make a place and you can have some content that trains them and encourages them. And you can you can at least make make a space for them. if they choose it, they do and somebody will choose it. Somebody. definitely will choose it. Maybe not the ones that you want it to be, maybe not the friends that you care about. But somebody else will and it will bring you joy to know that you've helped another mom and another family.
00:43:13 - Laura L
Yeah, that's my prayer. hope that, yeah, it will come true.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Speaking of family, there's a child. Yes. Yes. I am, but I'm almost done. Do you want to wait like a second? She's like, she's barbecuing for us right now.
00:43:31 - Laura L
She's making hamburgers outside on the grow. Oh, okay. need to go, yeah, go with your children and enjoy the barbecue.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So if you have any questions, you can send them through Upwork. If it's complicated, and you want to make like a screen share, a loom video or something, then that works. then we can have these meetings regularly. If it's something complicated and you just want a separate meeting, we can do that. I'm really flexible with whatever is needed, and I'm just so excited.
00:44:07 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Yeah, me too. I'm really excited.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
