00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. You're muted. go.
00:00:13 - Michael Fujinaka
Hi, good afternoon. Hi, how are you?
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really well. How are you? Good. You're off the hook with face-to-face looks today. And it's probably good while you're late.
00:00:25 - Michael Fujinaka
Sorry about that, my fault.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. Are you busy?
00:00:30 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, it's a little child care this afternoon, but...
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's to be expected.
00:00:36 - Michael Fujinaka
I know she's eating, so she should be good for an hour.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Welcome to multi-children life. Yeah, exactly.
00:00:46 - Michael Fujinaka
Emmys with the new... I mean, estrus with the new ones, so we're all covered. And what's her name? Beautiful.
00:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Are you enjoying her?
00:01:00 - Michael Fujinaka
He's a lot.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of a lot of crying and waking up, but it's good. Yeah, every every child's different than that adjustment period is always different. Some babies just sleep through the night and they're fine. My first born was a collicky baby. And she, she just cried a lot. It's really interesting to you how it's played out in her adulthood because one time she cried so hard she turned purple and stopped breathing and I thought she was going to die. I didn't know what was happening. Was she choking? Was there something wrong? And this child, Boogie, she still gets stressed out to that level. She shuts down. just holds everything in. Sometimes won't breathe and it's fascinating. not everybody so observant and like remembers things like that, but it's been really fun. fascinating to watch what traits existed from the womb.
00:02:04 - Michael Fujinaka
they came out and it's so funny. Yeah, funny.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's amazing. So there's no classroom like the one apparent thing, so let's trap in.
00:02:20 - Michael Fujinaka
I hear that.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you had some interesting sleep stuff happening, huh?
00:02:26 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, it's been rough.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but did you see? Now, of course, I don't have a lot of data. I have intract it. But to see two of the days, just the shock to me to see them this week, although I have to say that there's a huge discrepancy between Aura and Aura and the Apple Watch. Yeah, so I am gonna, I actually ordered one for myself because I'm such a nerd and I like to get there. Dina, so we're another data point, then we can compare the differences between my numbers too.
00:03:04 - Michael Fujinaka
So I can go, okay.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that? So if you had the guess, which one would you feel like is more accurate?
00:03:14 - Michael Fujinaka
It's hit or miss because a lot of what I think the aura ring is missing are the wake-ups when I feed. So like when I wake up and I, it's my turn to feed, it seems like aura accounts that sleep. So it's not like a super accurate representation to me. I've been like the Apple Watch, it recognizes that I'm like up, I walk around, I get the bottle, I feed, I go back to sleep. I mean that all could take maybe 40 minutes, but still it shows that I'm awake versus the aura ring. Sometimes says I'm still asleep, just like a light sleep. That's very interesting to see.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. So that's interesting to me and, but also because the Apple Watch seems to have recorded more actuals. sleep, then the ordering.
00:04:03 - Michael Fujinaka
It's possible. Yeah.
00:04:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like days, it's and it's hard. I have to go back and like do the math because they're not labeled on the Apple one.
00:04:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, the sleep one.
00:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:16 - Michael Fujinaka
Not on the screenshots. I see. I don't see dates. Oh, I push that little button on the top right where like uploads. But maybe it's not. Oh, yeah, doesn't show that. Oh, that's weird. Okay. How do your other clients send you the data?
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm open to whatever I just did. Nobody else is focused on sleep like you are. So that's the thing about a holistic approach to to this is that wherever somebody needs the most focus, that's what they do. Sleep is huge for everyone.
00:04:50 - Michael Fujinaka
Maybe I'll try next week, putting it in a spreadsheet. Then I could label like Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and put those screenshots because I like I Do you like the sleep tracker format better than the apples sleep app?
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so the things that I think are really important, first of all, like, because I don't need to dial into all the little things you definitely want to look at that. But what I am interested in seeing with you is so because your primary concern was how long you're spending in bed before you actually fall asleep. So you're lying down here. I want to look at that with you. What your light sleep is, what your deep sleep is, what your restful, and what your total sleep is. So that's kind of the macro level I want to look at. speaking of macros, we talked about a food journal app. Have you got that or is that something you want to get or will get?
00:05:47 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I haven't decided, maybe you can just, because like I was asking a couple of my friends that do track, like my wife actually tracked her macros, but it's more of people that eat. the same food every day and you know I eat my diet is just wacky like today I had a subway sandwich and I'm going to eat pizza tonight for dinner this is all over the place um so then you want something that has a really huge database and the two that I recommended do have that my fitness pal and lose it so I use lose it just because that's what I started with years ago I use it religiously um they so when I look at apps and I look at technology or software I'm looking at longevity how long have they been around how often do they update how much they improve because especially if I'm getting reporting information like I really want something that's going to evolve with me um I think that they're comfortable so if you just look at the the formats and see what you like their new databases are going to be very similar so you can do things like um search let's say you can do like hot dog stand hot dog so maybe it's not perfect when you eat out.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But most restaurants, so like mom and pop stores, you're going to have to guess if it's a Thai food restaurant and they've got spring rolls or something, right? you don't know what those are. You're going to have to make your best guess. And also the more that you read labels, the more you're going to have an idea looking at the content. Oh, this estimate's probably closer. This one's further. They have barcodes where you can scan. So like if you're eating packaged foods, you just scan it and it'll put all the data in there for you. So, yeah, those two, and there's a lot of data. Do you know, I drink fuel a lot.
00:07:39 - Michael Fujinaka
It's like a protein shake. Add a food to eat your app, lose it.
00:07:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. So there's multiple ways to do it, and you can do recipes. So let's say you have a breakfast meal that you put together. Oh, I'm just saying like you can get all the way, you can get super customized. You can have foods. and all the macros and everything. Yeah, but you won't have to. You'll just be able to scan the barcode.
00:08:04 - Michael Fujinaka
It'll already be there for you. Okay, got it. Yeah, try yours then. Yeah, okay, so next week by Sunday, I'll send you my macro tracker aura and then the sleep tracker and the journals for things.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so I don't know if my fitness pal does time stamping for meals, but lose it does. And I do want the time stamps because I'm very interested to see the impact of what you eat before bed. Who's it? Some people are just like, no, you can't eat before bed. I sleep better when I eat before bed. Everybody's body is different.
00:08:45 - Michael Fujinaka
So learning what you need will be better.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, some foods create more heartburn or anxiety or different chemicals. like if you really want to dial into this, that's the way to look at it.
00:09:00 - Michael Fujinaka
I've never thought. about looking at food as it relates to sleep, but I can imagine that there's a difference.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I'm happy to look at it for a little bit. Well, yeah, for sure, because the byproducts they create are all chemical, right?
00:09:14 - Michael Fujinaka
calories and everything.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we're like, I'm just even talking about the the the different chemicals that the body has to use to break the food down and the byproducts of them all have a chemical response in our brains as well. And obviously when we're sleeping, the brain is in charge of everything that's happening. So anyway, it just depends on how micro you want to get.
00:09:41 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, probably hold that constant. Like my diet is just so varied that I'm just worried that, you know, the the sheer variety of what I'm eating every week is just going to be strange to look at.
00:09:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's ask your different question and then come out at this from a different angle. How I'm important is nutrition to you anyway and how mindful are you about nutrition?
00:10:05 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah that's a good question I mean you know my grandpa had my my paternal grandpa had diabetes my father had diabetes and he's 70 and as skinny as me so I think you know nutrition is isn't I do think it's important I guess I don't really haven't ever really emphasized it because like I am my weight is pretty solid like it never changes and that's why I haven't put a whole lot of effort into where your grandfathers obese because you can be thin and diabetic oh no my grandfather well my grandfather was definitely pudgy but my dad is looks just like me he's 120 pounds so what does that tell you about your weight yeah it's not just the it's not just the fat that causes diabetes it's now yeah yeah so um
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that already tells you that you're predisposed to some issues and also just the functionality of your body. So again, it just depends on how much you want to look at this because there's no point in looking at sleep in depth if you're not going to look at nutrition in depth because they just impact each other. Your ability to digest properly is affected very much by how much sleep you get. Your ability to sleep well is very much affected by what feel you put in your body.
00:11:30 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay, that's fair. mean, I think if we're looking at sleep and you believe it, it's impacted by the, by what I eat, I think.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you're a doctor. Do you not believe that's impacted by what you mean?
00:11:42 - Michael Fujinaka
I mean, I think to an extent, but it's just, it's so hard because there's just so many, like, I like when I like to do experiments, it's hard to keep, I like to keep things constant. And I don't, I just don't think that like, I'm going to, I'm going to track anything meaningful, but I mean, we'll try.
00:11:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Happy to try.
00:11:59 - Michael Fujinaka
So. No, I know you probably don't want to spend a ton on time on this, but here's the thing that I want you to consider.
00:12:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, 100% an experiment is invalid if you don't have isolated variables, right? I think the bigger issue is that you and your schedule or maybe it's because you prefer different foods. But what I'm picking up on and you can tell me if I'm wrong is that you don't think you're going to be in a situation where you will be consistent enough with food to make any kind of hypothesis and valid experiments. And so you're kind of negating the efforts of tracking it from the beginning because you know you're going to pick up a hot dog at the hot dog stand and you're going to get pizza or door dash because at the end of the day, you're more focused on getting stuff done and food is set kind of an afterthought.
00:12:55 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that's fair. Actually, you know, now that you mentioned it, it's not that. No, you're right. I think if I'm doing this, if I know I'm doing this just for correlation to my sleep, I think I'm open to doing it. think I was thinking that I'm going to be like changing when and how I eat, but that's not what we're doing right now.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're trying to data collect. So, okay, I'm happy to do it.
00:13:19 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, we're just data collecting. then if we, you and I find a trend, then we can go after it. yeah, we're just data collecting then.
00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really all it is. You, you're going to make your choices and choose your lifestyle whenever and choose your priority. But, and this is really just a beginning thing. So, we gather some data and then we can move on. You could say, you know what, this is, this is not interesting and we can focus on other things. But if you're going to do it, for sure, all you're doing is tracking, you're looking to see if anything pops out at you. And that's why you want all the details from the beginning, then you can move on.
00:13:53 - Michael Fujinaka
All right, that makes sense. I like having that piece of data. So, sleep data, and then the food data, and then the journey. So, okay, I think, yeah, that makes more sense now.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. then let me look at my notes. So we talked about tracking your time. And I gave you an option for a couple of different apps. Did you be able to action on any of that this week?
00:14:22 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I'm going to. Well, I haven't done that spreadsheet yet.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And the other thing, though, was I suggested an app either toggle or or clockify. don't know if that rings a bell to you.
00:14:39 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I need to look at the notes.
00:14:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. don't know. No, you didn't have a lot going on at all this week. Um, let me see.
00:14:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay, toggle or Spotify. clockify. Okay.
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:14:56 - Michael Fujinaka
My wife said to tell me things like four times and I still don't.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
remember it's insane. That's okay.
00:15:02 - Michael Fujinaka
We're going to literally have no mental equipment. I have no processing ability right now. I'll look back at your notes.
00:15:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you said. Well, I'm looking and I didn't talk about tracking your time, but I didn't write. It was in the fathom notes, but I want you to not have to leave the email notes. So I didn't put those two things in there. So I'll make sure to put them in this one toggle or clock or five. And again, this is only two weeks, but we want as much data as we can get for the two weeks. So as accurate as possible. And then again, we'll move on because what we're looking for is where are the levers in the other, you know, in the parts of your business that you've got goals. So let me go back to my just tell me what shot you prefer. Um, I would love to do that for you, but it's really that interfaces are different. So it has to be a choice. I would use toggle most of my clients like clockify. Oh, seriously? Okay. Yeah.
00:16:17 - Michael Fujinaka
Wait, which one do you use toggle T O G G L looks fine. Yeah.
00:16:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it at the end of the day, the information.
00:16:30 - Michael Fujinaka
So, um, I got, so we'll do that and we'll do lose it.
00:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:37 - Michael Fujinaka
Toggle and lose it. I got it.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Back down here. You're not tired at all. I'm just pushing through.
00:16:45 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah.
00:16:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see.
00:16:47 - Michael Fujinaka
Do it.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go. So one of the things that we talked about was defining clear. Clear work windows in the evening that doesn't violate family time. So potentially just. creating a schedule of work stops at this time for, you know, dinner, bedtime, whatever.
00:17:06 - Michael Fujinaka
Did you come up with anything for that? Yep.
00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll move that to next week. And we'll put that down here also. And then this was premature because we didn't dig into it a lot, but we talked about essentially hiring somebody for SEO.
00:17:24 - Michael Fujinaka
We didn't into that a little bit more today. SEO, oh yeah. But that's not, that's not a for today kind of talk, I think.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me, let me go back up here. What do you do this for me? I know that your journal is just too difficult for me to read. Like I get bits and pieces of it. But what I would like to know, how much do you think the the baby altered your rhythm this week.
00:18:03 - Michael Fujinaka
So I can at least start with that kind of offset there.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if you made it a percentage.
00:18:11 - Michael Fujinaka
Like last week? Yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, last week. week coming up to ending yesterday.
00:18:19 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, it was just like 75%. I didn't get anything done. Like I literally did not really work. I don't think I mean I did like the bare minimum to keep my business going and I did the bare minimum to keep my QME reports going. But yeah, everything else is just baby and child care for Emmy for the other the other kid.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what do you anticipate this week to look like?
00:18:45 - Michael Fujinaka
This week's interesting because I have to QME work requires in person like so today I had to go to Daly City to work tomorrow. I'm in San Landro from nine to five or what's an hour away. So I have to leave at seven. Day after that, I'm in San Jose in the morning and then Thursday, I have the incubator, I got accepted into Wait, I already knew that already knew that and then Friday, I only have like morning stuff. So This is going to be interesting. Like what I'm doing is I'm helping Esther for the 10 or like the nine o'clock, 10 o'clock feeding and then I help her at like 12 to one o'clock or two o'clock feeding and then I'm sleeping till seven. So she lets me get like five hours of sleep like I did last night. So tonight I'm going to try to get that five hours or six and then Wednesday I'm going to try to get that again and then Thursday night I'll probably help her at the five a.m. four a.m. five a.m. feedings because what's happening on Friday is just like working the morning. So it's going to be this week's going to be a little bit better. for me because I'm going to get, I'm starting, I'm going to get at least like five, six hours of sleep every night because that's just going to let me.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:20:08 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. it should be a little bit more regular. And, but yeah, today, tomorrow, Wednesday are my Q and E days that I have to go and drive to in person.
00:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, I'm trying to take everything into account because it takes a couple months for the baby's belly to get big enough to hold enough notes to sleep through the night.
00:20:33 - Michael Fujinaka
But I'll be. Yeah. Oh, Esther, like we're already planning like we're going to get her to sleep through the night. I think we're going to we're targeting like a few months, three months. Yeah. So in another four to six weeks, we're going to start loading her up and then trying to get her to sleep for six hours at a time. So it's coming up, but not yet.
00:20:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't think. Okay. Well, I'm just asking because to put things in perspective on what we work on, what.
00:21:00 - Michael Fujinaka
realistic to work on and what the pace looks like. You know what I mean?
00:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's the reality. there's there's only so much that you can do. So that would mean that for us the most important that thing that we can do is figure out the big rocks basically like what what has the greatest impact and really only pick one or two things and we already have a lot going on but and that's going to be a process of digging so you might not come away with any assignment today or even next week. I might have to dig in a little bit more so that we're making the best use of your time and trying to make a powerful modification that doesn't take a lot of time or effort but it's you know strategic it's a precision incision rather than okay so yeah because two to three months like that's that's a lot of disruption but it's It's necessary. It's unavoidable and it's also good. that's really the best use of your time. Your daughter is only going to be an infant and a newborn once.
00:22:13 - Michael Fujinaka
So, you know, I'm spending a lot of time with just Emmy because, know, we've been just, yeah, I just want to make sure she doesn't feel like she's the second wheel now or whatever you call that word, third wheel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely cherish the time I'm with Mari, but she's just kind of like a little sack of potatoes right now. She doesn't know. Yeah, it's a lot of, it's just, I try to give Emmy, I've been doing, I've been teaching her how to read, she's almost three.
00:22:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that if I give a mouse a cookie, my kids don't know.
00:22:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, and then I've been doing like a lesson, I don't know, why is it blurry?
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's blurring out. Oh, teacher, she's going to read in 100 lessons.
00:22:58 - Michael Fujinaka
So, read every minute, I've got 15 minutes. with her.
00:23:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that.
00:23:02 - Michael Fujinaka
It's like one on one time just so she knows I'm I'm there. Esther can't sometimes there's days where Esther doesn't have a lot of time with her or she's. I remember those days I have and I was guilty I felt guilty all the time and the girls my second daughter one day she's like mom you should have stopped at one I'm like you do realize that that we mean you weren't here okay too um okay so let's get back into this oh okay where did you guys have any more conversations about hiring a person that was great yeah last week it was nice so we we this this was something we got into talking about um that we we decided that we do want someone we think local to be a personal assistant there's just a decent amount that and
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really it's we believe it's someone to help Esther not so much me I find that a lot we found that like a lot of the things that we need help with are more stuff that Esther already takes care of that yeah she feels like if she could offload she would be just a better she would be in a better space well and from what I know about her brain that's a great start like the conversation we had about going just every other week once a week for the cleaning to unlock her mind or even just her energy would be a huge lever in your whole family and so that's a great jumping off point if you find you need to modify or even hire a second assistant with a short amount of time and maybe that person takes multiple clients or something like you really want to what what what people often want to do is give one person a whole bunch of miscellaneous tasks, rather than really zero in and get an expert in a particular field that satisfies a particular function really, really well. Because we don't want to deal with more people, we don't want to deal with more payroll, and we think that that is harder. But really, when you hire a function-specific expert, they do so much of the thinking for you and they can act so autonomously that they still create less work for you, even if you have to hire multiple people.
00:25:37 - Michael Fujinaka
On that note, on that exact note, we wanted a chef to use our kitchen and use fresh ingredients in our kitchen cook. And on that exact note, the thing that when we talked about that Esther actually wants that less. And I agree, because there's, you know, like we do methodology and we talk We about the other meal services we both use. He actually wants someone to clean our kitchen more than we want someone to cook for us.
00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes perfect sense to me.
00:26:10 - Michael Fujinaka
And so we were trying to come up with strategies like, well, even when we get methodology, even when we do one of the cooking services, there's still dishes and that's what drives Esther crazy. then by like extension, she's like, because I'm always like, let's just leave it till the morning, I will clean everything up. And she's like, I can't do that. And so that's the piece we're like, and then I actually did talk to a couple of chefs and they're like, well, I clean up my pots and pans, but you got to clean up your own plates. like, I shouldn't be that many, but Esther wants everything clean. So that's what we're, that's anyway, that was as far as we got on the conversation. We're like, okay, we really want someone to clean our dishes after dinner.
00:26:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we don't want to do that. Then you just go systematically down the lines, trying to. figure out the best way to do it because there will be those types of people.
00:27:03 - Michael Fujinaka
So it could be a cleaning service.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Obviously, remember you want to have like compatible values sufficiently. So if the person is only coming in and doing the dishes every day, you might be able to get a college student. You just be really creative with it.
00:27:23 - Michael Fujinaka
You can look at cleaning services.

You might considering posting an ad on Craigslist, but be really specific so that the only kind of person that's going to reply to you, they're going to have to go through hoops. So for example, I'm doing this off the top of my head, but basically you want to say, these are the tasks that we're looking for. This is the time that we're looking for.
00:27:48 - Michael Fujinaka
This is the type of person we're looking for.
00:27:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Your cover leather needs to tell us why you're the rock star we're looking for. Use a different phrase, but you want to use a phrase that you don't draw too much attention to the fact that if that is missing, they don't get hired, you don't talk to them because it's going to be important to you that the person has attention to detail and that they communicate well because that's a type of value that you have. You're not going to want to repeat yourself. You're going to want to know that they have enough intelligence, you know, because there's a lot of nuance that comes with that. Why they want the job, why they think it's a good match for them. You know, tell them about your family dynamic. Hey, this is who we are. This is the type of work that we do. You don't want to give them personal information, right? These are the, this is our family dynamic. This is when we eat. This is when we want cleaning. If you're looking for additional cleaning work, we will be happy to make referrals, may have other work for you, that type of thing.
00:28:52 - Michael Fujinaka
You really want to be thorough about it.
00:28:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify and simultaneously disqualify because the two are not the same thing.
00:29:01 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I see, make them, make them, yeah, come through hoops, and then those very hoops can disqualify them.
00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And should, and should be trying to disqualify them, yeah.
00:29:11 - Michael Fujinaka
feel so like hope, not hope, I do. I feel kind of hopeless like about that search because I'm like, man, like it's such a short time that they, you know, I'm looking for, right? Like, I'm really just, we're just looking for help literally from like, you're, you're, you're overthinking it because you wouldn't do the job. Right. I wouldn't do the job. Yeah.
00:29:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I have to get someone has to drive over here. But yeah, but you're not trying to hire somebody that is like you. You're trying to hire somebody else. And also, so to that point where values come in, you have to do the math and make it reasonable for them. So you have to pay them enough for it to include their driving time and their gas because it's that valuable to you because of what it will unlock you. So you don't want to go be like, well, it's a 15. dollar an hour job or it's $20 an hour job period and the story. You want to go, what is it worth to you?
00:30:05 - Michael Fujinaka
What, you know what I mean?
00:30:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can pay somebody something they would never earn anywhere else doing that job because it's so valuable to you, which makes them loyal to you, which means you probably don't have to replace them soon, which means they're going to be happy every time they come to work because they're going to be like, I'm getting paid so much. I am so happy. I'm going to do the best job ever. Every time they come work for you and you're going to go, I never have to worry about them not showing up. They're always going to be in a good mood.
00:30:36 - Michael Fujinaka
They're going to do a good job because I'm paying them so much. I see. Okay. That's a really interesting way to reframe it. Like how much are we willing to pay and then start, know, or essentially go after that.
00:30:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I like that. So, yeah, because like if you, you would pay X amount of dollars for vitamin E supplement in a bottle. I'm just going to give you this word example. But if you were going to go, So get a new Tropic concoction. You'd probably pay, let's say you pay $10 or $5 for a bottle of vitamin E, but you probably wait $50, $60 for a bottle of new Tropics. Why? Because it's specialized to give you optimal function. Well, your dishwasher is not just a dishwasher. She's not a bottle of vitamin E. She's a bottle of new Tropics because she's optimizing your function.
00:31:29 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, giving extra or myself, you know, 45, 30 to 45 minutes back every day. At the time when we want to be spending time with Emi, yeah, I agree.
00:31:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So when you, the problem is just so many of us get into wanting to stop our money from bleeding and not put that out there, but it's really an investment in energy going back to prioritizing energy. So the other thing, though, I just thought of is that what you could do is hire your assistant first, train your assistant. one like I think I'm higher for you.
00:32:05 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, these are the rules of hiring. Don't mess it up. Bye. All right, that's interesting. Yeah, you see the personal assistant. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I gotta talk to like, I think I need to go. We need to go back there on the personal assistant, like square one, like what are the things that we want to get out of it? Yes. Because I'm pretty clear, actually, not that clear role. I mean, Esther and I need to be on the same page because we're going to be sharing this role. And what Esther talked about was like a lot of the things that she's picking up, Whole Foods trips, right? does Amazon return, she has to ship things, for family member post office, all those things are things that she was taking care of now that now they're going to start falling to me. I'm like, I don't want to do this. So, Okay, maybe I'm not sure how to tackle that but maybe just talk about the things we use use that person for around the house.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is where the time tracking is helpful and you can just go. So you can just kind of ball park it and and use last week and maybe do a little forecasting because this isn't always going to be like this right but what did what did the average day look like and and but also what did the average week look like because some tasks will happen every day and some tasks won't and so maybe you even wait another week or two which could be really exhausting but then you're much more informed before you hire the person and because you're so exhausted you'll have a better understanding of their value which means you're going to be less likely to sabotage it by penny pinching and being small minded. Okay, this is a massive lever at unlocking your energy. energy and your potential and really choosing to manage the most important resources, time and energy.
00:34:08 - Michael Fujinaka
Energy. Okay. I like how we're shifting the conversation to energy because I totally feel that like, like now that you keep, you know, you've talked about this the last couple of weeks, but yeah, like when I'm with it and I'm rested and I have energy, I mean, I get a lot of stuff done. And when I don't, like right now I have time, like I did have time today, but like I'm so tired. I don't have energy to be, I have like, I don't know if you remember that that's what we talked about last week.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I said of the currency, the main currencies that we work with, time, energy and money, you can have all the money in the world, all the time in the world, but you, if you have no energy, you can do nothing with them. I'm just like a potato, yes, which is why when you first said sleep, I latched onto it because I was immediately thinking energy, you were thinking sleep, you know, Oh, but I was I was like, okay, yes, because I always prioritize energy. So, but the other thing is that's another reason why you should be tracking the food, because 100% what to eat effects or energy, even if you're not being mindful of it. Oh, okay, I, it's interesting.
00:35:21 - Michael Fujinaka
Like, I don't know if it's correlation or causation, but I do notice that whenever I have like a heavy meat lunch, you know, like a hot dog or steak or something, I am tired after that meal. But when I have my fuel and I, you know, my protein shake, it's vegan, I try to get all vegans like that. But like, when I have my vegan protein shake for breakfast lunch, like, I just, it's just flat. I just keep going.
00:35:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's no like, it's metabolism. It's the workload of the metabolism. So I'll tell you something that was really weird. had no idea that this could happen, but I would. So COVID just wrecked my microbiome. I'm totally fix it now. But on that process, when I would eat blueberries or blackberries, any, well, any berries, but especially blueberries, I would get exhausted. And I'm like, there's no way, like I'm crazy.
00:36:14 - Michael Fujinaka
I can't really just can't really be happening.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But my, but I only change one thing at a time in my diet because I really had to fix things. So I knew it was, but I'm like, okay, maybe there's something else happening to me. Maybe it's time of day, so I looked it up and I was like, can any blueberries meet me tired? It can because it's full of antioxidants and antioxidants get to work scrubbing cells that can actually be exhausting to a very sick body because there's so much work to do that you're noticing that effort, the caloric deficit of just calories being the unit of energy, right, of going to work and working on things. once I'm more healed. They didn't have so much work to do. They just got to be digested and be used. My body was already being optimal. And so that I don't get sleepy eating blueberries or any other kind of berries ever again. But my point is is that everybody, every body BODY, like just not even make any way, operates differently, metabolizes differently. And so though I know I'm just reiterating it and saying a lot. But tracking that stuff and how you feel will be really good.
00:37:32 - Michael Fujinaka
I will do that. think if it's for dating gathering, I'm all about that. So I do believe that when I eat red meat or something that's like super fatty at lunch, I am exhausted for like an hour or two.
00:37:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you might find that either one, you just don't eat those at that's in the middle of the day. So you leave your protein loading if it's going to be meat or whatever, different times a day, or digest the sometimes might be able to help you like some protease so that you can digest the protein better and maybe more efficiently.
00:38:08 - Michael Fujinaka
Well, look at that.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's not a big supplement person, but yeah, good luck. Yeah, well, and timing. Like I said, there's always all options, you know, it doesn't have to be anything or you just be like, well, I'm going to have this big meat and I'm going be tired for a while. So I'm going to take a nap and you've got to strategically help you get some sleep and catch up on sleep.
00:38:31 - Michael Fujinaka
I like that. That one. I do that right now.
00:38:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's the whole point of data is, well, now that you see it, what are you going to do with it? So now that you're really thinking about the fact that it makes you sleepy every time and you already know that you suffer from just exhaustion and not getting enough sleep, if there is something that always makes you sleepy, guess what you can do.
00:38:58 - Michael Fujinaka
Use it. Thank you.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I see. Okay, so you had a hot dog the night before you got the best sleep.
00:39:05 - Michael Fujinaka
Did you know that?
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yeah, no, I didn't know that no So I looked at that because I was looking at your sleep journal. Hold on Go look at your journal. Um, you got a, uh, was it the Costco hot dog night? yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, and then Saturday night got really good sleep.
00:39:28 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, that's because Esther like at the five a.m. Feeding She felt bad for me.
00:39:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she let me miss it. So then I got to sleep on a bridge from like two But before you have the baby, you still weren't getting very much sleep.
00:39:40 - Michael Fujinaka
You weren't getting as much. You got that So I thought about that as well I had a hot dog and steak that day.
00:39:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think Well, so guess what test you should be running. It was a it was a good hot dog and a So the next night like on the nights that you know that you, um, Esther's you're not going to get up to help with the feeding this week. Try eating meat.
00:40:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh yeah, tonight we have we have pizza so let's try it.
00:40:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So look at your macros and just kind of compare the protein because I don't know what's on your pizza right compared to a steak versus a hot dog. I would choose cheese pepperoni but yeah yeah I don't think that you're going to get I mean probably like 20 grams of protein off at least just in that meal compared to ever looked well I read labels all the time so I would but yeah so I wouldn't expect that to be super helpful but anyway something to think about for the other other nights this week if you want to get the best quality sleep because you also got more deep sleep not just more sleep but more restful sleep. Okay um which probably was a correlation just to the amount of sleep it was hard to tell. But anyway, something to look into.
00:41:02 - Michael Fujinaka
That's what I'm saying.
00:41:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The whole point of the data is stuff jumps out. Okay, where was my notes? Okay, for hiring the assistant, so roughly tracking time throughout the day, the tasks that are getting done, what's that? Yeah, or even a notebook for Esther, but because there's two different things going on. So I want to look at it at a micro level for you for your business. Oh, right. For your assistant, all we need is just what are you guys doing? What are the assistant type tasks? So whatever the orders are that need to get placed, the grocery shopping, whatever jumps out at you. And so tell Esther, if you're doing this and you don't want to and you want the assistant to do it, write it down, write down how long it takes you. Same thing for you. only assistant related stuff that we're talking about for
00:42:00 - Michael Fujinaka
this. Okay.
00:42:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, at least we did this. you know, we did this exercise before each of the assistant hires.
00:42:07 - Michael Fujinaka
I'll pull up those notes if I can.
00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'd love to see those.
00:42:10 - Michael Fujinaka
And, uh, yeah, I don't, I'm not even sure how much we successfully offloaded. We should, but yeah, we should, I could use that as a starting point definitely.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And then remember that the, the other part of this success is how much you, you train and communicate before getting them going. And also, being able to get a gauge on how much they understand, how autonomous they're willing to be, because if they're going to ask you questions left and right all the way through, that's not helpful. But if they're going to ask you tons of questions in the beginning, and then they learn you, and then they use that to get the job done really well all the time after that, then that's actually wonderful. So, um, maybe doing a better job hiring. So any historical data that you have and how that went would be great. Everything's changed.
00:42:58 - Michael Fujinaka
Maybe a little bit now with the next
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're still, you know, the main kind of functions, the shopping, laundry, all that type of thing, although laundry loads probably have increased with a new baby. Um, yeah, so then what you do is you're going to want to kind of have an idea of how long all of those things take, but I really want you to rank the energy impact. So that when you're making the decision about who to hire, when you hire them, you want to make sure that they are the most qualified or there that your focus in terms of their skill correlates to the thing that has the greatest energy impact for you. So if shopping and doing a good job at shopping is the most important thing, meaning planning, inventory, taking stock of what's needed and keeping on top of that without you really having to think about it. If that's the thing that's the most tedious and draining during the week, then that's what you want to focus on in your conversation. Okay, that's a really good correlation there.
00:44:02 - Michael Fujinaka
It's not just getting the assistant to do stuff. It's, we want the stuff they do to positively affect my preservation of energy, so to speak.
00:44:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And optimize how positively it affects your energy at both of you, right?
00:44:20 - Michael Fujinaka
I like that. All right. I could, I could do that.
00:44:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can question can.
00:44:27 - Michael Fujinaka
We're just about done.
00:44:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so the other thing is, if you can hire that assistant. I really want you to focus on autonomy, meaning their ability to work autonomously, meaning do they communicate very thoroughly. And do they ask more questions than you do? When I get hired, almost always, I ask more questions than people that are, okay, I haven't been hired in forever. because I've been working like this for 22 years, but even in the beginning and even as a teenager, I ask more questions than the people hiring me. I ask my clients more questions when I'm doing sales calls and that's because I want to know what I'm getting into, but I also want to know that I can solve the problems and I want to know that I can be helpful and it always stands out. So you can look for that in someone. You have to learn how to craft the posting, the job posting, to get that and that all takes practice and whatnot, but really you want somebody who asks so many questions that you know they're going to get all the information they need and then they're going to run with it. That is the ideal kind of person for your family and I'll say your type of people being that you and Esther both are like I've got stuff to do. I don't want to be bogged out. with these things. You know? You want a person who's a leader of their own domain?
00:46:07 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, and definitely yeah. Yeah, I think this time we'll put more effort into training them and like you said, even before that, getting in the right hire, we didn't really do that with the second one. The first one we did take a lot of time to get the hire right, but then we didn't train well. And then the second one we didn't do either one. So yeah, a lot of improvements.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you? Would you once like I've got a I've got a crying child.
00:46:35 - Michael Fujinaka
Hold on. Oh, no. We're all we're good if you want to take off. Thank you so much. I will email you a wrap.
