00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Tina Marie: I know I saw that, but I wasn't sure if you took it anywhere from there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Tina Marie: Or if you had seen it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Dan: Hello!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000

Dan: Uh won't let me switch to Why won't we switch the speaker

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Dan: Good. Boom.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Tina Marie: Mom.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Dan: All right. Oh, now we're all

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Dan: Now we're all copathetic

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Tina Marie: Copacetic. That was not a word you hear very often

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Dan: The second.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Tina Marie: Actually, I bet you I probably heard it from less than 3 people ever

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Dan: Oh, really

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Tina Marie: Yes, and they're all nerds I think I'm funny.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Tina Marie: No, but in a good way, though smart like Very different than everybody else

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Tina Marie: Walk to the beat of their own drums. Yeah, it is not a common word.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Dan: No. No, not at all.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: The. Trina.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Tina Marie: I won't want my desktop to be snapped to grid show view options. Hold on a second You're not up to grid and automatically organized. So why can't I move this folder

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Dan: Thank you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Tina Marie: That's dumb It needed to be moved. Oh, sort by none. That's what it is. Okay.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Tina Marie: Um. But um. So what's new this week

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Dan: Uh So the they accepted all the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Dan: Terms, or whatever changes Of the Distro, flowing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Dan: Contract. Yesterday, so No no probably tomorrow.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Dan: Maybe today Uh got on the worksheets

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Dan: Over to Greg So that will finish the book for real Z

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Dan: Once. Once we add them to the book Um

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Dan: I've been working on a Modeling out this whole

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Dan: Catalog thing, like Signing that band, the oxymorons, or whatever that shit ain't gonna work

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Dan: So. It's like.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Dan: Sorry sean. Sorry guys, you know what would be cool. Not doing this

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Dan: Um it. It will not make money So I'm like, what's the point?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Tina Marie: What specifically

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Dan: Uh, but I gotta finish it. See how bad it is

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Tina Marie: For me.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Dan: So there's this. This idea of like

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Dan: I can't. Well, I don't think we ever really talked about this, but The original concept was

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Dan: Hey! There are the bands That have a catalog. All their songs

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Dan: Right, and then The I'll give you the the sort of I think this is sort of where the genesis of it came from.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Dan: Is there a band? There's a band called Taproot.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Dan: Um And they are on. I'm gonna say, Atlantic records, I forget who

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Dan: And Atlantic records is like Yeah, we don't give a shit about you.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Dan: We're never gonna give you another dime You could do whatever the hell you want.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Dan: Um. So I think There they will not be released from the label, but then the label also will not

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Dan: Support them, essentially And so that band's like stuck in limbo. But they get

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Dan: So, and they own nothing. Right. So the label owns the entire. Their entire catalog

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Dan: So if they get 1 million streams on spotify. They get $0

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Dan: And So the only way they can make money is to play live shows which they get nothing of sell merch whatever

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Dan: I don't even think they're releasing songs, probably because they're still on the label. I might be wrong about that. So they're kind of stuck

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Dan: So either they're releasing. They're not releasing songs because they're stuck in the label, or they're not releasing songs because they can't afford to play pay for the practice whatever. There's a reason So.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Dan: Oh! You could go in and buy

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Dan: Ah! Catalog from Atlantic Say, Hey, I want to buy this

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Dan: Offer you. I'll give you XYZ And then you would go to the band and say, Okay.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Dan: I now own it. Fan Chloe, mom, whatever you want to call it. And

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Dan: Now we're going to put out. We're gonna I'm gonna this is the deal You're gonna

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Dan: Earn from your catalog. Now And we're going to start putting out new music

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Dan: And we're going to start promoting your old catalog building a fan list like, do the whole thing So.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Dan: In that respect. That catalog

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Dan: Is. Currently

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Dan: A Cash Flowing Asset It's getting, however, many streams a month on spotify, and that is equaling dollars

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Dan: So there's a value to that asset that you can kind of figure out And then there's a value in

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Dan: Well, what happens if I purposefully tried to grow this asset right now? Nobody's marketing it right? So it's a distressed asset So almost like private equity. You come in and say

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Dan: Hey? I'm gonna buy this thing, and I'm going to put the shit that I'm good at behind it, because I know it's gonna make more money And then in a private equity scenario, you'd be like, and I'm selling this in 7 years. Right? They come in, fix, grow, sell.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Dan: Here you come in Oh, sorry, acquire, fix, grow, cell.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Dan: Here you come in, you say, acquire, fix, grow, stay. So you're like, you just keep supporting this band

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Dan: In, you know, in perpetuity, but The music pays off forever. Right? Unlike private equity. It's like, yeah, that business

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Dan: Doesn't have a lifetime of forever But this music.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Dan: Does right, or it has a much more Ah, certainly a longer life!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Dan: Than 7 years So.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Dan: Haprood wanted us to buy their catalog right? They want to do this. They want So Mark was like Oh, well.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Dan: I was like, all right, whatever. But nobody modeled that out, I'm like, well, what what do you buy it for? So, then

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Dan: Sean ended up in a situation where his label came to him, and they said, Hey, yeah. We don't want you guys anymore.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Dan: Um, we're not going to support you We do not want to pay for any more music. Your your deal with us is up

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Dan: PS, We own a hundred percent of your catalog because you sold it to us

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Dan: So that then Sean found himself in a Similar situation except those guys are touring

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Dan: They do put out. They want to put out music, whatever So.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Dan: Sean needed to By his catalog

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Dan: Or want wanted to And this is months ago

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Dan: So one morning, like I was laying in bed, and I was like he was texting me

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Dan: And I started devising like, well, how would you, you know, value this like you There's a fixed rate that you get for a song stream. It's like point 0 0 4. It's like super ridiculously low

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Dan: So anyway, I came up with a formula, and then I factored in like Well, you can't say that that's true, because spotify, if spotify is the leading thing right now.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Dan: And they're leading I I think they have 30, something percent of the market. But they're so they're the market leader. But

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Dan: They drive most of the revenue And it's like, Yeah, but that's not gonna be true forever.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Dan: So I need to depreciate What revenue would come from that

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Dan: So I came up with an idea around that, and I like depreciated the payouts of Times.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Dan: So anyway, I ended up with a number Of

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Dan: And then I, and then I have Put some variable on it right? So like uh

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Dan: I forget, like a 2 x or a 4 x. And and I, you know Justify that. So I forget somehow. And anyway, the number I came up with, I think, was like 200 grand

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Dan: I was like, yeah dude, this shit's legitimately worth 200 grand You should go, offer them 200 grand as an owner. Finance deal

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Dan: And Sean was like, what's that I was like? Just tell him you'll give him like 50 grand, 40 grand down Then you'll pay the rest over X period of time. But you start collecting all the revenue immediately. So you're gonna basically pay them off with the revenue that already exists

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Dan: And I don't I don't think he really

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Dan: Picked up what I was laying down to be honest, and I Be also honest, like I didn't really fucking care. I was like, this is what I get

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Dan: I gave him. The this is what I would do. I would do this So.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Dan: He ended up taking all that To them, and he changed the number to 1, 60,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Dan: And they said, Yes. And then

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Dan: I don't know why he did this. I wasn't involved Ah! Then he went out. Guess

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Dan: You know, they didn't have a hundred 60 grand, obviously So he went to a 3rd party and said, Hey.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Dan: I've got this deal over here If you give me 1 60, I can buy the whole catalog

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Dan: Um What do you want for that

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Dan: Basically Um

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Dan: So or no, he's. He went to them and said. Basically he sold 50%

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Dan: Of the catalog, which was worth 200 in my estimation, or 200, as it's at right now, right whatever

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Dan: He sold 50% of the catalog for I think he might have sold it for 200 grand, but forever

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Dan: So he basically

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Dan: Yeah. So I I think that's what he did. He sold 200 grand of 50% forever. They gave him the 200 grand

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: Of his.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Dan: Yeah of his

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Tina Marie: That's Lansdowne right

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Dan: Or there, or this is but this is Yeah, this is about to go down. It may be done already.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Dan: Yeah, Lansdowne. So he gets 200 grand. He goes, buys at 160. They pocket 40

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Dan: And now I mean, whereas it stands right now, Lansdowne, same thing. They don't make any money But they'd instantly start making. I think, his. I think his

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Dan: Catalog does 4 grand a month So the band will instantly start making 2 grand a month. Their plan is to plow

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Dan: The 2 grand back into marketing. And grow the catalog

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Dan: And then Going forward.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Dan: They own everything. But he's also

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Dan: Trying to do a deal with another company which I don't understand. This, either. And I didn't know you could do this

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Dan: So it's almost like a label, in a way. It's less onerous than a label. Right? A label gets, you know, the whales amount 80, 20, right?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Dan: He's selling the futures Of Lansdowne.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Dan: Hey? With the next song we release you get 50% So he's selling the futures. I don't know if it's the next 10 songs, the next 20, the next everything

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Dan: But he has another deal going 50% of futures

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Dan: And it's like a couple It's like a hundred grand or more

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Dan: So I was like, Oh, okay, but none of those deals make sense to me. I'm like Bro. You should have just sold me, I would have sold me 10% of Lansdowne forever.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Dan: For 160 grand And I would have bought it

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Tina Marie: And did tell him that. What did he say

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Dan: Goodbye! I think I did, I think. Well, I didn't say me, but I was like, you know, you could do it like this.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Dan: I did the math like it was a 15% return What I had figured out was like

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Dan: For it to be interesting to any investor It would need to be between 15 and 20, because it's a 2015 to 20% return

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Dan: Because it's just such a. It's such a weird sort of niche thing, and you gotta beat the market. But whatever So.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Dan: Anyway. I am not so. Then what happened was that

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Dan: This. Low level band appeared.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Dan: They met them on the the ship cruise thing that Sean and those guys played at It's this band called oxymorons.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Dan: And they're like, Come, they're like up and coming They're, you know. They're they're not huge on spotify by any means. But

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Dan: They! They! We're on this

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Dan: Tour thing on the boat And they met Sean and Mark and them. And then those guys were talking about Fan Flowy

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Dan: And these dudes were all into it. They were like, Oh, my God! This sounds amazing like we need that But they were also like

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Dan: Talking to labels. And they're like, we don't really want to sign with the label because they'd already signed with the label, I guess at some point. So they didn't want to sign with the label

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Dan: So then Sean and Mark were like we can do the catalog thing with them. Except they don't have a catalog, so we'll just buy into their current

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Dan: The current streams that they have And then I they have an unreleased album. So they have a whole album that's in the can

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Dan: So you would get that you'd get your percent of royalties on that Yada! Yada yada

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Dan: You know what would be cool I was like, Uh-huh.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Dan: So. They're like pressuring me now. It will only be 15 grand and

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Dan: But I'm like modeling it out based on their current So then I was like, though. So then Sean modeled it out, and I was like dude. These are all just guesses.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Dan: I'm like. You're just guessing. These these numbers aren't real

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Dan: Um And then I realized yesterday or 2 days ago, whatever

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Dan: One of the bands that we work with Presently called anaria

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Dan: They've been on the platform like from very early on And it's like

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Dan: Pre-launch they were around So those guys have been running ads and stuff for them since December of 23

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Dan: And the software Actually, they were using lead flowy. So we 1st started building this out on Lead Flowy. So those guys were on lead. Flowy

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Dan: Quote unquote fan, fluey. Like, then

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Dan: And then. So we've been running ads for them. And then they're they've been like, they really. I gotta hand it to them. They've really adopted, like all of it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Dan: Hey? We're releasing songs consistently. Hey, we're going to use all these fan promotions, hey? We're going to run ads to build the fan list And then

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Dan: Mark has been tracking data associated with them. And I realized, oh, wait a minute.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Dan: If I just treat them as if They were that thing.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dan: What does the math look like Let me sum it up for you.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Dan: Horrible! That's what the map looks like. It's like you would never make any money

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Dan: You make more money being their coach than you do, being their Partner, or whatever the hell you want to call it.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Tina Marie: Uh Of the of the musicians.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Dan: Yeah. So like there, if you were to be like, if we were to have signed them And invested money and time

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Dan: Into the ad like. So instead of them paying for ad management, we were doing it as part of being the label for lack of a better term Um! And then we were getting

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Dan: 50% of their stream revenue You'd lose money

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Dan: You'd lose a lot Those guys don't

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Dan: Believe that I was like well. I'm not the one saying it.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Dan: Or I'm not going to be the one saying it. Once I finish the spreadsheet So.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Dan: I just don't think So I'm trying to come up with like an intake

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Dan: So the early intake is, hey? If a band has less than X amount of streams per month. It's just a no-go

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Dan: Like you could get them on the platform. Get them working Show them a good time, and then if they catch fire like they're gonna be, you know, they're gonna feel indebted to you

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Dan: And you're gonna have helped them get to that next level. Then you approach them with that deal. But There's no point in like

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Dan: The oxymoron guys get like 3,000 streams a month or something. I'm like, it's just too upside down

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Dan: Also Well, yeah. And my argument to them is

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Dan: I'd rather go fucking. Sell 3 people on fanflowy Period.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Dan: Like.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Tina Marie: Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Dan: Cause. Yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Dan: I'd rather spend time generating leads

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, they're still in the shiny object phase, and also feeling like they've got to Hustle and make money a particular way, which is

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Tina Marie: Making the music. But it's not really

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Tina Marie: The most. The easiest way to make the money

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Dan: It ties more into the The big, the you know, the

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Dan: We want to be a Global name. I was like.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Dan: But you don't know how to do that.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Tina Marie: Sounds good

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Dan: You don't know how to do that. You think this is the way to do it. I'm telling you it's not

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Tina Marie: That really is still their focus

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Dan: I mean they said it 3 years ago. I don't. I doubt it It's changed.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so you you well, I I would say

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Tina Marie: 3 years ago. If I asked you any of you, what was your main goal? That's what it is. Do you still feel like that? Is now And before you answer

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Dan: What's my their main goal or mine?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Tina Marie: Reevaluate. There's

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Dan: Yeah, I think. Think, that

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Tina Marie: And tell them before you answer, ask.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Dan: It's it's let's put it this way. It's marks

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Tina Marie: No, it was Sean's. It was Jim's I don't know if it was no reason

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Dan: No, I know, but I think Mark is like the one that you know. Really

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh! I get. I

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Dan: Like I think

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Tina Marie: It was theirs, because it was Mark's is what you're saying.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Dan: Yes. I mean I think they but all

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Dan: Except Johnny. I think

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Dan: And he's really. I mean. I think Johnny's just along for the ride to a degree, but

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Dan: Yeah, I think that they it's just it's the ultimate, you know, what would be cool. And I'm like, no, I mean, yeah, it would be cool. I'm not disagreeing with you, but Would it be cool at the

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Dan: Expensive. Not making any money.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Dan: It's like. But I think they think that those things go hand in hand. I'm like they really don't

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Tina Marie: You know what is cool, is having regular money coming in that allows you the freedom to live your life and do whatever you want to Including the cool things. But you don't have to

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Tina Marie: That's cool

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Dan: Well. And if you build this other thing I'm convinced

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Dan: I mean, I literally like feel it in my bones. So I'm like, I know I'm not wrong

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Dan: If you build this other thing, those things. Will happen. There will just be a natural extension of it, except they'll happen in the right way.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Dan: Doing it early, just because you can Almost guarantees. It happens

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Dan: The wrong way And I'm like we just. It's just a distraction like

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Dan: It's too early. I'd rather get a thousand people on fanflow, because then what happens when You don't have

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Dan: I mean, I know what happens When you don't have this worry about making money

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Dan: And having to hustle. And this space opens up And then

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Dan: You know, they're all so different, and then they can all just sort of Be in their, you know the proverbial zone of genius

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Dan: Only good things can happen from that. But when when you're just trying to hustle and make money like you're not working at your most optimal Blah blah, and then they can all start like injecting methylene blue, and it'll be great

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tina Marie: Um Alrighty, then

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Tina Marie: So. You finished the book you were making some modifications last week working on the worksheets. How did that come about?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Dan: So they're all defined and Text, or at least the

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Dan: Current draft of the texts Are done. I think there were 5. I sent them all to Greg yesterday.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Dan: One was kind of already done. Or actually

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Dan: To. 2 came one. So I was like, Hey, I think you can just blend those 2 together.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Dan: Then there's going to be like an extra one that I decided we're not going to do, I said. Just keep that Keep that in the figma

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Dan: So then he has to basically design or build whatever both. Um 4,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Dan: So I sent those to him last night, and then Him, and I did like the

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Dan: Solution map already. So that's done so. The back of the book will be The solution map

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Dan: In like 5 5 worksheets And then the worksheets are directly tied to onboarding like I talked about last week, so

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Dan: It's like one. Is your royalty checklist? So it'll be like, hey? When we do the royalty call. Make sure you have this filled out But also, if you're not a coaching client.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Dan: Here's your checklist. You should do all the things on this checklist

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Tina Marie: Ah! I like that

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Tina Marie: A lot. Do you have it? Can we look at it? I'm just curious. It's not

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Dan: There you go! No.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Tina Marie: Important.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Dan: No. No, it's not. It's not done

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Dan: I just sent him a bunch of text

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: Hold on. I gotta go back to My notes.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Tina Marie: Nope, that's not right. Second.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Tina Marie: Product. This? Is it

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Tina Marie: No. Um

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so that's with that. Oh, anything with There's a few things that I want to ask about. So

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Tina Marie: I kind of also want to ask about

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Dan: Uh

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Tina Marie: David, like I'm trying to remember the conversation That you were having with him last. I'm just curious like that evolution

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Tina Marie: Um I was working on. By the way.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Tina Marie: So. Ah, this is so annoying! What do you call it? Chat, gpt.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Tina Marie: I think we talked about this last week, but like it goes in cycles of Retardation basically

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Tina Marie: And it's in one of those, and it's driving me. I'm like, Are you drunk? What the hell is wrong with you? So like I'm having conversation with it, and it's pulling in

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Dan: It's driving.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Tina Marie: Stuff from other conversations.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, totally. That had to be. I was like, why.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Tina Marie: Not Yeah.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Dan: I didn't say that

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Tina Marie: Right. I mean, we're not even talking about that right now.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Dan: It.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Dan: It kept using a word like it wasn't even a word But it kept inserting this non-word

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Dan: At like the end of a sentence, and I'm like, What is that? Why do you keep doing that? And it's like, Oh, my! I'm sorry. That's from our blah blah conversation I got confused. I got mixed up and I go. Yeah, but that's not a word It was so weird.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So it's been drunk this week

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Dan: Didn't have an answer for that

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tina Marie: Um. So I cause I it's weird, though. So one thing it actually did really good today was actually tell me

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Tina Marie: Um You misunderstand that you shouldn't be focusing on that. You should do this

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Tina Marie: Because normally what it does is kiss ass. I'm like that's not useful to me. I I don't need you to do that. I don't want you to do that.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Dan: Mhm. I think

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Tina Marie: Um! You're here to help me think better not to tell me how great I am

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Dan: Right.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Tina Marie: So it it did that today. And I was like, that's awesome. And then everything was downhill from there. I'm like that was completely retarded.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Dan: I hate that Okay.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Tina Marie: So. Claude

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: I finally came out with their upgrade of like, Hey, uh! We heard you. You're running into limitations. Here's the upgrade option. I'm like, alright. We'll see Get. The upgrade was working in a project. The project was, let's

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Tina Marie: You know. Put these client stuff altogether right and Work with this data better

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Tina Marie: Um. So there's 2, 3 ways. Anyway, I'll get to the other thing. I don't want to get off track, but Uh, so upgraded, and immediately limitation, limitation, limitation at the same exact thing when it was supposed to be 20 times longer. So I don't know if it's supposed to. It's not conversation specific like, where the hell is this extra

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: Or you know what I wonder is if I need to just Quit

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Tina Marie: And then Try it again or update it, or something. But either way, that was an issue

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Tina Marie: But the other thing, and the original plan was Build it through like

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: Pine cone, and Um taking advantage of Mcp with with

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tina Marie: The programming And custom doing that, but

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Tina Marie: As great. As everything is

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Tina Marie: Size limitations and continuity across Large amounts of data is

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Tina Marie: The hard thing And it just takes

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Tina Marie: A lot of time But

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Tina Marie: As I do like, get into it and be like Oh, well.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Tina Marie: What if we go this way? And it's mostly because I get annoyed because it it will do something stupid And I'm like your stupidity annoys me, and I can't fire you, and I can't threaten you, and I can't go hire somebody else

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Anyway, it's annoying, but

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Dan: I know.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Tina Marie: But I would say that of the tools right now. My favorite way to organize this probably will be clawed even with the limitations, because of The artifacts. So you remember that one website like that put together for Band flowy, just kind of doing some calculations with it.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Dan: Yep.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Tina Marie: I think that like creating a a client tracker with that same kind of thing, and then it'll probably just, you know. Take a few hours, is all Which is nothing. Really. Consider the visual that I'll get out of it

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Tina Marie: And the tracking that I can do. But Chat gpt can't do that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Tina Marie: I don't want to touch anything, Elon. The dude has data from the ground and data from the sky like I know I don't mean anything, but I definitely like just don't want to participate in it at all. You know what I mean.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Tina Marie: Like I just. I don't want to vote

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Dan: My favorite. It's my favorite. Sorry it's so good

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Tina Marie: Is he?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Dan: It's so good

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Tina Marie: What is? Oh, Grock!

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Dan: Yeah. So good it's it's the best one

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Dan: Period. Like I give it a spreadsheet. And I'm like son of a bitch. This thing actually works

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Tina Marie: What? So what did you use it for? Cause I nobody else is talking about it, so I don't know

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Dan: This. I'm

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Dan: So I Talk to it about building the model. So I talked to it about um.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Dan: I have like multiple threads going, but One of them was about

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Dan: So you would have with Mom. You would have

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Dan: For sure, 2 entities. I think

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Dan: So one entity would be all the software distro flowey, fan, flowy Follower flight whatever all those

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Dan: And then to protect it from the liability of potentially doing a label thing right? So on the label side, you have the you have, like the tap root that one can work like that. PPE. Style catalog can work because

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Dan: It's a cash flowing asset, and you can actually do the math on how it should be acquired. And you can project out what it's gonna make But if it's if it's making

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Dan: Sub $1,000 like Anaria. And these other guys like it does work So.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Dan: I had a I designed like 3 different

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Dan: Funds for lack of a better term One was like this.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Dan: Sort of legacy thing which would be a taproot Another one would be something more like Sean's

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Dan: Which is, I forget I have a name for that. And then the 3rd one was this idea. It's like a cow A list fund. So it's like, Oh, yeah, they're, you know, they're catch fire. But that's the one that I don't think is gonna work, but I've been using Grok to be like, hey? What would

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Dan: What would I want to track What would I want to know?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Dan: Doing this like While I'm doing it before, like

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Dan: I think I started out saying, How would I intake a band based on this idea? Okay, I want to look at and using spotify as like the main source. And then we'll just

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Dan: We'll just Project out what we think.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Dan: It makes from apple or whatever based on their market share So it's like, all right, you want to track this, this, this, this, this and this

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Dan: And so this is over. The course of days I fed it.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Dan: Tracking data that Mark had that I didn't know about. I was like, Okay, we're tracking this. And it's like, Oh, yeah, that's all good, and you want you want to do this. You want to do that And then at the end I said, All right, I want you to give me a spreadsheet

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Dan: Based on what you're talking about. And then I'm gonna go fill it in And it was like, Okay, here you go. Here's the Csv, and I was like, put dummy data in it. So I know what I'm doing.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Dan: It's like, Here you go! So I've been filling that in

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Dan: And I was like God damn! This is gonna work.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Dan: I'm gonna have to take it back in, because now I'm looking at it. But it was like I couldn't even A I didn't want to sit there and start building all the call right, trying to figure it out. I was like, I just I need like a

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Dan: An 80% start. So it gave me like an 80% start. I was like, all right. And then when I got in there, I'd start moving columns around. And I was like, Okay, yeah, yeah. Alright, I'm seeing it. And then I'm like, Okay, I'd add a column here and

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Dan: All right. This is, I think this is gonna work, or it's gonna get me Closer. And then I realized

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Dan: Today, I was like, Oh, I'll bet we can project out in the future now what the streams would be Because I've got

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Dan: Uh, like a year's worth of data, which is not enough But I'm like, Okay, but

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Dan: Quarterly. I'm like, okay, if I look at the Quarterly, at growth of streams, and I and I'm like tracking where we did promotions and what promotions they were And then I

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Dan: Also realized which. I will go back to it with that You really

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Dan: Should not use. The I don't think

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Dan: You should not use the total streams, which is what we're using right now. So you're looking at the monthly total streams which yes, that times point 0 0 4 is the revenue

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Dan: But We.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Dan: Are operating from a singles. Perspective So I would want to see we're never promoting the catalog

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Dan: We're promoting a song So it's like.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Dan: Okay, I need to be tracking every song by stream and then rolling that up into the total, like the total is comprised of 60 songs, or whatever

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Dan: And then, when a song comes out. I'm promoting that song

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Dan: So I need to know what happens when I promote that specific song And then, yeah, I know that goes towards the total. But

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Dan: What? What's happening with that song And then

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Dan: How does that song affect other songs in the catalog So when I start juicing that song, do we see another song? Other songs start picking up

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Dan: I know the answer is, yes, but I can't see it. But I'd be able to in the future

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Dan: So it's building like a model. And then Sadly. It's like software I was like, Oh, we nobody's doing this. I'm like we

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Dan: We need to probably build this thing

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Tina Marie: Ah, yeah. So what would it take to do that?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Dan: I've been talking to the spotify developer. What would take is the model like, build the model So this is the data that we need. Okay, great, how do we get? How do we get that piece? That piece? That piece, that piece

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Dan: It looks pretty straightforward. It would just be Um

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Dan: Hmm. Data

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Tina Marie: Did other Oh, I think you like cut out for a second. You said it would just be

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Dan: So. There is a

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Dan: 3, rd

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Tina Marie: And then You were gone.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Dan: Uh? What With spotify. You cannot pull old data

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Dan: Which is. Bizarre.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Dan: But they don't let you do it via their Api. So if you wanted The streams for a song.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Dan: If you wanted the data that I'm talking about You would have to start tracking it like right now.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Dan: Today And forward!

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Dan: So. In order to backfill the data

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Dan: You can go to. There's a 3rd party company called Chart Chart, metric or chart metrics.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Dan: And depending on The band.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Dan: And They may or may not have that data

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Tina Marie: Did you just cut out again

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Dan: They may or may not have it, for all the songs I don't know what to tell you. I'm not even fucking, moving

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Dan: Um So I'm not sure you can go backwards

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Dan: To the degree that you would need to But you can always go forwards.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Dan: So it's like, Okay, so I don't know. I don't know I think I think it's possible, but I don't know yet, so if I can build the model

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Dan: Then maybe

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Tina Marie: Um Oh!

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Tina Marie: Like. What level of interest do you have in that

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Dan: So it would It would

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Dan: Answer the question on whether or not I mean I'm doing it So.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Dan: It would answer in theory. When I build this It becomes.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Dan: Sort of which was my whole goal. I'm going to build it around a band that we are not working with, but they fit all the pieces

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Dan: So then, if I then zeroed this thing out and said, Okay, now, this is about Tina, band

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Dan: And I go populate with Tina Band's data To me. It's like an intake thing. So

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Dan: The next band, I would do it with Would be with Lansdowne

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Dan: Because I have all, or one of the other bands that we're close to Um

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Dan: So, if If you

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Dan: Or taproot if we could get their data. But, Lansdowne, we can get So then I if I stuck in Lansdowne and I said, Okay, well, I know Lansdowne

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Dan: It just sold for whatever. But I also know I put a $200,000 Price tag on it? What would be the deal that we would do with them? How much money would we spend on it? How much money we spend on promotion like I could model out acquiring Lansdowne

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Dan: And then I think Then you come to the deal right? So the deal that Sean

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Dan: You know Sean did 50, 50, I would hope 50 50 works.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Dan: Right. Like 50 50 doesn't work.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Dan: You know, I think, part of the goal At least in my mind is, you don't want to be onerous like you don't want to be like a label

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Dan: Well, if you don't want to be like a label, 50, 50 sounds less labely Than 80, 20,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Dan: And then it's like Okay. If it doesn't work at 50 50, maybe this just isn't possible.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Dan: To do, you know, or or if if it has to go 60, 40, and you want to be Artist friendly, and give them more

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Dan: Can you do that? Yes or no.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Dan: So. It'll just be a matter of like the data is going to tell you. I do think it will work with these higher level

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Dan: Catalogs. I don't think it will ever work

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Dan: With the band banned like an oxymorons. So, then

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Dan: The deal with the oxymorons becomes more label like Meaning. It has to start at 80, 20,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Dan: And then it can shift over time Or

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Dan: Like a label back in the day you're saying Hey? I'm gonna lay out this money

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Dan: And I need to recoup it all Like.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Dan: It, it suddenly becomes more like a label, except you can Design it over time, where you're giving up shares

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Dan: Back to the band so that they stay, and something like that Would be, you know. I don't know

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Tina Marie: Say that last sentence one more time. Please.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Dan: It's so that that, like you might have to start out with Where it skews towards

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Dan: The employer mom heavier in order to make it work But then over time, you're shifting the percentages. So you're

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Dan: Okay? And then in year 3, you you get 10% back in year 4. So then in year 7 or 8 It's 50, 50,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Dan: So it has to start With

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Dan: Or or we have to know, hey? No, we're gonna go 40, grand in the Hole

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Dan: But it's gonna come back this year. If this deals um like Sean, had it 4 years, it'll never work. 4 years But if we put a 10 year horizon on it.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Dan: You say, okay, if we do it at this, and it's a 10 year deal Provided spotify doesn't go out of business right? That's sort of one of the calculations you have to make. Then it works. So then it's like, Okay, well, that's fine, like you

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Dan: Sunk cost Makes it up in 10 years. Great, but sunk cost trying to get whole again in 4 years.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Dan: Probably is never going to work on that type of deal So.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Dan: We'll see

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Tina Marie: Uh, could you build like a really simple, simple. Kind of

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Tina Marie: Calculator with the formula that I mean, you're not going to know certain things. But you you could probably identify specific types of patterns that you know, within a set parameter of

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Tina Marie: Possibility versus probability. And you know, those guys, especially Need to understand the difference between the 2 right

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: Just because something's possible doesn't mean it's probable Um

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Tina Marie: And and we probably have enough information to At least say that, like it's super improbable that this is going to be profitable within a year. 2, 3, 4, 5 whatever you know what I mean. Like

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Tina Marie: What are the parameters where you could create a formula To at least immediately. Go absolutely not, or

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Tina Marie: This is potentially something that we could work with. Here's why

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Dan: When this spreadsheet is done, I will have that So it's like.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Dan: Other reception was like, Oh, if they work with us, we'll increase it. 10%. I'm like, based on what Like, what are you talking about like

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Dan: Yeah, that sounds great. But is that true? And if it's not true. Then what? And then it's 10% enough

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Dan: Do we? How do you even know So his math was like kind of all over the place. It was like Rose, it was super rosy, and it was not very detailed, and whereas you know me, I'm like

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Dan: My sheets already like way too long. And I'm like it's gonna get even longer But

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Dan: Mine will be. Correct.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Dan: And it's just gonna it's gonna tell So, for instance, Anaria, for all intent

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Dan: They've They? They're paying for coaching every month

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Dan: They are this deal Except

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Dan: We didn't sign them to a deal But they're investing the money in themselves.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Dan: Using all the strategies that we're telling that we would use on an artist that we signed So what happened?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Dan: Did they get 10% growth, yes or no? Well, then, how can we say someone else is going to get it when they're doing the exact same thing? They're doing what we tell them to do. They're doing the thing

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Dan: And does the thing make money? Does the thing create 10%? Does the thing create fans And I'm telling you the answer is, No.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Dan: Like. But on on that level band

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Dan: For sure. Bigger level band, different story.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Dan: So I think that's that. But that was my thing. It's like But there's a

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Dan: It. It'll tell me the avatar of these funds. It's like, Okay. You know, like Sean's 300,000 streams a month

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Dan: So is he that middle tier And if he is.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Dan: I build the model and say, Okay, well, then, this is this is the deal you would do with a band like that. Our tap root, this even higher level. They're

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Dan: They're 4 times as big as Lansdowne Okay, great. Let's plug in their numbers.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Dan: Or maybe they're, you know. I don't know

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Dan: At the at the end of the day. I don't know until I know

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Dan: And then there's the idea of like The the super low end idea which I've

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Dan: I'm like, this idea probably actually works better Is you go find the person on Tiktok that's got their acoustic in the bedroom

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Dan: And they got 100,000 views. And you say, hey, I'll pay 1,500 bucks to make that song with you. Put you on fanflowy. Release it, and I get 50% for life.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Dan: Like that probably would work better So that's like, that's like the total Vc move

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Dan: So you're like, I'm just gonna go Drop a thousand 1,500 bucks on these people over and over and over and over again.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Dan: Until I Find unicorns

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Tina Marie: I'm just visualizing unicorns

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Sorry.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Tina Marie: Huh! Another, 71

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Tina Marie: You guys just got What do you call it? Releases score releases right?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Dan: It's happening right now.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tina Marie: Right? Okay, how long does that go on

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Dan: It's typically 3 days

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I thought that was last week, though.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Dan: Nope. The yesterday.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Dan: Well. It's officially yesterday's, but it actually starts the day before, like

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Dan: Because of time zones, or whatever. So technically, price started Tuesday for as far as People were getting scores early

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Dan: But the bulk of them Came out yesterday.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Dan: And then today. So it's usually like, you know, it's like 3 to 4 days.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Dan: But the The big day would be yesterday

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Tina Marie: So. Um

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all. When will you know how to compare it to previous score releases

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Dan: Um What do you mean?

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Dan: I mean, we we have We have all that

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Dan: So we track Weekly sales.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Dan: All the way back to 2,018. So every on Monday We'll have a chart, or we have a chart that goes back to 2,018. It's not updated, so Bobby will send all, he'll commit all the updates on Saturday. Probably

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Dan: And then On Monday, when we get on the call he sends out

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Dan: He sends out the same thing every Monday And it's like

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Dan: Leads from last week sales from last week Upgrades from last everything from last week

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Dan: And then there's a comparative Quarterly that shows every quarter going back

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Dan: 6 years. So you can see like, oh, in this quarter. And last year we were doing 40 sales, 22 sales a day this quarter. This year. We're doing this way last week. We did exactly, you know.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Dan: This many sales per day. The week prior. It was So you can see like

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Dan: Okay, this is how it changed from week to week. This is how it changed from month to month. This is how it changed year over year And then at the bottom of that

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Dan: Text. Or or

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Dan: Chat, whatever Is.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Dan: He takes a screenshot of this Turn it.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Tina Marie: Dude. You keep cutting out for chunks of time

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Dan: And it shows sales and cancellation. It's a gigantic What we'll see on Monday is a gigantic green spike

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Dan: Of sales, and then you just go You look left, and you can see it. It's so interesting you can see every other score release forever.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Dan: And that's how you compare

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So um

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Dan: So this score release.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Dan: Should be. Bigger, I would say

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Dan: Because It's

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Dan: The first, st No, it's the center already, just

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Dan: Purely based on the customer base is larger But it's like

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Dan: Score releases. Don't Factor into the model. Really, I mean, we just know that they happen

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Dan: Um And it's like it's still just about the daily

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Dan: Customers. The daily subscribers like that's the number that That's the primary

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Dan: Kpi And then you just know, when score release comes, that you'll you're gonna get some crazy amount of sales. But

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Dan: We don't Promote score, release, or anything like that

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Dan: I guess we do send emails, but nothing crazy.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Tina Marie: Um so With with Mark and the whale stuff

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Tina Marie: He! Whatever. He's gonna be busy this whole weekend. He's at a brain something conference

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Tina Marie: And he didn't ask. Answer the question that I asked, which is, what did you get out of this last year? Because it's like 4 days He's like

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Tina Marie: I'm here for the nuggets But basically, it's a bunch of inflated egos and all these things that he doesn't like. And I'm like, Okay, what could you quantify quantifiably say that you got out of it last year. That was worth even going

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Dan: Is it It's like a brain injury.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Dan: Thing.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Tina Marie: I don't know something brain related about the brain I don't know

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Dan: But like your brain. Like to make you smarter, or is it attorneys and brains? If it's

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Tina Marie: No, yeah. I think I

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Dan: Attorneys and brains. It's brain injury

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, probably.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Dan: Yeah, which is dumb. He doesn't need to go to that

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Dan: How many, how many brain injury clients does he get

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Tina Marie: Let me ask him this

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Dan: And if he does get one he he refers it out

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Brain injuries.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Tina Marie: Um related 2,

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Tina Marie: PI, Um

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay. See.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: Going back over notes from our stuff So for the um

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: Spotify alternative that you are working on

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Tina Marie: Is that live now like, where's that? At

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Dan: Wait, what 3? rd What

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Dan: No.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Tina Marie: So your spotify.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Dan: It's modifiable Alternative.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Tina Marie: Yes. You were going to build the spotify, app

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Dan: Oh! Uh

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Tina Marie: And it was declined

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Dan: No.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Tina Marie: You were working around that With white label, access. No

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Dan: No.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Dan: That it? It's not. It's a um That's the 1st thing I mentioned. It's not spotify. It's like Distro Kid or CD baby. It's a distribution white label, so that

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Dan: I'm probably gonna sign that tomorrow. So that we negotiated

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay. That was that

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Dan: Yeah, we negotiate points back and forth. They agreed to everything Basically, cause I'm 99%. Sure, they don't have a lawyer

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Tina Marie: Meaning that that's not gonna slow it down because they have to put it through. A lawyer

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Dan: Meaning. They sent over the contract thinking we're gonna sign it, and I sent it to

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Dan: Renault, or Warren Stacy's Sick, another who is a contract lawyer, and he went ham on it

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Dan: He was like He's like redlining all this shit I was like, Oh, God! And then we sent it back. And they're like, Oh, you guys like, okay, let me run it by the team

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Dan: So they, and then they sent it back. They accepted everything, all the changes and and Ran out was like this is actually isn't a bad contract.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Dan: But he pointed out a couple things and Help make some, some clarifications

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Dan: Then they sent it back And they had maybe 4 things. And then he changed those

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Dan: And uh, and then they had a software licensing agreement that I told Rena I was like, Hey, look! I've white labeled Shit before, and these are the issues

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Dan: So we ran those by them, and they're made assurances. And then we just memorialized those into the agreement. We're like, all right. This is what you said, so we put it in there And I sent that back on Tuesday, and then he came back yesterday and said, All right, we're good

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Dan: I was like, Okay. And I'm like they definitely are not running this by a lawyer, because their turnaround was way too fast.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Dan: Um But

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay, so.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Dan: It's a good contract

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Tina Marie: But but that's not the same thing as like the spotify thing cause? I thought that that's you had an alternative for that

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Dan: Oh, no, no! So we have No.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Dan: No, no, no, um. So we have our spotify app that I have not resubmitted, because I'm Like they're just going to deny us again. All the feedback I'm getting from other developers like you cannot get approved

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Dan: So I need to like strip it down to do next to nothing. And then, in the interim We set up an account with a 3rd party

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Dan: Provider, but it's not a white label. Um, actually, we haven't set that up. But we decided that on Monday I was like, Hey. I think we could just go use these guys

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Dan: For the one function So I actually actually might set that account up today. Um.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Dan: And then our spotify, app I don't know. I mean I'll maybe I'll work it. Um! I probably won't even work on it next week, but I'll get back to it

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Dan: And then Have.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Dan: Sod, strip it down to Just do a single thing. And I'm like, maybe we if we get approved for the single thing, I think we're good

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Tina Marie: You basically just trying to get your foot in the door of approval

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Dan: We don't need the other stuff Right. So it was like

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Dan: There! There's a there's another competitor. This might be where you're referring to

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Dan: There's this other competitor that I keep meaning to go like sign up for their thing and go through

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Dan: They do have all the functions that we have. So I'm like they got approved So.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Dan: Maybe if I look at their shit I can figure out what we're doing wrong. I mean, I figured

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Dan: I figured out one thing that we're doing wrong, that we just have to get rid of But those guys have some of the additional functionality that

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Dan: We are. Punching on that they were approved for

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Dan: So I'm like, maybe they have a disclaimer. I do honestly think it's like their pop up window is right And our pop-up window is wrong.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Dan: And spotify. Won't tell me what's wrong

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Dan: So I'll have to figure it out

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Ah! So

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Dan: Of course I don't remember the name of the company, so I need to find it again.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Yeah.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Tina Marie: I'm not even asleep. It's just stupid oxygen Um cause, you know everything's blooming allergies choke you

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Tina Marie: That kind of stuff

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Dan: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: Um Mark, you were talking about

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Tina Marie: How he used cold dms to fill his calendar Like you said it was like, Okay, I don't know if these notes are right, but I remember it's crazy. But the notes say, 22 calls booked in 2 h.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Dan: That is right.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Tina Marie: And But then I was trying to remember, like what he was selling them into

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Tina Marie: And I think the conversion rate was not that high, but it was a few Anyway.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Tina Marie: Is there? Um

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Dan: Oh no!

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Dan: You cut out that time

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Tina Marie: Oh, weird! Uh.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Dan: But he! He's selling them into the $2,000 thing, or the $2,500 thing

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Dan: Um I don't know what the conversion rate is

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Dan: On those 22 specifically, because

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Dan: I actually. Highly doubt we flag those as like

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Dan: Other right like oh, cold outreach! DM,

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Tina Marie: Well, it's a small enough number that Mark should be able to manually identify them Huh!

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Dan: He definitely closed some of them for sure. I just don't know how many I've found

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Tina Marie: Well. I mean, that's a system right there. And that's definitely a, you know, in a pinch, if they needed it. Kind of thing. But there's something to be learned from that. So like, 1st of all, what was his DM. Approach

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: Who did he target Um! What did that conversation look like? Who said? Yes.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Tina Marie: What are their avatars? What are you laughing at?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Dan: Oh, because I love that. You think there's a depth of knowledge, depth of anything to this. He just he just did it. And I'm like, wait! What did you do?

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Tina Marie: Uh

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Dan: So what he did was he just He just redmed everybody that was ever qualified at once

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Dan: That's it. And I was like, Oh, we could. We could We can automate that

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Dan: And I was like

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Tina Marie: Well, that's at least still something from the same thing What? What did the DM. Say?

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Dan: Oh, yeah. No. Uh, I have a copy of it. I forget what it said. But I was like, we're just gonna use that

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Tina Marie: And how many people did it go out to

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Dan: Um Like to whatever I said. 200 200 and something

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so like 10% response

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Dan: Yeah. Well, actually, it might have gone out to. I think he got

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Dan: I think he got capped Because that account hadn't. There's there's

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Dan: SMS, thresholds in High level that you have to

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Dan: Kind of break through So it's like, if you've never sent 200 dms in a day. Well, that's 1 of the ceilings

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Dan: So I think that was part of the issue that he ran into was like he tried to DM. 400 people, or whatever

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Dan: So I don't know if he ever went back and did the rest. But He hit the 200 threshold, so it it sent out 200, and then all the other ones after it just fail

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Dan: Because they won't send them for you. But and then the next day your new ceiling opens And let's say that's 5, 300. I don't know what it is

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Dan: I mean, they're posted somewhere, but You started out at like 20 a day, and then you've once you hit 20. Then it opens up the next level, and there's no way to

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Dan: Advance through that, or get them to unlock it for you. The only way to get advanced through it is to hit the threshold That that the threshold that you're in

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Dan: At that time, and then It unlocks the next level the next day, so he at least sent 200. It might have been more if he sent more, but

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Dan: I kind of am not sure he did I'll have to ask

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I mean uh

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Dan: Yep.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Tina Marie: I would love to know everything around that, because that seems like he There's data in there to help your funnel

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Tina Marie: System whatever for acquisition. Basically, there's a there's a mini acquisition system. There Cause you got some results of it.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, I already built it. Yeah, I, built it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Around. What he did that worked.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Dan: We just haven't turned it on

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Tina Marie: Is what I'm saying

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Dan: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, oh, we should just make this a thing right? So it's like

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Dan: We just I'm I just. I didn't activate it But it's I just have to pick

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Dan: I mean, I guess I should go look at. I guess we do I just didn't know what

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Dan: Coldness. To set.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Dan: Right. So I'm like, Well, who booked the call? Were they people from 4 months ago.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Dan: Or were they more recent people? So if you got a bunch of people that were only 45 days cold Well, then, I'm going to set the coldness to 45, so that in 45 days

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Dan: Every qualified lead that did not book. A call is going to get that. DM, So, but I have not figured that out yet

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Dan: But I built so it's like one step in the automation. That's not Filled out.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay, uh, we can't get there now, but I would love um. Just because of the visualizing, and also because

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Tina Marie: Well multiple reasons. But This is your fun thing, but it also needs to pay the bills

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tina Marie: And did you ever figure out how much they owe you I know. Mark asked that number

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Dan: That is. That is a work in progress

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Dan: I am figuring it out I actually just did a dump of a bunch of feeds yesterday, and then Stacy and I

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Dan: I've been maintaining a list like every day I'll go. Oh, yep, there's another one. I forgot. I paid those guys Stacy started pulling some upwork data

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Dan: Pulled the High level fees. Yesterday.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Dan: Stacy pulled the Um

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Dan: Wise, right? So we pay All the

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Dan: Not all whatever. Some people we pay through wise. Some people we pay through upwork right? Most of the Devs are through wise

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Dan: Other off one officer through upwork So she started compiling all that

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Dan: And then I have a list of like

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Dan: All these other things that we have to go look up. So it'd be like, Okay, I paid For instance, this company apex

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Dan: Was the software that we tested for managing Facebook ads through high level I paid them

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Dan: Did I pay him a month? Did I pay him 3 months I've no idea

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Dan: But If I go into

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Dan: The credit card, and I search for apex

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Dan: I can get that

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Tina Marie: Bye. Apex, not apex

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Tina Marie: Apex. What is that?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Dan: Up. Yeah, uh. It's like the it's like a white label.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Dan: It's not just Facebook. It's like a white label ads management thing that you can iframe into high level

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Dan: It sucked

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Tina Marie: Wow! Okay, so.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Tina Marie: What I would like to If it's

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Dan: Oh, I just thought of another one

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Tina Marie: What?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Dan: Another one that I'm paying for. I'm gonna go add it to the list

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So anyway, next week I'm gonna check with you on your

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Tina Marie: Bill, just to make sure you're getting to that number, and then Um. I'd love to touch bases more on like what you're building in terms of

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tina Marie: The funnel. To the visual point that I can wrap my head around it, because that's where my questions come from. If I can't visualize it, I can't ask you questions that are useful

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Tina Marie: I mean, there's always

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Dan: With which, what funnel.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Tina Marie: Uh for um Leaves Louis. No, no, no, no, no, no! Uh.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Dan: The book.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Tina Marie: Fanflowy, I guess. What you're doing with the guys. Um.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Tina Marie: Mom, but It's fan flowy right

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Dan: Oh! Yeah, yeah. But like a specific funnel, the one that's which

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Tina Marie: Basically specifically around like what Mark did And how you can automate that. But basic, any way that you can get people into the community and have what you're doing with those guys make you money

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Dan: Oh! Yeah. Yeah. So the only one running right now is the song, submission funnel. Yeah.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Anyway.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Tina Marie: Ah just Sorry. My brain is like

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Tina Marie: Really shutting down right now. Um Yeah, that's that's what I want to ask you more about. But what I'm gonna do is also work on this um.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tina Marie: Cloud, version. I don't know where the hell all my extra stuff is. It's supposed to be 20 times extra. There wasn't even like 2 times extra

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Tina Marie: But whatever it's, the the technology. Whatever you know it is.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Tina Marie: It's good, it's bad, it's frustrating. And then blah blah!

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Dan: Okay.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Tina Marie: Um Anything just like new on the horizon, or good bad, whatever that I didn't even know to ask about

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Dan: Well, since I am not allowing anything new. No.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Tina Marie: Good. Oh, uh, Evelyn, how's how like you were talking about hiring her

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Dan: Nothing She's hired

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Tina Marie: And

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Dan: So she's she's working on the song, Submission, Funnel.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Tina Marie: All right.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Dan: So like, what happens is people Somehow they screw it up

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Dan: Because they're people So what happens is they'll end up with 2 records

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Dan: One is the song, and one is the lead. And then Evelyn goes through and merges them. If she can't figure out who it is.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Dan: There's an automation set up, and I'm like, add this peg It'll email them

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Dan: If they respond, merge them if they don't respond I don't care

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Dan: So she's working on that. And then I put together a 90 day sort of community launch plan. And then I put together a Community management, document

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Dan: So. And I sent her the book

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Dan: I was like, all right, you gotta look at this book Here's how we're going to run the community. She's in the community

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Dan: Um So as soon as the book is done

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Dan: Which will be sometime next week My thought was to

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Dan: Reach out to everybody. That

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Dan: Some chunk of the leads And just give them the book

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Dan: Like, here you go. We're launching this book We're giving it away to you. We're giving away the 1st 500 copies for free

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Dan: Um! Here's where you can get it. And invite them to the community

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Dan: And Yada Yada Yada, maybe Maybe we do a webinar or some shit. I don't know

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Dan: Um And then get start getting people in the community that have the book

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Dan: And see what happens. And then the book funnel.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Dan: I have to map. I realized I left 2 pages off I don't know how, but I went to send it to Greg No, I'm sorry I went to send it to the developers yesterday, and I was like, Wait a minute. There's 2 pages missing, so I have to go

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Dan: Uh Show Greg with those. But I have one. And then I was like, I don't know if that's right. So anyway, I'm gonna that's my thing I'm gonna do this afternoon. Figure out the 2 pages, send them to Greg, have them design it, then kick it over to

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Dan: The developers and have them build it.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay. One other thing I think that maybe would be beneficial to do is create an org chart for Mom

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Tina Marie: Um cause

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Dan: Have you been talking to Bobby

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Tina Marie: No.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Dan: Let's go. What the hell's going on That came up on that came up on Monday

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Tina Marie: What?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Dan: He said, you know what would be helpful for me, just like you, basically

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Dan: We had a chart that said So he was

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Dan: Touching on 2 things. Well, and then that sparked my thing Because we were laying out the rocks

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Dan: So Bobby was like, we need like, who's doing? What? What does this look like? And I said, Okay, well, then, that

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Dan: It's like a Accountability chart. But I'm like

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Dan: We're going to define the roles And who's in the roles right now, and like what the roles are, gonna be

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Dan: Because right now, people are in multiple roles So.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Dan: Yeah, I don't know if he's starting that. I don't know who got that. Somebody got that. It might be me But uh I'm

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Dan: I weirdly started working on it on the side and didn't tell anybody

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Well to the conversation that we had last week. We were talking about segmentation and keeping guys in their genius zones You brought Evelyn in like, it's really starting to shape up into an actual business

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Tina Marie: And so the structure is important. The role should be defined so that we're not, you know, overlapping, but also so that Um, you know, like, like we were talking about Johnny being top Jack, of all trades, kind of thing. We know that

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Dan: Yeah, so this is a rock

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. Good.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Dan: As of Monday. Yeah, this became a rock. This was the last rock, I added.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't suck that Bobby and I are on the same page. There

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Dan: Strategic delegation. It's called

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Dan: Egypt delegation. That's what I came up with in the early

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Tina Marie: Sweet.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Dan: Um, so part of it is laying it out, and then the other part is Um

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Dan: Looking at. Okay, like Sean and Johnny. Well, so I didn't

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Dan: I guess Sean and Johnny both do onboarding, but Sean does it more And I was like, Okay, how much more

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Dan: How long does it take? So we got to start gathering that stuff But to your point, onboarding is a role

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Dan: For sure. At least as long as we're

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Dan: Selling the $2,000 thing

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Tina Marie: Um. I will hold the rest of the questions then, and Work on formulating some of this a little bit more, but

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, mostly because my brain just went bloop

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Dan: That's okay. I'm starving all of a sudden. So

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Tina Marie: I think that's my issue. I think my sugar just like it. It crashed, and then um!

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Dan: I'm done

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Tina Marie: I I can't even formulate a sentence very well, like I think it. And then, like, Wait, was that right? It's really annoying. But

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Dan: Yep.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, bodies are fun. Anyway.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Uh, that's it. You have a good weekend. What day is it? It's Thursday. Yes.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Dan: Okay. It's Thursday

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Tina Marie: Oh, it's tax time, too. That's fun!

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Dan: Did that already That reminds me, I have to email the bookkeeper. I'm gonna do that right now.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Don't email the bookkeeper. Alright, sir, I will talk to you on Monday. You have a great day

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Dan: Yeah.
