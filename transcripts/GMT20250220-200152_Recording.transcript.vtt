00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.500
Dan: Nope.

2
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.880
Tina Marie: Hello!

3
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.759
Dan: Hello! Hello!

4
00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:44.160
Tina Marie: How are you feeling today.

5
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.519
Dan: I'm good out here in the out here in the sunshine. Get my vitam, get my vitamin d on.

6
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.930
Tina Marie: I don't even know what sunshine feels like anymore, Dan. It's been such a dark, cold, long winter.

7
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.980
Dan: Don't know what a winter's like, so I can't even relate.

8
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:07.069
Tina Marie: 3 more, years, 3 more, years, 3 more years, 3 more years.

9
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.580
Dan: Indeed details.

10
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.510
Tina Marie: Okay.

11
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.219
Tina Marie: So before I start asking you questions about everything, let me just tell you. Today I played with Grock 3,

12
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.790
Tina Marie: and I gave it.

13
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.399
Tina Marie: Things that I had worked through with deep research and deep seek are one

14
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.149
Tina Marie: ability to extract what was most important

15
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.280
Tina Marie: and extrapolate. Diff refine it, distill it.

16
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.560
Tina Marie: It's that is one of its most valuable things. So

17
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.150
Tina Marie: 80 pages of stuff. Very detailed. Plan.

18
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.405
Tina Marie: That it, anyway, it just yeah.

19
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.609
Tina Marie: Don't even know how to say this also. By the way, my daughter goes to school just long enough to get a sickness and bring it home to me.

20
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.440
Dan: Nice.

21
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:12.299
Tina Marie: Stupid stomach bug. I had it yesterday, but the good thing is because of all the things I've learned, I'm like, you know, maybe 20% sick of what everybody else is, but it still sucks on my brain.

22
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.340
Tina Marie: anyway.

23
00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:25.849
Tina Marie: But yeah, the the if I could like narrow it down to one thing, it's it's ability to distill what matters most. What's the most powerful thing out of that conversation.

24
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:47.729
Tina Marie: and then back it up with examples so like this. I have a revenue like a content revenue plan that's mostly automated. That I've been trying to build out. And of course it's iterative on a daily basis because everything keeps updating every day. So I'm just like building it while we're learning, knowing everything's gonna keep changing. And that's okay. Because

25
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.939
Tina Marie: holy crap! This stuff is going fast.

26
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.120
Tina Marie: But

27
00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:08.350
Tina Marie: One thing that all of the other models have failed to do is know what I already know about how fast money can be made on certain types of things and the way that they're they're created, like, for example, tidy cow.

28
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:22.899
Tina Marie: This little thing that is, you know, it's a calendar plugin that allows you to book calls and take payment, but everybody is selling subscriptions, and everybody, not everybody, but mostly. And that particular service.

29
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.470
Tina Marie: It's subscription.

30
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.329
Tina Marie: So the world is moving to subscription base. And now use case based right with AI tokens. But that sold millions of

31
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.959
Tina Marie: versions of the product at $29. So you know, do that math, and it didn't take very long for it to do it.

32
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:56.070
Tina Marie: And so what I was trying to do is like, if we're going to build logic, let's build logic with these things. Keeping this in mind, and none of the models could get their heads around that they'd forget it. They wouldn't. Whatever Grok got it in seconds before I even pointed it out.

33
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.820
Tina Marie: It's crazy fast and super good at distilling. So whatever your most complicated thing is that you've done.

34
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.390
Tina Marie: take it, and just copy that entire conversation into Grok and see what it spits out at you.

35
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.310
Dan: Yeah, I saw today. They're releasing in a desktop app for it now, too, or if it's out yet.

36
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.539
Dan: But yeah, they said they're gonna have a desktop app soon.

37
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.309
Tina Marie: Yeah. And right now, Grock, 3 is free to everybody.

38
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.639
Dan: I pay for X, anyway. So I already had it.

39
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.550
Tina Marie: Yeah.

40
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.199
Tina Marie: I literally just canceled it the day before. I'm like, I never use this. I'm never gonna use it. Blah! Blah!

41
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.280
Dan: But 6.

42
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.975
Tina Marie: Yeah.

43
00:04:43.077 --> 00:04:45.459
Tina Marie: Yeah. I don't think they have a desktop.

44
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.900
Dan: I'm sure I'm sure, Elon, I mean the dude makes great shit period, so I'm sure this will be great.

45
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.520
Tina Marie: I mean I've had Paypal, for I don't know how long, and.

46
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.130
Dan: Open AI for a long time.

47
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:08.129
Dan: I love the open AI guys like he. I'm like, really, Bro, he's like, we'll just build a better platform. I'm like he's going to.

48
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.830
Tina Marie: Yeah.

49
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.379
Dan: Like that's that's an idle threat.

50
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.520
Tina Marie: Yep.

51
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:25.820
Tina Marie: yeah. I mean, who else? Like, has satellites going through the sky and has gone to the moon and Mars? And obviously, I mean, yeah.

52
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.680
Tina Marie: that's all.

53
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.190
Dan: Thing about him the other day. It was like one it was. It wasn't him. It was like some other.

54
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.690
Dan: some like tech billionaire type, dude or whatever. And the guy was like.

55
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:52.990
Dan: I've been in meetings with him, and he's like, you know, what he does. That's really interesting, is he meets with every team once a week, and all he asks them is, what's your biggest problem right now and then he fixes it.

56
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.000
Tina Marie: That's brilliant.

57
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.509
Dan: And I was like, that is really smart. So he's like he just goes in and fixes the biggest problem, helps them think outside the box helps them fix it.

58
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.100
Dan: and then they move on, and he's like, but it's like you knock the it's like this domino effect.

59
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.040
Dan: And then all of a sudden.

60
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:22.070
Dan: He's like, you know, and they don't have big problems every week. So it's not like it's a huge problem every time. But it's the big. It's the one that they're struggling with the most. And then they just sit there, and that's all they talk about.

61
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.609
Dan: I was like, huh! That's interesting, and I guess he's done that for years.

62
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.100
Tina Marie: I.

63
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.669
Dan: That was like, have you ever seen? This is crazy.

64
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.300
Dan: So

65
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:47.420
Dan: Tesla's have like this, I'll call it like a Unibody design. So it's like the the it's built on a platform. Basically, if you think about it like that.

66
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.129
Dan: And the way that he got that idea supposedly was, they were sitting in a meeting.

67
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:13.650
Dan: and there was someone I don't know if it was him or somebody else had like a matchbox, and he was playing with the matchbox, and he flipped it over. And if you look, I'm sure you've seen a matchbox before, but the bottom of a matchbox is like a plate, right? It's like a single. And he looked at it and he goes, why can't we do this?

68
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.710
Dan: And they were like, What do you mean? And he goes? Why can't we just build

69
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:28.180
Dan: a platform like this? And they're like, Oh, well, I mean, you'd have to build all this tooling. And blah blah blah. And he's like, yeah, okay. But what if we did it?

70
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:40.210
Dan: And they're like, Oh, well, you know, that would revolutionize revolutionize car manufacturing, because you would eliminate all these other things. But this stuff doesn't exist. And he's like, yeah. But what if it did?

71
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.330
Dan: And it does? It does now.

72
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:57.760
Dan: and it has completely changed the way cars are built. And now, of course, they're going to start licensing it to other car manufacturers because it cuts out so many jobs, so many steps in the process, and that was all from him, flipping over a matchbox.

73
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.799
Dan: I'm like God damn dude! That is wild.

74
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.544
Tina Marie: Wow!

75
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.466
Tina Marie: That that's crazy. It!

76
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:22.209
Tina Marie: Yeah, it also he, the personality of it, is crazy. But I had to tell it like, you speak like Elon, very hyperbolic, and you know, like, if you're gonna give me all of these compliments and say, this is brilliant, this blah blah.

77
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.117
Dan: I hate that.

78
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:41.680
Tina Marie: Yeah, I said you, you need to back it up because you're not serving me by inflating my ego and building my hubris like that's not helpful. So if you want to tell me it's unique, you need to give me comparisons. If you you want to tell me that this, you know isn't done. Then show me all of these things because

79
00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:58.580
Tina Marie: chat. Gbt, 4. Does that? And Grock does that. And I'm like, you know, I could see the benefit of boosting confidence. But I'm like, if you're gonna boost my confidence and drive me into the ground because you took me in the wrong way like, No, thank you. So

80
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:09.000
Tina Marie: I don't need that. But anyway, it's just. It is interesting to watch the nuance of each of the models and how they perform across speed

81
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:26.979
Tina Marie: calculations, communication, style, logic, strategy problem, solving the tools that they're aware of how they research like, because I've been doing it every day except Sundays for the last 3 weeks, and it's

82
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.000
Tina Marie: I'm learning a lot by watching how they process. But in that

83
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:39.990
Tina Marie: I'm also validating. What I know is unique about me. But I'm also knowing that

84
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.090
Tina Marie: that uniqueness bubble begins to

85
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:52.159
Tina Marie: just shrink very quickly for anybody that is using the models. And I'll so the example is.

86
00:09:53.110 --> 00:10:07.219
Tina Marie: I was trying to come up with a unique name for what I was building and going to Namecheap, and I was going with all these I'm like, there's no way somebody thought of this thought of this thought of this, and because normally, I'm really good at coming up with things people haven't thought of yet.

87
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:12.399
Tina Marie: and it was getting harder and harder and harder, and a lot of them.

88
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.249
Tina Marie: you know. Some of them had been registered a few years ago, but most of them had been registered within like the last year.

89
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:32.549
Tina Marie: And also I think that I can. Registry is just cock blocking, basically, because so many of them with like, let's say whatever your name is, and then you go AI instead of.ai.

90
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.940
Dan: Yeah.

91
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.210
Tina Marie: Like premium. 2,000 3,000 $5,000 Tlds.

92
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.150
Tina Marie: Oh.

93
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.439
Dan: Yeah, the domainers just go out and buy up all the real estate. They're bastards.

94
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:57.129
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, that's been interesting. But for sure, you should take whatever you're like. Most like, holy crap. That was an amazing conversation with AI, and go feed it to Grock 3

95
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.100
Tina Marie: and see what you got.

96
00:11:00.983 --> 00:11:04.540
Dan: I will. I just finished the book, so I'm not editing that again.

97
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.000
Tina Marie: My next question.

98
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.870
Dan: Sorry not happening.

99
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.029
Tina Marie: Alright. So how finish finish like what's next?

100
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:22.229
Dan: I started. I took the well. Mark and Sean are like reading it, but I'm like

101
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.919
Dan: I don't think they'll have any changes. I mean if the changes will be minuscule, like change sign ins whatever.

102
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:36.039
Dan: I gave it to this woman that I had found on upwork a couple weeks ago, who like knows? Designer. That's

103
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.427
Dan: so I have, hey?

104
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.340
Dan: Barking up.

105
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.520
Tina Marie: Dumb.

106
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.060
Dan: Zinnia, hey?

107
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:53.170
Dan: So desk like what is going on? I thought someone was in the yard.

108
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.020
Tina Marie: Oh!

109
00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.739
Dan: There's a dog on the stairs next door, like what is happening.

110
00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:07.039
Dan: So anyway, I I found a designer, the chick that knows designer.

111
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.479
Dan: And which is that my buddy, Paul? Software.

112
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.220
Tina Marie: Right.

113
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.715
Dan: And

114
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:21.490
Dan: I was like, Hey, do you know how to do this? And she's like, Yeah, of course, you know, build a Pdf by just importing your Google, Doc, like I tried it. It was a shit show, I'm like, Oh.

115
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:21.830
Dan: okay.

116
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.240
Dan: there's no way. And then she's like, Oh, no, you have to like pre-format it, and I was like, great

117
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.220
Dan: do it.

118
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.260
Dan: So I picked a template. She's like, Go in there, pick a template, whatever. So I

119
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:41.359
Dan: told her I was finished the book. I finished it, and then I went went in and hired her, picked the template. She started doing it yesterday. She's like 5 chapters in, I think.

120
00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:51.079
Dan: And then I sent her graphics and was like, here, just do a version, and then I'll go look at it, or you can pull me in whenever you want. She's like, alright

121
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.159
Dan: Then I spent some quality time with Chat Gpt yesterday.

122
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.150
Dan: and I mapped out the Circle community.

123
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:13.759
Dan: and I created a spreadsheet for that. And then I found a dude last night on Circle, and I sent him a message and was like, Hey, this is what I need done. He sounds like he knows how to do it, based on his his profile.

124
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:22.011
Dan: but he hasn't gotten back to me yet, so I might hit up a couple of people. I usually hit up like 2 or 3 people. But I was like, Oh, this guy seems good.

125
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.000
Dan: so then I'll just have him go build out

126
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.060
Dan: the community like, Hey, go, build these circles. Here's the structure.

127
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:37.840
Dan: This is what I want. Then Eric and I will hook up the paywalls, or or whatever, and go start populating some of the content in there.

128
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.180
Dan: Then we can just start inviting inviting the leads that we're already getting to it.

129
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.870
Dan: Invite the old leads to it, invite the

130
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.040
Dan: bands to it. We'll probably run the book

131
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.940
Dan: after it's done. We'll probably run the book by a couple of these bands.

132
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:55.865
Dan: But that's it.

133
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.270
Tina Marie: Nice.

134
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:04.750
Dan: Oh, and I also. I also finished the prop. I just finished it. I finished the proposal for the

135
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.259
Dan: distribution. White label

136
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:14.549
Dan: Sean's going into. Sean found a couple things. I swore I did it, but I was like man. I guess I only thought about doing it.

137
00:14:15.328 --> 00:14:24.799
Dan: Because it's it wasn't in there. So I edited that the parts that he pointed out this morning so that we can send that off to them

138
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.190
Dan: today.

139
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.440
Tina Marie: Distribution white label.

140
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.670
Tina Marie: Is that the that's not the spotify thing, though right?

141
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:46.170
Dan: Nope, they do have that functionality which we would get. But it's not as good as what we want. Spotify is still not approved.

142
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.630
Tina Marie: So tell me about finishing the book

143
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:04.159
Tina Marie: like so did you? Did you do it with chat gpt pro.

144
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.570
Dan: Okay.

145
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.999
Dan: Oh, you know what? I'm gonna disconnect from the Internet. Hold on.

146
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:12.700
Tina Marie: Okay.

147
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.389
Dan: All right. Say that again.

148
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.599
Tina Marie: Tell me about finishing the book. Did you use chat? Gpt pro.

149
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560
Dan: I did.

150
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:28.369
Dan: Yeah, it was like, whatever it was. Okay. I mean, it definitely

151
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:36.069
Dan: took. I took the stuff that you sent and fed it back into it. I don't think it initially, it wasn't really following it.

152
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:45.380
Dan: Claude sucked like Claude just kept spitting out bullet lists. I'm like, Oh, my God, these cannot be a book of bullet lists.

153
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.370
Dan: It's like

154
00:15:46.640 --> 00:16:01.469
Dan: this is, and then I'd be like, you're doing it again, and it'd be like, Oh, let me rebalance this with narrative, so I do feel like once I took it all back into Chat, gpt pro or whatever it's called deep. Whatever it did

155
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.289
Dan: it did write it better. And then I used the final book

156
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.959
Dan: to then build out the community structure. I was like, Okay, now, I want to take this book, and I want to do blah blah.

157
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:23.969
Dan: And it did. It did a good job of that, especially because it was going out like researching circle, and I was like, Hey, how do I do this? Can I do this? Can I do that? And it was able to like get real answers?

158
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.910
Dan: I think it was wrong about a couple of things, but nothing, Major.

159
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.150
Tina Marie: Nice. So okay, so what are you focusing on right now, like.

160
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.420
Tina Marie: over the next week or so?

161
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.400
Tina Marie: So I'm gonna get this. I gotta get a.

162
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.310
Dan: I gotta get these. There's a couple things.

163
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:52.480
Dan: So it's really interesting. Right? We started doing the meetings with Bobby. And then every Monday it's like, done done done

164
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.600
Dan: for fanflowy. And I'm like, All right, here we go.

165
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.859
Dan: I gotta get like there's

166
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:11.679
Dan: I'm gonna do it today. But it's I have to define these landing pages for Greg and then get them over to Greg, and then I'll get sods guys to build them and then use.

167
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:23.910
Dan: I had them build a Facebook C Api app, basically, so that our landing pages can pass custom conversion values back through Facebook. C. Api.

168
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:35.169
Dan: But in order to get those to work. You have to like, use the code references like, Hey, does it have this div name, or or this button class, or whatever?

169
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.899
Dan: So I'm going to get them the landing pages, and then they'll build them using the correct classes.

170
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:51.970
Dan: And then the since all our pages are dynamically built, the users never need to edit them. If they want to edit content, they go edit the content elsewhere.

171
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.229
Dan: So if I get them those, then I can.

172
00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:05.269
Dan: I can finalize my testing of like the URL Rewriter which works. But it. It needs some other stuff.

173
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.390
Dan: And then I mapped out.

174
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.849
Dan: I mapped out another app.

175
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.150
Dan: It's like, it's like, basically like a scraper.

176
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:27.650
Dan: We need to get like bands. Twitter, spotify blah, blah automatically. And there's no there's there's like an Api to get social links.

177
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:33.000
Dan: But there's no Api to get digital streaming platform links.

178
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:41.269
Dan: So then I talked to Chat Gpt, and I was like, how would I? I can't figure this out. And it was like, Okay, well, you can use the Google

179
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.560
Dan: Google search. Query, Api

180
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.460
Dan: and I started messing around with it. And it was giving me the prompts or whatever that you've used in the code.

181
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:57.339
Dan: And it was like 99% accurate. And I was like, okay, well, I use this, and then we have the band

182
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.100
Dan: approve them like, okay, here are the links that we found for you.

183
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.670
Dan: Are these correct?

184
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:08.669
Dan: And it approves them. Then that will automate this other section of the onboarding.

185
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.640
Dan: And then that also ties into the Ul rewriter.

186
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:21.349
Dan: So I'm like, okay, if I get the landing pages and the scraper. Then I can finalize the URL rewriter like I

187
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.789
Dan: pretty sure I need to add

188
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.420
Dan: some sort of automation or some sort of

189
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:38.450
Dan: trigger that will go build, hey? Every time this field is filled in. Go, build that link something like that. But I need to see

190
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.260
Dan: the data, the data needs to exist. And I need to see it. So I can go. Yeah, that's correct.

191
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:50.800
Dan: Then I can go back to those guys and go, hey? Just add this function, or here's what I want to do. What is the best way to pull this off.

192
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:59.279
Dan: and it will work and then that'll be done. So that well, that's there's 3 things that aren't done.

193
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.069
Dan: No, those are the 3 things that I want to get done over there.

194
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:11.050
Dan: Then the the last one is the onboarding, which we don't really need, because everyone's done with you.

195
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:18.689
Dan: And then we could start to look at the onboarding and be like. All right, let's but there's no rush in completing that, because

196
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:24.830
Dan: we're not going to be having a diy person for probably 6 months, if ever.

197
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.660
Tina Marie: If ever.

198
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.790
Dan: Yeah, I mean.

199
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.180
Tina Marie: Yeah.

200
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.204
Dan: Because you want to do done with you mostly.

201
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.960
Dan: yeah, or the the short term. Yeah.

202
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.210
Tina Marie: So does Mom have a website yet.

203
00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:42.630
Dan: We had one. But it wasn't built on basis 2.0.

204
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:53.919
Dan: So those guys are building the new one right now with the with the podcast pages and stuff. So we sent them. They need some podcast stuff that I sent them

205
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.810
Dan: on Monday. I think.

206
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.239
Tina Marie: What's the due date?

207
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.819
Dan: There isn't 1, because it was just like, Oh, hey! Get that up!

208
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.110
Dan: The book was more important. But now that the book is probably going to be done.

209
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.269
Dan: Then it would be

210
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.330
Dan: I think I think I had Greg do this.

211
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:20.100
Dan: So then we would build the book funnel on the back end of that mom site. So it needed to be on the new theme

212
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.520
Dan: and then be able to use funnel kit

213
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.459
Dan: so that we could build the book funnel, which I think.

214
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.479
Dan: if I think he designed it. But I'll have to double check

215
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:43.689
Dan: because the book we need the book funnel to be live when the community goes live, because

216
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.099
Dan: we'll be directing people from the book.

217
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.499
Dan: I mean from the community to the book. So when people come into the community.

218
00:21:50.910 --> 00:22:01.550
Dan: The it's structured around the book. So they'll be like, what is what is this? What is? Step one. Where is this coming from? Like? Oh, it's come from the book. You got to buy the book. If you want to understand the steps.

219
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.650
Dan: Do you want to be in the crew.

220
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:13.920
Tina Marie: Who is the freaking, most brilliant marketers I see right now. It's the people that make squishmallows. Do you know what squishmallows are.

221
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.069
Dan: I have no idea what a squish mellow is.

222
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:25.270
Tina Marie: With teenage girls. I'm surprised because they are these stuffed animals, and pretty much every week there is a new one.

223
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:37.519
Tina Marie: They come and they go, and they're gone, and now they have it in monopoly. They have it in all kinds of things. It is constantly changing. I've never seen stuffed animals change so fast.

224
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:56.859
Tina Marie: And they are basically shapeless, like fluffy, squishy pillow type things. But they've got all these different creatures with different outfits, constantly changing Dan every month at least, it's probably not weekly, but like so frequently, they are

225
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:03.649
Tina Marie: completely changing out whole new whole new creations. It's probably going to be some like collectors, things later. But

226
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.490
Tina Marie: yeah.

227
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.939
Dan: It's like a there used to be squishables

228
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:15.820
Dan: and squishables was similar. But yeah, so they married like Cutesy with Beanie baby.

229
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.300
Tina Marie: Yes.

230
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.089
Dan: Limited, so like Mariel, was super into these squishable dragons.

231
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:32.549
Dan: and so like you couldn't get the Ice Dragon like the Ice Dragon could not be had until I found it on ebay, and paid way more than I should have.

232
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.190
Tina Marie: Good daddy.

233
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.910
Dan: She still has them all.

234
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:54.049
Tina Marie: That's yeah. It's wild, anyway. My daughter just sent me a picture of squishmallows on monopoly, and I'm like that's all I can even think about is just the marketing, like it's bonkers, because every week they go to the store and they send me a picture of something new

235
00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:01.660
Tina Marie: they have so many and like you, this is ridiculous. You don't even have room in your room for more stuff.

236
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.299
Dan: I was like Beanie babies. People went crazy for those.

237
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.400
Tina Marie: Yes, but at least they were tiny. These things are, I know that's true.

238
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.920
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, anyway. Okay, so

239
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:28.790
Tina Marie: man, it's just crazy how this the AI infiltrates, and can make things so much faster, like the thing that I've been studying for the last few weeks

240
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.910
Tina Marie: is the

241
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:39.200
Tina Marie: agents, you know. And some people say agents. And really they're talking about like automations that are basically no more powerful than make.com.

242
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.600
Tina Marie: They're not.

243
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.669
Dan: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's like a glorified zap. Yeah.

244
00:24:44.670 --> 00:25:05.420
Tina Marie: Yes, that's that's really all that it is. But with the constant speed of iteration and of well, okay, so operator, chat, Gpt operator. If you can't do anything that we go, it's an autonomous agent. It can go do this. It can't do hardly anything.

245
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.479
Dan: No, can't do shit, Eric. Eric played with it.

246
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.710
Tina Marie: Wanted to book your flights or go grocery shopping when you're gonna have to tell it everything, anyway, and you could have got it done faster.

247
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.250
Dan: Right.

248
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:35.519
Tina Marie: Yeah. So that's where it's at. But we are, for sure on the precipice. So of the autonomous agents that can do something that's useful and productive, because, like, if you could combine what rock understands with the ability to

249
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:50.640
Tina Marie: write the code inside of a linode server, for example, right? You have your app built. All you have to do is come up with idea and map it out. But you don't really even have to do that. You basically have to just say, choose one like it's nuts.

250
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.750
Tina Marie: but

251
00:25:52.190 --> 00:26:07.280
Tina Marie: to not get too shiny right. And to keep it. Applying to whatever you're actually already building where your other skill sets are just kind of thinking about. What could you leverage

252
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:14.270
Tina Marie: for mom, or for another 71, even if it's just

253
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:22.790
Tina Marie: better analytics like looking at the data in a new way and seeing something we haven't seen.

254
00:26:23.238 --> 00:26:30.700
Tina Marie: Whatever kind of opportunities. Maybe there's trends that we think that we figured out, but we couldn't really get it before that type of thing.

255
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:37.339
Tina Marie: That's something I think, that we should be considering as we're as things keep evolving.

256
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.880
Dan: Oh, yeah, sure.

257
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.059
Tina Marie: Better understand what we already know and what we're already doing.

258
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:50.250
Dan: Right. I mean, we use the I mean the we launched all the Delphi

259
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:57.720
Dan: things for all the sections, sections of the exam like a week ago, or something.

260
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.279
Dan: Okay.

261
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:06.789
Dan: no one has that. No one's using AI in the space. I guess someone else is Beta testing it right now. But we already launched one

262
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.270
Dan: done.

263
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:22.420
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, so you've got you've got the things that you're planning on. How is like, do you perceive any bottlenecks in what you're working on?

264
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.030
Tina Marie: Feel like.

265
00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:28.154
Dan: No. So next I I did my little

266
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:35.510
Dan: I got my my trick move where there's a software called.

267
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.700
Dan: I think it's called open, audible.

268
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:47.320
Dan: So it's it's free. You download it, you log into Amazon, and then it accesses all your audible bugs.

269
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.359
Dan: and then it converts them to Mp. 3. And then I feed that into descript and descript

270
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.130
Dan: creates a transcript of the whole thing.

271
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:07.249
Dan: So I'm gonna I did that with 100 million offers yesterday or Mosey's book. And now I just haven't learned the book, and then I go in and go. Hey?

272
00:28:07.746 --> 00:28:15.360
Dan: Based on his, you know. Lead magnet. Blah! Blah! What lead magnet should I make for mom

273
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.990
Dan: for fanfloy, and just see what it says. So he's got like the 4

274
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:27.339
Dan: we'll call it quadrants. I don't know if he actually calls that. I think he does, actually. But it's like the 4 quadrants of

275
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:34.910
Dan: promotion, right? Which is nothing new, but it's like it's cold outreach, affiliate.

276
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:43.570
Dan: paid ads. And there's another one. I don't know what the other one is. But same idea. I'd be like, okay.

277
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.179
Dan: I'm doing this right? So right now, we have

278
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.360
Dan: affiliates. That's where most of the

279
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.879
Dan: affiliates. And then we have that one lead thing coming in. Those are the 2 main sources of

280
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.620
Dan: bands right now.

281
00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.730
Dan: I had developed this cold outreach idea. But it was like.

282
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:09.899
Dan: well, it's not that, it's labor intensive. It really wasn't. I wasn't doing it. I think it was costing 40 cents a record

283
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:16.750
Dan: which, now that I say this out loud, if we're paying 50 cents for a lead from a band.

284
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:23.380
Dan: But they're pro. They're actually a lead. These are not leads. So it's like, if I go the cold outreach route.

285
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.660
Dan: What's my conversion rate? Right? If my conversion rate

286
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.690
Dan: at 40% at 40 cents to create a record, not a lead.

287
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:37.499
Dan: and then I start contacting those leads. What is the actual rate in which

288
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.470
Dan: they respond? They do anything I don't know.

289
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.110
Dan: but I think I have them.

290
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.819
Dan: I think I had them.

291
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:55.789
Dan: They created at least a hundred records, but it might be like 300, but I think some of them were incomplete. I think I looked at the data, and I was like, Oh.

292
00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:02.209
Dan: a real record should be this. So I'll go revisit that. I actually just texted this guy because I was like, Hey.

293
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:10.110
Dan: there's browse. AI, which is like this thing that goes out and browses the Internet for you. It looks like you could

294
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.229
Dan: take a browse AI and break it into like multiple bots.

295
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.630
Dan: So I just sent it to him. And I was like, Hey.

296
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:23.280
Dan: can you look into whether or not we could automate the the process that we did on this project, which was.

297
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.909
Dan: you go to Google and you do a search for

298
00:30:27.604 --> 00:30:33.579
Dan: I forget what the search is, but it's like a custom search using the search operators. And it's like.

299
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:41.370
Dan: has Instagram in the thing and has gmail in the in the thing, and mentions band or music.

300
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:50.040
Dan: and what it does is it pulls back search results that are bands, profiles on Instagram with their Gmail address listed in their profile.

301
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.609
Dan: So I had them do that. And then I said, Okay, great. Now, I want you to go from there, find their spotify, and then get this data.

302
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:18.229
Dan: So then we could cold outreach from Mark, saying, Hey, such and such band! I was checking out your latest song on spotify, or I think we grabbed the latest song on spotify. Let's just checking out your song. Blah blah! Oh, we also grab last time they posted on Instagram.

303
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:31.189
Dan: and then it's the latest song and the date so we could look at them and go. Are they active at all? Are they active on social? Are they active on spotify? And then you could sort of lead, score them, and then see if those scores have any meaning.

304
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:49.070
Dan: But then put it into like Gmass and have it emailing from Mark Rivers. Hey? I was just checking out your spotify. Saw you on Instagram blah blah, and then make them some sort of pitch. Pitch them the book, pitch them. The community, like probably the community.

305
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:54.069
Dan: make it free. And then what's the result of that? Right? So

306
00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.460
Dan: go deeper into affiliates and then try a cold email thing. We're already kind of doing ads. And then I forget what the 4th one is and be like. Well, what's the 4th one?

307
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.510
Dan: And then

308
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:12.458
Dan: go see which ones work. See? Once to go deeper into Mark's like we need to go to trade shows. I was like no fucking way.

309
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.375
Tina Marie: No.

310
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.779
Dan: There's no way we're doing that.

311
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.211
Tina Marie: I mean they can go. You don't have to go.

312
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.359
Dan: We got. I'm not paying for that.

313
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.240
Tina Marie: Right?

314
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:38.090
Tina Marie: Yeah. So speaking of paying like, how long have you been building things on basis and with them? And it's not been making you money, or at least not enough to even break even yet right on any of it.

315
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.480
Dan: Yeah.

316
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:51.579
Tina Marie: So do you? I mean, I I know that another 71 pays your bills. And technically, this just kind of creates almost like a tax protection because it's bleeding so bad. But

317
00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:58.399
Tina Marie: do you have kind of a okay drive towards the revenue plan?

318
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.690
Dan: I'm just going all in on Fan flowy and distro flowey like, I don't even care about basis anymore.

319
00:33:05.723 --> 00:33:14.399
Dan: Like I use it like, there's maybe the opportunity to like do something there with Joe and heather. But I'm not.

320
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:22.040
Dan: I'm not pushing it. We're gonna build the podcast sites. I think we're Gonna, put the podcast stuff on wolfer site because

321
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:26.880
Dan: they were asking about it. And I was like, Oh, yeah, no, we've got it. We just never implemented it.

322
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:34.259
Dan: And then we'll use the podcast on our own site. And then we might still rebuild Joe's site after we get these up.

323
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.860
Dan: And then it's like, there's a there's a company called Pod Pages, or whatever.

324
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.520
Dan: Supposedly they have, like 30,000 users, right? So it's like.

325
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:51.519
Dan: it's like a basic website builder. But if you're going to turn your

326
00:33:52.110 --> 00:34:13.669
Dan: podcast. Into a business, you need additional functionality like it needs to be using activecampaign. It needs to be using, you know better tracking and all that crap. So it's like, Okay, well, if you've got 30,000 people paying $30 a month, how many can you get to pay 300. How many podcasts are there like Joe?

327
00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.210
Dan: That will get it right. And you pay 300 bucks a month.

328
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.380
Dan: There's some degree of those, but it would all be sort of

329
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.290
Dan: dependent on whether Joe and Heather want to do it, and then I was supposed to go out to lunch with them to talk about it, but I was sick.

330
00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:30.810
Dan: so it never happened.

331
00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.660
Dan: So we got to reschedule that

332
00:34:34.905 --> 00:34:54.434
Dan: and then I've you know, I'm using basis like they just gave me back that car accident or the car report finder for Mark like I just got it right before I jumped on this call so like once they were able. Once they were like, Oh, you need that. They were able to build it in like 2 days. I was like, sweet.

333
00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:01.530
Dan: So yeah, and I'm using it for mom.

334
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.949
Dan: because that can't be built on high level.

335
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.310
Tina Marie: Okay. So basis doesn't

336
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:16.539
Tina Marie: basis doesn't have the required role of you have to make us money anymore because the basis creates the foundation for the things that does make you money.

337
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.170
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I used it. We're using it on all the ninja sites.

338
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.280
Tina Marie: Yeah.

339
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.170
Dan: Right like I'm still you.

340
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:29.860
Dan: I mean, I had that realization like 2 years ago. I'm like, Oh, if I can just use this for me, and get what I need out of it.

341
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.350
Tina Marie: Yeah.

342
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:37.299
Dan: Which I did, and then the the another, the ninja subscription thing.

343
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:42.440
Dan: It's just like killing it. And I'm like, Oh, my God! Like we? I haven't even

344
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:50.549
Dan: I mean, it looks like it's increased new customers per day like 4 or 5 a day.

345
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.570
Tina Marie: I'm like easy.

346
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:57.040
Dan: I know. So it means the goal that I set is already been met.

347
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:03.930
Dan: So on Monday they're like, what are we going to do, and I go. We can't do anything. We shouldn't do anything like.

348
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.440
Dan: It's like looking a gift horse in the mouth. I'm like we just need to let this ride

349
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.809
Dan: for 90 days, right? We're halfway through it.

350
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:23.760
Dan: and then we'll have some idea of what it really looks like. But as I pointed out to them on Monday. I'm like, if we if we're getting 4 more customers a day. Now.

351
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:41.800
Dan: this is our low season. That means that number is going to go up even more. So I'm like, how do we set a target for growth when we don't even know where we are? And it's not that we, and we don't know where we are, because we can't. We can't possibly know, because it hasn't happened yet.

352
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:55.460
Dan: So like if we did something we'd never know if it worked, because we're doing something, and it is working. And the something that we're doing is not done being done, even though we're done doing the work.

353
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:06.229
Dan: The the offer has not reached maturation right? It's like it doesn't mature until the summer, because that's our high season.

354
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:11.100
Dan: So there's nothing we can do we? There's all we can do is wait.

355
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.769
Dan: and it won't hurt us, because it's working.

356
00:37:17.531 --> 00:37:19.640
Tina Marie: I'm trying to see what Stacey.

357
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:26.149
Dan: Bobby was like, you do realize that we entered this year with the most subscribers ever I'm like, I absolutely realize that

358
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.849
Dan: this is on. We're on part of the best year ever.

359
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:42.039
Dan: and I'm like I did not necessarily see this happening like I figured it would work, but I mean there was no way to know, and and it did, but there's no way to know to what degree it worked.

360
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.480
Tina Marie: Right.

361
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.999
Dan: And then you got to deal with.

362
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:51.730
Dan: Well, what's the Ltv $187 subscription? Well, I hate to break it to you, but you're not going to really know that for a year.

363
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.210
Tina Marie: Yeah.

364
00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.250
Tina Marie: Do you know, if they finished car accident report finder.

365
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:05.439
Dan: Oh, that's what I just said. Yeah, they just released it to me like this morning, an hour ago.

366
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.480
Tina Marie: I missed the domain part of it.

367
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.980
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I said the I said, I didn't say the right domain.

368
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:16.019
Dan: Oh, okay. I was like, Wait, exiting quote, or whatever. Yeah, okay. But the

369
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.749
Dan: was the thing they were able to once they were like, Oh, shit! You need that. They were able to build it like 2 days.

370
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.689
Tina Marie: Because of basis and the way it's been built.

371
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:24.145
Dan: Yeah.

372
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.100
Tina Marie: Crazy and awesome.

373
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:32.787
Tina Marie: So I'm just

374
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:59.959
Tina Marie: okay. I have so many thoughts. And I kind of want to sit with them. But also, we're having a conversation. I'm just thinking about. Another 71, and wondering. But don't answer yet. You know how much time you're spending on that, knowing that so much is set in place, and has a system that you don't really have to spend a lot of time of it. I don't think.

375
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.220
Dan: None. I can answer that easy. None.

376
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:07.330
Tina Marie: And then and then mom, is the current

377
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:23.819
Tina Marie: puzzle to solve on a marketing level, on a on a tech level. And then you get to make music like it feels like Mom could just fill up your time with anything business wise, even still, even with it, the

378
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:43.150
Tina Marie: the AI and the technology that that basically one problem getting solved or one puzzle getting solved leads to an opportunity for refinement that can last all year long, no matter what's happening, because there's just so much to build and learn and iterate

379
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:54.560
Tina Marie: because at 1st I was thinking, oh, well, I mean, it's all going so well, you probably started something else if you wanted to. But would you want to.

380
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.829
Dan: I do not want to.

381
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.090
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean.

382
00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:05.539
Dan: I'll I'll help like I'll help people and talk to people. But I'm not. Someone asked me the other day. Oh, do you want it.

383
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.239
Dan: Do you want to do this? What's your level of interest in being involved? And I said, 0.

384
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:19.560
Tina Marie: They're like, okay. But I said, you want to ask me questions about it. Feel free right now.

385
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.750
Tina Marie: Okay. But to do and build things with Mark that takes time.

386
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.480
Dan: Oh, I'm not doing that.

387
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.780
Dan: That's not happening. I'm gonna get.

388
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.330
Tina Marie: 5.

389
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.970
Dan: I don't even see that is.

390
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.319
Dan: I do not like that idea. I don't think it's a good idea.

391
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.910
Tina Marie: I think you should tell him that I think you should just tell him I'm not interested in this.

392
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:50.090
Dan: Well, no, I think it will. Can work for him, and that's what we're doing. We're implementing it in suite law. And that's my argument like, let's see if it even works for you.

393
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.969
Dan: Right? It's like, there's you. You say, this is a problem for you. Okay, great.

394
00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.680
Dan: Let's see if this makes things better. Let's see if it works. That's all well and good.

395
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.510
Dan: But I don't know. It's like.

396
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:10.430
Dan: you know. Is it a solution in search of a problem. I'm like, I don't know that that many people have this problem or care

397
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.110
Dan: care enough to do it right. You're talking about people that don't even follow up with their leads.

398
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.240
Dan: They're gonna sit there and nurture their network. Nope.

399
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:34.480
Tina Marie: It's interesting because I watched a Youtube video yesterday and the guy asked, Chat, Gpt and perplexity come up with a plan that gets me from 0 to 10 million arr in a year.

400
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:43.770
Tina Marie: We're in 3 years, or something like that. And the one of the main plans that came up with was building something almost identical to Touchbot.

401
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:52.500
Dan: Yeah, I don't know why it would pick that. I mean, what is that even based on how? How did it? What data did it tap into that says, Build that.

402
00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:06.569
Tina Marie: Yeah, I don't know, because they didn't share all of that. But I thought that that was fascinating, that they thought that that was an untapped market, because you know that they're not having conversations like that. And about that.

403
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:16.799
Dan: Yeah, I mean, there's no way to build it with high level. So that then you're talking about doing like ground up software development. No, thanks.

404
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.560
Dan: Nope.

405
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.470
Dan: Not interested.

406
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

407
00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:28.429
Dan: Like, can't trust Norio, so it's like, I don't really have a developer I can trust.

408
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.449
Dan: And there I'm I'm not about to go find one.

409
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.410
Dan: And I'm like, Yeah, no.

410
00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:42.560
Tina Marie: Well with with the AI tools that you have with the fact that you're basically in a mode of

411
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.839
Tina Marie: maintenance with your primary revenue generator, another 71.

412
00:42:51.320 --> 00:43:20.539
Tina Marie: And, mom, you have a, you have a whole team. You have a simple plan. The iterations on there. What do you think is the benefit for you and I talking. I like it, and I want it to happen. But I don't. I don't. I want to know that there's use that still works for you, for our conversations, because most of the things that we work on, I mean, like, I can share all the things that I'm working with, and it will

413
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.859
Tina Marie: spark some idea that you'll go and multiply a million times over. But

414
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.150
Tina Marie: I don't know, you know, like what we started with has changed so much.

415
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.320
Tina Marie: How have you thought about that recently? Huh?

416
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.160
Dan: It's shocking. Things have changed that much over many years.

417
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.330
Tina Marie: I know almost.

418
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:48.419
Dan: So like I got the site right. Site looks good for Mark. If I can go generate leads this way, and like help, Mark make more money

419
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.650
Dan: doing what Mark does like to me. That's a better outcome of like that relationship, certainly

420
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.019
Dan: in a in a short term fashion.

421
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:20.090
Dan: And then it's like, I mean, this is literally what I was thinking the other day. I'm like, if Mark wants to make money with me, I'll be like Bro. Just fucking. Buy this catalog. We need investors for this music catalog. Give me money to buy this catalog, and you'll be a investor in that right? It's a Salco's like dude. I'll throw money at that. This is this is such a cool idea, and I go. I know it's like some.

422
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.479
Tina Marie: Thank you.

423
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.749
Dan: Tool that you can do.

424
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:31.590
Dan: So. It's like, if Mark wants to make money like, just make it passively like, I think that's where we all should be is like making money passively right? So

425
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:32.650
Dan: it's like.

426
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:38.279
Dan: And then, if you I think the neck and and that's like shifting into

427
00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:42.499
Dan: the idea of buying an asset instead of building it.

428
00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.280
Dan: And it's like.

429
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:49.269
Dan: you know what? At this stage of the game? That's the move. No more building. It's buying.

430
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:56.349
Tina Marie: Well be, especially because you can apply the same type of logic that Elon does, which is, go in and be a puzzle solver that other people can't be.

431
00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:56.940
Dan: Yeah.

432
00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.140
Tina Marie: Yeah.

433
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:11.750
Dan: And then and then it's like you bring. If you have the fan flow in the distro Flowey, like you own the puzzle, you own. The you own the solution like it's like, Hey, here's this, I solved the puzzle that you're trying to solve. Here it's solved

434
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:18.170
Dan: like, come in and do this, and then you go. And oh, here's a strategy to grow your music career

435
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.559
Dan: through this community or whatever.

436
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:29.130
Dan: And then, yeah, you can sign artists, and you can buy catalogs like which that stuff's already starting to have, like all the things that I thought were

437
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.440
Dan: possible

438
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:43.590
Dan: are already happening. So I'm like, okay, I really just need to get this white label deal close that I'm gonna send over today. It's really not a lot of money. And I'm like, okay. So here I am. I'm not good.

439
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:49.150
Dan: like, those guys wanted to build distribution software. I was like, no way, there's no way we're doing that.

440
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:55.640
Dan: And then then Sean found this, which is great, he's found a couple right, but this seems to be the a good fit.

441
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.590
Dan: And then the other day he was like.

442
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:09.279
Dan: well, you know, we're going to be paying them like 30 grand a month if we get to such and such a level, you know. At that point, we probably should think about building our own software. I go exactly

443
00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.419
Dan: at that point. You consider building your own software.

444
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:40.539
Dan: I was like, which is exactly what I did in my company. We license software for years. We built up the brand. We built up the audience, we built up the customers, and then we would have just kept going except they yanked the license and they forced us to develop our own software. But I'm like in this scenario. Yeah, if you're making 30 grand a month off this white label, and you reroute some of that money into developing your own software, it's a done deal.

445
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:44.780
Dan: and then you could make it. Do you know, by that point we'll know all the

446
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.879
Dan: issues, things that we would customize.

447
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.489
Dan: whatever you want to call it.

448
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.350
Dan: So yeah, it's like.

449
00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:00.300
Dan: I'm I'm not gonna do anything new. And like, I'm curious to see if I can get leads through this

450
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.950
Dan: report site. Now, now that I've got it.

451
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:12.140
Tina Marie: Well, do you still feel like I can add value to refining and what you're doing in your plan? Or do you feel like that's something that you're probably moving out of.

452
00:47:13.396 --> 00:47:14.429
Dan: I mean.

453
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.520
Dan: Talk to me in 6 months.

454
00:47:17.484 --> 00:47:18.450
Tina Marie: Now.

455
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:18.960
Dan: I mean.

456
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.528
Tina Marie: It's gonna be so different in 6 months.

457
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.010
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

458
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.840
Dan: I don't know. I mean, it's like.

459
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:40.619
Dan: Yeah, I do think there's a benefit to these conversations, because you asked me things no one else asked me right? Other people other people like borderline suck up to me. And I'm like, Yeah, that doesn't really. I don't know who you're doing that for.

460
00:47:41.345 --> 00:47:41.690
Tina Marie: Pop.

461
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.920
Dan: It's certainly not for me.

462
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.900
Dan: But it's like, yeah, it's

463
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.640
Dan: I don't know. I mean, things are

464
00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.519
Dan: coming together on all the fronts that I want.

465
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:05.409
Dan: and I mean, I look at Fanflow, and I'm like, Oh, dude! This is like on the exact same path as Ninja now like. Oh, what a coincidence!

466
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.660
Tina Marie: Yeah, right? But who's behind it?

467
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:17.409
Dan: Right. And it's like, Yeah, I had to go all those years, or whatever doing the wrong thing. But I you know I don't look at any of that as wrong.

468
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.690
Dan: And it's like, you know, I'm very much things happen in their own time.

469
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.259
Dan: Yeah, I mean, today, I was like, I just need to

470
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:32.029
Dan: when I tell myself that I want to go, do XY or Z. I'm like, I just need to go to the gym.

471
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:32.790
Dan: That's what I.

472
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.800
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

473
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:42.620
Dan: Just put time in there and then, if I have energy or mental whatever, I should just go direct it

474
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.620
Dan: like basically internally.

475
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.758
Tina Marie: Yeah, but but externally, yes, I like that plan.

476
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.849
Tina Marie: it's crazy. May will be 8 years.

477
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.920
Dan: I know it is kind of crazy.

478
00:48:56.347 --> 00:49:01.049
Tina Marie: Especially because we were Facebook friends for before that for years.

479
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:12.700
Tina Marie: and just anyway, but also just looking at the pace and the trajectory of everything is fascinating. But one thing I want to do and start started doing a couple of weeks ago with everyone

480
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:41.250
Tina Marie: kind of internally, is running the transcripts through AI to extract tasks, and I can do that well. I had to do it because nobody else had project managers, and they just need their homework right? But you have a project manager, so I can send stuff straight over to Stacy. But what I'd also like to do what I wasn't doing before is analyzing like we don't always have the same level of conversations with strategy. But for the most part our conversations. There's a lot of Dan strategy that comes out that

481
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:45.639
Tina Marie: I capture some of it, but not enough

482
00:49:46.153 --> 00:49:55.259
Tina Marie: cause. I know that we'll go back, and I'll be like, well, you were talking about this whatever. But so now, if we have the Transcript and keep the Transcript

483
00:49:56.041 --> 00:50:20.319
Tina Marie: and feed the transcript into one of whatever agent I'm using. Right. If you're okay with that, that's why I'm asking. Then we can go back and say, You know, what? What have we not been talking about that we talked about before. That we should be working on, or we need to circle back to, or whatever, so that we can extract even more out of the conversations than our brains can do on our own.

484
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:30.890
Tina Marie: And I think that I don't know. I think I think that iterative power grows exponentially when we

485
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:40.790
Tina Marie: handle it that way right? Because because there's just too much like there's too much that either I'll say as an idea, or you especially you and our calls.

486
00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:45.540
Tina Marie: We'll work through something, and I feel like it.

487
00:50:46.180 --> 00:51:02.100
Tina Marie: It it either dies on the vine or the power that was behind. It was something that just came to you in that moment was so clear in that moment. But the notes aren't captures good enough for you to even recall it in in its essence. If that makes sense.

488
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.100
Dan: Well, we just did that.

489
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.420
Tina Marie: I know that this exact.

490
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.130
Dan: I literally was like, oh, I never thought about it like this.

491
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:18.780
Tina Marie: Right? Right? Which is because that was one of the things I'm thinking. Okay, this is one I need to turn back to Dan and go like these are all the things that you just talked about, you know, and and.

492
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.590
Dan: Yeah. And I don't think I ever

493
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:36.519
Dan: right. As you know, I mean, I tend to have these ideas that they're only within myself. Right. So like, I never explain to someone. Oh, I see this whole cold, outreach thing based off of this scrape that I did that I got from this

494
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:48.520
Dan: Youtube reel that I saw one day, and I was like, Oh, wait a minute. What if I did? XYZ. But I and I just coincidentally just texted the dude like, Hey, man, I want you to work on this.

495
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:53.609
Dan: See? So step one is seeing if it can be automated.

496
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:58.420
Dan: But and then it was also like it wasn't time to do it, because

497
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:06.140
Dan: there was no book there was like. But all that stuff's gonna be done by the end of the month, like the community will be built. The book should be done.

498
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.040
Dan: the website and sales page should be done.

499
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.830
Dan: And then I'm going to figure out, I've got the couple lead magnets. I'll figure out. I mean, they worked.

500
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:28.689
Dan: So it's like, okay, in my view, there's like a lead magnet. Essentially, throughout the book. There's probably like 6 or 7 or 8. I just made another one for myself and showed it to Sean. He was like dude. This is awesome. I was like, Okay, I'm going to put that in the book.

501
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.170
Dan: and it could be illegal.

502
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:33.960
Tina Marie: And it could be what.

503
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.410
Dan: A lead magnet.

504
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:36.740
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

505
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.800
Dan: We're a resource. It's gonna be something. It's it'll be handy.

506
00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:48.370
Tina Marie: And the other thing is, you know, documenting like

507
00:52:48.530 --> 00:53:02.129
Tina Marie: sops, creating visual flow charts, like all the things that help the team get on the same page, stay on the same page. But then also those types of visuals and things that you can create for your users.

508
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.239
Tina Marie: Anyway, I think I think.

509
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:14.809
Dan: That's that. No, you're. It's interesting. You say that because that's the the thought that I had last week, I was like, Okay, so we keep bringing these bands on.

510
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.770
Dan: We're gonna have to like. Johnny can only build so many ads.

511
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.960
Dan: And like.

512
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:34.329
Dan: once we have an understanding of, or I have an understanding right like. No, this is no lie. I have no idea how these bands get into fanflowy. They just start appearing, and I'm like great

513
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:42.219
Dan: nor do I want to know right? It's like, I don't really need to know that it's I mean, it's very much like another 71 like I don't log into our

514
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.630
Dan: thing like, I've never seen the software. Why would I? Why would I look at that

515
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.285
Dan: here? I have seen the software? But

516
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.770
Dan: But it's like, okay, we're gonna need, like

517
00:53:53.370 --> 00:54:02.319
Dan: we're probably gonna have to. I would imagine the 1st thing. And this is what I'm trying to figure out like listening to them is the 1st thing we're gonna need to outsource

518
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:09.039
Dan: ad con like making ads. So a band comes on, and then we do the same thing every time, I'm pretty sure.

519
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.989
Dan: So I'm like, Okay, that's a repeatable process

520
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:15.439
Dan: that that process is not documented.

521
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:26.170
Dan: And I doubt it's the same every time. As far as like execution steps it should be. It should just be check, check, check check. But I guarantee it's not, and it's certainly not.

522
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.409
Dan: It doesn't exist in that format anywhere.

523
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:48.029
Dan: But it's like, that's the sort of stuff you're gonna need over there. It's like, Okay, what are we gonna start to automate or or outsource. And then we're gonna need an sop and a hit list. It's like, Okay, the band's on. And then they've the onboarding is complete. Now do this.

524
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.119
Dan: This is done. Now do this. This is done. Now do this.

525
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.650
Dan: And I don't think those guys I don't think those guys are equipped to.

526
00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.469
Dan: They've never done that, so it's like

527
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:08.879
Dan: it. But it's good. That's how I think that's where the bottlenecks will be. It'll be a bottleneck of process, or a bottleneck of people.

528
00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:19.970
Tina Marie: Yes, and it's been a long time since we've had that conversation, but bottleneck bust in was where I got my teeth. I cut my teeth to just

529
00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:48.869
Tina Marie: breaking it open and getting things flowing so but that it's it's interesting to me, too, because it's kind of come full circle that I've started to notice that I'm going back in that direction again, because it's been a lot of building and building and building whereas, like I had gotten started in things that were built but weren't flowing right? Because they needed those fixing. And yeah, anyway.

530
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:54.070
Dan: Well, it's interesting, right? AI solves like the thinking or the strategic.

531
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.069
Tina Marie: As long as.

532
00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.439
Dan: I'm not gonna solve that.

533
00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:06.980
Tina Marie: Here's the thing, though, in order for AI to do that, you have to be able to articulate the issue clearly enough, and guess what a lot of people can't do.

534
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:11.950
Dan: No, yeah, it's it's I tell people that all the time like it's only as good as the person talking to it.

535
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.010
Tina Marie: Right. But what they don't understand is that.

536
00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:15.420
Dan: Yeah, I know.

537
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:44.909
Tina Marie: That component of it like. How often people struggle to even define what an issue is, or describe what the situation is, which is one reason I keep trying to teach my girls and everybody else is understand language. People keep trying to dumb everything down like your copywriting needs to be simple, so simple that a 12th grader can do it. Now. Now, 6th grader, now 3rd grader like, I'm not gonna dumb down for anybody. If you have to go look something up, go look something up.

538
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:50.430
Tina Marie: But I don't want to attract people that can't understand those words, because the reason I use them

539
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:57.709
Tina Marie: isn't because I want you to think that I'm so smart. It's because of the precision of the word.

540
00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:26.069
Tina Marie: There are some words that when you try to string other words, together they lose their meaning. They lose their nuance. And there are, you know, and we know this about different languages. Right? They've got single words that mean entire phrases in English like. And they're like, I don't even know how to put it in English, because you guys don't have the words for it, and they just have one word, and it means all the things I'm like that's mind blowing to me. But anyway, to the point of

541
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:50.750
Tina Marie: the ability number 1 1st to comprehend, and then the ability to articulate it. I think AI is going to dumb people down right. They will be more regurgitators, which they already have been parrots. Right? I heard something, I repeated. I heard something, I repeated. But what's missing in the middle layer? Which is essential is the comprehension.

542
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:59.519
Tina Marie: and then the ability to articulate it in their own words. It's going to be like this self-feeding cesspool

543
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.800
Tina Marie: in January.

544
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.420
Dan: Would be.

545
00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:24.080
Tina Marie: Yeah, well, I don't think it will entirely. But I think that what I mean, I guess, basically, is that there will always, or at least in the near, foreseeable future, be a place for cerebrals for people that not, you know, in the in the day we had they were philosophers right, but

546
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.020
Tina Marie: just deeper thinkers

547
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:56.329
Tina Marie: and people who, instead of going tldr is too long. I don't want to read it. Give me the short version, will actually have a conversation of depth and nuance that can zigzag, and that can take, you know, 30 min to go full circle to come back to something. But because you did that you built this whole verbal perimeter around an image that is now contained inside of the story that you just expressed.

548
00:58:56.330 --> 00:59:01.380
Tina Marie: And now the fullness has been built

549
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:20.500
Tina Marie: visually because it was built verbally, which means it can now be built physically right in the real world, because somebody could express it. And I don't think that that is something everyone can do. I think it's a few people. I think it's more and more people, maybe, or maybe it just seems like it because

550
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:23.859
Tina Marie: of algorithms. And we're attracted to each other.

551
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.669
Dan: No, it'll be. It's you know. It's like

552
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.509
Dan: a certain subset of people will be able to leverage it in a in a way that other people can't.

553
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:39.650
Dan: And then that's gonna be us Bruh period end of story right?

554
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.340
Tina Marie: Yeah.

555
00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.409
Dan: And it's like all these dummies like

556
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:49.080
Dan: making their AI, this and AI that. And I'm like these are all just glorified zaps that like.

557
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.350
Tina Marie: That's what they are.

558
00:59:50.350 --> 01:00:03.160
Dan: Yeah. And they're not solving a problem that someone I'm telling you right now. The problem to solve is, give me the ability to make my own dedicated Gpts. I would easily pay 200 bucks.

559
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:14.559
Tina Marie: I figured that out. I figured that out. That's that's what I'm building. When I've built mine I'll show you. But it's a library. What's hold on to go see what.

560
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.789
Dan: I had. I had it figured out, I'm like, I'm not gonna build this.

561
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:24.010
Dan: I should. I should just outsource it. I should just find someone and go, hey, this is how I think it could be built. Build it.

562
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:27.200
Tina Marie: Did you get Clarence? Thank you so much. I love you.

563
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:30.077
Tina Marie: I mean, I love you. But that hold on one second.

564
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.210
Tina Marie: are you are, you guys, are you leaving? Yeah, can I have a hug?

565
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:54.390
Tina Marie: Okay, dude? I asked for no tomatoes on my crunch wrap. They put extra tomatoes, and I didn't even put the second tortilla on it, so just bored. It's rude. I think we should go get another crunch wrap later. I don't even. I don't even want to try. I should have just gotten a case. I miss playing games with you. We haven't played games for like over a week, maybe something. Okay. I love you.

566
01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.900
Tina Marie: Bye, bye, you could just leave the door open. I'm almost done.

567
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:07.540
Tina Marie: They'll they'll scratch at the door eventually, if I close the door. Hudson is like. Let me in.

568
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.600
Dan: Hey! Hey! Hey! No!

569
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.620
Tina Marie: Speaking of dogs, no.

570
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.240
Dan: Quiet.

571
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:21.879
Tina Marie: Okay, so hold on. Let me see if this was the one, anyway.

572
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:46.529
Tina Marie: basically, because I've been talking to freaking all of these ais forever about not being able to get somebody to like an AI to write like me. And the biggest issue is because they can't support a big enough library to understand so much of the nuance like it. Take, it will take them a lot to recognize any kind of my patterns. And basically they're just gonna have to repeat them because they can't use.

573
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:59.370
Tina Marie: They're too common. My analogies are incredibly uncommon. And I didn't even know that or think about that until I was trying to go through this process right? It wasn't like I'm so special. But

574
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:08.370
Tina Marie: anyway, let's see, chroma. dB, it's a database plus lane chain plus Gpt. 4 and Claude.

575
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:20.059
Tina Marie: But then I got an iterative. Anyway, I'll build it if you can go hire somebody to do it. But I would bet you that what I'll do is going to be better than what somebody else would do for you potentially.

576
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.160
Dan: Where.

577
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.569
Dan: So the chroma dB, is, where you're gonna load your blobs, or whatever.

578
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:45.429
Tina Marie: I think so. I think that's the database where we're going to put in. I haven't ran it through Grock yet to see if it has a better thing, so it's a combination of pine cone, chromadb, lane chain, and then gpt 4 or cloud. But it may be grok now and then fast. Api.

579
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:57.349
Tina Marie: so it's separate system. Api, that base with fast Api, and then for a faster one. Never mind. That's that's the the variation. So, yeah, that's that's the system.

580
01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.200
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

581
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.190
Tina Marie: Yeah, I think I I ended up.

582
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.910
Dan: With like using Google docs

583
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:20.630
Dan: because it was like, Oh, yeah, no. Pine cone is not going to cut what you're trying to do. It's eventually gonna fail on you. And I was like, okay. And then it directed me to using Google Docs. And then the Google Docs would be each.

584
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.480
Dan: I forget what the word is. It's not blob, but

585
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.089
Dan: the Google, Doc would be each chunk.

586
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.060
Dan: And it's like, Yeah, you you can create your chunks in Google Docs.

587
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:35.490
Dan: And then you would have like a spreadsheet that says.

588
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:39.899
Dan: Hey, this chunk title is associated with this

589
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:49.049
Dan: Gpt or this idea? Right? So if I had songwriting as one, and then dan as another one like or business, you'd have a

590
01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:54.290
Dan: spreadsheet that acted like the database. And then, when you said, Hey, I want to work on a song.

591
01:03:54.891 --> 01:03:57.299
Dan: You know. Tap into the

592
01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:24.550
Dan: you could either tap have a tap into the whole thing, but it was like, no, you'd never be able to tap into the whole thing. But what you could do is say, Hey, I want to write a song using the cut up method. And then, and you're like last session would also exist as a chunk, so you could like even reference, your last section. But all your stuff is there? But it was like there's a limit to how much you can ask it to access at one time.

593
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:32.869
Dan: So they're like you could have all kinds of stuff there and then, if you tell it, which chunks, you want it to use, it, will. And I was like, Okay, that's interesting.

594
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:41.580
Tina Marie: So to that point. Well, 1st of all, the reason I didn't use Google Docs because it did suggest, that is like, I'm trying to avoid all the big like Meta Google

595
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.280
Tina Marie: at whatever they've.

596
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:43.770
Dan: Guys.

597
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:47.580
Tina Marie: Anyway. Yeah, I was. I was. I was pretty much trying to do that because I do

598
01:04:47.770 --> 01:05:08.479
Tina Marie: whatever I'm tiny and insignificant. But my thought process is just enough distinct that I'm like, what whatever but so to the point of separating the agents and the roles, I think that that is the key point. So what we can't do with people as much because of cost, right? We can do with agents.

599
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:33.170
Tina Marie: So like, I have a business strategist slash CEO, coo a content copywriter, a a researcher, right? But the researcher reports to the business strategist. So it does. The research for marketing. It does the research for content content? For competition, things like that. Then there's a content writer, and then there's a copywriter, and there and then

600
01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:47.390
Tina Marie: a Cfo and a Cmo. But and also a sales agent. So they're all and I, I actually want to get more granular so that we have

601
01:05:47.938 --> 01:05:53.910
Tina Marie: agents reporting to agents as long as that actually works. And they don't lose information.

602
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:58.590
Tina Marie: So that we've got basically like the the C-level team.

603
01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:05.489
Tina Marie: And then they've got teams that report to them so that they're not getting bogged down with too many tasks.

604
01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:20.789
Tina Marie: But each one is doing a specialized task and reporting the progress, the content, the issues up the chain, and seeing. I don't know if it works better or worse that way. But I think

605
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:33.180
Tina Marie: that, based on what I know just about electronics and segmentation and everything else on a coding level. I think that it would work better that way. I don't know how fast, or whatever. But

606
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.570
Tina Marie: anyway, so I'm starting.

607
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.020
Dan: This.

608
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:35.490
Tina Marie: Colors.

609
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:40.670
Dan: This like is any of this desktop, or it's all like a web app.

610
01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:55.119
Tina Marie: It's neither. So right now it's all being built. So it can be local on my machine built in python through the terminal, but

611
01:06:55.850 --> 01:07:20.469
Tina Marie: I want to be able to access it from either machine, and I also want it to be faster. I don't have the server type of hardware that I want to have. So I'm using Linode instead. But then it should be able to be, and I don't know if Linode can do it, or if it has to be an external package. But I know that there's something that can help me create it into a package that can make it a desktop installer.

612
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.990
Dan: Gotcha.

613
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:25.179
Dan: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, Jack, about that.

614
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:39.049
Tina Marie: Because what I also know is, if I can build this for me, then I can either sell, and it would be separate than mine, right? Total, different data. So mine can't be corrupted. But either interface access to it as a software, as a service

615
01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:47.759
Tina Marie: or you know, a standalone package, and it's a it's something that people use and and do themselves

616
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:54.100
Tina Marie: have access to themselves, you know, on their own desktop or whatever. But anyway, the 1st thing.

617
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:54.890
Dan: Like the ultimate.

618
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:55.740
Tina Marie: My own problem.

619
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.750
Dan: And brain.

620
01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:13.460
Tina Marie: Yeah, but specifically trained around business. And specifically in business, trained around fundamental concepts. Right? We are not the grinders. We are not making money for the sake of money like there's a set of parameters and values that rule

621
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.859
Tina Marie: and that

622
01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:44.219
Tina Marie: because of that, the output and the guidance that is received is going to be of a particular kind of quality. Right? So the person that wants to go make a billion dollars like making porn videos of kids not going to want my stuff, and people that want to create addicting softwares and gambling things are not going to want this stuff because it's not going to give them that plan. But people that want to, you know you know what I mean, like trying to segment and keep.

623
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:50.299
Dan: Well, yeah, I mean, what would be what would be super interesting is to like, have it so that you could

624
01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:56.529
Dan: second brain yourself. Right. So you're like, Hey, I can build this second brain around me. And then I could.

625
01:08:56.769 --> 01:08:57.909
Dan: I could

626
01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:17.599
Dan: subdivide that right because we're not right. Even you would never want just your brain right? Or your brain is really just a bunch of different pieces. Right? There's the music part of your brain. There's the mom, part of your brain. There's the the, you know, religion, part of your brain. So you could, you'd build separate ones of that. And then

627
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:24.219
Dan: together, they're your brain right, because that it would see the commonalities with way you speak and think.

628
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:29.120
Tina Marie: Actually already seen that, and put Jesus Christ at the center of all of my business stuff.

629
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:39.320
Dan: Right? Yeah, then you have like, so that's the the main thing. You're selling the second brain thing. But then you give people the ability to tap into

630
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:44.479
Dan: either other people's brains if they wanted, or

631
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:50.600
Dan: other people's realm of expertise. Right? So if I wanted a

632
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:58.100
Dan: music theory thing, I would just pay an extra dollar a month to also access the music theory. Brain.

633
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.470
Tina Marie: Well, but then you get whatever

634
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:03.469
Tina Marie: copyright stuff unless we're talking about. What's it called.

635
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:09.540
Dan: No, no, but it's like they're they're no, no, they're putting it on the platform, and then you're paying them a rip.

636
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.529
Dan: right? So it's.

637
01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:12.500
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

638
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.079
Dan: Right. So it's like you're you're licensing it.

639
01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.870
Dan: But they've put it on your platform to be licensed.

640
01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:24.909
Dan: So it's like they could get 10,000 people paying a dollar a month.

641
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.650
Dan: and then you're getting a rip of it, and they're getting a rip of it, or whatever.

642
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:43.049
Tina Marie: I think. Ultimately I want to build, you know, for a few years and and capitalize on this time that has never existed is never going to exist again. There may be a version, right? Because basically, when the Internet went high speed, that's what I compare this to right now.

643
01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:44.640
Tina Marie: and that.

644
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.320
Dan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's Wild West, all right.

645
01:10:47.320 --> 01:11:14.139
Tina Marie: But so for a few years, and just really capitalize on it, milk it for all I can get. The millions that I know that I can get. But then take that basically top out, sell out, take those, and let my money work for itself. Reinvest. Use my brain, you know, to be a a solver right in other people's businesses. And just so I don't. I don't need a ton. But I just wanna I want to keep learning. I want to get my doctorate in psychology. Phd.

646
01:11:14.947 --> 01:11:17.939
Tina Marie: I wanna do stuff like that. So.

647
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.859
Dan: You know what's interesting that I ever thought about? It's like you always hear about

648
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:27.980
Dan: in sci-fi. It's like, Oh, and then we're gonna be able to upload our consciousness. But it's like.

649
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.140
Dan: really right now in

650
01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:37.939
Dan: you could upload. It's not really your consciousness, but it is a version of you, right. So I was just thinking like

651
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:44.920
Dan: God. If Elon launched like Elon, bought and charged a buck a month to talk to Elon, he'd crush it.

652
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.120
Dan: It would crush.

653
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:51.849
Dan: But it's not just him. There's lots of people that could do that, I mean, that's what Delphi's whole angle is.

654
01:11:53.530 --> 01:12:02.690
Dan: but it's only as good. It's only as good as how it it takes in the data and is able to give you an answer that like, that's the issue you're running into. Right? It's like.

655
01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:24.569
Tina Marie: And also your ability to wrap your head around it. So, for example, so we would take these tests and my reading comprehension level was 98 percentile. And I never like really thought about that until later on in life, when I'd hear people say, well, I never had that thought before. It never occurred to me, but they're talking about thoughts that I have all day, every day, and it's never.

656
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:32.750
Dan: That it's a valid point. Yeah, it would almost. It would almost have to quiz them after like, do you understand? Do you? Are you understanding what I'm saying, and I would have to.

657
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:54.389
Tina Marie: Have to teach them line upon line to even build, because they would physically be building their neural network. They, that's what happens when we learn. So let's say somebody's got, let's say, and these are not the real numbers, right that somebody's born, and they've got a thousand neural connections. Somebody else is born, and they've got 10,000 neural connections. That's a physical difference of comprehension.

658
01:12:55.050 --> 01:13:20.569
Tina Marie: They can't change that, but they can, but they can't do it quickly. So let's say, the person with 10,000 connections, you know, reads constantly and and fills it. Now they've got 10 million. The person with 10,000 or 1,000 connections does the same thing, but they're still, you know, they're 10 multiples behind. They're they're not going to be able to catch up now. They're plugging into an Elon brain. Those connections. There's no there's no nodes to even attach to

659
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:36.620
Tina Marie: what they're trying to learn. People want to say like there there is no real equalizer. There is no real equality when it comes to intelligent ability. And all these things, which is one of the reasons I'm very grateful for my brain because God gave it to me. I didn't.

660
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:40.660
Tina Marie: But but anyway but what we can do

661
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:59.639
Tina Marie: it doesn't matter right, because people I used to say, people just want to be happy. But what I heard. And now what I believe is that people don't. Most people don't just want to be happy. I think elevated people do. But most people want to escape pain. They're not thinking about being happy. They're thinking about escaping pain.

662
01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:22.180
Tina Marie: So that's 1 element of it that you have to think in like in terms of when you're marketing, and they say, don't sell them what they need, give them what they want, sell them what they want, give them what they need, because what they want is to not hurt in the way that they're hurting at the moment, whereas, you know Maslow's hierarchy, people that have elevated up on that pyramid.

663
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:38.280
Tina Marie: they they want more. And so all of that comes into account, too, and is relative to what we build for ourselves and what we build for other people, and being able to identify who those people are, and remembering that

664
01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:59.620
Tina Marie: when we think we're building something. Of course they're going to want it. You're assuming that they're working with the same things that you have, including the neural networks, right? Just even the ability to comprehend what you're giving them. And you're you. So many times we've had this conversation. It's like they just don't get it. They just don't get it, I'm saying sometimes they don't even have the.

665
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.320
Dan: Can't get it.

666
01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.400
Tina Marie: That's exactly it. Incapable.

667
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.150
Dan: Yeah.

668
01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:08.500
Tina Marie: We don't gotta think about that more often, I think, because

669
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:15.110
Tina Marie: it also makes it easier to be patient with people sometimes, because how can I hold somebody accountable and and just

670
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.849
Tina Marie: like it seems even mean to say stupid or

671
01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:24.660
Tina Marie: unintelligent? If they are, is it their fault? You know.

672
01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.029
Dan: Right? Yeah, it's it's not intentional.

673
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.930
Tina Marie: Right?

674
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:30.680
Tina Marie: Anyway.

675
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.299
Tina Marie: Another deep dive.

676
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:36.880
Dan: It hurts stupid stomach bones.

677
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:38.569
Tina Marie: Alright, sir, I'm gonna.

678
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:39.250
Dan: Alright!

679
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:42.989
Tina Marie: To Grok and see what Grok says about Dan's brilliance.

680
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.100
Dan: And okay.

681
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.360
Tina Marie: I'll send it back to you.

682
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.460
Dan: All right.

683
01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:50.259
Tina Marie: We'll talk to you later. Have a good day and go get Jenny some pets.

684
01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.215
Dan: Alright!

685
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:52.930
Dan: Right!
