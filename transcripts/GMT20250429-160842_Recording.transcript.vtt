22
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.490

Pain Management: Yeah, I don't know.

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:44.849
Pain Management: So that's usually what I do. I'll explain to her on, sure, and I'll see you tomorrow. I will see you tomorrow right.

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.836
Pain Management: Oh, I should have pushed pause. Huh!

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.446
Pain Management: Yeah, you know.

30
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.970
Pain Management: Okay, guys. So Patricia, she said, it's coming today, right for the MRI. But there's an a person she wants to add for a consult with her

31
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.020
Pain Management: like I think they were together in the car accident. So just watch out on that email from Vanessa

32
00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.580
Pain Management: Carolina.

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.379
Pain Management: Yeah, I scheduled today at 11.

34
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.190
Pain Management: Yeah.

35
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.150
Pain Management: I believe.

36
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.580
Pain Management: Let me turn the lights on.

37
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.350
Pain Management: Okay, before we start. I would like to say good job to Kenya yesterday for doing

38
00:02:26.148 --> 00:02:28.420
Pain Management: 6 patients come in. It's 6.

39
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.383
Pain Management: Thank you.

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.660
Pain Management: Was I it was all of us, though.

41
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.120
Pain Management: Yeah, but I know that, you know I'm putting heavy.

42
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.370
Pain Management: 3, 4.

43
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:51.109
Pain Management: You know, heavy weight on making sure they come, and you probably hear me being redundant. And I'm just worried because you're by yourself and Dr. E. Just came, and I know he's all over the place

44
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.120
Pain Management: so, and you'll get used to redirecting him.

45
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.795
Pain Management: Yeah.

46
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.059
Pain Management: And you know I wanted to tell Maria because Maria was not there with us, so

47
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.670
Pain Management: I know. I think you were asking Laura Lee, or you're telling Laura Lee about our patience. On Friday.

48
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:34.449
Pain Management: I was. I was just asking if they knew the schedule if they knew his schedule for Thursday. Because I kid you not, I would ask Dr. Eo like when he would have like kind of like, at least like no, obviously no more than 5 min downtime. But he would have some downtime in the office where we sit, and I would ask him how to be like, oh, doctor, A. Do you know your schedule for Thursday yet? And he would pick up his phone and be like, Yeah, and then walk out of the room

49
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.540
Pain Management: like like that.

50
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.829
Pain Management: It happened like 5 times

51
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.289
Pain Management: since I was out there while you were with that patient in the room when I left.

52
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.989
Pain Management: I just asked them if they knew their schedule for Thursday.

53
00:03:46.992 --> 00:04:03.630
Pain Management: Because I. I told them that I accidentally booked some people in at the wrong location on Friday, and they're like, Oh, we have 48 patients on Friday here at Huntington, and then one of the other girls was kind of like, please don't book us anymore, like, please.

54
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:20.219
Pain Management: because sometimes we don't leave till 7, 7, 30, and then I and then Lorelli I mean Lorelli was really nice about it. Kind of. She was just telling me like, oh, we don't have access to the old, to the, to the Timbras with you guys, but they should this, they should be part of this 48.

55
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:37.730
Pain Management: Yeah. So it's okay. I think you know him coming back. It was kind of 40. It is a lot. But at the same time. We've scheduled our Fridays before he had vacation, so

56
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.199
Pain Management: I think, for now we try our best to book less, I guess.

57
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:47.460
Pain Management: As much as possible. On a Friday.

58
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.570
Pain Management: Yeah, cause they were telling me.

59
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.840
Pain Management: It would just be, yeah.

60
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.040
Pain Management: They do, their injection.

61
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.420
Pain Management: Yeah, just be mindful, and you don't have to ask. You can also load

62
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.230
Pain Management: cause you know, Cheryl texted me last night.

63
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.219
Pain Management: Oh, with Dr. E.

64
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:15.129
Pain Management: And I'm not again. I'm not gonna engage. I choose not to engage, she says. Please do not book any more procedures on Friday. So things like that. Just ask me or ask Maria Maria can. Also, you guys know how to look at Dr. E. Schedule right?

65
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:33.089
Pain Management: So just look at that, and if you click all locations you'll see just on his name, because sometimes other people's name will be added, so it's fine. We have how many patients we need to move them right? Maria. So to answer your question, I think I told you Thursday, we're gonna have.

66
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.409
Pain Management: Yeah. So let's try to move as much as possible like today, like, there is a Wednesday right? Schedule.

67
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.339
Pain Management: Yes, I called her, and I left a voicemail.

68
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.080
Pain Management: Yeah, so and just text her as well. But just say, you know the

69
00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:03.539
Pain Management: the provider, whoever the anesthesia is, who will do the injection, unfortunately, won't be able to make it on Wednesday. So just kind of apologize about that one.

70
00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:08.020
Pain Management: And I'm sure you guys talk to them, you know, with rescheduling.

71
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.140
Pain Management: Yeah, yeah.

72
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:16.070
Pain Management: And then on Thursday I have Lake Forest, so Alma Barragon, the epidural, for Long Beach.

73
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.670
Pain Management: Yeah, I'll just call her and tell her.

74
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.240
Pain Management: And moved. In the afternoon.

75
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.590
Pain Management: And.

76
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.549
Pain Management: Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure Dr. E. Might do an exception for 1130. Maybe we can do her first, st

77
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.620
Pain Management: you know, like I don't see an afternoon schedule yet.

78
00:06:35.053 --> 00:06:36.660
Pain Management: For procedures

79
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.939
Pain Management: for Thursday, so I guess we'll let's just move some of the Friday mornings to the Thursday afternoon?

80
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.489
Pain Management: Are you guys clear on that one.

81
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.440
Pain Management: Yeah.

82
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.879
Pain Management: Okay, so let's try our best to do that today, cause it's already Tuesday. And

83
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:04.587
Pain Management: you haven't seen it's yeah. So the the brochure. The pamphlet is big.

84
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.510
Pain Management: It's bigger than the paper bag.

85
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.270
Pain Management: Oh, really.

86
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.579
Pain Management: Yeah, but it's really nice, though. Hold on, let me grab it

87
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:33.379
Pain Management: with this one. It's oh, I don't know if you can see it. How do I remove the blurry? But, anyway, can you see it.

88
00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:37.270
Pain Management: I could only see doctor. He's oh, right there.

89
00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:41.670
Pain Management: It blurs out my theme. How do I fix this? I don't know.

90
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.910
Pain Management: Oh, there!

91
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.780
Pain Management: T.

92
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.720
Pain Management: Oh, okay.

93
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.630
Pain Management: This is the printed one.

94
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.310
Pain Management: Move far, but it's so nice. I like it.

95
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.425
Pain Management: I think, Vanessa message that

96
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.300
Pain Management: Yeah.

97
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.640
Pain Management: Can you? This call it the business card? It's not glossy right.

98
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.540
Pain Management: No.

99
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.930
Pain Management: Okay, that's fine. We can just use it for next time.

100
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.590
Pain Management: Yeah.

101
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.999
Pain Management: It's bigger, and then tomorrow, I think it's bigger.

102
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.629
Pain Management: Because the glossy was. I told you it was delivery only, and it would have not got here till today.

103
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.240
Pain Management: Oh, yeah.

104
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.940
Pain Management: Do that.

105
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:24.129
Pain Management: Yeah, we don't want to do that. We wanted to be prepared. Meet up time tomorrow.

106
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.259
Pain Management: I think 10 o'clock should be enough time.

107
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:37.400
Pain Management: Yeah. And then, did you want this to be? I had a question. I don't know if it's a dumb question. But did you want this to be like in scrubs, or like formal attire, or

108
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:48.940
Pain Management: you're comfortable with I I know Dr. E. Will be on scrubs cause he has probably procedures. I know Barron will be on scrubs. His. You guys haven't met her, so you probably meet her in person.

109
00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:55.679
Pain Management: Whatever you're comfortable with. I think this scrubs is good. You're already comfortable with that right?

110
00:08:56.393 --> 00:08:59.149
Pain Management: I'm also thinking of wearing a scrub.

111
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.260
Pain Management: Okay, you let us know when your final decision.

112
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:10.750
Pain Management: And maybe just wear. But whatever you're comfortable with, there's it's really, what do you guys want to wear? Do you always want to dress up like business casual. That's okay, too.

113
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.090
Pain Management: I think transcripts.

114
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:18.800
Pain Management: I think scrubs is like cause scrubs look formal, and that we don't have to stress about what we're gonna have to pick.

115
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:27.720
Pain Management: I'm also stressing out about it. I'm thinking about it, and I honestly do not, you know, want to dress up, but obviously make yourself presentable.

116
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.100
Pain Management: Yeah, of course. Yeah.

117
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100
Pain Management: I think I might wear, not my white long coat, but just a white jacket.

118
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.090
Pain Management: Yeah.

119
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.480
Pain Management: And what else

120
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.219
Pain Management: I think we're. It's 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock should be enough time for us to meet here in the house.

121
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.385
Pain Management: Right, Maria, but or cause we will have a lot of

122
00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:03.060
Pain Management: a few patients today, I just want us to send the email before the event. You know, you guys are welcome to come early. You tell you guys tell me.

123
00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:12.755
Pain Management: what do you guys want? Do you guys? Or obviously, it depends on me. Right. I need to make sure the night before the the notes are done. How about.

124
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.430
Pain Management: Yeah.

125
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:22.920
Pain Management: Okay, cause that way, when you guys come, we'll just focus on just what we're doing.

126
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.720
Pain Management: Yeah.

127
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.759
Pain Management: Do you guys have questions about tomorrow's event?

128
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.649
Pain Management: Like, what exactly are we gonna be doing.

129
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:57.590
Pain Management: Okay. So tomorrow's event before this, in December, just a quick summary. In December we met the big, the bigwigs, the the main, the main owners. And we basically pitch our service. And it's been 4 months to be exact that they're using us. So now they kinda we kinda like prove ourselves. So now they're gonna roll us into the entire company. So that's why we're meeting everyone.

130
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:03.089
Pain Management: And and apparently they have multiple teams. And so far, we're only working on 4.

131
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:12.770
Pain Management: So if they're gonna roll us over the entire team. So I I hope it's gonna be more busy after this. So I'm gonna talk first, st

132
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.160
Pain Management: whatever.

133
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.480
Pain Management: Oh, my God!

134
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.530
Pain Management: 1st and introduce us, introduce our

135
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:36.672
Pain Management: group, and maybe just say we already work with them. And just basically talk about this, what we offer. This. Is really it right? Because this is the fast turnover in house billing. I'm just gonna reiterate this, and then I'll introduce

136
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:54.959
Pain Management: I'll introduce you guys as well. You guys don't have to talk. It's just this is our group. And then Dr. E. Will talk. He's probably going to talk about procedures, and then we'll we'll introduce Dr. Farren as a neurosurgeon. That work with us, and we might have another orthopedic doctor that

137
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:10.192
Pain Management: we will also introduce. So my goal is, the talk will be less than 20, Max. 30 min, because we don't want to talk our heads off. We want them to eat, and the main goal is when the food comes,

138
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:18.850
Pain Management: main goal is to just talk to them and mingle. And you guys are representing us. So you guys talk as well

139
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.179
Pain Management: to them, and we'll give out.

140
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.620
Pain Management: Okay.

141
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:29.110
Pain Management: After the talk, or or while they're eating, make sure we're handing out the the what do you call that? The good.

142
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.680
Pain Management: 30 bucks.

143
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.620
Pain Management: The goodie bags.

144
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.330
Pain Management: It's only like a few pieces inside, like

145
00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:40.054
Pain Management: there's a chips. There's a it's like maybe 3 or 4 pieces, which is fine.

146
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.410
Pain Management: Not everyone gives Goody Bag.

147
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:45.919
Pain Management: Yeah.

148
00:12:46.190 --> 00:13:00.000
Pain Management: I mean, I want. I know I was. We would have prepared more by giving cute stuff. Mark is thinking like, remember, Maria, the the cute stuff toy. We don't have time. So that's fine. I know we're starting big.

149
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:08.919
Pain Management: Usually we start small. But this is a big firm. This is, you know, sweet James is huge. It's 1 of the biggest in California. So

150
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:21.399
Pain Management: which, you know, we're starting with a bank. So the goal is, maybe every month. We have to do this at least twice a month to meaning 2 law firms to kind of do this.

151
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:28.239
Pain Management: Introduce us. Basically, we're this is marketing. We're marketing ourselves. That is our goal, right?

152
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.080
Pain Management: Yeah.

153
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.540
Pain Management: And you guys are very important in this

154
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.369
Pain Management: group to make it work. So if they talk to you, just talk, you know.

155
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.230
Pain Management: just whatever you're presenting the group and your pain management.

156
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.130
Pain Management: And if you don't, just.

157
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.060
Pain Management: you know, if you don't know the answer, then then don't

158
00:13:47.570 --> 00:14:13.460
Pain Management: just just be yourself. Just be yourself. You know we are, but you are just just know that you are representing us, and we we work as a team as a team, not individually. That's why I was like the, you know, like, like you see on Dr. E. And I like we're not. I mean, you work with Dr. E. You know he's not. There are worse doctors, so we are.

159
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:13.970
Pain Management: Yeah.

160
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:22.249
Pain Management: We're fortunate we haven't. He might be all over the place. That's why our job is to make sure. Like to keep to keep him

161
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.840
Pain Management: at bay.

162
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:31.640
Pain Management: Okay, a few things, anything that's glaring in your end.

163
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.230
Pain Management: We already talk about procedure rescheduling like I said, let's try our best to

164
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:54.189
Pain Management: not schedule so much on a Friday. I understand the girls point of view, too. We don't want them to stay too long. And maybe, Kenya, what we're gonna do this Friday is we're probably gonna get them. Maybe food.

165
00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:03.239
Pain Management: Like at the end, like for just the staff. Just I understand you. No one wants to. Sometimes they're there 7 o'clock, and

166
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:11.859
Pain Management: because it's, you know, and even though yes, ours is not a lot. What how many procedures we have really in Huntington Beach? 3.

167
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.940
Pain Management: Yeah.

168
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:20.860
Pain Management: Right. And we're rescheduling the rest. So technically, it's a lab. But we're, you know, we're also wanting to.

169
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:32.309
Pain Management: I actually prefer to make sure that we work with them. Cheryl is whatever she's not happy with me, and she's never going to be but the staff. It's you know, they're the ones that's gonna suffer.

170
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.260
Pain Management: Yeah.

171
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.560
Pain Management: So.

172
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.240
Pain Management: So.

173
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.395
Pain Management: And then work work delegation.

174
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.290
Pain Management: Kenya, you wanted to tell us about what you were saying yesterday to me.

175
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:50.150
Pain Management: Oh, yes, I had just brought Jonah up kind of like like, maybe like

176
00:15:50.796 --> 00:15:54.043
Pain Management: making. I don't know how to explain it.

177
00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:20.580
Pain Management: like setting like, okay, this person is what their main job is to do like for me, like it's procedures and scheduling. But I've just kind of been like all over the place because of the like getting the event stuff ready. But I mean, after the event, since that's all over tomorrow, like, kind of like, okay, this person mainly does this unless I mean, obviously, I want, I want to learn everything in cases where Maria needs to step away or things like that. I can help as well.

178
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:27.130
Pain Management: But it's like me. I'm I'm doing scheduling. And this person is doing this, or only because I feel like

179
00:16:27.596 --> 00:16:30.919
Pain Management: I just don't want to feel like I'm not doing anything either.

180
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:53.493
Pain Management: So, and thank you for pointing that out. I think you know you just started and you got thrown in right away. And I did ask your help a lot on this event, and which I'm we're very grateful. I think, Maria, she feel bad that she's not helping enough for you especially yesterday. We're we're like in

181
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.380
Pain Management: We we got busy at work.

182
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.999
Pain Management: No, I know I know procedures gets really busy. I I understand.

183
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.589
Pain Management: I think I think procedure procedure days.

184
00:17:07.713 --> 00:17:15.380
Pain Management: We want you to be in charge and procedure, and and until you're more comfortable with it. Then, obviously, we'll

185
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:30.830
Pain Management: we'll kind of not free range. You'll be, you know, free range, in a way. But for now you're still new, and Maria is basically in a way, doing double work, helping you out as well. Kenya.

186
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:43.379
Pain Management: On, especially on doing the procedures. I'm not gonna do the notes here after our after we're done. You haven't sent any procedure notes right? Because last week there's no procedures.

187
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.060
Pain Management: You think.

188
00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:46.670
Pain Management: Me, or her.

189
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.110
Pain Management: Like us.

190
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.680
Pain Management: Oh no!

191
00:17:49.680 --> 00:18:02.960
Pain Management: So I want. I wanna make sure that it is sent correctly. The procedure now should be straightforward. Right? It's just the procedures and the bills, but I know the consult is a little bit more tricky, and I know

192
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:12.929
Pain Management: Maria being a nurse, she understands obviously well on the plan, and what to do on like the prescription. All of that. So.

193
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.620
Pain Management: But the procedure notes the building of that should be all falls on you.

194
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:30.069
Pain Management: If you have question that would be Maria. Is that is that clear? I know we're gonna be evolve as we go. And since it's just the 2 of you for now, and

195
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:42.169
Pain Management: you're gonna have to really work with each other on this. And I know it's probably all over the place now, because we don't really have a set. Oh, this is what you do, this, what you do. It's more of you guys helping each other with this.

196
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:42.650
Pain Management: Yeah.

197
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:47.499
Pain Management: Would you be with Maria More on the day to day?

198
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.620
Pain Management: Flow

199
00:18:49.800 --> 00:19:07.419
Pain Management: off the schedules and getting the assessment? But I know it takes some time to get the assessment at times, and then the phone would ring, and then the the email would go on. So I know it's hard because we're not in one office right where we don't know what each other is really doing. But

200
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.240
Pain Management: but I'm not saying that

201
00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:18.089
Pain Management: and and that's okay. As long as the job is done right. As long as someone answers the email.

202
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.879
Pain Management: Someone which I think you guys are doing great with that

203
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.640
Pain Management: unless you there's something that I'm not seeing that you guys tell me.

204
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:34.619
Pain Management: is there an anything that we need to work on? Is the test working?

205
00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:40.190
Pain Management: I'm trying to put in? Is it working for you? I saw, Maria, that you put some on yours.

206
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.771
Pain Management: Yeah, I had put some on my.

207
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.640
Pain Management: Is it like helping or.

208
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:51.850
Pain Management: But like the ones that like like the new consoles that come in, and they're like all call after 2.

209
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.680
Pain Management: Right.

210
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.979
Pain Management: Sometimes, like I I would forget, like, you know, cause the day goes just by like so fast.

211
00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:10.060
Pain Management: Isn't it helpful? Because I forget stuff like I put on your or everyone stats about Alan Perez. I don't know if you I want you. I want us guys to keep looking at this, because the signal every 4 weeks it will be erased right.

212
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:28.649
Pain Management: I guess we can search like we can do the search bar and search the name, but it's not gonna be too accurate, and I have to tell myself to to use the task, because at least it's concrete, and if it's done, you check it off like the Alan Paris one. It was emailed right? Them right?

213
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.360
Pain Management: Yeah.

214
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.129
Pain Management: Yeah. So I'm gonna check it off now. So just check it off once you're done that way, we all know.

215
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.680
Pain Management: And then Kenya.

216
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.699
Pain Management: Kenya. We have to ask Dr. E.

217
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.940
Pain Management: Okay, I'll ask. Today. I'll remember.

218
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:53.329
Pain Management: Remember it's I put it in there, and I forgot myself. I put it in there because we yesterday, Maria. We talked to him like so much, and we took us a long time to talk about to order food.

219
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.511
Pain Management: because the guy on the phone is old.

220
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.939
Pain Management: Oh, my! Gosh!

221
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.040
Pain Management: He was kind of mean. He was telling Jonah like, pay attention to me.

222
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.020
Pain Management: Yeah.

223
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.687
Pain Management: What the hell.

224
00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.970
Pain Management: He's old, you know. It's like, that's why you know I don't.

225
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:16.449
Pain Management: But yeah, no, Esais, we we need to know guys. If if maybe we can even text him.

226
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.279
Pain Management: So like things like this, because the attorney is waiting for answer.

227
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.669
Pain Management: like the ses, can we do? 5. 5. Placement and removal. 5, 9. And technically, that's just 4 days.

228
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.420
Pain Management: Okay, so I I leave you on that. Kenya. Okay.

229
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.180
Pain Management: Okay.

230
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.939
Pain Management: So just I don't think we have access on the tasks, on our phone, on the Gmail app.

231
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.000
Pain Management: Cause you guys, it would be easier right if.

232
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.960
Pain Management: Yeah.

233
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.109
Pain Management: No, I don't see one.

234
00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:03.120
Pain Management: Hmm, but see, like on our phone, we can do the the task like here, you know the task that I said remember. So

235
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.510
Pain Management: I mean, like, remember the task that we did on.

236
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.449
Pain Management: Yeah, I like the thread.

237
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:20.730
Pain Management: The thread. And yeah, no like on the chat under chat. And then says, Task, I mean, we

238
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.640
Pain Management: huh!

239
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:30.479
Pain Management: We can utilize that as well, or you guys wanted to do the task. But at least the task here, you can see it on your phone.

240
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.349
Pain Management: So which one is it? It's up to you guys.

241
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.680
Pain Management: cause I know I know you guys go and

242
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.529
Pain Management: do something outside, which is again, Hello.

243
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:51.519
Pain Management: fine! But like I said, you know you do your own time as as long as the job is done, I think. Maria, you have Tebra access on your phone right.

244
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.999
Pain Management: Yeah, but I don't know if it gives me access to the fast pane. One I tried logging or.

245
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.039
Pain Management: You know what me, too.

246
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.300
Pain Management: There's.

247
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.430
Pain Management: I think we have to sign out and sign back in or no.

248
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.990
Pain Management: No, it won't, Kenya. You have access to the fast pane, Doc, or the West Side.

249
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.760
Pain Management: Have access to both.

250
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.360
Pain Management: Wait? How.

251
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.500
Pain Management: I don't know.

252
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.540
Pain Management: I just. I just logged in.

253
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.620
Pain Management: And it was there.

254
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.310
Pain Management: I don't know if it has to do with how Cheryl set up.

255
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.900
Pain Management: You have to. You have access to both.

256
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.030
Pain Management: Yeah, let me double check, though.

257
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:22.830
Pain Management: Wait.

258
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.850
Pain Management: How do I? I'm here? No, I only have access to the old one.

259
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.870
Pain Management: Let me see, let me see, let me double check.

260
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.869
Pain Management: And it says, West, sign, pain, management.

261
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.229
Pain Management: Yeah, maybe I have to.

262
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.419
Pain Management: Maybe. Oh, I we can't practice name, Maria. We can.

263
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.610
Pain Management: Where is that? At.

264
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:48.619
Pain Management: You'll look at settings on the on the you see this on top.

265
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.679
Pain Management: Click this and then click settings.

266
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.850
Pain Management: Okay.

267
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:59.479
Pain Management: On the bottom, and you see practice settings click fastbain. Doc.

268
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.190
Pain Management: Yeah, see? I oh, wait. I do have.

269
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.460
Pain Management: Did you guys see that.

270
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.220
Pain Management: Yeah.

271
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:12.480
Pain Management: Yeah, I think I cause I only had. I thought I only had access to Fast Paintoc. But I see the West Side on that on what you just said, too.

272
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.030
Pain Management: Yeah.

273
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:22.859
Pain Management: So now, I have a fast pane, Doc accent. So we we can actually access.

274
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.190
Pain Management: So that's good.

275
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.670
Pain Management: Okay?

276
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:32.480
Pain Management: So now I know, now, we know, okay.

277
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.460
Pain Management: I had one more question. Jonah, are you? Are you going to be in HP today? It's only 2. That's why I'm asking.

278
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:49.670
Pain Management: I'm I'm asking. I I let's see I have. I'm going to Lv today, right? Because of the I have a patient there

279
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:58.150
Pain Management: and then let me see, and then you're.

280
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.280
Pain Management: It's a Spanish speaker.

281
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:06.589
Pain Management: No, no, that's fine. I can ask my staff, or I can also just call you guys.

282
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.220
Pain Management: And so.

283
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.899
Pain Management: I just wanted to make sure that this 2 o'clock is confirmed, and you tell Dr. E.

284
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.919
Pain Management: Yeah, she is.

285
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.590
Pain Management: I saw her yesterday, because that was the one that was scheduled in the morning.

286
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:24.179
Pain Management: Oh, okay, make sure you in text. Kenya.

287
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:34.349
Pain Management: Yes, and I'm also, I'm also gonna confirm Angel, because I remember he would kinda like he wouldn't pick up the phone too much. So I'm hoping that it is confirmed, so I'll text him.

288
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:40.409
Pain Management: Okay? And also when you're emailing the staff on Huntington Beach, you CC, me.

289
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:49.420
Pain Management: me see, always with your email, CC, me and you can. CC. Dr. E. As well. And, Maria that way. We all have

290
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.370
Pain Management: access.

291
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.090
Pain Management: Okay.

292
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.060
Pain Management: And then what else?

293
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:08.950
Pain Management: So is it pretty good did that answer your question, Kenya? I know you. We know that you're still kind of feeling all over the place. Especially I. I asked you to do this

294
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.809
Pain Management: stuff, which, by the way, is great, you were able to do all of this. I know we

295
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.950
Pain Management: it doesn't matter if we already have it kind of. I actually like it. It turned out good.

296
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.640
Pain Management: I like it, too.

297
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.380
Pain Management: Yeah.

298
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.602
Pain Management: It's like Dr. E. Likes his face.

299
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.570
Pain Management: Did you show him.

300
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:30.399
Pain Management: Yeah, he's there. He did. What did he say?

301
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.965
Pain Management: So he said, It's really nice, and he laughed.

302
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:40.460
Pain Management: That's just it's 1st his 1st reaction. But okay, what else?

303
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.179
Pain Management: Anything that's glaring, that?

304
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.550
Pain Management: Yes.

305
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.769
Pain Management: I think I think that's it for me. I'm not sure.

306
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.780
Pain Management: How about you, Maria? Is there anything?

307
00:26:54.210 --> 00:27:16.710
Pain Management: Oh, Mark said, because Mark and I last night we were looking at the procedures and we kinda updated. You probably see names that are not there because the previous person who was helping me didn't put all the names. So just again, reiterate. Make sure everything is there, because this is our brain. What we feed in it helps in the dashboard and on the procedures. Make sure you write down

308
00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.620
Pain Management: the the date garbage.

309
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.359
Pain Management: The drive.

310
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.960
Pain Management: On the on our drive. Yes, the Google sheet.

311
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.019
Pain Management: Alright, yeah. The Google sheet.

312
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.050
Pain Management: Right.

313
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.629
Pain Management: Anything else? Is there anything else?

314
00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.679
Pain Management: I think that's it. Just the procedures.

315
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:42.449
Pain Management: We're pretty much on time on the schedule, except the patient like yesterday, the one that didn't show off

316
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.590
Pain Management: all kind of.

317
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.670
Pain Management: Yeah, yes, and she has a a mailbox that's full. And I kept calling.

318
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.969
Pain Management: Okay, let's just email, I think you emailed already. Right? Maria.

319
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.430
Pain Management: Not her, her attorney.

320
00:27:53.430 --> 00:28:04.510
Pain Management: We texted her too. Okay, you have a second phone number as well on your grasshopper. You think that will work. You think she you think she? Okay.

321
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.499
Pain Management: I don't. I'm just worried that

322
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:12.239
Pain Management: if we switch it we won't get a call.

323
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:20.799
Pain Management: Oh, okay, I didn't know that technology. So the grasshopper, you guys, apparently on. If you look on top, we have 2 numbers.

324
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:27.550
Pain Management: Yeah, that's the number that mine was stuck on on the 1st day or the second day when me and Maria were like, Why do I have this number?

325
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:37.673
Pain Management: The 1st number, is our, the 9, 4, 9, the 2 5 9. Obviously my number. But he's saying that if the patient doesn't answer. You can use the other number.

326
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.389
Pain Management: It works, it actually works.

327
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.830
Pain Management: Maybe.

328
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.890
Pain Management: But what we like.

329
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.629
Pain Management: I love that the other number would we get a call back.

330
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:52.750
Pain Management: Yeah, that's what I asked Mark. And he said, Yes, but just just switch back to, you know, yeah.

331
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.069
Pain Management: just in case.

332
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.690
Pain Management: 5!

333
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.240
Pain Management: Oh.

334
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.850
Pain Management: Do you know of any of the case? Managers who are moms.

335
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.880
Pain Management: Hold on!

336
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.369
Pain Management: Do you mean if you know Case Manager's mom? Maybe you send like a happy mother's day

337
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:28.549
Pain Management: next week like, it's just an email or something. Oh, we don't know. I didn't ask. I think that's why we have tomorrow to kind of get to know them, mark is saying it's more personalized right again. Top of what is that thing that you said?

338
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:41.190
Pain Management: This is also like you're trying to date like a hot girl. You're all girls. This is like you're trying to get. Yeah, I don't know. You're trying to date a hot girl, so you need to like, make sure you stay top of mind and get her attention, like I know I have a very hot wife, but like

339
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.069
Pain Management: I don't think it's here that you

340
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.740
Pain Management: keep top of mind and attention so like when stuff comes up, just even a quick

341
00:29:48.325 --> 00:29:54.719
Pain Management: happy mother's day, or just some that their birthdays, if you ever get that out of them. Just so you can always do a reminder.

342
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.619
Pain Management: How do we get? Oh, we didn't have prices, whatever

343
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:03.090
Pain Management: we didn't have. Remember, you have more, too many people.

344
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.120
Pain Management: Okay.

345
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:21.639
Pain Management: I don't know if you guys heard him. But it's basically saying, trying to build the connection. Remember, Maria, when you had that build that connection with that baby who took Jack the reason why they call us because Jack told them. But still we haven't heard anything from them.

346
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.470
Pain Management: No.

347
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.040
Pain Management: Oh!

348
00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.060
Pain Management: Anyways, that's fine.

349
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:44.530
Pain Management: Okay? So going back to the procedure, just make sure, just reiterating, to make sure that you put it in there. And if the patient didn't show up like the one yesterday, just make sure to, I guess. Leave voicemail and just remove the date that way. It's not counted on our

350
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.170
Pain Management: dashboard.

351
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:46.850
Pain Management: Okay.

352
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.190
Pain Management: Does that make sense.

353
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.790
Pain Management: Yeah.

354
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:54.870
Pain Management: Okay. And I'm sure you guys are on top on following up on those that didn't

355
00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.299
Pain Management: show up like on Friday. There are patients that didn't show up. How do you guys?

356
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:11.439
Pain Management: This is what I'm saying, like, maybe utilize that task to put that in there so that way, I know, and maybe I, you know, on weekends. Sometimes there are people that call and stuff, and I can also answer that.

357
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:18.850
Pain Management: So what I usually do is that when I'm emailing them, I just start again that way. It's back in my stars.

358
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.780
Pain Management: Do? Do you guys want to?

359
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:34.459
Pain Management: We utilize that task, or what I'm saying, or cause we don't have access here on the phone, you know, on the task. But we have access on a phone for the task bar

360
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:43.029
Pain Management: again. I just, I just want us to see what is all of us, maybe to see what is appending.

361
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:50.050
Pain Management: Maybe like for Kenya. If there are pending procedure like this patient didn't show up, I need to call back.

362
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.040
Pain Management: because, you know, we were all forget, and also

363
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:57.979
Pain Management: what if something happens to either of us, and we don't know who's pending or not?

364
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.930
Pain Management: Does that make sense? So maybe maybe on the spaces

365
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.270
Pain Management: we can change those names. Maybe we can say

366
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.559
Pain Management: we can have a space for procedure, for example.

367
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.339
Pain Management: And then

368
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:23.129
Pain Management: I'm just trying to like, see? And you guys tell me, obviously, if it doesn't work, I'm just trying to see what will work for us. That

369
00:32:23.926 --> 00:32:28.829
Pain Management: we won't miss anyone that's like the thing. I just don't want us to miss anyone.

370
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.920
Pain Management: Any suggestions you guys wanted to do the tasks there or the chat task.

371
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.720
Pain Management: You guys know what I'm saying. Right? The Gmail on the Gmail app. We can see the task on our phone.

372
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:51.640
Pain Management: I think that one's like the the ones that we just did on our computer like where we can check off. I think that one's a lot easier. Yeah.

373
00:32:51.640 --> 00:33:01.839
Pain Management: That's easier. Okay, so it's true. So then let's just utilize it more that way. Everyone can see like I know, a science. I remember, because it's here. We haven't checked it off.

374
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.790
Pain Management: Yeah.

375
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:09.680
Pain Management: Yeah. So the Ess one, we can just text Dr. E as well. Or when you see him this afternoon, ask.

376
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.330
Pain Management: Okay.

377
00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:14.760
Pain Management: Always better to see him in person and ask him, because it's hard for him to.

378
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.980
Pain Management: His mind is all over the place.

379
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.630
Pain Management: Yeah.

380
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:22.539
Pain Management: If we don't get to him right away he will probably not.

381
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:36.940
Pain Management: So I'm gonna do this. I know I have a 10 o'clock, and a bunch of follow ups which I can just call and then I will do the notes for the procedures.

382
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.390
Pain Management: Okay.

383
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.356
Pain Management: The procedures are, everything is in the

384
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.649
Pain Management: It's in the new one, correct.

385
00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.589
Pain Management: I believe there's 1 that's on the old tabra.

386
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.330
Pain Management: Okay.

387
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.080
Pain Management: I think it might be David.

388
00:33:56.573 --> 00:33:57.940
Pain Management: David Borowski.

389
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.940
Pain Management: Yeah, he might. I might be wrong, but it might be him. Okay.

390
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.839
Pain Management: From yesterday.

391
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.470
Pain Management: Yeah.

392
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.070
Pain Management: Yeah.

393
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.920
Pain Management: Let me see.

394
00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.719
Pain Management: I'm not too sure there is. I believe there is someone, though, that.

395
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:20.399
Pain Management: David. So maybe I know we're utilizing our zoom a lot. So you can also just put it in there, you know, old.

396
00:34:21.289 --> 00:34:26.433
Pain Management: But old Tabra, or old what is our thing?

397
00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:29.259
Pain Management: Ws or something

398
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:34.159
Pain Management: That way. We don't miss anyone, cause it's easy to miss if.

399
00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:34.959
Pain Management: At all.

400
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.209
Pain Management: Doing the procedures.

401
00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:36.919
Pain Management: July.

402
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.780
Pain Management: Note, for example, especially the procedure note. So

403
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.400
Pain Management: any anything else. I'm trying to

404
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:55.090
Pain Management: see if there's anything else glaring as of right now, or issue that we need to address.

405
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.220
Pain Management: I don't. I don't think so.

406
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.570
Pain Management: I know there is one note that I'm missing

407
00:35:02.188 --> 00:35:18.210
Pain Management: and because I'm waiting for the team. So I'm gonna ask them tomorrow, because there, there are times we're in. I won't finish the note, because I'm waiting for the attorneys. Answer, see? And because I didn't do the task. I don't remember the name.

408
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.930
Pain Management: Did Doctor E. Finish? Was it Daniel Domingo.

409
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:29.800
Pain Management: Oh, you! It's good thing you mentioned that. And he told that to me yesterday. So America I mean. I'm sorry. Sorry. America.

410
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.770
Pain Management: I mean sorry, Kenya. Don't get.

411
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.316
Pain Management: It's okay.

412
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.129
Pain Management: You've heard America right, Maria.

413
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.199
Pain Management: I think I have.

414
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:46.298
Pain Management: It's cunning how they sound alike, anyways, so sorry.

415
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.070
Pain Management: Just tell it to him in person.

416
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:58.049
Pain Management: And for the lien agreements. Just send it whenever you're going to go to Long Beach. You don't have to go today.

417
00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:58.650
Pain Management: Okay.

418
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.390
Pain Management: I don't want you traveling.

419
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.469
Pain Management: I left them at Hb. Yesterday.

420
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.270
Pain Management: All of them.

421
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.730
Pain Management: I know I left some there, and then I have another stack that I'm taking to Long Beach.

422
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:17.090
Pain Management: Okay, perfect and again, the next one, we just need to do the this thing for patients.

423
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.320
Pain Management: Okay. Yes.

424
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:28.349
Pain Management: Just so we can. And for patients, you know, obviously, the email, we're not gonna do that. We just wanted to make sure Dr. E's name we'll we'll we'll talk more

425
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:33.159
Pain Management: about that cause. That's after this. After the sweet James event.

426
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:33.860
Pain Management: Yeah.

427
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:41.389
Pain Management: Okay, anything else, guys? So it's really important. Let's reschedule all the the procedures.

428
00:36:42.957 --> 00:36:48.680
Pain Management: Maybe ask him where. Oh, no, he tomorrow afternoon. Maybe he can do stuff. I wonder

429
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.840
Pain Management: can you ask Dr. E. Today? Because there is that Wednesday? Maybe he can go in the afternoon to a long.

430
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.010
Pain Management: Yes, I can ask.

431
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.080
Pain Management: I'm not sure if he will, but

432
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.269
Pain Management: or maybe he would want it to do early. I'm not entirely sure what his plan is.

433
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:11.760
Pain Management: Just be patient with him. He's really. You can see. You can see sometimes he doesn't know where he's at.

434
00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.740
Pain Management: Yeah.

435
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:20.550
Pain Management: And he might change his mind last minute. So you know, which is annoying. But you know

436
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.849
Pain Management: he's an injector. We need him to. We need him to do the injections.

437
00:37:26.948 --> 00:37:35.319
Pain Management: Okay, I think that's about it. I'm gonna we could cut this short and I'll do the notes, and then
