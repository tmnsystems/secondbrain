I got off another call and I was like, I got to go get onto this but it was like 10 minutes before and I got distracted and I forgot because I don't have my alarm set up like I normally do.
00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, I do it. I do it. I do it least and then lot of times we meet with Mario and then Jeff and then sometimes I want to run late and then all of a sudden we'll be like 10 minutes.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh .
00:00:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But then a lot of times I'll get out of Bobby's just there alone. Jeff has it.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. That's hilarious. that's how I am a lot of times with the Monday meetings because they're so short too. I'm like crap. And then, yeah, the like the basis ones. Are you telling me there's no tops? good. Anyway, so everybody was in a good mood yesterday not. Even Denise's not sad yet?
00:01:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not at all.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good?
00:01:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not even a little. Yeah.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome though. We'll see though. Like it said, the real test will be believing and then the holidays and stuff like that.
00:01:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I got to set that. I guess we're going to stay over it. Seems like that's what Denise wants to do. So I'm like, sure. Santa Cruz is very cool.
00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like town.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. The drive there was really interesting. It reminds me of New Hampshire. So it's like all winding mountains, not super mountainous, but up and down. Like you go up a lot. Like the elevations are really high. And then the elevation to the school was really high. Like I'll say in this one picture, it's the field. the soccer field. It's like the. the track in the field, the way we're at the outdoor area, and it's just literally past the field, all ocean, and then in the distance, Monterey. And then you can't sort of see it, but when you're looking at the ocean down, like at the edge of the field, Santa Cruz is like down, you're looking down over Santa Cruz, but you're really high up. Like, god damn, I didn't feel like we drove this high from, you know, being down at the beach level and then driving up. Then the other fun, the other fun that was like where they have like a full-on boardwalk, but it's not wood, which I thought was funny, but it's a boardwalk with like rides, arcade games, like the carnival games or whatever, and like Ferris wheel, three roller coasters, but it's only, I don't know, maybe four blocks long, five blocks long. So we're like, yeah, we'll go check that out, go check that out. we're walking on the boardwalk and I'm Denise is like taking a picture of the beach and I'm looking at her like standing on the stairs. This is hilarious. She's standing on the stairs, I'm looking at the stairs and then I turn and I look over my shoulder to the right and I'm like this is Bloss Boys. I'm here on the boardwalk with Bloss Boys and I start looking up on my phone and we're walking and Denise stops me and goes look and there's a poster on the wall. This movie was shot here, Lost Boys. I knew it and it's like you have got to be kidding me. You actually, I'm not kidding you. I'm looking at my phone. was looking at it right now and I was like wait a second, this staircase is the motor's like I know this. We're gonna watch that too so I can do proven right.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know how far it is away but Capitola is pretty close to there.
00:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah no yeah that's the name of the mall.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've been doing half a period and it's amazing, been out on the pier at that beach there, yeah, it's gorgeous.
00:04:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a cool little town. And just, I don't think be East Coast vibes off, which I thought was weird.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is weird because I've been to New Hampshire also and what struck me about New Hampshire was how pristine it was. No garbage on any road anywhere. Everything like, there are like, there's hardly any like, crocked payments and crocked sidewalks. Like, it is, it was almost Stepward Wives Erie kind of just, especially compared to where I live. everything's just filthy.
00:04:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I came back and was like, I hate this place even more now.
00:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't want to be in New Hampshire because it felt cold.
00:04:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is. Yes.
00:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, not my cold temperature, cold.
00:04:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a little, yeah, it's a little sparse.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we'll it.
00:05:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We'll bear it. Some areas are very bare.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, oh, right then. So what kind of updates we got on the projects?
00:05:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I don't. So I guess the, well, Heather dropped the bomb on Jamie that she wants out. Right. Um, Jamie has not, this is hilarious. Jamie doesn't call Heather, guess who she does call me. So she texts me. I totally missed it. She's like, can we talk? go, yeah, whatever. So, but Heather has not called me. I haven't talked to Heather. She just texted me, told me she was doing it. And I was like, whatever. And then Jamie texts me. Can we talk her yet? She calls me. She goes, I assume you know what's going on. go sort of. I don't know, like all the details. don't know, like, I couldn't tell you how much money. she's asking for and I'm not sure I really know that and then I don't know where the number comes from I don't really know much and I like it that way and so Jamie was trying to get a feel for like whether or not I was going to stick around and I said well I'm sticking around until I you know one of my lines I'm like this is not altruism I want to get that page up because I want I spent time and money in effort I want to see the works and then I was like that and she knows like that's tied to the stupid code and I'm like those guys are telling me this is it we've got it this is we're this is really real and I'm like okay those guys are like super excited about it even Greg is excited about which I thought was funny and So I go, that's gonna be done. You know, they say it's gonna be done early October, if not sooner. So I go, get that page up and then, you know, I'll watch it for a bit. And so then Jamie was like, I can't buy her out. I'm like, I know. She's like, so what does that mean? don't know. And she's like that, she's just gonna go sell it to someone and we're gonna have her to work with that person. And I said, I don't know. I honestly don't see anybody buying it because the first thing they're gonna, I go, because A, it doesn't make any money.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And B, they're gonna say, why are you leaving?
00:07:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And she's gonna have to tell them whatever the reason is. I'm like, I don't know what she's gonna tell them. I don't even know what the real reason is to be totally honestly. So I go, yeah, I don't see anybody buying it. I don't know. I guess Heather valued it at 600 grand, which is ludicrous.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, based on that?
00:08:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Of no idea. Math, magic, wish, math.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty typical for everybody that thinks their business is awesome and wants to sell it.
00:08:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I was like, so, you know, Jamie's like, well, do you think of valuation? don't want. I mean, I don't know how she came up with it. Getting a valuation done. I go, but I can tell you right now to get a valuation cost $4,000 because I'm getting one. And I go, and I go, I, our books are a mess. And so the books aren't even in a place where they could do it. I sent them reports to one group and then they were like, your books are a mess. So I go, I got a bookkeeper cleaning that up. And then the other group, I told them the books are a mess. They're kidding. You know, to look at them because the first group was like, these are both. They got to get those done and I'm sending to them and you get no say, but they come back is what they come back with. And I'm like, I basically requested a seller's discretionary earnings valuation because I feel it's the most repo based on the size of the team, Jeff being the main dude and the size of the team and the revenue. But ours is legit in that it's over million dollars a year and it's like, know, Wolf or it's like, you're not even close to a million. So in that regard, it's definitely probably seller's discretionary earnings, right? There's no money here. no money made here. think Heather thinks the leads are worth money. I'm like, says, who? You've never made any money with them. What makes you think someone else can?
00:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:09:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, as I get. You'd have to just come up with you'd have to agree on that and then But then even then you probably can't buy it So and then chili, you know, she's gonna try to sell it, but I don't see anybody buying it That's not your problem No, I mean I Been sore. I mean, I've been sort of a newling it, but I'm like I'm not gonna I'm gonna just let it sit for a bit But I was like Here's the thing. I'm I know I could buy it. I know Jamie. She works totally differently with me that you've seen it. Oh 100% yeah and She Doesn't want to lose it, but I would be like hey We got it, you know the way that this works like there's no there's about And you to do YouTube either like yeah, you can keep the YouTube revenue. I don't care about that but it's like You can't, you're not going to get paid to do work, you're going to get paid based on the results, right? Which she would agree to because it was stupid in the first place, right?
00:11:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:11:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then it's like, try to come up with a thing that makes it repeatable. But I would look at it as like, OK, rid of Katie. Get rid of Rebecca, like, be like, sorry, can't afford it. Like the business can't afford this stuff. Um, and then if it's making, you know, it makes the subscriptions probably making like close to. No, no, that's right. Like, I think it might make a hundred grand a year. So it's like, my thought was like, OK, well, if I, if I head her out for what it's worth, then I'm actually getting a 40% discount. Because. whatever money I give her, I would pay 40% taxes on that, right? So let's say if I paid her 100 grand, I'm really paying 60. Because that 100 grand would go to the government and that would lose 40. I'm okay, I can spend 100 to get, I can spend really spend 60 to get whatever. And then it cash flows at 10 grand. So then in a year, I'm paid back with in-profit. And then if I can rub it in that period of time, then I would get that too. And I've got the software, which is mine, not hers. I start selling that. That instantly makes a thousand bucks a month. And then whatever else I can get that to do. But I'm like, I don't need to do anything. I'm just going sit around with my thoughts.
00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No drama.
00:12:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No diggity.
00:12:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No doubt. Yeah, it's 30. I mean, I don't pay attention to their finances at all. Yeah, whatever. Well, I did say it won't be and Jamie's like, well, mean, do you really think that this is all the business can be? And I said, I think this is the business that you get when you work, you both work 10 hours a week and don't put any money back into the business. Right. It's like, I've never built a business by not putting money into it. So like, that's part of the problem. But I said, you know, on the plus side, the numbers here are extremely consistent. Like, they're the same, the same, the same week after week, after week, after week. So, yeah, that part's good. And that part, you know, in that way, it's sort of like an annuity or whatever. And yeah, you'd get rid of all the expenses as many as possible. And then just let it. Let it go let it run run your run your black Friday sale that made 20 grand last year Like that.
00:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Pay me 600 bucks a month Oh, so how's the perfect wedding timeline?
00:14:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So going and how going good until Oh Norhills personalized we're weird. It's ugly head this morning. It's like here. We go The like a sister thing not very nice. The sister has been hospitalized. Oh, no for a Some sort of side.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess she's an MS.
00:14:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no there's some sort of neurological side effect maybe or whatever and so that will spin him out Like nobody's business. Yeah Which is Completely admitted to yeah Yeah, so it's like mother effort, but yeah, we'll see.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got an email back. He's good for at least two periods of two months of not showing up for one reason or another every year.
00:15:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Pretty much. But it was going really good. Like he says, he's super proud of it. He's like, this is the best kind of ever written. I'm like, wow, that's a testament. Right. And then Abhishek is, you know, they're plugging away. I see Abhishek finding the things in Norio speaks to them. So there's like tickets going in and getting solved like the corner of thought today. Yeah, so Norio is like, yeah, Abhishek is ridiculously good at this. So I had talked to Norio about, you know, I'm not in a huge rush right now with Heather pulling the plug or whatever. like, okay, this is an all good interview. interesting. But my plan was, well, I'm going to generate leads. I hit him up, and I said, Hey, what could I make this perfect wedding timeline? And then we make our own version, he said, Yep. Okay, that tells my problem. So I go, I could make a version for them, and then we do a 50 50 affiliate split. So I just make my, I just make the, you know, 14, I think that I think they made 1400 bucks last month. I make 1400 bucks a month off their version. That's their brand. And then I can go make blissful wedding timelines or epic wedding timelines.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Peaceful wedding timelines.
00:16:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then I can tie that to the seed planner. So then I get a 50 50 deal with them. And then I get 100% the other way. And then I can go do whatever the hell I want over there. And it just stay, I could build a totally different brand than I own everything. And then I can work out a whole receiving plan or angle, see if that works, and that's it. So I'm like, oh, OK. And then I mean, we have to see what the leads look like. I don't know what they're going to look like, but then that could lead to something else. So odds are I will do that, especially since they're like, unless I bought Heather out, because then I would own her going to timeline. But then I'm like, I don't even know if I want to own that. Like, I don't want to, I don't need to bring anything into this if I brought anything in. So then I'm like, yeah, I could just whitelittle to them. And I do think that both of them would like, Jamie was like, I know you spent so much time on this. And like, I do feel bad about it. But she's like, you know, you don't say anything.
00:17:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go, I don't feel bad about it. So I knew what I was doing.
00:17:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So. We'll see. Oh, so I talked to Norio about, hey, if we could get start getting beta testers on it in like November, that works for me. So it's a very liberal timeline. The idea being like we get beta testers in that have nothing to do with those guys. Our beta testers are going to come from the populating people into the software. Greg, design site, I think we've put it in for build. Actually, I said it was up to them. if you guys want to wait, like if you think the theme is going to be done, you just want to wait and it's going to take like three weeks. I don't really care because there's still squash and bugs and then if we're going to build it and they have to rebuild but there's no sense in that. But functionally, it's there. So the only function that's not there. like the theme. So let's say they do build it in October or whatever. I can probably start getting metal probably. I know I can get leads within 24 hours. That's how it always goes. And then it would just be a matter of like, do these leads look like the people that buy a perfect wedding timeline? Great. I'm gonna invite the ones that look like buyers to be beta testers and then let people beta test for like two months and then roll it out for real in January.
00:19:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that plan. But I'm back.
00:19:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
on. Be nerdy. Bob.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, it's Friday. Are we making music?
00:20:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like wrecked. I am going to go in and work on so I start this funny. Sean hit me up. So funny how same old , right? So maybe two or three days before. Like so I have a calendar invite from Sean or whatever like a recurring calendar thing with Sean. It comes up every Friday. That is from when we did the song a year ago. He just never took out of his calendar. So every Friday it's like starting with Sean at nine or whatever it is. It came up to me. So we're outside of that. I was whatever three four days ago. Like me and I should really just like get with Sean and be like, let's just start doing Fridays again. And I'll just start plowing through these things like one at a time and like what I've decided. I don't care what song, what the order is, I'm just going to make them, get them, put them out. So I was thinking that I was like, I should talk to him about that. And then on Wednesday, texted me and he's like, why shouldn't you have like, sick? Oh, no, don't you have like 60 songs at this point for me to work on you with? And I was like, he's like, let's do let's go. I was like, so weird that you say that I was thinking we should start up Friday's wish on again, which is literally the input, I think. And he's like, right, let's do it. So I knew I couldn't do it today. Because I'm like, I don't know what I'm not going to back to like midnight, but I have the song that I was working on with Eric and Jimmy. So what I was going to do is go in today, fix this one thing that bugs me and then send it to Sean and be like, okay, and do like a, and then maybe jump on a call with him whenever. but do like a pre-production meeting and be like okay this is what I hear needs to be done and then this is what I want to have this is what I want to hear at the end so you tell me this is my hit list for that is that list correct so to give you an example there's this one part where like Jenny's voice becomes like the lead singer essentially or the focus let's put it that way so what I did is I had her doing background vocals and I just sort of moved them into the center channel if you it sounds different but I'm like it's not what I want them so I'm gonna be like should I like should that be totally re-recorded can we take those and then just re-effect them like what do I need to do there I have a double pan do we just double them like I said tell him this is what I want to hear like I really want her voice to become the focus but then still have this it has like this ethereal quality need to um so like how do I what do I need to do to make sure that I have the right recorded to get that outcome because all the stuff that she I have is just her like on the mic really quick do this do that just like I could get it in there and then I have all of Eric's stuff that it's the singing's not great but where it is and like where I do certain things I don't have to point out like see what I did here I want to I want to keep that so how do I do it what do I need to record to make sure that I can get a good version of that like do I just need him to do a double do I have to do it three times I know part of which I'm gonna say like do it four times you'll be like just do it more than you need and then you have it and if that's what he says that's what he said and then get into like you know we have to do stuff like melodine which I'm not gonna add but Sean is yeah it's a software Sean's really good at it And he, it's funny, he started sending me his, he started working on a song, it's the fastest I've ever seen him do a song. He sends like his idea, and it's like 90% done, like, I don't know, I know you don't know what that means, but it's like, if I send you my stuff, I would have sang a song with Eric. Everything needs to be re-recorded, except the drums. Johnson's his idea, nothing needs to be re-recorded. It's like, he just needs to add more stuff to it, and it's like mixed and mastered. It's like, he's like, almost at the finish line, I'm literally like barely out of the box. Okay, great, but here's the idea. But, so he sent me his, and then he kept saying it as he layered more stuff on vocals, strings, strings, whatever. And then at one point I go, there's this part in the song where like, this, I know. in the background, I go, dude, is John singing that like, is like laughing? No, is that that's melodine? did it with melodine. So he made all these harmony parts that essentially aren't real, but they are. It's like, but so this would be my question to him. Okay, did you take one of the takes? Is it, is it the literal same take, or is it another take that you then took into, into melodine, which is my guess. It's the second that because it sounds different. Granted, he pitched it up. So I don't know. But so I want to do some of that with Eric's because I can hear it in my head. So I'll be like, okay, how do we do that? What do I need to bring to the table? What needs to be done so that we don't have to go back and record. I just want to get it all recorded and then come to you and be like, okay, now let's start mixing it. Let's start doing the next steps. And then just do that every week. You're like, all right, here's the next one. Here's the next one, here's the next one. Some stuff I'm how to do, and I don't mean Sean, like, okay, go record the acoustics and get them already done. I can do them all by myself. Well, with Eric, well, somebody work in your test.
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So I like that you're getting some structure for the timing in the organization and the creation, like, so creation of actual music, as well as the system for publishing it and all of that. Do you have Q4 Rocks for Mom?
00:26:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I wanted to do, I revisited the book. don't know what Mark's talking about. He did not finish the book.
00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:26:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got to that. And I was like, there's nothing here. So I got a, I was actually going to look at that after this. I looked at it the other day, so today I was sitting here going, well, wish I had worked on it. I got to go see what's wrong with it. So my buddy, Paul Clifford, has that software designer. We're going to run across it.
00:27:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's been around for years.
00:27:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But apparently he has a music writer that is killer. And he gave me like full access to the software like three years ago. And I cannot find a login. And I don't want to reach out to be like, hey, man, especially when he invited me out like a week ago, and I couldn't go, god damn. So I'm trying to get access to that software because I want to see how it works. But I'm in here, I went in the Facebook group, which I didn't know. And all these people are like kicking out their e-mails. books. I'm oh, I'm like, so good. Let me see. There's an AI involved. But what, what are you doing?
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I have, you're getting muffled.
00:28:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's so loud. Okay, now it's off. It's so loud. It turns on the man.
00:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Noise cancels you. Yeah, it cancels you. Yeah.
00:28:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So I have, I just have to read it this whole time. Like, I have the book that I got. The Allen was like, model this. So I have that book. And I'd given that to Mark. And I was like, okay, we're gonna model this. I'm gonna plug in our stuff into a degree. He did that. Then I layered on this shipbuilding metaphor, which I still like. I read that. was like, no, this still makes sense. But then the book isn't done. So I'm like, okay, and now we're, you know, two years. Here's an AI, like we all know the AI writes it even better now. Like, okay, if I could get that outline, I got some of the content for Mark. The, uh, the content that's missing is the stuff that we basically built in fan flow. And like, all right, we know that we can, now we can throw screenshots. We can talk about fan flow, potentially. So we've got to finish the book and then it would be. Finish the book, build the mom site in the new theme, set up mom and leave flow, uh, in fan flow already, figure out all the lead magnets. the lead magnet, I think we should use is the fan growth, like the one that basically leads you into fan flow. So you would do like a collector map and then one of them would be run ads and we would just give that away. Hey, this is how you run the ads because running the ads and the key, the key is following up with the end, getting into your email list, blah, blah. All the stuff that the employee almost does we don't do the DM thing yet, but I actually met with the developer today and he's made some headway on that. So it's like got to get the book because the book, she was like the front end of my rehab I know for like a better chairman. And I wanted to get that lunch in January too.
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, get the lead magnet for I'm trying to give it a name like the Fletcher map, but like it's for mom, but it's like it's like it's the fan, it's the fan growth and nurture.
00:30:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, you know, like whatever. Fletcher map. We have to come up the headline. I like grows your followers followers and fans. it doesn't. Followers on specifically Instagram and blah blah blah. Well, I found all of them. So it's like a fan of all the work and whatever. We have month today, but it does both of those things.
00:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I guess that's the sub headline. Okay, so that's a Q4 rock you wanted to have already by when.
00:31:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
One of the book done. I mean the book I could maybe get done in this quarter if I can get access to poll. So Q4 would be like have the mom site built because the funnel will live on mom. So the book funnel or whatever will run through mom and then Banflow is only going to be like the software site. So it won't have and don't think it will have lead magnets or anything like that. But all that stuff comes from mom. That's what you'll build the community around mom. And then, yeah, there'll be community members that use fan ploy, but there might be community members that don't, but even if they do, it's still, I think, be around that because the bigger idea is there. I met with them on Monday and I don't know if Mark is doing this, like, I'll read this on this Monday, but there, I mean, there's like, there's got to be close to 30 bands using it now. And there, some of are like freaking out, like, Oh my God, dude, this actually works. And my argument to them is like, like, they're focused, Mark and them are focusing on the wrong thing. like, yeah, it works, but we've got to teach these people to make the product. If they're not releasing songs, there's nothing to promote, right? And they don't see that. I think they obviously they're in the band to, like, make songs and make me apply. play music, whatever. But then they're they're not, I want to say regimented, but I'll use that. They're not regimented enough to do the thing. And I think it's because they don't have a system for doing that or a checklist to follow. So it's like, if you start to train them, hey, you should be releasing a song every 12 weeks, right? So they get caught up in, what do I post on Instagram? Here, this is what you post on Instagram. You post everything that you do in leading up to release in the next song. Then when that song is released, you do a little post release thing, and then you immediately start doing the next song. So in essence, you would have them do an entire song and all the content for that, sit on it, and then start another song and start making the content for that. then a week into that go, okay, now start talking about everything that's done. So you're released a week or two, a week or two ahead. And And while you're doing the next song, you're the song that's done, all of that rolling out. And then all of a sudden you have another song done, you get to the post promotion of the song that's out. And then boom, you start to cycle over again, except you have the behind the scenes footage already. You have this video done already. And you load all that up into your planner and then start the button. And it's like, okay, now start writing the next song. documenting that. And you're just doing that like four times, roughly every 12 weeks, right? But it probably wouldn't be, but the target would be every 12 weeks. So you're doing it four times a year. If you're releasing four songs a year every year, as we know, consistency is the name of the game. And you don't get caught up in this video and that whatever, you just keep putting up product and you're running fan flow in the background, you're adding these fans. And then they're adding to the streams and like I don't yeah, maybe you're selling merch like we've they've proven out like for this one band They're selling shirts through the funnel and stuff like that's great Their website sucks When's the last time they released the song like yeah I mean because that's the name of the game right like he sure business already in the music business Yeah, mean that's all great. That's all great that that worked and it's like but Wouldn't it be better? mean the mailbox money is getting streams the mailbox money is in the music not in the t-shirts He sure it's a one-time sale Yeah So I've been kind of working on that like You know figuring out okay, what would you do like and you don't need to get caught up in Like what is the video it's like no, you're gonna make a behind the scenes video You're going make a video of, okay, here's the riff, right? This is the riff that's going to be in the next song. That's the video. Here's the riff, here's the idea, here's some of the lyrics, right? Here we are messing around with it. If they're one of those bands that plays together, here we are messing around with it, come up with the arrangement, boom, boom, boom, and then here we are in the studio, and then here's the artwork, right, as you're getting close to the release, and you just do the same thing every time. It's not the exact same video, because it's not the exact same riff, right? It's not the idea doesn't come from the exact same place every time, but they're the same, it's the same in that it's behind the scenes. It's the same in that it's in the studio, you know what I mean?
00:36:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:36:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But what are those, and just map it all out, and you're just getting like a matrix of ideas, okay, here are some ideas from behind the scenes. Week one is, these are your content ideas. pull from these, okay, which one you pull from, just do one of them. And then the idea will be that you pre-schedule it all, and then hit the start button when the last song promotion is done. And it's just in the can going. And then you're creating this content like while you're doing the thing. I think they get caught up and like I don't know what to create. It's like you're not creating content, you're not creating songs, you're not creating everything, you're creating havoc. But what's funny is cobbler shoes. These guys aren't doing it. I'm not doing it, but I'm not them. I'm like, am I really in a band? I'm gonna do it.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm going to, I highlighted, I don't know if you've ever used Fathom notetaker and seen the interface, but you can never highlights. So like I can hit highlight if you start talking about something. It will only go back 20 seconds, but it still marks it. And then I can get a summary of it, but it just makes me well, first of all, I could get a clip just of that. So like if you, sometimes we have conversations and I feel like you go through these technical approaches that may or may not ever come out the same way to like Mark and Sean or whatever, that you could like have access to or I could just have it summarized, but that was a very technical and very succinct in the technicality of what should be done, what should be done. And also the logic behind why a person should do that and not do that, which is two parts. Number one, it can be in copy, can be in content. Mark and Sean could parent it basically and they should, because they should really internalize a lot of this logic. In and if they were to do it like on video or whatever, because they're more the face, right? Then anyway, that would be good, but it would also be good training. So you have people in the members area like, why should I do this? Well, Dan explains why you should do this. And anyway, so I'm just, I'm trying to pay attention to when you do stuff like that. And then I'm gonna put some in here and I'll show you later what it is, in case it's useful to you.
00:39:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking about it a lot. That's why I'm able to be like, okay, this is what you're doing. Just like I was telling you, you know, I telling you what, got my, I think I got my Reddit script, I guess, and I left out of it. Oh. But if that's good, then what I'm gonna tell Shheeb is like, Hey man, help me figure out. I don't know when the new 1000 is there, and I want you to scrape it again, right? Because right there only goes back, let's you go back a thousand. That means when they get to a thousand and one, the post that was newest when they scraped is now off screen and there's a thousand ones, so I'll be like, okay, how do we figure out when it's time to crawl again? I don't know, but maybe there's a way maybe he'll just keep an eye on it. First, I need to see if it's any good. Right.
00:40:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested in seeing that I left notes for myself, come in. What was I saying? Oh, I leave notes for myself too, I remember to ask you about it next week, so if you have it, then we could go over it, because I'm interested in. and seeing what you get and then how you use it and what you know are there other things that we could apply that process to?
00:41:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah I mean I actually did this with yeah I think I did it with the wedding planners.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was gonna say I thought you did too.
00:41:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think I did. I forgot about it and it was helpful there. think I think I used that to come up with the nine steps actually.
00:41:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like you did too like I know that you scraped something for...
00:41:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I definitely it was that for sure. It's all coming back to me and they had categories in that red group. don't think this one did though. I'll find that. mean I'm not pretty sure I for sure did that.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah no I know because I remember when you started talking about it this time I'm like oh yeah you did that before so like that's not.
00:41:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
did not use the AI back then. So I don't know if it pre-do the AI. what, and I definitely didn't lose it.
00:42:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You didn't?
00:42:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. Are you sure? No, I use the Allen on the ask Jamie questions, but I didn't use it for this.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. I'm like, I know you used it for something.
00:42:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. It was helpful there.
00:42:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so mom Q3 still trying to get the book done. Oh, what is the guy? What, what is it?
00:42:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The Paul guy with the ebook with, is there a Facebook page or something like that? designer, like design R.R. I have to give my spell it. Or E.R.R. something like that.
00:42:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That IO probably had a create an e-book and it magnets sending e-books with chat GPT. So, like a much cheaper version of what Vosler did.
00:43:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, he's been doing this way longer than Vosler. So design has been around for years and he's just evolved it. He's a super super cool guy, very savvy. helped him, I taught him feeders, not really random but kept an eye on him for a bit. And he lives here.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well you should teach Maria feeders and then Maria can do feeders for me and everybody else. I'm trying to talk her into like oh my gosh she is so much happier. Part of it is separating from a partner who things just weren't going well and she really wasn't filling it. Her heart wasn't in it but she got her hair done, she got her nails done like she is energized and night and day difference from the first time I spoke with her and working. I'm helping her figure out what her offering should be and helping her to create the tiers. for me, I've got my high level clients, but the little Etsy store, it would never make money, it may make money, I don't care. It's literally just an outlet and it's my, you know, business heart, creator heart, and then the product that I want to build probably will lead to some high-end clients, but it's mostly kind of my give-back, which is it not going to be nearly as profitable, but it's scalable and it can be something that can work without me being there, right? Not necessarily mailbox money, but kind of money-wide space because it's mostly being ran, it'll be systematized. And I'm like, we should have all of that. We should have like, you've got music and that's your creative outlet. And even if it barely broke even or even operated at a loss for a while, you'd still probably do it or you'd just at least make it. music. But you would still be talking to people about music business for the rest of your life, whether you make money or not, like you just know that. Right. Then you've got your puzzles, and then you've got another 71. But potentially, there are other businesses where you have much less hands on because now you've got the team, the systems, you've got people that can do a lot of the things and all you have to do is be the brain of it. Like you could have, there's room in your life where you could have a couple, two or three more of those, your high end. So I think that there's a high, high, medium, bottom, top and low, whatever, high, medium, low, I can't think. you know what I mean? the different types of things that I feel like the most well rounded, we are is having those different things that serve different purposes that have different paces that have different energy levels, different profit levels. correlate with that as well. Anyway, just trying to help her with that. But it's also helping me just kind of go wait like everybody that does the best has some version of that. Like for Mark, the dog food probably won't make money for a long time, but it'll make them happy just thinking about it.
00:46:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, totally.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All these other things. So anyway, that's just been kind of like an interesting journey, whatever. you and your feeders, like that's the that it feels like is dying with you. Like you have and I'm maybe somebody else teaches it. I don't know.
00:46:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But that is one of those. DK taught it to Justin. Justin Brooks, you've been out there somewhere, which by the way, Justin, I know, reacquired.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Oh, reacquired. I so I wondered about that part. I just knew that he was back and he was getting really active. But it had to suck for him to I did, by the way, then.
00:47:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, he did it. It was by his design.
00:47:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know.
00:47:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know, yes, I do. Yes. now he's back in there, whatever. So I don't know if he actually paid Liana, but she was happy to go, I guess. She's like, oh, yeah, no, I'm, I'm happy to leave. Uh, this sucks. Uh, it doesn't make it kind of all over the board.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that she really knows what likes her up that much either.
00:47:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, and I was like, you know, price seemed like a good idea. The DK was like, what, you know, he called me out. And he's like, you know, I said something like, Oh, what's going on over here? And he's like, Oh, yeah, what do you, what do you think? know, what do you think you should do? And I was like, here's what I think, DK. I think Justin doesn't know jack about buying traffic. That's what I think. Like this kind of hasn't done anything of merit in like a decade. So I don't know. I go, I think he needs to get all the new courses because everything in there is completely outdated and I do you train people to be media buyers with training You don't He's like, yeah, yeah, I don't know what he's gonna do I go well if he can go shake that tree again Get people to make courses or not But I don't see why someone would pay to be in there to talk to somebody like I don't get it.
00:48:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the what's the draw? Yeah Yeah, and there's been a lot of witnesses to the What is the word incompetence the lack of structure and Basically the wishy-washy in and out in and out Well, but the structures the same way too because they have Their courses were on like two or three different places with different logins No, they moved it again and then they say, okay, we'll just go to this course. Okay. Well, where is that? And you can't log into it and they send you a login, but the login is to the other side. I think it was just so badly managed. And that is a huge point too, right? just because people can get attention doesn't mean they can make money and just because they can make money doesn't mean they can keep money and just because they can make money and keep money doesn't mean that they're good at business. There's some other skill going on, which generally is personality, charisma, and persuasion. They're talking people out of their money. But yeah, that's it. And I think that there's a lot of that going on.
00:49:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I mean, I just laugh every time he's like, would not have to add skills to $4 million over 10 years after I came.
00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, my coaching business did a million dollars in five and a half years. So, Oh, but yeah, like so what but also during that time I worked about 15 hours a week and I didn't add the blah blah blah blah blah.
00:50:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and the funny thing is it's like he's left to do faith but it was such a better idea and blah blah. Clearly that didn't work because you're back. So I'm like, we're not going to talk about that. We're not going about the two brands that you left to start. Like, but we're not because no one remembers that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I do, but like, you know, those. Oh, they do. But social media is so weird.
00:50:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:50:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, okay. So my point was Daniel, I does not offend you. That's me being just playful, but I think that you're okay with me playing.
00:50:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is that okay?
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calling me Daniel?
00:50:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, people do it all the time. Okay. Yeah.
00:50:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, wait a minute. Denise does it.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, she really wants to get my attention.
00:50:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Damn.
00:50:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, also has a great name, but you.
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, even if you just do it internally teaching that theater system, I would love to see you do that I just think it's funny Eric just asked me to teach it to him on Wednesday Now I can't share whatever Well, if you do you should record that whole session Yeah, I mean it's yeah, it's just now there's a little more maintenance to it because Google what they're held Well, I did some stuff the other day. Yeah, know I I negative match some stuff the other day There's such like it's unreal So like steel buildings, right? So I I had it like or was metal or stupid one of the other right so it's like other words We'll sneak in there Building is okay buildings is okay, but like steel like I can't think of another word, but What the word that never showed up before was structure So all of a sudden the next time I go in there are it there's steel structure And then there's so many variations of a phrase with the word steel and structure and I'm like who searches for steel structure But share a plenty of clicks. I'm like I'm not converted.
00:52:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like you're such sneaky little pastor It's like they like all of a sudden Years into this the word structure starts showing up like really yes And I would have obviously never thought to negative that's that it was Certainly wouldn't left to mind and I was like oh, what's a what's a possible sinning if they might throw it near that I don't want But I wonder if there are Like with mates calm or something like that any kind of alerts that you can create I mean obviously you can just go check and compare words and their Conversion rates each time but it would I wonder what kind of automations you could have for checking for bad Performing keywords that got added in but weren't there before I Don't know.
00:53:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean you would want you'd have to do First question is can you even go grab? I mean it's there. I don't know if you can hear me go grab it But then it's like could you you'd use like a yeah, right? That's one thing you'd have to be like is there I guess it's a noun right it look for nouns and Then give me a noun count and then it would like send you a noun count every day Okay, this noun is now showing up ten times That would do it you'd be like oh Because you'd see the noun and the frequency and go There's a there should be no frequency Right, so it would be it would get you It would certainly cover up. I just don't know if you could actually pull that search query data, but that's how you would do it You're little negative match like alert, alert button.
00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, in terms of just scaling and maintenance, I think there's such a huge power in the simple version of the technology, not super complicated because the more complicated it gets, the harder it is to maintain, but also the bigger the cost and generally the bigger the dependency on it because people will be like, well, I spend so much time and money on this, I'm abdicating. Whereas if it's simple, you can maintain it easily and quickly. So something like a search query and then, well, yeah, there's an alert.
00:54:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I bet you could do it where Google script, Google sheet and, and, and, uh, GPT. Yeah, think I guarantee I can go to the dudes. Hi. My buddy who's name I can't remember, he'd be like, hey, can you go this because now I can just now I can tell him what it is. Yeah. Uh, and he'd be able to build it and then you would, you'd make that screen and then you have to load the script into your account.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here, if you did something like that, I almost bet you'd be like, well, now that I've seen this and I could do this, how hard it would be to do that and just a little kind of tweak, like looking for, um, the, the volume change, right, or a conversion rate change and just that's definitely doable.
00:55:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I, I've never heard of someone building, I've never heard of this thing. I don't, and I don't know, I mean, you could actually go in and like auto negative match it too. I don't know that you would maybe want to do that right out of the game.
00:55:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
might want to watch it first and go, Oh, yeah, not going to it that. But you could probably create your own algorithm.
00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
um of if this than that right if it covers this threshold then keep it and if it is below this threshold after a certain amount of views or clicks or displays or whatever right then you know so just a conditional statement yeah because it seems like as you try to fence them in they're like oh well we're just going to jump higher like stitched right you don't want them jumping at all yeah well yeah i mean this happened pretty quick too i was like damn it well quick out of nowhere which is doubly bad because you know not expecting it and then i just happened to look and was like wait a minute if not a bad thought i'll think about that um and just any update on josh and the cost-prove for source report uh i haven't heard anything from the
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Daisy, but she went out of town yesterday. Oh, you said like end of September, right?
00:57:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
