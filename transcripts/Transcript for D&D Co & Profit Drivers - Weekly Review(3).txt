Good.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just as you got home for lunch and I was like, I gotta wait second.
00:00:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm a little snack.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. Wait, where's my phone? gotta, I have to send you pictures because we're getting new family member. Yes. is a family member. And this one is going to be my little baby because my girl's growing and they're almost gone.
00:00:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't say that because then the dog will attach itself to someone else.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They all attached to me. I am the master.
00:00:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To me, stop that until this little number that's right next to me right now came along.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's no boy in the house. I am definitely the strongest energy. If there is a composition between male and feminine energy, that's possible. But since... There's not, I am the appa. I've tried not to be actually, and it didn't work out. I give the extra scratches and scratches, and I'm home all the time.
00:01:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's the one that's car stuck.
00:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:01:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is definitely part of the nation. We're like, oh, there's somebody here.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always. Did you see him? I was sitting up for a tinder on the tree. Now, can you remember? Just like, his name is Hudson, and you will be here.
00:01:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are brief.
00:01:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What is that other than cute?
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a yarky poo.
00:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He will do the word.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. I'm going to hold him 24-7.
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a yorky with a miniature poo.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it's quite poodle.
00:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Even smaller.
00:02:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You probably just got a golden doodle. Yeah, right.
00:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know people that have them, but I've never actually met one. Dude, it's like a shag carpet. Like, oh my God, this is the most amazing to pet ever.
00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know.
00:02:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, it's like a living fidget spinner.
00:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, oh, oh, the stress is just leaving my body as a strength for her. I want a big dog like that. Number one, my allergies, number two, I travel two months. So I need this one can travel with me.
00:02:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I will take him. Yeah, I don't know what this this is even a big dog though. So it's like, I guess there's it's like what you write.
00:02:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's toys, standard, whatever.
00:02:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So this must be cross-bred with a different. I'm not a standard to me because it's only they said it'll never get more than 30 pounds. So I thought it was going to be where my other body has a giant like his is like humongous.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. So the poonal size matters but even still it's right with a golden retriever which are not tiny and also not hypoallergenic but yeah those are adorable dogs and crazy popular.
00:03:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, very slush.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah but this guy I was like I didn't even ask permission I told the extra I said this is ours and we're keeping him and it will make me happy and he's like really called like 5,000 like no I'm just better than that but he was 35 hundred me. Yeah just under three include but that's including the nanny services to have him come from South Dakota.
00:03:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah because when I want a puppy I'm not waiting for a litter. want to know who's a fan. Right now. I'm to me. Yes. Tina does not wait very long. Anyway, how was your Thanksgiving?
00:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's good. Okay, my great.
00:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:04:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Evelyn had a nice little visit. She'll be back in like a week. I'm like, wait, you're coming back on the 12th? Like, oh, okay.
00:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
End of the term.
00:04:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, end of the quarter.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wait, a minute. Okay, wait. No, I did my homework. Oh my gosh, I was so scared for minute. I thought he didn't do my homework this week.
00:04:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sorry. Open your school.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. My end of terms coming up, but also I have an assignment coming up, and I thought we hadn't been giving that stuff yet. then anyway, anyway, that's just okay. That might be ADD. I'm just, everything's fine. Okay, so we'll be back. You had a good Thanksgiving. Was Denise, like, sad when she left again?
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, okay.
00:05:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They hung out of it.
00:05:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Evelyn has become Denise since she moved out. I'm like, what is happening right now? Like, you're everything coming out of your mouth. You sound like your mother. Like, it was just so funny. I'm like, when did you become your mother?
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. When she has it become the mom for herself.
00:05:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So sounds like she's gonna do well her first semester. Yeah.
00:05:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all good. What is she shaking?
00:05:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A bunch of general ed in the chemistry, I think, is the only thing that's like in her major right now.
00:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's coming up?
00:05:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, uh, like the biology.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. just tell me that. How was Mario? Like, was she sad when she left or just like, okay. No.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, they definitely, like, were friendly to each other, whatever, like, they're still doing the whole thing where Meryl's like, I don't like her, it's like, shut up.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got four of them, and then the DHS got involved again, I'm like, can I just be done with this nightmare? Why can't some people just be nice, like, they literally have to go out of their way to cause misery, and you can be genetically related to them, and it's mind-blowing.
00:06:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you can't account for that, it's like, well, where individuality comes in no matter what.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The whole nature versus nurture, like, you would think that there was more to it, but it's not, it's mind-boggling, but on the same time, it's talking, like, yin and yang. My favorite part of it is that I can count on no matter how bad gets, there's going to be a balance of good. And I really feel like they... the good exceeds but I think that it's um it's probably pretty even but I think that perspective and focus allows it to feel much better if that makes sense yeah well and then it's also what you focus on right for sure because you get to that so they might both coexist at the same time in the same potency but because you're focusing on one it's like the other one blurs yeah and then if you're it seems like when you if you when you focus on one of the other whether or not the the levels are the same the other ones automatically dissipated yeah but but you could focus on so bad of which there's little and it just outweighs all the guilt and vice versa yes and that's like one of my favorite things about kind of growing and evolving is learning That mental, it's in our heads, it's in our souls, I'm like, it's so wild that that's true, but you have to be open to even allowing that perspective, aka focusing on it right, to be able to even have the power to do it, you first have to have some kind of willingness to try that experiment, which is also in your head, it's so wild. It's just my own. All right, so did you feel like refresh, did you get a good kind of distance break from things?
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:08:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dad.
00:08:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
On Monday, I canceled two meetings because I was like, I don't want to do those. So I canceled like the Norea meeting because Norea's going through a crisis. like, I can't deal with canceling that meeting, and then I canceled Wolper. because they're is completely off the rails and I'm like dude just why don't you just here's here's here's thought why don't you just do nothing because everything you're doing is just shut up and then you're making it worse and then you're actually blaming Jamie but I hate to say it you're doing it right it's like and so I canceled that meeting because I didn't want to deal with their passive aggressive if they showed up I'm like I just can't so then it was a preview of not having any of these projects and in that regard it was great okay let's talk about that it's an absolute truth too I was like oh yeah this is great I have to deal with of this okay so what is January gonna look like what are we gonna do about that awareness Dan so Heather just literally quit the entire business yesterday or the day before. Like out of the blue. I don't know what the hell's going on with her. She's like, well, I mean, I do. she she that into motion all these things. That so Jamie basically has stolen 100 grand from the business two weeks. Yep. And I was like, I have to break it to you. But like, this is your fault. Like you triggered this bio. I don't know what I don't know why you chose it that like you just wanted to do it. You did it out of spite. You did it out of. I'll show her. You did it out of pride.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whatever your night.
00:10:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then that caused Jamie to start acting away, right? She like, you know, felt attacked or whatever the house.
00:10:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't care what she's feeling.
00:10:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. then she started making moves. And then those moves have had a detrimental. like on Heather, and then moves that Jamie made, I'm like, well, I hate to say it, but it's your fault. Because Jamie's making moves based on this idea that there's a Wolford and Co, which apparently there is, right? And a Wolfie year. So Jamie started doing deals as Wolford Co, that are maybe questionable, but I'm like, it's not in your contract. And I'm like, you know, I don't know what to tell you. So, yeah, it does. It's probably unethical. could probably spike her over this, but what's that look like two years in court? And I was like, you know, so as a result, Jamie basically like went and cut deals with Generation Tuts directly and this other company directly. And then somehow or another Heather. saw the deal that she did with this new vendor and it was for like 50 grand and she's like, that money should be going to Wolfier. And I go, give it it. Are they buying YouTube videos, right? YouTube video channel is separate. You set that up. You did that. I don't know why you did that. I don't know why that was ever excluded. It's like a primary asset of the business you guys created, but that's what it is. And then she did the same thing with Generation Tux for like 60 grand for something. So she got like 110 grand in a week. And then, but then there's a chunk that go and then she's subcontracting some of it to Wolfier. And I'm like, oh my god, . So then Heather was like, well, I'm not gonna, she's like, I'm not gonna fulfill this if We don't get a deal with generates and tucks directly and I need to know what I don't know what she was talking about and then so then I can generate I think generation tucks got 30 grand or something is out to them right now whether not they get and that's to like send emails and Whatever the other so they went heavier on just YouTube videos with Jamie not with All for your whatever it's calling. Mm-hmm. That's like a boy and then And then Heather was like bitching at me and I literally was like this is you like you Hate to tell you but like you shouldn't have triggered the buy-up before those deals were in the door Like you should have thought of that. Why didn't you think of that? You knew they were gonna come in in December So, you know, I'm sure she's not gonna cop to that And then I was like look you know, look at your contracts like you don't like these things go look at your contract like wrote the contract. Where did the contract come from? What's in the contract? And she sent me the contract and it's like an online contract. The one benefit, although I did not tell her this and I'm not going to, there's a binding arbitration clause. And she could for sure make an argument that the YouTube channel is owned by their LLC because it is the primary driver of Leeds and revenue. And because it's acted as that from the very beginning. And so that LLC has a claim to that. Like you could make that argument and it would be binding arbitration. So like you just go in and it's like there's no court, there's no discovery, there's no mental , and then you'd get an answer. But like what's the point? If you got it then Jamie would just stop doing work. and stop posting to the channel. Right? I already know what would happen.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then that would be like a breach of fiduciary duty. then you go back to arbitration. But like, what are you going to do force this person to make videos? Like it would never work. So Heather created the fear. Like her biggest fear was that Jamie's going to get the business and get all the money. Job well done.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just what you just said. prophecy.
00:15:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So then she in slack was like, I'm stepping away. I'm going to get evaluation of the business. So she's going to force the sale to Jamie by getting her valuation. then that is in the contract. But the way that the way that the contract is written, Heather's never getting paid. I'm never going to pay because it has this weird formula that is like based on it gets based on what each of them gets paid. so like, if the whatever it is, I can't remember before, but I'm like, dude, you're not again. And the payouts once a year. And it's, uh, it's got all these parameters. I'm like, Oh my God, it will take years for you to get paid, like even a hundred grand, it will literally take years. And it's one payment a year based on this formula.
00:16:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it can steal your soul and your mental health and everything else that will actually prevent you.
00:16:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're never going to get paid. You're gonna have to like get Jamie and like show me, I mean, like, you have access to all the numbers still. And the headers like this has become so toxic.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, you don't talk to her. It started talking.
00:16:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I know, but this is the what's so funny. It's like, you don't speak to her. So whatever toxicity is here, it's just like we were just saying, it's all in your head. Yeah, your. it again. You're looking for it and you're creating it. And then she gossips with Katie.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like you should not be doing that.
00:17:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no. I'm like, you're real, you need to stop. And you know, she's putting all this on Jamie. Like, oh, she's a snake. And she's gonna steal and like, she did do that stuff. But I'm like, you set the table.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:17:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's the problem with you are culpable in this, but so whatever. So then she said this whole thing that she was like stepping away from the business, she's getting this thing. And then Jamie was like, okay, I'll take over from here. And I'm like, I think Heather didn't think that was gonna happen. I'm like, of course that's what's gonna happen. Jamie thinks she's ting . So now I'm like, I gotta get out. I'm gonna talk about you.
00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I always just got to say Daniel, you really need to not talk to either of them anymore.
00:17:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because well, they were said to g-mails. like they broke the email. Yeah, you can just leave me off of the ship. I don't, I don't need to see this.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I feel like with all the things that you have going on, even any kind of association with them, whatsoever, like if you can buy and own something and never have to talk to either one of them again, fine. But if anything that you're considering doing like with the perfect wedding timeline requires any of them, I would not. But I think it doesn't, right?
00:18:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I mean, that Jamie, I guess, you know, whatever, she would be an affiliate still, but that's fine. She doesn't do anything. Well, that's okay. I mean, she doesn't do any work. So I'm like, I don't, how was she being toxic? Like you guys don't work on this business at all.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't understand how it can be consuming so much in your time. It's because Heather let it get out of bounds so bad in the beginning that she can't.
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
let any of that go, even when it's not there. Well, and I know, I told you this, I said, look, you're doing what I did when I broke up with my partners. You're being overly proud and it's going to bite you in the , like you just need to let that go, and she's not going to let it go.
00:19:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really hard to do. It's actually interesting to me how powerful it is even to my divorce, and I was right about all those things, but right doesn't mean that you're right.
00:19:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it doesn't mean it's right, that it's right, yeah, that it's all right. You're all right, and you're justified, but you're like, it's the price you pay for that.
00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and it's not good. There's a difference between right and good.
00:19:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, absolutely.
00:19:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And effective and useful, it really doesn't matter. So some of the things you just really have to let go, because even if you're right about the things when you feed it and give it more. or an energy. Yeah, but it's, it's just interesting to me that the other funny thing.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The other funny thing is like, they're like, no money. And then like, we're running this Black Friday thing. So like, Heather's like, we gotta cut back all the costs. She's basically trying to line it up so that Jamie has to fire Rebecca, who's like, her bestie is what Heather was doing. Like, dude, I can see what you're doing, right? Because there's no money, right? and then after the fact that then Heather goes, I'm out, you could take everything over here from here. And Jim is like, okay, understood, done. You know, like, when does this start? like, I think it started right then, whenever I'm not going to comment. And this is what I was funny. I'm like, Heather, do you think she'll have any qualms about riding the bus over her best friend air quotes? None. There'll be no clobs so ride the bus right over her she doesn't give a like who who you're this person you're saying is a snake you think she's suddenly gonna be unsnaky with her best friend that lives two thousand miles away that's the game okay definitely time to let that conversation and all of that just go that's a thing Jamie can't there's nowhere for her to go like i gotta hit her hey unrelated Heather i'm out like i just like there's there's no reason for me to stick around like this doesn't this isn't gonna make enough money for me to be around but you have this killer this 's killer what it works it's like a great little machine just don't just leave it like let it run you know pay us we we can build when you need it like that's part of a service like six hundred bucks a month seven hundred bucks a month like you can't beat it Katie's going to stay around, I guess. So between, you know, Jamie can make like a good six, seven grand a month off that plus the 10 grand or whatever she's going to make off the sponsorship. So, you know, she's all set.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:22:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And who knows, it could be, this would be funny. It's like, in the absence of Heather, all of a sudden it could start working because I do feel like they're, they never worked together. So I'm like, how are you going to get anything good when you guys are always on odds? Right? There's no flow. There's no, no one's really interested in making it work to be better. So like, the best thing that's probably for them break up now, but it could be that Jamie suddenly starts getting more leads and putting up better videos. wouldn't doubt it.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it for her, she does. She doesn't. Don't break anything. Right.
00:23:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's super consistent.
00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, yeah.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So either way, that's happening before the end of the year. I mean, she has no option. There's nowhere for her to go and you can never hire someone to move all the and it would be stupid to anyway. Like, just leave it alone. Actually, you need to go switch my sales page up. Maybe change it. I'm not sure. Okay. you do it?
00:23:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, so I will just keep following up with you and seeing how that is de-evolving. So now perfect wedding and timeline. Is that what you're calling it still or is it a different name?
00:23:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, that's a better light. Call it the light labels.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. What what will it be for you?
00:24:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no Norio's gone sideways and I'm like I'm over his too. That's what I never really wanted to send me to be like, okay, so Is this where you want to go hourly? Only I'm like, you're not gonna be able to work and that's gonna work for you Like you're gonna be able to go into a depressive episode and like survive cuz I don't see anything Well, yeah So I don't know if his sister dying or what but like God forbid if she did because then he'll really dig at right So that I don't know I don't know But with him, I was like, okay, we're just gonna focus on one thing at the time So I gave my tassel a damn like do this and he launched it yesterday It's with the it's for fam slowly like okay, and I Gotta get us to work with those other dudes No. And then I'm going to go back and already go, okay, now get this to work, which is another fan flowy things. When I think that's all the custom codes are fan flowy, that's what we did. We talked about one new thing on Monday, but I don't, I don't think it was custom.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are all the things that Norio's working on?
00:25:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he's building, he's built a couple of apps from fan flowy, and then he code overlorded their code. It was like, do it like this. So I can't even, all I can tell you is that he had to modulize their code so that we have like one central app, essentially called tools, fanflowy.com. So he is code overlording those guys, they're writing it in larval, and then they send him the code, and he puts it into the branches and the git and all that that I don't understand, and then he deploys it. Deploy it to the server. He checks the code, right? He makes changes looks for bugs all that kind of crap and Then he was working on Perfect wedding timeline, but I think that's done. Like I don't think I've seen In the check ticket or tweak in like a week But I might just because I have a because we're working on membership, but also I don't really know So I wasn't really paying attention while last week says But I think I haven't seen anything and then That's it the only other thing That he would work on is if we do this distribution thing which I have never shown him The song distribution yeah, and it seems like it might be the right move now based on a bunch of leads that we've been generating to this radio station that a lot of these people don't have distribution. So I was thinking today, was like, I got to get with Mark and Sean and be like, how could we build a calculator on this? Like, is there any way we can predict revenue off of this? Maybe, maybe not. And then we get back with the distributor guys and be like, what's the pricing on this? So that would be the only other thing. And I'm not even sure if you SODs and those guys are so good and they're larval that Norio could just be the code over more than like hourly and be like, so I was going to hit him up and be like, all right, what do you want to do? Do you want to do strictly hourly or just want to cut this thing in half? So I'd be willing to cut it in half.
00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
JDO guys is the, what's your name?
00:27:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
SOD is the, I think he's like, S-D or S-A-A-D or something.
00:27:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just curious. I'm a nerd. Have that.
00:28:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, everything. No, it's not that okay.
00:28:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, All right, I'm just moving by the way, I talked about it a little bit, but I'm not going to put notes in teamwork so much. I don't want to get rid of that. But number one, sometimes there's things I just do want to keep notes for myself and it's not like I pretty much everything is Stacy safe, but some things I just don't want to put anywhere else. So I can keep things like that here for me, but also just kind of organizing who's working on what and when. Because I'm not the project manager in teamwork and anyway, it's just going to help me. Plus we're simplifying and looking at it this way will help me do that. So, um, are there. Okay, so the tools at bandfloys.com, there are multiple tools or just.
00:28:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it was like five. are. there Spotify some catalog tools that let people hit an API and all release songs so they can say that's my song back catalog track one two three and there's a latest release app that's or that actually runs with no I'm not there but actually has a UI and it runs with that so that works when let's say they we set them up in the beginning they say hey this is my latest release you know these my back catalog songs and then in the course of like a month or two they are releasing a new song so they go through our new release thing and then what happens is when they submit that new release it triggers the latest release app and says hey there's a new song coming out on this date the next day I want you to go get that song and then update the latest release to that got this pick your latest release thing and then has this automation that runs in the background and automatically updates the release upon release. Then there is a URL redirect builder that basically it's going to build a series of URLs for them to put in their bios. So like, hey, here's your Facebook URL, here's your Twitter URL, here's whatever, whatever ones you pick, you can pick the ones. they would fit the destination and then it will automatically create the seven or eight URLs that are rewrites and then those rewrites underneath are automatically appending the tracking code that I want. So then we don't have to teach them like, okay, you're going to put www.com slash question mark equals source equals. uh you know uh yeah source equals facebook and then twitter and then you got to make one for which they're never going to do uh right so there's that and then there's a custom onboarding app so that allows us to create onboarding steps and define whether not they're absolutely required meaning they cannot go anywhere else until they do it um so we can define unlimited amount of steps and then we give it the URL to take them to which is typically really all inside the software and then that way there's like a fixed onboarding thing that I think if it does like a popover but like they can't even they can't access fan flow until they finish the required onboarding and then we can make another like hey here's the a secondary onboarding that's not, you got to finish it, but it's, you can then get into, yeah, it's do something like that. That's probably going to be launched tomorrow. Just talking about what? Live tomorrow, like I just gave it to me on Monday, and I got some issues getting it, getting the initial part working, and then on some stockings, and looking outward.
00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is the latest release live?
00:32:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, cataloging, latest release, live. The URL things live, I just haven't used it, so I got to use the URL thing in the onboarding, we have to like break. Like, okay, this is what's wrong with this or not. And then there's a Spotify one, to the original one, and then that's, we're still waiting for approval on that. Then we might have this other one, but I was talking about and on Monday that I can't remember it. So it's good.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. OK, so he's MIA. What's Eric working on?
00:33:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mostly and glowy right now. So he's building a snapshot for websites, funnels, forms, and tracking. So we just got the funnel yesterday. I'm sending that to him today. So he's got the website in there. He's working on the conversion API Facebook, sending that up with custom values and all this stuff, so that we can then have a form for that and say, hey, enter your pixel, enter this, enter that, and then we'll be able to use those variables in the background on funnels and stuff. So I'll send him the funnel, which they, I don't mean to look at it, but they built it. And then I'll be like, hey, does it do this? Make sure it does these things. And the funnel that they built is like, we just sort of copied someone else's funnel, but it's really not the funnel we're going to use. Then we'll take that and say, OK, duplicate it, remove these pages. then we're going to change the flow, whatever. And then Eric and probably Saad need to do some automations around that funnel that will allow us to do this future upsell thing, that Saad and I figured out if you haven't made it, because of the way working. And then we'll get that to work. And then he's got the forms. That's probably where the URL rewrite. Things will live because that's tracking. Yeah, he's going to create that. And he was doing something to me about itself.
00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did you hear about the earthquake, this one?
00:35:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, um, far for you guys to feel right.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we got Eric felt it. He's insane. He's where Santa Rose was. I would have thought that was too south. So we're about 181 miles from it and we got the emergency alerts, but then I feel anything. Yeah. Anyway, interesting.
00:35:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:35:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, you said mostly that's what he's working on. Just it was there anything else because I just wanted to, like, yeah, I broke some sites.
00:35:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I made a blunder that's custom issues.
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh.
00:35:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Tell me about that. But these hackers got all the API keys for Stripe. I'm like, what the f how were they? doing this. Then I went to funnel kit and funnel kit was like, so I went to Stripe and Stripe was like, they're coming from funnel kit. I was like, all right, make sure I miss some stuff. said, okay, thanks, great, screen cap, send a funnel kit. They're saying it looks like it's coming from you. then to them, they looked at it and they're like, yeah, it says it's coming from us. But this and that, like, that's not what we said. So what they're doing is they're using the API directly through the builder. So then they're like, someone has access to your server or devices and I'm like, oh, God, these are going to be a device. So I was like, all right. So then I started looking at like admins on WordPress and I like, dude, we have so many of like just old admins that we shouldn't have. So then I updated the primary admin password using wp-manage. I updated like 30 instances and whatever. And then I was I'm going to delete these other admins. I've deleted them and then I forgot or I didn't get the move that moved their posts to somebody else and it wreaked havoc. It did all kinds of crazy . would have never thought like deleted images. wait a minute, if you delete an admin, it will delete the images they uploaded like that.
00:37:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you don't transfer anything that they created to another user.
00:37:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. The images.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything. Any content.
00:37:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, what the hell?
00:37:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that.
00:37:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it was kind of it's and it was just really random stuff because it wasn't the primary admin. But you had backups of database of old users. You could restore to get all that stuff back, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But it was just like, hey, this isn't working now. And then Eric would go fix it. Hey, this isn't working now. Eric would go fix it. and Abhishek and me and Jay fix some other stuff. But I think that's all it does. So he's working on how to do it Tuesday.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to revisit the conversation, the last that we spoke, you are very satisfied that Eric takes things off your plate that you don't have to think about, and his price is worth you not having to think about it. So still there?
00:38:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello?
00:38:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hello?
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:38:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dumb dumb went up to the neighbors yard.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How the hell did you get up there?
00:38:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that's one to just chase their back.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Zinnia or?
00:38:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, dumb dumb. Dumb dumb is the new guy. But there's like a Malam law that lives up to him. There's always marks at them. And I guess she just traveled over there. And I turned around and she's leaping off his five foot wall.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I was like, oh, Jesus. Oh, she's back.
00:39:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you have time? her name. What's her name? Bell.
00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bell. I should remember that. I have a bell. Her name is Isabelle, but we, I call her Bell. I don't remember that, but not them them. Um, okay. So, oh, so did you hear the question about Eric?
00:39:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then today, actually, so I'm starting to give him more stuff and be like, and I, I'm going to talk to him about this, but I was like, dude, you need to like steer these, I'd like, uh, like, so, uh, well, part of it was because he is getting familiar with fan flow. But like, I couldn't communicate. Okay. I want to be able to just send a task for like, saw it in those guys and be like, talk to Eric. If I did that today, I told Ahmed, who's the main dude over at JB Funnels. It's like, hey, I need you to add Eric. They use click, which is Voho. I was like, I need you to add Eric to that. Because I don't get back to people fast enough. So I was going to do that. And then he needs to sort of manage like cycles, like not manage the build, but like manage, where's the build app? Is it when it's going to be done? necessarily, is it on track, but an example of that I like, we're building this site for these other dudes. I'm like, where is this? Where is that at? nobody's Stacy doesn't know. Eric doesn't know. Abhishek and Vijay know. I was like, yeah, but like, then we have to wait 12 hours for those guys. it's going to tell Eric and Stacy that you guys need to be on top of the ship. Not me.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:40:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, so the question, though, was, no, no, yes. yeah. giving in more stuff yes okay i thought that that was the answer but i just want to you know i would be very specific that's good okay um yeah and he's kind of like even today i was like and i might need to get like fan flow is you know we've got like 30 something people on there i really hope the Spotify app gets approved but like on monday mark and charm like epic we can get these funnels and websites working like we've got people coming to us now wanting websites like you were right you were right they want it and i was like i knew it and then i said okay well we can for sure get that done that's eric's current project right and he's partially waiting on me because i was doing the funnel right so there's some disconnecting like i'll go start these things and you know manage them and i would need to hand them over right so that's what i'm doing but eric wasn't working advantagely at all before and now he is um don't Those guys on Monday were like, if it lets along without Spotify. And I said, OK. So they want to launch the D-I-Y in January. We just have to make sure that that funnel's and website thing is done, which it will be, and then maybe button up a couple of other underworld things that don't matter. Those guys have gotten some sales. We built this funnel with the radio station. We've gotten three sales, like $1,000 and $500, and then we have a bunch. We've gotten three sales up this book, a call funnel that we built. And I have to prepare for it.
00:42:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think I feel like we talked about that roughly a couple days ago. But what are they booking a call for for Mark, right?
00:42:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To talk to Mark? It's Mark Schon. or somebody else. It's for label services basic. It's done with you, Fanflow, essentially. So they'll like run ads, they'll have the account, you got the others.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, Sean, who else?
00:43:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who knows, Angie.
00:43:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you got three calls booked. Oh, okay. So are the calls paid?
00:43:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. So you, the offer is submit your song to get on this internet radio show. So that's a lead from Facebook. And then from the lead form's thank you page, there's a button that leads to a song submission page, or you get that same page in an email. And then on the song submission, page, it's just like a pre-populate your email address. If you come through the email, you come through the Facebook form, we're just like, hey, make sure you use the email that you just used in that form, which most people are doing. And then they, it asks them a couple things. Is your song on Spotify? Yes or no? It's on Spotify, then it exposes the Spotify URL field, it says, stick the song in here. No, it says like, what's the name of the band? What's the song name? Is it on Spotify? And then if it's on Spotify, expose that. If it's not, it exposes an mp3 upload and they can upload an mp3, which they're doing. And then if you upload an mp3, that tells us that you don't have distribution because you should be on Spotify. And if you're not on Spotify, you don't have distribution. That disqualifies them from having a call because they don't tradition, but it qualifies them for a distribution offer, i.e. this year of Lowy, down the road. And then if they are qualified, i.e. they have a Spotify URL, then it says, how seriously about your music career, 1 to 10, which is just kind of a bubbo question we're asking, has no relevance other than to see it. And then it says, no matter what the answer it exposes, what's a realistic monthly budget you have to promote your music right now. It's got a four or five options of ranges, like 100 to 250 to 250 to whatever. If they're 250 and up, then they're qualified, and then the funnel directs them to a page that calls the call side of the funnel. If they are not, then they go to the end of the funnel. They're not just, they're qualified, but not. They're not they're not qualified for different reasons.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're just qualified for this logic. So then if they go and book a call, is that call a sales call?
00:46:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
00:46:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what was sold on those calls and how many calls did it take to get the sales?
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like a thousand dollars set up fee in first month. So if that includes some amount of ads spent and then setting up family with you and then it's five hundred dollars a month after that, I think half of that goes to add then the other half goes to just like with something like that.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And half to what?
00:46:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The with you like you can ask question.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So they set up the app.
00:46:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They'll set up the initial app, run it, and then you get access. And, you know, um, I'll call it support on a more challenge and so how many calls did they have before they made three sales? Like five or six.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that's a great conversion rate.
00:47:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the problems were not big weren't getting a lot of. But calls, so. There's a couple problems, but they built it. They just built this funnel and it was working right there. We're getting song submissions. And then I was like, Oh, okay. And then I went and looked at it and I was like, Oh, I can make this better. like they were getting like. If a hundred people submitted the Facebook form on the 30 were submitting their song. Like, dude, that should be like a hundred. So I've rejiggered it and right now I've seen it this high 75 right now. It's like 55. I doubled the song submission rate and I go. All of these things that you're building Nope Just in my mind Would it be okay next week if I try to extract that from you?
00:49:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and we just brought out cuz if we have a call mark in like eight minutes, so I Want to have more time than that?
00:49:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yesterday marks like Jim and I are gonna start a podcast. It's great. So we started my thing on a podcast and So poor bunch of stuff for that today, so we aimed it mapped it out It's like okay, but now now and I'm now in the process of mapping out fifty two episodes I have podcast for like what's the topic specifically or About it.
00:49:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, make our music.
00:49:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Yep. Let's our music strategies and stories for independent musicians You
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's Are you going to like use AI for that?
00:50:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Already did.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you use top of TPT or cloud?
00:50:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've checked you can just because I like the desktop app.
00:50:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would just recommend that you just try it also with cloud. Just copy and paste all of your instructions. I would be curious to see if you like cloud better because right now it's logic and planning and I mean really just the logic I guess, but seems to be outperforming the latest version quite bit.
00:50:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Even the new version of TPT, the logic version on that.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:50:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure. Yeah. mean, it just gives me what I want. What I like is like, I don't. I'm very structured when I ask it. So just. Takes what I want and then makes it more presentable. I guess the best way to say it.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that the thing that I love and this is in the promise that we don't know what we don't know is that everything was wrong on it. Frequently I'm more frequently than chat GPT it sparks something I didn't think of that actually is quite enriching without being distracting or signing object.
00:51:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, my new thing is that I just sent this to Katie, but I started like I have all these courses that I bought. was like, you know what, I'm just going to download the courses and then upload all the video to the script and then take the entire transcript and get to chat GPT and then like tell me what this is about and it does it, but I'll do that with Claude because that would be a good AV comparison, but so now I haven't watched any of the videos. So then I can start to query it and be like, hey, does it have anything like this? What do they say about this? What about that? And now I'm like, and I really wish I could just take these and stick them into a custom GTP that would remember. But I had a meeting with this dude, but he canceled it. And then I just hit him up, but he has this methodology using fine tone and tree. So instead of like a sequel or whatever, you store the stuff in pine tree. And so that's like the memory. And then you can get chaffy, but he's not good for it. If you can't believe it, you're back in himself.
00:52:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get that quiet, I can't hear what you're saying.
00:52:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The dude canceled the meeting and then it was so funny because all his reminders were like, don't be a no show. And then I go show up for the meeting. He's not there.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, is this like a joke?
00:52:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
he's like, oh, I emailed you. I'm traveling. Like, why was it in your calendar? And I emailed him directly. was like, how do I read books with you? Because you don't have a calendar. And the only thing he has like $125 call, like f that, I don't even know if you know what you're talking about. But I explained to him what I wanted to do and he's like, wow, that's a really interesting idea. I know. I talked to Noria about it too, but Noria was not getting what it says.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any other questions I have will take longer than we have before you have to on the sweet log call. how about we take four minutes real quick and reconvene on the on the sweet log line.
00:53:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just a reminder that it's a different one.
00:53:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I was seeing you in a few minutes. Why am I And
