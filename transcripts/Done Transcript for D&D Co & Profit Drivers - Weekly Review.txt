Hello. Oh, shoot.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on my iMac instead of my laptop. I've got about the audio. Oh, well, I guess I don't even know what to do. I'll just deal with if there's weird audio issues and I need to set a reminder from myself. It's weird. It's only you. That is just so weird. But it changed when I was on my laptop. So it's not you, but it only happens with you. Isn't that weird? I just don't know what it is. right. Anyway, how are you doing?
00:00:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? I am good. I wish that teamwork had a way of removing links quickly and like changing their formatting. So like if you wanted to format everything to be a particular size instead of let's say paragraph or heading one heading to whatever, you can't highlight everything and switch it. And if I wanted to just highlight everything and remove any links, I can't, I have to remove links one by one, which matters because if I'm bringing in my notes from battle, it's full of all this other crap and formatting and teamwork is just not a good text editor. No, it's not, which, you know, whatever. But it's kind of a basic function and most things can do better than teamwork can. And since it's organizing tests, for projects and things like that. I think it might be a little bit better.
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's cool. It's because you're cutting and pasting some editors just don't like cutting. It's like when you cut and paste something into like Gmail and it does this wacky formatting. You're like, I was at the component in like this other app that I have that just clears out every problem or what it's taking off. But yeah, so I'm with you.
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, huh, I use this app. Yeah, but the problem with that is when I do that, then everything is a single line of text. Yes, then you lose the breaks. Yes, no paragraph breaks or anything. And so that actually takes probably more time.
00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That just depends. But anyway, so there's my tip. I use this app on clutter.
00:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use it constantly. I'm a big fan of the app. Is it a Clutter or a Clutter?
00:02:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, app and is it like a desktop app or I think yeah I think it's App Store does top up pretty sure it's in the App Store.
00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've also available on the Mac App Store.
00:03:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It gives you this swipe down note pet but so it that will keep the breaks it just strips out all the stuff so I use it to like keep instead of having to open notes you just swipe down and use this thing. Mine's littered with info but it's I use it constantly.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay let me just do this. Remind me to get the unclutter. App at 2 p.m. Thank you. Okay that way I don't have to bother you. So how did music creating go last week?
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I finished some drums, I finished the arrangement on one song, and then I finished the drum on the other, and I wrote this is like the first time, I think it's first time. Lately I've been hearing parts in my head, which I don't normally, I hear melodies sometimes and vocal parts, but I never hear like a guitar part or a piano part, but I've distinctly heard this piano part, and I was like I gotta, and I just, it was like stuck in my brain, it's been in there for weeks, but I didn't do it because not only did I hear, but I heard the sound that I wanted to sound like, so I laid that down and it totally works, and then I've got this other one that I can hear a part for, so I'm like alright, I'm gonna go do that one, and that one has a very distinct sound, it's basically like, it's reverse, essentially, it's like this reverse. as well. So I'm like, okay, I know exactly how I want it to sound. I'm not sure how I'm going to get that sound. But first, I got to find the notes that I go find the notes. So that's what I did with this one. I just found the notes, plated in on piano and then applied, went and found the sound.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder if, you know, how you spend more time doing things you evolve. And maybe just, but it's not just more time doing things, but more time just more time doing things systematically. You have been much more systematic in your approach to creating music. And so like, maybe you just leveled up and your brain is like, I got something new for you. Yeah.
00:05:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean, it's like the drum, these are probably the best drum parts I've programmed, I think. And now, and then I can go. Like, I went and listened to stuff that I did like two years ago and it's just unreal how bad it is. God, it's so bad, but so you can hear the progress there and then I also, I did a lot last week. I had this idea for a song that I had like a guitar part and then I had a vocal melody and some lyrics and I had like this idea so then what I'm that involved Nashville tuning a guitar. So I had like this, I had the string sitting around, was like, I had a string, I guitar and then I strung it and I started playing the part and I like, Ooh, that does sound good. I'm going to go record this really quick. And then I realized, oh, wait, I could just turn that into a loop and pop up and the next again, I was like, I figured out how long the song was and then I quickly like laid down some scratch vocals and then That one I you can hear it like me when I demoed it or when I did like the work tape. So what I do is I'll have these parts and I just listen to them when I'm in the car and that's when I usually come up or I'll listen to it in my house right but it's usually I'm listening to it and then I'll come up with the idea and then I have to like play it through the phone you know I'll dump it to my computer play through the computer and then record on the phone and then I'll sing over it recording me and the thing coming out of the guitar part usually coming out of the computer so for that one I had this vocal melody idea and a couple words and then I for sure was like and then it's gonna get I didn't say this in the thing and I was like doo doo doo doo doo like yeah then there's drum parts gonna kick in that's all you can hear on the tape is me going doo doo doo doo doo doo doo so then I did that I was like okay well then this is where the drum part would come in then I like I was telling someone this the other day, I listened to this obsessively, like obsessively, I'll listen to it 15, 16 times in a row and I'll be listening going, oh, I gotta change that. Oh, okay, well, I'm gonna go try this. So I start to hear these other things the more I listen to it. That's, so that came together and then there's that that's the one that has this reverse well idea that I can hear so distinctly in my head. Like, I hear it when I listen to it.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't know how to make that. Yeah. I mean, like, if you have, do you have a synthesizer?
00:08:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I'm sure you have all the tools of just being able to get in the habit of being able to take from your head, get the similar enough sound and then just plunk it on and record it. But I Okay, that's so cool.
00:09:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and the one that I did do, I have to actually figure this out. So I didn't write it like Dan, Dan wrote it. But I'm pretty sure it's in the key of G. It might be in C, it could be in D. Like, I'm actually not sure what key this is in. But the piano part that I wrote, it goes, but it's, it's like the relative minor key or something. It's not the key. I know by looking at the notes, like, this is not, these notes are not in this key, but they could be in the relative minor, and that's when they work. But whatever they work, they don't sound wrong. So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what I'm doing here, but it's not I'm putting on. And maybe something will tell me later on. You can't do that. I'm like, and yet I did.
00:09:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, holy crap. I just tried to unclutter for a second and then I pieced it and I was like. Like, what just happened? It did the thing, but then at the very bottom, it was a whole bunch of links to it. OK, Dan just sold me on my new tool, the hall. I can't that. It will make my note-taking better, because phallom is great. And it allows me to do, like, just now listening to you. And I get phallom to highlight the notes to see, you know, is there anything that I want to remember to talk to you about later? But if I'm trying to write it down as it's happening, I miss stuff all the time.
00:10:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. So you can actually create multiples. Like, if you look on the right, you'll see, like, a plus. When you drag it down from swipe it down, it slides in. I'd never do it, but you could have multiple column notes or whatever it is.
00:10:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so one more. Yeah, the example did that. So it had, well, I had clipboard file and then notes like it looks a little complicated and I my brain feels overwhelmed so I think what I want to do is just go watch a video um to really get it because it definitely seems nuanced um and not super like point and click intuitive but that's okay because if it's doing what I think it'll do uh you know it's worth the organization anyway okay cool so music is evolving that's awesome how do you feel like you're how do you feel that more time on music and also more evolution in the just just in the creation process and in the organization process of that how do you feel it's impacting two things one your for overall happiness level and to your creativity in the rest of just life and business and things that you're doing.
00:12:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I think the more that I haven't been able to do this, the more that I can integrate, like I was making the music, so now I know how to make it and release it, so I can just, I just need to get in the rhythm of that right, so I'm gonna take this, I mean this is my plan, the song that I just put the keyboard part on and did the drums on, like okay this is done, this is the arrangement, these are the parts, now I need to go re-record all the guitars and the bass and then I need to redo the vocals. I can do that super quick, right, I just gotta, I gotta learn the bass part, I don't know it so I just have to learn it, but I can, I can learn it, I can probably do all that in like two hours, figure it out, punch it in, get it in there. Time it out. It'll be done. And then the guitar parts are easy. Um, there's one guitar part That I there's another guitar part. This is another first. There's this guitar very distinct guitar part that I hear The weird chord. I don't know what chord it is, but I'll know it when I play it. I don't need to figure that out yet because If it's there, it's just gonna make it better. So I'll go rerecord the stuff that's there For sure going on so it's too It's an acoustic and electric in the bass So I could probably do that. I could do the guitars. No problem So I'll do the bass next because the bass and the drums usually the sort of the flow that I picked up working with Sean is Figure out the arrangement Do the real drums do the real bass Do the real acoustic if there is one do the real electrics if there is one And then you can do some of the jewelry, right? So like the piano part It's like the jewelry that's done, so and then then it's like this is the mistake I think I made the first time we're on with the first song is then you sing the vocals I sang the vocals Early like not to the not to the finish track I think it does make a difference because you're not you're not really singing in the in the context of The song you're singing to the song, but you're not singing to The guitar we know what I mean. It's like that guitar parts gonna get replaced Yes, it's the same, but it isn't because you're never gonna play it exactly the same It's not gonna sound exactly as the same as what's on what ultimately ends up on the track, so I Didn't realize it when he sent it to me before but that was his thing is like sing Wait till it's all done and then sing on it because you're gonna be singing on this very great sounding thing Rather than just singing to the acoustic that you lay down in 20 minutes, which So, I'm going to follow the process truly this time because I need that song to be done to release it and then I can really start to use the fan flowy stuff like I can go play with the fan flowy stuff in the context of, hey, I'm promoting this artist, right? Yeah, it's me, but now I can sort of bring both sides of me to the table and go, oh, well, here I am making this music, but then here I am marketing it and figuring out how to make fan flowy work better, which I can't really do right now because, you know, Sean's band, like, we change the website and then they change it back.
00:15:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, you know, it's me.
00:15:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't have to talk to anyone to say, hey, I want to do this with what? Like, okay, let me turn to myself and look in the mirror, like, Stuart's morning. So I'm waiting for the phone number to get approved, which I submitted on like Tuesday for some reason that one's I can get my own phone number approved Johnny gets people prove left and ran like what am I doing wrong here like I feel like I'm in high level capitalization and everything of company numbers and things like that. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. My was getting turned on because the privacy policy wasn't visible, which whatever I fixed it, it was some weird issue. But so when that's done, then I can go because this is my argument to mark yesterday and today. So he says, Hey, we can't offer these ads to the. Art is because they're too hard to run my version of it is how do we make it so that we can offer to the artist because it's not like It's not like we're asking them to solve a Rubik's cube here, right? It's like come on And it's like how can I but I need to run it two things. I need to run it make sure it's worthwhile This is a good add add tight doesn't get the result It's it better than the other one Is it good to have in the mint whatever it is whatever you learn from it and then it's like okay now and then how do I? Make this, you know stupid proof or as close as stupid proof as possible Which and i'm like he was telling me the problem and I He's like, oh, well, have to go get the ad ID and then of course, I think Well, I could just have someone make a form that finds the ad ID for them. Yeah Like pace the world here scrape everything in the world and populate into something like Come on. Exactly. Yep. Exactly. was a percent. like, yeah, I could just take it, it'll pull it, it'll populate it into the field that is being used by the other way. Like I can see it. So I was like, right, well, but I need to go run the ads and do it myself so I can see it end to end and obviously these, some of these people like don't want, you know, they don't want to be guinea pigs, which I understand.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What did Mark say when you approached it that way?
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I didn't tell that. No, no, no need.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he got that going to argue with you.
00:18:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm just going to do it. Right. I'm like, I'll go figure it out.
00:18:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't need you to sit down on the table with me and do this puzzle.
00:18:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do the puzzle stuff. Yeah. I could be wrong. It's like, okay.
00:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's always interesting to me how your responses come. because that did in no way really answer the question that I asked you but it was useful and good information. The question was how do you feel that working on music in this way, this systematic, know, spending more time on it consistently and being systematic about it has done these two things. And well, I guess that does kind of, you answered by showing me rather than telling me, I guess, but it still music really. When I was asking this, do you feel like it's me? Do you, any happier, like, has it impacted your mood? That's one question.
00:19:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So let's just stick with that part. No, no. don't have bad moods.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like it's me? Wait, I'm, hold on a minute. Oh, no, I turned my volume down or something or hit me the button. Sorry. Did you say something? I don't have bad moods. Well, that's still like, but there's degrees, right?
00:20:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have volumes. Well, what I would say is that what's interesting about it is it's bringing these two worlds are coming together, right? It's like there's never been a time where there's like I said weeks, months ago, right?
00:20:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How like I can just get completely lost doing this.
00:20:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so to me, I mean, that you could call that being happy, right? You could call that like certainly content content, content, where like I can just sit down and get lost, and like I can get lost in a spreadsheet and like solving that puzzle, right? And what's happening is like these two worlds are coming together, like, and that's never, that's never happened before.
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it probably would never would have.
00:20:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's like I Also, what a coincidence that fan flow is like my idea, right? So it's like, oh, look, here's this, this music thing was my idea. The fan flow of things, my idea, I, I'm, I'm working, but it's cool, cool things with cool people. Okay. This is interesting. And it just makes me want to not do other things. Like, I just don't want to work. I was helping someone out with the, the paintless dent repair thing. So I started running ads for that. And the dude that owns that company, like, I guess he didn't know it was me. And he sends this message on this message on Facebook. And I was like, okay, well, doesn't know me. And it's me.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I respond back and I'm like, hey, dude, it's me. And he's like, oh, sorry. And he's like, I can't wait to talk to you and blah, blah, blah.
00:21:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, all right. So I told him I was going to talk to him yesterday, but I forgot.
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought it was Wednesday and I don't do calls on Wednesday.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So I didn't call him yesterday, but so I don't know if it's because. How they didn't call him or whatever he sends this message to me and it's like He's telling me I need you to take that add down It looks bad and it's it's easily cost me a hundred thousand dollars of business. I'm like, okay, hey How the could you possibly know that Be one red flag. Bye-bye Your buddies whack about and he's like, what do you mean you're out? I'm like, I'm out He you trip my one red flag like I'm not but I have time for this . Mm-hmm. I've got more than enough better things to do And I want to do the things that I want to do right same thing with wolf or all the wolf or I'm like I still want to see what happens with the sales page, but The more I look at that. like, yeah, this is just a nice little business, right? okay a six hundred bucks a month pump, call it a day. But I think their business is kind of slightly but then again, I'm like, I don't really care. Look, like, I want to spend time doing that. Although I was chatting with Heather earlier, and she put together a deal to sell some leads, like, all right. And they got it. I go, okay, great, these people seem to get it and they're willing to do whatever it takes to get it to work out. So it's, it's like, okay, we can work on that because that's what we want to do. That's the that's where we want to take this. And if the course thing catches up, I think that's all going to be contingent upon the sales base of Maria and I did, like, it's either going to work or it's not.
00:23:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, she had it will hopefully be next week. She had an offer that was like right up my freaking alley. So I got it from her.
00:23:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like $2,000 and she's really good at marketing.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she is she really is good at it. She gets psychology. And the offer, I should show it to you, but she basically wrote it down.
00:24:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got all her stuff.
00:24:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like, this is how much I'll take whatever I'm like, well, you don't have to tell me how long it takes because I sit there and I'm just like, my brain gets pulled away from it because I can get pulled away from it. And I don't have anybody to riff off of like that is my biggest issue, no one to riff off of in real time. Whereas everything else that I do for other people, that's all it is, like it's constant riveting, right? So I'm like, you just you put the perfect offer in front of me. It's a no brainer. Here's my 2000. Let's go.
00:24:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's a I think that's a really that's the vibe I got over was like, Oh, I can actually wish with her. Yeah, you're the reason that was possible to even begin with. Yeah, whereas there's very few people I can riff was unmarketing stuff. Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to, I'm going to hire again to work on the whole fan blowing mom thing. I just got to get all these pieces in place, right? So I got, I got the payment gateways approved, I sent it to the guys in France, they're looking at it, so they're going to come back with an answer and then I'm going to, they're going to do it. I just know, you know, I'm like, I know they're going to, I know they're going to take the offer that I just know it and it's going to be this thing and the Spotify guys just sent back their code. I sent that just like that's why I was three minutes late. I sent that to Mark. I was like, you use this because I know how it works. So I need you to use it because you don't. And if you ask, I'll be able to your questions, most likely, but I won't, I won't see a problem because I know how it works. So, but it's done. They freaking did. in less than a week. No, exactly week. They did it in seven days. They actually did that.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't believe it. I couldn't believe it. That's why.
00:26:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just realized that today's day seven actually wasn't supposed to be due till tomorrow, technically.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, so who did they get started?
00:26:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
These dudes. So it's these guys that I found. So we need it. They're called J.D.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Funnels.
00:26:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's the universe, Tina, the universe. I the other guys, these Dan. How are the other guys? were terrible. Ice, but terrible. expensive. Took weeks. don't even know if works right still. I'm going to have these guys redo it. And then I was like, okay, because we got an Oreo. like, I really need developers that know larval, right? That way, Norio can be tapped in or when Norio becomes just the code. Rover lifter three grand a month, whatever the deal is that we talked about and he can just be there to literally overlord I'm like, I gotta find guys that know larval and We had a need for this custom values updater, which Everything I looked at was a subscription or you had to buy this $2,000 thing to get this one function I'm like, man, I do not want to do that and it's like, yeah, I would have solved that problem, right? So my thing my issue was okay, I can I can solve the problem at hand, but it's It's temporarily solved, right? don't you know, I don't know that I'm gonna want this forever, but so Then one day I was like, all right, I'm gonna Just spend do one of my Googles right where I Like can find anything in 10 minutes if I really just sit there and think about Okay, how would I find this so I do that and I find these random dudes And they're Yeah, we have a custom value what data it's one pay for 200 bucks I'm like, what if the odds of this thing works? Hey, right everyone else's size. All right. reach out to the guy I'm like, hey, I need to do this blah blah blah. They're gonna work. They get it's gonna work Send it to them Buy it get it set up Couple little issues right I didn't know what I was doing and then you know long storage art it works like holy And then I don't know if it was before I got it to work during somewhere. I Asked him. Hey, what language are you developing? This is he's like larval. Let's get out My god, I hope these guys go to good, right? So I told myself if they're up data works, and I'm gonna hire them to do this spotify thing so I get with them The one weird thing about them is like their calendar is never open.

We're on a call from like an hour It's like the owner and this Who I thought was the dev who's not the dev? He is a dev so as the owner and this dude sawed and sawed's going through and I'm like he's like okay.

I met with him Tuesday. No yesterday And Go in the meeting with him. He's shown showing it all to me. He made it even better and now he's got the dev on with him So he's not the owner. was just son this dude And I'm looking at him like oh my god Like he actually built it like in a week and it's gonna fully integrate into high level That was the other thing. I'm like these guys know how to use high level Laura ball. Okay, great. So my whole thing was their code is good. All bets are off, right? Now I've got access to these guys that can just make a reality. And they just sent me the login. It's like, we crap, they did it in a week. Yeah, wild.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I mean, so you know, some people can start off hot and then they kind of, know, what's the word that fizzle out? Yeah. But, um, that's the thing.
00:31:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't even think they're hot. I mean, I don't think it was that part of a job. Just like the one that I had the other guys do, it was not a difficult job. This one was not a difficult job. The other guys took weeks, weeks, and it was a constantly me going back going, no. Like what they would turn in, like, do you guys, do you even try to use this? But this dude, like the UI, he came up, like, what the heck, this dude, this dude gets it. Like it's borderline noreal, like without the depression and dead animals. Oh my gosh, that was a not nice joke, he's not on the phone, I can make that joke. Yeah, so I'm like, so bad about bad jokes this week with Mark and Aaron. About bad animal jokes, I know. But you know, all that morbid comedy aside. Yeah, so I'm like, holy crap, these guys really do it. It's not like I need it on some stuff. I just need that. Like, I just need, and there's clearly more than one of them, so it's not like a dude, it's a team. And I'm like, Okay, and then I mean that was the same the other universe thing was the super rise guys same thing I'm like, what is this built on there like larval like yes Okay, I'm gonna talk to you more right I tried other softwares and when those guys responded with that That's when I was like I'll buy this off you. Let's do a deal like I want to work with you You know and granted it's related to noria, it also isn't like yeah, I'd like to keep noria around and it's like okay But now you've got Those deserts are larval noria's larval the French French guys are larval. Okay, and larval's like we Noria's got some other devs that do it. Okay, great. So we kind of start hanging out in that neighborhood I think that's a good place rather than having it built here built there Whatever, it's like there's some uniformity to it Yeah Speaking of
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Eric, just any new thoughts about them this past week?
00:34:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. No, I was like dealing with the, we had like family in town stuff, so I wasn't even like graduated and all that good stuff.
00:34:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, congratulations. And how is Denise doing?
00:34:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She thinks she's not doing poorly, but it's not really really yet. She is, I can tell she's starting to not let me in that thing. I'm catching crap. This is what's so funny is like, I work all day, right? I don't work or we know that, but you know, I'm working. So like Denise is a very structured schedule, right? It's very structured. She gets up super early. Because of menopause really but gets up super early then she like I think now what she does she gets up she like listens to Like religious podcasts or something like that like some We'll just you just cause it Jesus. She listens to Jesus stuff And then she'll like now that they're out and then she would like make them breakfast of some sort like she was always making like Pancakes or whatever like not for them, but just it's there Would come rabbit So it would be like Jesus pancakes Jesus pancakes if she was driving to school she'd run to school If she's not driving to school then she walks the dogs or dog walks the dog and she comes back. She works out takes shower and Then like we'll go Run errands or whatever she'll leave so that's all happening between like 6 a.m. then she'd come back in the afternoon And then they come home from school and then she'll make dinner some sort and then it's like, and then she'll eventually like, you know, end up on the couch, watch TV for like an hour or whatever and then go to bed. But now, it's like, they're never home, right? Evelyn went out yesterday and just was gone all day. Maryle went out yesterday with her friend and she was gone the better part of the day, then came home with the friend and then they went out again. so then Denise hits me with no one wants to hang out with me. And I'm like, well, I don't know that that's what's happening. And she lumps me into that crowd. So what I like when I was programming drums and stayed here till like eight o'clock at night, she was giving me Like, I wasn't home to hang out with her on the couch. And I'm like, you don't hang out with me during the day. Like, you know what I mean? So it's like, man, is this what's going to happen? I'm gonna catch this.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't warn you. It's just... It's a consuming thing. And I have been going through this because I went through losing two of the girls. So it's about It isn't about what's left.
00:37:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's about what's gone. Yes. And that's all thing.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Adele is not gone yet, but she's gonna be No, but they are when they start with their friends more and they they're gone. Like it doesn't have to be moved It's just they're not present as much anymore and they don't need or want as much anymore. Then it's gone So it's not about what's still there.
00:37:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's about what's missing and that missing Lloyd and it's difficult and Yeah That's what she keeps saying that I want a dog which is not true Like I could do or not do with the dog I've got the dog because I'm like that will give her something It will not enough something, something extra, right? So to your point, it has to be people.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs more people.
00:38:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's something gone, but there's no, she doesn't, she doesn't like people. No, I invited her, she doesn't.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will leave you, but I'm just saying like, but that's what's missing. It's a people thing.
00:38:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a mom thing. It's a momming people thing. Yeah, yeah. There's no way to replace that. There's no way to, that's a unique thing. Like I invited her to go out, like I go to trivia with Stacy and her not husband, like every two weeks and I used to go here and there, but I've been going a little bit more consistently last couple months because it's fun and like, I need to hang out with people, right? Like I need to go do that. And so I invited her and she literally is like, I want your pity invite. It's right. I'm like, hey, it's not a pity invite. But that's the thing, I was thinking the other day, she's not, to your point, think, she's not been nice to me. She says stuff and luckily I purposefully don't let it get to me, but I'm like, oh my god, you're saying it's pity and bite, I don't hang out with you, if I said these things to you, you would be like all over me, but I'm like, okay. Then like, I was like working in the yard, so she wanted like plants and stuff in the yard, so the week and I'm like, you know what, I'll just do it, like she's banging out really quick, right? I already go out and like take care of the plants, which apparently she was unaware of. So the next day, like I had her go to, I went to Home Depot and bought bunch of plants and then I was like, hey, you come and like, right, let's hang out, you come and we'll pick out some plants. And so we did that although she didn't want to do it. I'm like, oh my God, this is so you're just complaining. OK, got it. So we get the plants and then I go plant them all and like make this nice little area in the area that she hangs up in. And then the next day she goes, how are you doing so much gardening this weekend? go, what are you talking about? I'm like, I do it every weekend. He's like, you do? like, did you not? How do you think these things stay alive? I go, I water them every weekend. was like, oh, I didn't know that. I'm like, oh, she's really killing me.
00:40:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a major transition. statistically, it's very hard on marriages. just apply Dan, brain and puzzling to it. And because it's really hard.
00:40:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure good.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good luck with that.
00:41:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah. And that's what, but I've been preparing for this since the girls were young because I heard people. I really heard them when they said it. I'm like, I have got, but, but nobody told me it happened before they leave. Like they're gone before they're gone. And with four of them, like, so I've been in this stage of because the first one left in 2018. So, you know, that was six years ago. And, but she started as soon as she got her car. So that was eight years ago. So I've been in a process of losing my children for eight years.
00:41:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's hard to spell.
00:41:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll tell you that. It's just hard. Even when you're not like, well, it was my identity, but I was purposely. trying to not make it my identity, but it still was. So like, but I've always had business and, uh, it's like, you know, I'm mom and business kind of too. Like, so it gives me an outlet for it. So I have that. So I don't even know, like, I would probably lose my mind if it was nothing, no people to take care of at home most of the time. Anyway, yeah, don't know how you can find her people to take care of, but that that might be a puzzle for you to stop.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
People have fur. No, no, because they can't talk. If this dog doesn't work, I'll get a cat. It doesn't matter. She talks to them anyway.
00:42:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She talks to the dogs. She did try.
00:42:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She did try. You did try to go into like a whole thing. Like I can, the whole Jesus thing, whatever, that's all new. So that's sort of the thing. that she's not it's not totally new but like that she's more there's a more concerted sort of i won't even say movement but just that just that like her doing that and i don't know if that's her like pheripizing herself to a degree maybe i'm not sure but then she wanted to do like i'm gonna say the bible study but it wasn't but it's like some sort of group whatever but it's like 45 minutes north they're here and she's like i'm not doing it it would either so she is sort of looking for the more men women have something called release society it's just like one of the oldest female things but just finding jeez because uh so many people go through that well what am i here for right if it's not this anyway but if she's exploring she could check that out i'm a convert i didn't i didn't
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
grow up in the church, but it has been a super happy thing for me. A female connection, but also just the whole family thing was huge. I don't know what it's like in San Diego. That's the other thing, just like most places, most organizations, the location changes what it's like. Like, Utah Mormons are kind of different.
00:44:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They can be very clicky. all of them, obviously, but there's a whole.
00:44:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can go in some areas where people in the church are just rude and judgy in other places where they're really open and welcoming. so like, it's not an end all be all, but if she's an exploring thing, of the communities where they have a strong community could be helpful because women will just like wrap you up and you got to find them first. So then it's a matter of what's the odds for the best way to find something. But anyway, hopefully she finds it. I found Jesus to be very helpful myself. love my Jesus podcast. I'm send some good healing vibes for both of your sakes and get all of the attention and the scrutiny. All the mothering energy put onto you.
00:45:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be that rough. Dexter would go nuts if he had to be here. Well, that happened probably. I don't know. He's really good though. Okay. So music, music, music. It's good. It's going to be really interesting to see how this is my favorite thing about getting to do consulting and seeing the different businesses, which you do also, right? in different, you got your hands and different things, different projects. But what you learn from one thing and then go apply it to another. But because your building music from the top down from the bottom up left, right, whatever, you know, kind of looking at all of it, and also it being really competitive, which applies to, it doesn't apply the same to all markets, but you're in one of the most competitive ones, like how do you get eyeballs, how do you get followers, but what's also really unique about music is that people like you because of how you sound, like, well, and how you look, like it's a whole thing versus the promise of riches, you know what I mean, or the promise of solving a problem. It's just your vibe that that people are drawn to so what I see as a as an interesting aside that you can glean is that the apology of how attraction happens, right? How we're attracted to the artists that we're attracted to, and it would be them showing up as themselves, but also in a systematic approach. Like, how crazy would that be in terms of coaches and consultants and you've got bases or even podcasters who are constantly trying to compete in the noise, whereas if they would just embrace what's unique about them as and think of themselves as entertainers more than marketers or entertainers more than marketers. You know, because like a musician is like, they want to make the music they want to make, right? And so they want the people who like their music. I just feel like there will be more understanding about how to get people to market themselves as them. themselves which reduces friction but it also should reduce competition because people are naturally tend to be you know more unique than I don't know like it's hard to to put it all into into specifics because I guess not everybody's unique some people just have not a whole lot to them but if they're bolder not to want to go market and spend stuff then there's there's usually something kind of a powerful attraction attractant that they have inside of them that has drawn people to them that made them want to do all of that in the first place but anyway I just I think that as you're going through this the things that you noticed and the way that you can apply it to other things that you may have zero interest in moving forward but um yeah anyway it's just going to be interesting to see how working in the music systematically the way that you are is going into effects, all the other things, also adding in the whole, you're almost an empty nest or two. That's all going to be interesting. The audience. Yeah.
00:49:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
then, and then I'm like, well, that thing, like, I think that's I said to her, she would, she said something about, you know, doing the music stuff. And I was like, that I'm executing my plan. Like, that's what I plan on doing. Like, you need to find something to do. Like, that's what I'm going to do. And she didn't realize that, which is fine. It makes sense. But because I'm thinking three years down the road, right? Like is in my head. And of course, we know how my world works in three years, another 71 will be sold, because that's what's going to happen. Right. So I'm operating from that sort of perspective. And also, it's like in three years, it's like, it's also funny, she thinks Italy trips, she's like, it was the trip of a lifetime. I'm like, no, it wasn't. It was a trip. There will be more, because if you think I'm sitting around for like 20 years after I sell this thing, you're dead now. but the girls are there. You're Italian citizenship. Yeah, that will come on these other ones too though, that's the whole thing. So it's like, but no, she, oh yeah, absolutely. She literally just thinks it'll never happen again, which is, I mean, that's all well and good, but I mean, I don't, I mean, this is also the person that, you know, for years and years and years didn't, when I told you this, like I'd get money and she'd be like, is that ours? like, oh, I think it is. So , like she has no idea how much money. we have, which I actually think is a bad thing. I like, you should probably know this, but whatever, it's in your name, you'll be fine.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, sorry. I think that you will figure it out. And just fun, like maybe she just needs to have more fun, but I don't know how you do that. Like you have, we all do it different ways, like if she doesn't like socializing with people, but did with the girls.
00:51:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You would like to go places is what I think she would like.
00:51:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then we got to figure out how you get some scheduled time and make that happen, but you've built the business so that it can do that very easily.
00:51:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's like paired this stuff down. It's like, okay, here we go.
00:51:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, your meetings are super streamlined and the, you know, yeah, yeah, everything is built to do that. So, okay, so the last, and I know we're coming up on the hour, but. So we're working on the org chart and just kind of thinking about where stuff will be going towards the end of the year. I would like to wait what's happening next week next week. I'll be out of town, but I'm still doing my, my regular calls. Just kind of thinking about. The targets for the end of the year. So, okay, so we know that we're working on another 71 trying to get that 1% of that was some of the questions I had. Oh, hold on. Okay, did you review Marcia's analytics course.
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, I barely worked last week. All right. Okay, so let me do this real quick, Dan.
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is they see. I think that's it out. I think that's how I spell it. Yeah. Okay, so because we just need to know that better. Hold on. me go back to my notes. That was a thing. The funnel kick guy. There is to resolve the data issues and get accurate data populating in Google Analytics. Was there any movement on that?
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's still not working. So I got to hit them up, but it didn't do whatever I thought it was going to do, actually what it should do. I got to send them some screenshots.
00:54:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me change my notes a little bit. All right. Oh, do you need a reminder for that?
00:54:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I was going to ask. No. That's the longest running task we've ever had. Bobby touches it every Monday and every Monday, I'm like, no, that can go.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, and then with the Google Analytics, it's determined. governing the extent of customer confusion about Ninja being a supplement versus full course and just saying what we can do to improve that, but we really need to get good data and analytics on there. You were talking about, who was it? It was wicked? Was getting better?
00:55:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
who like segmentaries.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Segmentrix, that's right.
00:55:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You'll.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This in here. Segmentrix work on that. Is there anything that you can be doing now to with segmentrix like just looking into that to see about? Okay, so what I guess what I'm asking is that contingent upon you going through Google Analytics training and Mercer first?
00:55:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, not at all. just have to I just have to find the source of truth. Right. could be. Segmentrix. I'm hoping it's segmentrix.
00:56:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, you gotta look for it. And so do you need a reminder to look into that with segmentrix?
00:56:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, no. I mean, I start, I start doing it, but then I stop.
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is our family.
00:56:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, he sent it. I watched. Yeah, I think I watched it. He sent a video and I watched the whole thing. Like, all right. It sounds interesting, but ultimately I just don't mean that they're so clicking.
00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, all right. Well, just really because it was so much family stuff last week and what we're doing is more of this review. There's kind of, we're in that flux state, again, everything.
00:56:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's summer.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're doing the summer transition. Yes, but. in that it's more about making sure that those those things that we are looking at there like building blocks type things that make sure that when you know everything starts picking up that it's picking up on the right foot and wear it out to be so like for me I'm thinking making sure that we've got that clean data that we understand stuff so we you get that one percent of market share so you can get that maximum selling rate for another 71 so you've got more time for music and enjoy music but also music be profitable because that's also more fun and yeah just kind of that and then whatever else that is on your plate that maybe you don't want on your plate whatever else we can kind of clean up and just be like all right that's going on the dance life that's going on the dance life and dance life is even more awesome now you know Yeah, kind of thing.
00:58:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
