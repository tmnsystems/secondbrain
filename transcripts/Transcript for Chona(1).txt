00:00:10 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I don't need the name. Okay, bye. Hi.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, how are you?
00:00:18 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh. Um, I don't know how to answer that question. think you're the first one that question today. Ah, I think I need to go away. I know. I put them eyebrows.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, nobody wants to see me without eyebrows. They turn gray.
00:00:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So I have been doing this blurry thing since I've been doing a lot of, um, Oh gosh, I haven't talked to you, right?
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, for two weeks.
00:00:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh gosh, there's so many things that happen.
00:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do you want to start? Anywhere. Okay.
00:00:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Um, I, I. Oh, we will start on the day that we got that contract and then yeah, and then we had a party that day on and then the next day we like prepared for Japan I'm just trying to do the time like as it feels like a blur I That was about it. That was right around there when we talked we talked Face it 12 is when we got that meeting and then it's marks holiday both party for his His office and then we left the 14 And then we arrived at 15 We're in Tokyo while we are in Tokyo from 14 to 18 or 17 Everything is okay. Then we went to Kyoto the mama We went to Kyoto 18 19 like 19 is when the email starts going coming in I was like what's going on. I guess it's starting now. So I'm very stressed out at that. It's my first time that I had a vacation that I have to work. I never went on a trip that I have to work. I see Mark doing that. thought that my role with Mark is to make sure that he's relaxed and he's in the past. feel bad that he has to work. Now I understand how that feels. But at the same time, I know it's different because I'm just starting and we don't have any, I feel like we don't have anything in place other than the Google sheets. I'm glad that Cheryl actually did that. The Google sheets where she's just start like putting the patient's name, the date of birth. It's like very basic and they just hire her daughter to be part of, they call it lean department, which I'm leading, I guess, managing. It was built for me, basically, like, and she was just hired on the 11th, 12th, he's like very new. was scrambling, like, I'm so the stress level, I cannot even express how it is, although I try my best to enjoy my time there, which I did because it's in the morning and then from after 9 o'clock, we go around and 9 a.m.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I'm done with my notes and stuff.
00:03:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
try to – and Mark is there, which is – I think that, again, everything happens for a reason. Mark is right there with me and looking at the way I chart and telling me, like, okay, this is a good to go, was able to send in, but the orders were not sent because the – the triplicate that I was saying is It's for narcotics. The one that was actually stolen to part of the stolen stuff. So the triplicate And that's like another thing we'll talk later, but it's where we write MRI orders like MRI of the server neck I'm right, but you know back, but we don't need that. We don't need the triplicate We just need a regular paper with the doctor's name and signature Which I'm very happy that we did actually just two days ago or three days ago With mark mark help me that I think I sent it to you. I'm not sure I'm not sure if I did.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know anymore.
00:04:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So what it's like a check-up order that if I see it So you know how that yeah, there's so many things that happen in this But we're focusing on the business, right? There's so many things that I There's days that I remember when we went to Tokyo again or she's she no go-ha mom. I think mark and I I'm having some arguments because I don't even remember why, but I think I'm just very stressed out, but it's like, and that's when I think you hurt me, I cry and like, um, the voice message, I feel, it's like a make-up break-y moment, like, can I really do this? But then in hindsight, like, you know, it's really okay, I just have to keep on going.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:33 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So we're averaging, as of right now, I wanted to tell you exactly how much patient came in, who, including, like, holidays, right? There's two holidays and excluding weekend, I guess. But we have 32 patients from, where are you? Okay, we have 32 patients for it's like averaging four to five patients a day that I see that's a hundred a month which is amazing like our goal is 400 right but having 25% of the way there and about that is that is just crazy and I know this month is huge and I know obviously I won't be able to get this without Mark and his connection and the owner of sweet James is he he was in our wedding with us together like he knows us but he doesn't know me he's not Mark but he's been I don't know if Mark told he's been trying to get Mark back to work with him which he doesn't want to now but if there is a relationship and I am very stressed out I'm making sure that I don't it up because of Mark like I don't want him to I think that's initially where my thought process went is I don't want to embarrass him but at the same at the time, like, this is on me, like, Dr. E just doesn't, like, he just, like, I need not in any way, like, other than me calling him, like, hey, a situation, there's this patient, is this okay, like, I'm thinking to do this. So he's there when I call him. But he does not, he's not part of day to day seeing patients documenting nothing. So right now, the process, can I tell you the process is, I know, I feel like it's a lot because I'm doing the main part, but I'm going to give it to Bella next week.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Before you tell me that, the thing I want you to think about is, what would you have to do to consider something really being messed up? So let's break this down for a minute. There's a few different things. Number one, you could do something that gets a patient killed. We know that's not going to happen, right? We know. you're not going to do that. That's you have that expertise. You're not going to hurt somebody. You could not see somebody in time and something bad happens to them. We also know that's not going to happen, Jonah, right? It's not the way you operate. It's not going to happen. That's really the only thing that could actually be the biggest messes up is that something happens to the client that's detrimental. The worst thing that could happen is you don't get notes done in time. You miss something in the note, but I don't think you would miss anything that's detrimental, right? It could be something that maybe doesn't help them when the case is much. So, but that is huge in error and that's going to happen a percentage of the time with just about anybody. So the odds that you would make a mistake that is like absolutely unacceptable. I don't believe it's something that you can or would do. So you are going to make mistakes and sometimes it may cost somebody something, but I promise you that everybody that they work with including themselves make those types of mistakes. Mark makes those mistakes very rarely, but they happen. Sweet James, everybody in there is going to make those types of mistakes. So what they're going to do to evaluate that, right? Like I said, unless you did something that's like a detrimental life or death to the client, they're going to look at that and go, that really sucks. Jonah and they're probably going to yell or whatever and then get it out and then put it in perspective and go, yeah, but she shows up every day. She can take the feedback. She doesn't something wrong. I need to make a mistake. I need to be corrected on a mistake. And then she keeps improving. So they're not going to measure you according to the mistake that you made. They're going to. It will feel like that in the moment. That's what it feels like when we make mistakes. That's all we can think about.
00:10:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's all we feel.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then, because of the nature of their business, they have to learn how to put things in a perspective. Keep people. There aren't a lot of people that can do what you do. There's competition and there are a significant amount, but they don't all show up. They don't all break really good notes. They do not all have really notes. It's not all timely. And they don't all meet their patients, love them like yours do. So, your value is going to buy you some leniency, if and when you do make your mistakes. You can't mess this up so bad that marks reputation is completely tamed. Whatever mistakes you will make and you will make them, they will not be detrimental. to mark in his relationship. Even if he gets stressed out and think that that's a possibility, it's not going to happen because Mark has a tendency to worry and stress too much as well. But he's also really good at putting it back in perspective and go, you know what, it'll be what it'll be. But if you two feed off of each other, stress moment, then those are going to be periods of animosity. what you need to do is say, you know what, I need the mark that says everything's going to be okay. Because I know you have that in you. That's what he is. When I'm sitting there and he's told me something bad that's happening, oh, I feel sorry. I feel like a mama and I just want to be like, how can I make it better? And he'll be like, but everything will be okay. I'm like, well, like I know you how I have to go there because I'm normally like, does he ever tell you what my nickname is for him?
00:11:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
No.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or you want to know why every time we would get on the call like how you doing I'm like what is wrong with you I was just so like two years later I'm like I'm just gonna call you E or because and now he is very cognizant of not showing up that way he didn't like it but he also wasn't you know a child about it he kind of realized that I said it for a reason I didn't say it to insult him or degrade him I said it because that's not helpful it's just not if you want to be unhappy then focus on the things that aren't great and it's not that he doesn't have real hard things going on you know but we have to like I've told you we have to focus on what we want to grow so if you want the good things to grow you have to focus on on, on what growth. So, but what happens is, so I heard something probably about 10 years ago that shifted me. I like, I feel like crying again, just thinking about it, because I thought about how much I did it, how much my family did it, how much most people did it. And that is that we give our best manners and behavior to complete strangers and everyone other than our family. And we say, well, it's because our family, they can handle the real us, and we can be ourselves. But what they mean is, I can be rude, I can be snappy, I can be short because I'm in a bad mood. What really should happen is we give our best to the people that we love the most, our most politeness, our most good, you know, our greatest amount of respect. And we should hold our tongues and master our tongues better around the people that we love. And this is like I can cut somebody down in half with my words in half a second and put them for decades. And I used to be proud of that. And it's a terrible thing. I was proud of it because I was hard a lot and I only did it to mean people and it wasn't okay because it came out a lot. And I realized I really have to think about my words. Because I'm clever and witty, I could say really hurtful things, not even just thinking I'm joking. I'm funny. Not funny. I've watched marriages be destroyed over that kind of stuff. So when it comes to like the worry and the stress and the fear and the pressure, you guys have to remember that you have to give each other your best. Like if this was an employee or this was a best friend, what would you say? to them. How would you use your words then? Our parents, children, spouses, they should get our very, very, very best. And it's really hard to do sometimes. But I think that the two of you can have the most powerful support of each other because I know that you love each other and I know you believe in each other and I know that you like working together. So if you can figure out how to read each other when you need different things, when you need that support and you need that encouragement. And if you can tell yourself, this is the person that gets me through everything, I need to not hurt him. He needs to not hurt you. Not that you've never do it intentionally. We do it accidentally. That's my whole point, is we just, we're in our homes and we let our guards down, but what that can can mean is we also let ourselves react in ways that really we shouldn't. And that's us backwards. Because I think that your greatest strength is going to be, at least when it comes to this business stuff, is marked. And likewise, that's what I think about families, you're going to be able to get through all of this stuff. And I think another thing that would be good. So you've got me, but if there are other women, so just kind of like raise up your antenna to notice like when you meet a woman, maybe at an event or something, and you feel like you kind of click with her, and maybe like you have either similar or complementary personality types and things.
00:16:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have two right now.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, that is awesome.
00:16:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
The one is a, she's younger than she's, she's so much her. I, we, oh. These two women are connected because of love of luxury, so that's how we connected the other. The one woman she's in for, she has an Airbnb, she's the eldest, so it's a family business that kind of handed on to her, so she's ever since, she's very mature, she's basically doing Airbnb business. And the other one, she's Japanese, has a, I don't understand fully her business, but I talked to them and I did ask the Japanese, she's a little reserved, she's, that's how her personality is, but both of them really just told me, because what do you do when you feel like you don't, you want to feel like keep on going? And they said, and you feel overwhelmed, and then they, both basically say the concept is just to keep on going, keep on working. So I wanted to tell you this, this past two weeks. I cried a lot. And because I feel overwhelmed, some Mark saw, some Mark, he didn't, like this Monday, he's, we push our buttons intentionally. I mean, unintentionally, like, I asked his help about this order set. I said, can I see a sample of your doctors, you just have to redact the names and the things. I just need to see how they order stuff because we cannot use the triple kit on all time because we're not prescribing narcotics. We're just recommending physical therapy and get an MRI. So he showed me a checklist and he has, he helped me do it from something to Adobe. And I'm technologically challenged. I mean, I just can't, I don't do them. But anyway, he's so. He's helping me and he's very frustrated because he's also in pain. I don't know, he told me I was pain on his knee and he's very snappy and I said, it's okay, just eat first and I know he's very rare mark with that snack, but he can.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pain will, pain makes everything go out the door because and then I said, it's okay, I told him it's okay, just eat or whatever, but he wants to do it for me.
00:19:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
He knows, I need, he knows I need it. So he's very snappy with me and then I just started crying, but I keep on working. Like I got his own, he can't see, we cry and I just keep on working. I'm not crying more because of how he is.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know he's in pain frustrated. That's all for a while, it's a relief.
00:19:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's a frustrating part that I don't know how to do it myself, that I will always see.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and to help me like I don't want that in general. Do you want me to teach you things?
00:20:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I just I definitely feel like I need the how to edit the things because right now it's more work because I have to input each. I don't know how to share. I want to show you what I'm seeing. Can I go there and share? What do I do?
00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, click share and then you can either choose we know.
00:20:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I click sharing your screen sharing. Can you see it? Yes. this this is the right now. This is the in case the Cheryl started and then we input stuff. example, a patient's name and the date of injury and birth and the priority. That's what she did. This is not me. This is just all her and and status. So when we have an email, we put. situation's same birthday and the status I put scheduled and This is my note supposedly and this is Bella's note And who's the case manager? So we're this is what she did and I think it's nice. I think it's okay. I'm sure eventually But so far we're at 32 32 and she put other liens here for me from other Which I haven't inputted anything yet. I haven't put inputted the last the last ones I got This is the lead She shared me the charges Oh Okay, she shared these are the charts so now I'm doing the billing because I want To to do this first, I know it's going to be more work, but I'm doing the buildings. So this is the billing and this is this is the orders right now. Okay, I have to input each name here, copy, paste the name here, put the birthday, put the address, put the date that I ordered it.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the one that Mark did for me. So check that I kind of pick and choose which ones leave behind.
00:22:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then this is the black one. I added this and I removed some stuff. This is like three texts. And then the electronic signature is already there. So I have to do this each and every once. I feel like it's tedious. I want to integrate eventually here. This is our this is our charting system. So later on, once Dr. E arrive from Australia, and then once I get back from Paris, I guess I want to integrate here when are you guys leaving and coming back so we're I'm well Right now. It's it's still continue. I think we should continue. I mean our life should continue I know I just want to know because it does I know I'm sorry. I meant because it's I feel like it's still I've hung up in the air like I don't know how mark feels how his mom feels because it's his mom's birthday Oh, but if it ever it's January Not at nighttime of January night.
00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what a week Okay, and then how long will you be gone?
00:23:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think the 18 or 17.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay It's a week. Yeah So Yeah, do you want me to stop? Yeah, I just want to tell you something really quick and then I keep keep going but the the way that a I have evolved this year. A lot of this stuff, you probably will be able to integrate and put together. The limitation is that anything that has to be HIPAA compliant is going to be slower than the rest of the stuff. But lots of people want this, so this will happen quickly. you will run your business best when you understand how everything works. it will be best for you to gather the skills and to get them because you'll be better at hiring and managing the people who help you in the future if you know how to do it yourself. So the way that I want you to kind of always think about it is when there's something to be done, it's um I do it and that's you, right? That's you and the person that you're hiring and then it's you do it. So I do what we do what you do it. So you always learn how to do it first, then you do it together and then you have them do it and then you just watch from time to time. And that just, like I said, just makes sure that you understand, it also helps us to not overburden somebody. It's very easy to hire somebody and think, that's really easy. You should be done by now, but when you've done it, you have a little more respect for who you're hiring and who you're managing.
00:25:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I wanted to tell you, like I talked to well on Monday Tuesday, like I called her, I said, and talked to her even when I was in Japan, we did a like a FaceTime with Cheryl, her and I, and then now we've been talking separately, like I told her I want you, I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, I know she's new, this is, I'm trying to, you know, obviously the sense of ownership will eventually be up to her, but I wanted to include her, like on everything, said both of us are starting this, so I don't want you to feel it. I basically call her, I'm always here, but anyways what I'm doing now and you tell me if this is wrong, is I want her to listen to how I
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
call the patient.
00:26:01 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm trying to tell her how the process is. The first process is when the email comes in. Our goal is to make sure that we call the patient and set an appointment right away. And I will tell her that in 30 minutes, 30 minutes each patient, these are the block of hours. want you to schedule for me. I have yet to email her dad. supposed email that yesterday for her because we just talked. Of course, I wasn't able to do that. But that was my plan is to tell her, for example, from Monday to Friday, these are the block of times I want you to fill them up with patients. So that's my plan. And we weren't able to do it with one patient yesterday, wherein he can hear how I talked to the patient, how I made this schedule. And I just have to write it down. have yet to write it down. So I told her from the email comes in, call the patients, put them on our Google drive your information, start the chart on our software and then send a zoom link meeting. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. Sorry. I have to write it down.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But she, I told the first assignment. Okay. Tell me I'm going to write it down. Okay. What happened first?
00:27:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So first is when the email comes, I told her to, I guess, put it in the Google drive. I want her to have her own flow, but I told it put it the Google drive, call the patient, set up an appointment based on the block time I gave you in 30 minutes, fill it up and set up appointment based off the blocks that I have yet to give her. But yeah, box schedule and 30 minutes at a time. now, eventually I'll get faster. I actually added something, I told her while you're on the phone with the patient, send the lean agreement, the electronic lean consent agreement, which she actually did and she just finished it. Because I told her I need this, the first time I talked to her last week while I honest, I did ask her that we're both learning the Adobe, I guess, that you all don't like the part we're in after they sign. Something is sent to their email and they have to verify that first. So she's trying to see if we can remove that because if a patient elder is patient, how do they go back and forth to the go back to the email and verify like we're trying to make it because because it's an electronic signature, you may not be able to get around that because there has to be something.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and kind of verification that the person signing is the correct person.
00:29:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now what I've been doing is sending the PDF scan document which is actually like sent it and I told the patient to sign it and give it to me and they're actually giving it back to me.
00:29:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they can even with Adobe they can print it from their wet signature and bring it to you if you want that.
00:29:25 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean email the email is back to me.
00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know but I'm saying if you want to skip the authentication where they're not signing they can probably just print it. You can have an email to them where they print it, wet signature, bring it back. So but one of the others is going to have to happen because it is a authentication. The whole point of a signature is authentication.
00:29:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So yeah so that's something that we're trying to work on. In the meantime I'm giving them a PDF form. It's not assignable. It's just seen the patient printed, they've been printing it and writing it in pen. So that's because 99, I would say 95% of these patients or 99, the first meeting is video like Dr. Fuji. Unless we're going to do procedure, that's the time that will come to the clinic. So I told her while you're on the phone, do the send them after you schedule them, send them the lien document to sign and send it before or after. You know, we're trying to be flexible with them. And then thirdly, I want you to ask a simple medical and surgical history. And I have yet to write it down for us. That's actually what keeps me the time on my 30 minutes with them.
00:30:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have those questions?
00:30:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I have those questions.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, are they in your head or are they right now? Okay, tell me.
00:31:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So basically I asked do you have any medical history sometimes they say oh I'm fine I'm healthy but the next question is do you take any medication regularly oh I said oh yeah I'm taking cholesterol medication so you have high cholesterol so it's just oh but I'm fine now well you're fine because you're not cholesterol medical but anyways I'm trying to teach her how to get that information so I need the medical and surgical history that's it the rest I will ask I just need those two for you to write it down and then I'll figure it out later and maybe there is a way that will be easier for her maybe just a checkup or type I'm not entirely sure what else currently in the in our current charting system it is um maybe I should just tell her to open create the chart open the note open a note and because She's part of the note that's checklist, but she has to look for it, you know? I don't know if it's going to be harder for her. easier for her to type, but I thought about it. She's not a medical drink. She does not have a medical background. So if a patient tells her, oh, I I don't know, carpal tunnel repair or something like that. She may not know how to spell it, and I don't want her to film. So I'm trying to see what's going to This is very easy.
00:32:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it's a spelling thing, you just literally go at, if she has Siri or Google, ask, how do you spell carpal tunnel? Right. So you don't actually need to, you can look it up and Google picks it too, but either way, she can just ask that.
00:32:46 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It is better to ask and then check off on our checkup system on our chart, patient's charts that she can, once you open new notes, there is a checkup there. Yeah.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so, so think about Oh, what you get when you go to a new doctor, they ask you all of this medical history. They ask you if you have any known allergies to medications.
00:33:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's going to be something that's important for you.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking any current medications?
00:33:14 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
you want to make sure that you don't have any. So actually for us, the only medication that because with the lean patients, I there's only one that I prescribe medications, but the prescribing medications is kind of. What's the term? I avoid it for lean patients. Yeah, we reach for some reason that was the practice, but I don't like narcotics. don't like Fuji does not give their heart. He will probably give some muscle relaxants, but not narcotics, right? for my health insurance, chronic pain, every month patients, I give narcotics to them. So for me, It's like, yeah, so it's very, very rare, and the other thing is if we're going to do an epidural, I will ask, are you on blood thinners? And I have some very specific question because those are the ones that will affect the procedure. So, I mean, again, I'm trying not to make Bella a work a lot because I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, but I need those two.
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need medical history. That's not the way to do this, the right person for you is the one that helps you the amount that you need. So, it's not your job to worry about if they're overwhelmed. It's your job to find out if they can handle the job. Does that make sense?
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's still hard for me to grasp the concept because my mentality is I want to be a part of it rather than, I don't know what the term.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're delegating your application. don't want to have the you want to delegate. But you thinking about the entire process, and you should be reviewing all the notes, it won't take you nearly as long to read them as it will for you to put them in. So, and whether you read them all, although I would, because you're accountable for all of them, it's saving you time to have her input everything, but you're still reviewing it. And from time to time, so she'll be on calls with patients asking these information, right?
00:35:35 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, so that when she get, like I said, when she get, I was trying to tell her the steps, so when she get the email, call the patients, and this is what I want her to start doing, like just ask for medical and surgical history.
00:35:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what we'll be in email, right?
00:35:55 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, when the email comes, I told her it's very important, our response time. You know, it's fast. I told her once we get it, put in Google Drive the information, call the patient set up an appointment based on that time frame of 30 minutes. And then while on the phone, help them send the, what do you call that, the electronic consent patient. So we will need patient's email. So there's actually nothing on the Google Drive with the patient email, may have to add that. Because right now I'm just writing it on my notes as I talk to them. So I have it on my phone notes. So, and then I said that I told her to set up, while you're setting up the schedule, initially I told her, you can have access on my Zoom link. And then Cheryl said, why are you assuming we have a Gmail? count that can do that for you. There's like a zoom meeting, like a meeting. And the Google Meet. And she said it's HIPAA compliant. I know Mark told me that the zoom is HIPAA compliant. But again, I think it's okay. She told me she's okay. So I'm going to start telling Bella to start doing it on Google Meet and then start plugging in schedules there. For right now, 30 minutes per patient, eventually I'm going to get faster and do 20 or 15 minutes each patient, which is the standard anyways. So right now it's two patients an hour, but the goal is to do four patients an hour and be faster and so if I do Yeah, so I mean, four times, yeah, if I do four patients an hour in four hours, I can have 80 patients a week. That is very close to getting 400 a month, like that's very doable, like if I just do four-hour patients, like, and this is just California, like I haven't even touched it later on in the Washington, like it's actually perfect timing, like you said, everything I need to hone is done. Everything that I do now will prepare me for Washington. So yeah, I don't know if it's a check-off is better or hurt.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Typing let's let's let's just say this. Um, template. We're going to call it template. Um, So, let's do one. Let's think about this. Let's. Where's my undo thing? We moved the alert is. Um, what did you do that? Oh, that's why. Okay. Okay. let's see. You It's one one No, I'm just giving an example date. I know what it is So that we want to highlight this because this is the very first up like dude, okay, then put Singing into patient like there's a folder it's called Thomas lean Yeah That's what the folder name is, Chona's Lean, Chona's Lean Case, Chona's Lean Case is actually So yeah, I mean Okay, so let's see Let me think about the exact water I forgot to put water Oh, that cough. It's crazy how long coughs can linger. There's some new things in here that's pretty cool. I'm just trying to think of, so here's what we're going to do. Because you can have one doc that is a checklist with instructions that has all of this. But then you can also have a template that she just saves a copy and fills out. I think that that's probably the better thing to do is create a checklist and she can either open it or print it off. The thing with printing off is if you go and make an update, then she's got an old copy. So anytime you update, you say shred the one you've got, make a new one, print it up.
00:43:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean, the checklist for her when I mean, came, it comes in.
00:43:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like, right. So we could have one thing that's a checklist, right? That says, these are all the things you're gonna get. And then the other thing is an actual document that's got all of that stuff in it.
00:43:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, no, we're thinking of writing it on that temporary document that this one she created a, she can all this, she can all do this in the form. It's a matter of obviously being fast. It's like, she put the pages on the Google Drive. Whatever. For her flow is eventually, she will eventually have her flow, but I want this all done and I want her to create a chart, creating a chart needs name, birthday, and she can put the address later. When she created a patient's chart, she can open a note or a memo for non provider for non doctor non NPE staff, and they can write whatever they want, they can they can free text. So that's what I was thinking of, where to put the medical and surgical history, either a memo or either open a chart where in, there's a check off. have, I do want me to show you.
00:44:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:44:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay.
00:44:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me stop. Sure. There you go.
00:44:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
How do I? Okay. Share. Share. Okay. Okay. So. This is our thing. For example, I'm going to do a test. Yes. 10. test. So she could this is a new chart, for example, the patient, she can put under here notes, either create memo, or where she can free write, this is what memo looks like. And I can just write like that, you can save it, or do a new patient form. But this is not the note that I use for liens. The note that I use for liens is so, because the soap is just very simple. So these are minus the medication. Think about the medication, but I did objective, objective, and there's nothing in here about medical, surgical history. So I don't know which one is better for her.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's probably you should have both. Like, you. This is the thing, it does not matter what business we're starting with, does not matter what business I'm working with, people have a tendency to want to do less work, thinking that somehow that's better.
00:46:16 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So this is, I want to show you, this is the new note, this is our note for health regular health insurance and this one right here PMHX primary medical history. So when you click this, it's like a check off box.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so all the patients, for all the diseases, and then you can also free type here.
00:46:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, and then she can save it. But the thing is, if she do that, then I have to open this.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not combine them? Can you not create a whole new form that combines both of them?
00:46:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, you can. So like for example, So this one, I will open soap, because that's what I use for liens, this one right here is called soap note that will integrate this note that I just did. However, it's not going to copy the medical history, because the soap note does not have a medical center.
00:47:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, what I'm saying is, as like a template form, so like in your dropdown menu, you have all these different options, right? So note is one of them, right? All of those, what I'm saying is, can, and you may have to ask what the name of the company is, what is that? Can you make me a form that combines soap with with medical history? Yes, because then you have it all in one file, all right, so you're not opening multiple things. I don't see why they wouldn't do that for you.
00:47:56 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, that would be I'll be making. Oh, also. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Um, you can, you can actually do this. No, how do I? Okay. You can do this one. I can create my own notes. It's just macros that I don't know how to do this. Cheryl just told me this the other day. He's like, this is mine and I can create.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So look, this is, I'm going tell you the fastest way to do this. Go click on the, the help, the question mark at the top of the menu. Um, in the blue, top right of the screen, like by your account.
00:48:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Over little bit more right here.
00:48:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. on that. Scroll down. All the way down.
00:48:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think this one took place. The list of template. I don't need to. I don't That's, I don't want that. This one. No types. This is what she told me. Customize a list of no types. And there's like a macro.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just show you real quick because I don't know if this is what you show me. I'm going to hold on. going to go Google something. How do I combine notes, type templates in Deborah?
00:49:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Here create template. Is this one right here? But then it's macro. Like I don't know this title.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, the title is Chona's notes or something like that.
00:49:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You can just do lean notes. Okay. I guess me. And version one.
00:49:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:49:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
then I don't know what's next.
00:49:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, uh,
00:50:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I, this, this is what I don't know why I know it's very, um, my, it's macro. So I, they told me to, how about I'll just add stuff at a section or at a care plan. I just have to play around with it. So at a section, maybe, um, don't know, is there a drop down menu? Uh, no, uh, there. Oh, it, these are like the, the, what's already being used to exam in detail. don't know if this is correct, exam gen detail.
00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Click on that and see what happens.
00:50:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Uh, save, just go save and see what happens. Can you just add that there? Um, yeah, I think this is like, more, I can call the customer service and that's what I would do. And then, um, I'm going to tell you, like this,
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People resist calling support or getting support. It is the fastest way to get exactly what you want.
00:51:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It will save you hours of frustration. That's what happened. That's why I was able to get the um remember the able to this is the the system where I was able to give electronic prescription. This was the problem. Yeah. then the other doctor who came at this and the new doctor came in at the same time with me. He still cannot. It's only with already been mine.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You go to the expert. If you need something, you go to the expert. Their support knows their software. And if they won't do it for you, say, do you have um affiliate like like a partner agency that I can hire who can go do this for me? For sure. All you want to do all you like there are two forms that are exactly what you want.
00:51:49 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You just need to merge them, right? Right. And this one, I need this exactly this one. of me writing the name Databrit, I just all like, you know, manually. So what I mean, these are my annually copying the name and this is so much work. want this to be integrated in that system.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you give them like have a copy that has what you want and that doesn't have any patient information say, I need soap, I need this, I need this. I need them in one form. Please make it for me or tell me who I can hire to have it made for me.
00:52:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. Because these are all like electronic everything is done.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said, hold on a second. Do they have a um, Tebrat? Does Tebrat have email or help? That's support. Once again.
00:52:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I hope this. Yeah, I believe so. That's that. That's how I called. did both.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did help this and call. Yeah. Yeah, I would just call him today is New Year's Day. So they're probably not open but tomorrow Chona. I would. I really want you to be accountable to do this thing because it's going to make your life so much easier. Yeah. I want you to commit to me to call them tomorrow and ask them for this.
00:53:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Will you do that? Yeah, I need to do this. I need to call them for this. And in the meantime, I think for Bella, she can just type it whatever, however she understood.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would also tell her I'm going to have somebody build this for us. So it's just going to be all in one so that she knows you're proactively doing this. Just, of course, thank her like, you know, like this. Yeah, I'm really grateful that you're here to help with this. This is stressful. And I'm going to make sure that it's as easy for both of us and that we enjoy doing the work.
00:53:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
What do you think of this one so far? Like what how Cheryl did this is what we're doing right now. I'm just copy casing it. And I'm just putting my notes here.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's a good start. But the thing that I love about CRM type The thing database like Deborah is that you you probably have a better search function a reporting function It's going to be a lot easier to print out for the attorneys for you to be able to send them the documents And so what I do is after there's a document here.
00:54:15 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's so easy. I just download it Then I send it I copy the building is also done here. It's very I already took over those which is actually very good I think Cheryl and I already got into this space where I'm not there to take her day I'm there to make sure it's not a lot of work for her So I think we're there Within this sort of we're there like she was also text because I told her about what happened and she's very And I think we're okay. I understand how she is. I think she understand what I need and it clicked right away like Yeah, so I think we're good in terms of that because it's so easy for her to give out and remember before she's like No, let us do the building.
00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But now he's like, okay, this one, he showed me how to do it.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, share me the charges. So, well, and if you bring them into the age of technology and simplifying things where they've got everything they maybe knew they should have been doing but weren't doing because it was too hard, they're going to love you for it. And the more the longer you're there, the safer Cheryl will feel.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you kind of got to bear down on all of this and know that I love the scripture that says you shall know that by their fruits. most people don't think about things like that, but we do measure people like that. We measure what's happening. So, fear is natural and it's going to happen. But when a person just keeps showing up consistently, good constantly, being helpful constantly, like eventually you're like, you know what, that person's good because you get the same kind of fruit all the time. know what I mean?
00:55:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And they saw me work well, I was in Japan that I, you know, when I talked to them, I was did you kind of be huge. They saw the work and she told me like, no, I you're much better to work with. Dr Lee, so hard to get him to do things for me.
00:56:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, they're going to love you, first of all, because you're just able to love. But yeah, but that's why though, Chona is because you have such a good heart, but you also show up and and you work. So it's not just you have a good heart and I wish things were nice.
00:56:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You have a good heart and you roll up your sleeves and get to work to make it nice. Right.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll definitely.
00:56:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. And I told them, no, I fully, I know the gravity. I'm not taking this lightly. I am full on it. I can't believe how fast I can do the note. No, it's got to keep getting better.
00:56:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, is there's going to be a tipping point where like, okay, you can get better.
00:57:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay, it was not perfect. Obviously, like when I was a little gentler coming in this past couple of days, I have you know that are like not done. But the essentials, like the case manager, by the way, I just want to tell you real quick, there's a case manager there that we are like, we are in sync. I asked her, I told her, like, you know, I want to know, I don't want to bother, you know, I was like, I actually like you're very responsive. You know, that's like, okay, that's a good feedback. So it's easy for us to like text each other, call each other. And so, so far, you know, she's she's just one department. And she's her department, the one that's giving me like all of this. And I am, I don't know, that's the combination of stress and excitement at the same time. But I feel good. I like the idea that if I travel, I can still make have some money and
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're crazy. I love that. I go on trips and because of the way that I've got my business, I've spent 22 plus years working on. So what I work on is making sure that I keep learning the highest value thing. So I keep learning new technology. I keep learning new systems and new automations so that I can keep saving people more time, more energy, so that they can make more money. So I get paid really well for it, This is what you're doing. leveraging your expertise to be like this.
00:58:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Nursing is one thing, but nursing and managing lean patients for attorneys is a whole new ball game. So because number one, I get paid really well and because it's all zoom and emails and whatnot, I can take it anywhere.
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, any world and because I'm not doing it time. Once you don't work, I can still enjoy wherever I go. Even if I still work on vacation, it's maybe a couple hours a day and the rest of the time.
00:59:08 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, which is the day. Yeah, it's a life I choose all day, every day.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would rather have that than like this nine to five where I can only take a couple weeks off.
00:59:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I can go on vacation any time I want. And I told Dr. E already, there is the hospital, you know, I still wanted to continue for now. I definitely like the hospital setting, the hospital patients. But I already kind of told him that the Monday to Tuesday between 1.30 to 4.00 or 4.30 that I'm there. Seeing patients in the clinic, sometimes they give me 20 and only 10 show up.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I feel like that's not a good use of my time.
00:59:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And I told him, I'd rather have the telemedicine patients because I can still be. calling them and still take care of the link patients and the hospital patients. So eventually I have to let go of that afternoon set time. Like I, although I don't know, I'm still in the works on end. So I don't know what the right thing to do, although Cheryl thinks a Thursday afternoon specifically for me because right now the office is in the afternoon on Thursday, they want to open that up specifically for me, lean, not just my lean, but also take care of these lean patients.
01:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so always remember that you're the architect, but in this balance where you're unsure, just keep showing up even if it's not optimal for a while because what happens is there comes this breaking point, this tipping point where you you've and it's usually a very stressful period where you're kind of balancing this act and then you let this thing go because you're already got this thing. What happens is most people want to jump to this thing after it shows up without this being stressful. It's not like that. You basically end up having both at the same time before you let it go. So you'll be really full, really busy and go, okay, this doesn't make any sense anymore. And then in terms of like explaining what you're doing and why you want to do it because I think sometimes you struggle with the yeah, but you know I need to be there to help him whatever. Always remember that you're not like anybody else. You're not employee. You're not his nurse, right? You are here as a profit partner. Always remember this profit partner. You're a profit partner. Okay, so your role is you came here to make money for both of you as optimized as possible. the way that you optimize for him, you're making Cheryl better. You're making his this better. He's already giving you that feedback. Okay, but the cost of that to him is you don't get the bottleneck me having me be at the hospital and not filling up my time. But now you don't say it that way, right? But that's what I need you to understand is that because of the gift that you give, you also get to give that to yourself. You don't get to give him all the blessings and take care of all the business and just take all the burden off of him, right? And then let burden be put on you in reciprocity.
01:02:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That doesn't make any sense. So actually, remember, I remember you asked me what's my ideal schedule? I'm thinking, I'm thinking in my head right now, what I can see is go to the hospital early. I need to knock that off early. Um, either I'm still deciding, you know, I know I need to be consistent either go there at six thirty or seven o'clock and be done. acts an hour and rounding my patients and then go back home and start my day in the morning and this is right now the morning is for my telemedicine patients but eventually once Washington started I want the morning but again obviously I want something doesn't mean that it's gonna be perfect I want that to be the time and then in the afternoon will be the lean patients here and then I'm going oh it may not be perfect but you being really specific about what you want gives you the best chance of getting exactly what you want what I have noticed is that number one that that is true period but what will happen is the Tina today that's making that plan and that vision will get right up to there and go oh now that I'm here and experiencing this it could be even better right but
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wouldn't have known that until I'd gotten to that point. So keep doing that, keep figuring out, you know what, this would probably work best. And then know that you're not going to know if it's best until you've lived it and allow yourself to continually be fluid, changing shape according to whatever is happening.
01:04:18 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now that's, that is definitely what's happening. And I'm actually, I actually want, I just realized Wednesday, because I know we set the time. And this is the time for like prime time for my patients.
01:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like, it is because they're here. You know that because you're here, right? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
01:04:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're like, Oh, now that I see like from 11 to three to four, like those are the times that I've been setting up my patients. But I don't know if it's because I'm adjusting it on my Japan time. But now that I'm, yeah, seriously. And now that I'm Here, I remember scheduling a patient, yes, Monday from 12 and 12 p.m. onwards. So, you know, I guess the reason why I'm saying that is because we have one meeting. So if I give block time to Bella, like, do you need to change your time? Is that what you're saying? I don't know. Or do I, do you be in So the brain have a break.
01:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what the So, I mean, I keep a pretty light schedule on purpose with some flexibility, but I also don't have a ton. Like, I have a certain amount of window, but we can figure out something probably. So whether it's a different day that it does infect things or different time, we can figure it out.
01:05:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But it has to, yeah, you tell me, you know, which day and so if you were to create the schedule, wanted right now.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One time. would you be able to meet on what days?
01:06:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think if I am. I think I just don't want to discount the 12 o'clock time because some of the patients are working and that they're but without without worry.
01:06:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you were not worried about what Tina thought or anybody else thought and if you could do it ideally, what would you do?
01:06:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
For our meeting? Yeah, right. OK, I like the Wednesday, the middle of the week. I I'm really thinking, I really don't know. Well, here's between 11 to one. Like that time period, like 11 to 12 or I'm not sure. think that would be the time because I've noticed I'm start I'm putting in patients 12 o'clock.
01:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I have mission meetings from nine o'clock to 10 and 10 to 11. So I would become so every other week is my 10 to 11. So on some of those days, I won't probably be as mentally prepared as I am. But okay, as long as we're talking well and we're doing our good work, it won't matter. Just know that like normally what I do is create a lot of buffer space before call so that I'm sitting here.
01:07:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm looking at all your notes. It's fresh in my mind.
01:07:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if I if you want to just do 30 minutes or you think an hour, it's a question. Well, it depends on what you need. If if sometimes a half an hour might be okay, but for the most part an hour. And you know, also it depends on how much we're talking throughout.
01:08:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
week.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, like you and I sometimes were texting a lot and that can be enough. It depends on your need. I don't ever want you to feel like I needed more and you don't get it.
01:08:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Like right now, and I'm not worried about it because there's stuff to catch up on and we need to do.
01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I won't have any calls after that. So it would be only you needing to run to go get to a patient.
01:08:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
If you wanted more time, I'd be able to give that to you. Right. Okay. So is it between 11 to 12? Okay.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could do that. Yes. And also because my mission meetings are not, they're not like my work stuff. They're, they're training, but they're not, they're not draining at much slower pace. I'm not the one mentally creating everything and stuff like that. it's not, it's not a burden. I really enjoy them. They're a, ooh, emotions, a blessing.
01:09:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, good. And maybe that's great. Perfect then. So that way I can get the secondary energy from it. There's so much things that are happening. And I'm very glad that we were able to catch up because I feel like, I don't know if you can feel it like so much. It's like, I feel like I'm just vomiting with the stuff that happened. And I do, I think I'm gonna try to, you know, succinctly because I'm not, I know I'm not a good story color, but I would succinctly say that now it felt good. It felt good to have that account locked in. I know this is a trial period, this first month. I know that. That's what's very important throughout the past few days. We already figure out like what work, what doesn't work. Like the, the, the triplicates, I already said this is not gonna work. We can't do every patient every order like this. So we did the checklist, which is really great. Everything is in there. And then the lean is being digitalized, which is great. And then I learned from the case manager, she told me what's important for them because every firm, I guess, is different. For them, what's important, that checklist prescription that I just showed you. The notes and the billing is not as important for them. They're like, that could be days later.
01:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't care.
01:10:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Such kind of, in a way, put a little bit of a pressure with myself because myself is like, I'm putting the notes first. And then I'd say, RX, the RX prescription and billing to follow. But now because of communication, I learned that they need the RX first. So now, after every session, while I'm with the patient, I'm clicking off already.
01:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I say send it to them. That's whatever. Love you. This is gonna be I know it's trial. They're gonna there would be no reason for them to not do business with you I'm excited for you. I'm so proud of you.
01:11:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're going through so much I think I can go through so much and that's why I said I need to talk to you because I feel like I need to be Grounded I feel like I'm a grounded person anyways But I think I need to be grounded in this particular aspect of my life because this is like my act I'm holding on to this one because I know this is my win that I know I will win this year. So it's like I don't want to interrupt you. No go ahead.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would just add one more thing and you might have already done something like this But when when I am going for our things like I just have so much love for the people that are going through it with me and who are helping me so My type of gift giving is generally words because I feel like that's something that I have
01:12:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
By the way, good and I've learned that so that's what I give but for you like you like luxury things Like maybe you give something to Cheryl and Bellant. It did actually I figured I mean if you're close by I was like I know you're I mean I didn't know your address actually But mark maybe a mark that but I I know she loves because Cheryl and I again I think we connected now I mean week within the four months that we know each other is connected. I was able to I'm a very personable person anyways like I just I don't have problems like you know you're awesome with people but I learned she loves vintage brooch any like stuff and then in Japan I saw the Chanel brooch and it's 2005 so this vintage Chanel stuff is more it's better quality. Oh, yeah, and in Japan they don't sell fake So it's a crime, right? So I give it to her. She loves it. She's like, you don't have to. But I understand, and she understands, I understand the work that she's actually helping me. Now, it's not because Dr.
01:13:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E told her, but because I've been talking to her, I said, this kind of love you. You really are, I'm not telling you this because we were together. You're really just that level boy. You're, hate, I love emotions, but I hate them because physically, they're overwhelming in my body. Like, I feel it everywhere. But, Chona, you, you're not, you're not common, you're rare in everything. And you, you're the kind of person with the love and the light that you have, that people are going to want to have around them. And even when it's professionally, they're still, they're going to be like, I want to do good for her because you're doing good for them.
01:13:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, I'm going to keep happening, except for there are just some bad people that you don't want to, okay. Yeah, I know they are. And again, like I came from before I left for Japan, I gave them like, you know, just little things. And I obviously, because I love Hermes, and it helps my chance of getting a bag.
01:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if I will talk about that some other time that time.
01:14:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But I gave them like small perfume, like eat all of them, not because I see how they work. I see how I'm just very given. think Marc and I are interested because these are stuff for sharing, like we are blessed, like it's okay to like be generous.
01:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I didn't have point of having it. It's like karma and everything.
01:14:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then on that day that I got into an accident, actually, I have Christmas gifts with me. I don't know if you know this, I got into accident, right? You know this, right?
01:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if you know.
01:14:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Wait, before we went before we left for Japan. Did I not tell you before I left for Japan like a couple that week same week I fell in front of a I still have a slip and fall in front of a Starbucks two days later I have an accident it for my previous my daily driver I really love and it's still in the bar to shop and then Mark made a comment like isn't it coming threes and then you get the the theft and then I did the theft here so I said this has to be it like it's that's it it's I'm done and then just good things have to happen. But here's the thing you you didn't let it break you like Mark was worried about you because he said this is the stuff that you work for but I did no I was I don't want to cry because I think I'm the first one on the scene and I was so scared I was tired. I have a flashback of what happened when I was child. I didn't tell my mom because she's gonna be, she's not gonna help me.
01:16:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like she's just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be worried about her and her heart. I don't want to bring to her in the hospital.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is like three years of hard work and wins and losses. Like freaking Hermes game really caught me on the, it was like wrapped around her finger in terms of, I do love stuff. I do love luxury. I don't want this to deter me from loving what I like and living in theater. Lessons learned, know, being more, I guess we are very definitely nonchalant with stuff. We don't have bolts. don't have, my stuff is around. My mom told me, even my friends told me like, you guys have people in your house. Like we have the PA, we have the chef, like cleaners comic. We're very open. I guess it's just in life. That's how we are. We're very open to giving anything our own expertise Whatever we just give and I even question mark is this is my fault that I did this problem.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, am I being um, no, no tona It's a gift for you to know that that is not that stuff doesn't define you you can love it But it's not what's most important to you. Do you remember when you told me that you were worried, um You were kind of doubting yourself because like you were feeling bad about your financial goals And I think it was a rather time that you talked with your friends about, you know What you wanted to do and they're like, yeah, okay. Yeah, it was before it was before then and you were like You were you didn't want to be? Superficial or just about the money and then the next week you came and you told me about your hospital patients And you were just like so actually I think it was right out After that in the same conversation either way it was really recent and you were telling me how much you love them and how much love you and how much you want to take care of them. If nothing else this was just a gift for you to know that you can that part of the joy is not just that having them and having them be you know in in the closet most the time you're not seeing them all anyway you're not gonna wear them all all those things but it's that you can have them and and you get to enjoy them and you can go make more whoever took them from you they can't do that without stealing it from people you could just make it and then you make it and you give it so the gift is knowing that nobody can take anything really from you they can take the stuff you can get more stuff and if they had memories attached to them if they had meaning the memories stay with them the meaning stays with you the physical item leaves sometimes our families as a way, but their memories and the things that they give us, they don't pass away, right? They're taking from us.
01:19:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I was, I'm definitely, you know, I, I was meditating a little outside, but I noticed I'm very jumpy. I want to lock the doors, like I'm here, I got, I locked doors, I don't just come and tell me, but I noticed that I'm very jumpy and I'm on edge, but I'm looking at the positive, I'm trying, I'm not positive, yes, positive, but being objective about it, and not disregarding my process on it's a gloss, it's a grieve of losing stuff, and it's a fear of violating our privacy and our safety with the, I don't know if Mark should do that.
01:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did. The one thing I would say, and I'm, I'm a grounded person. to and but I also so I believe in being prepared but my guns are right there in a safe I've got like five of them and my girls have all got shooting I have security cameras we lock everything but what's meant to be is gonna be when it's my time God's in charge of that nobody else but I do believe in being prepared but statistically people can come back to places they've been to if it's not a lot of resistance so you may consider upgrading your security but still be peaceful I don't mean be afraid I just be prepared for the statistics maybe if you don't have security cameras just put them up security cameras are one of the best deterrents and they'll walk away that's right now again because of the neighborhood even our neighborhood they don't also have no one I think there's people that have
01:21:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
but there's no security individually, but because of this, now they're gonna, everyone is on edge around us and I call like, our neighbor across the street who have guns and they're across the street. I really like that. For some reason, I remember calling Mark because I'm the first one in there and then I call 911. I don't recall entirely the conversation 911, but I went outside because I feel safe inside and I call our neighbor and then they they like running right. I didn't even tell them what the problem is, but Keeson was like, Jonah never calls because Mark and him talk all the time, but I never called him.
01:21:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
knew you needed something.
01:21:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And so he's like, something went wrong. So him and his wife, they have a baby. They finally left their baby with their brother that's they're in the house, thankfully, so they have family with them. So they left the baby with them, toddler. And then they came to watch both of them and then mark came 20 minutes later, but they're with me in the house So I feel very grateful. That's why we love and it was we love that neighborhood That's why we don't want it to be and he's like I've been here for 25 years. I this is never happened like in the crime like There's a crazy son who killed his family and then the house was sold in at a lower price But that's he like that's That really is there's nothing like this that happened to us.
01:22:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So everyone is on edge too right now But this into is that sometimes that can bring communities together and Maybe you guys needed it for something else. There's there's so many things that we just don't even know But you did nothing wrong The there's no punishment you are doing amazing wonderful good thing as much as they There's real light and real good and God. There is an enemy and an adversary to that as well, and he's busy on his work. And, and so it doesn't mean anything. You just keep surrounding yourself with good people, keep loving them, keep supporting them. You're very good at giving as much, if not more than what you get, you're going to do amazing things. Keep thinking about this, like definitely go to Ted and say, look, this is what I need. Do you guys do this? Can you create this for me? If not, can I pay you to do it? If not, can you tell me who I can pay to do this for me? If not, we will find somebody to do it or we will sit on a call and do it together. But it's really going to make that big of a difference. These types of systems, they prevent errors.
01:23:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because I'm worried I'm going to have errors on date of birth because I'm just copy-pacing it or memorizing it and then putting it in.
01:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They prevent errors not just on your side and not even for just for the patient because now you're looking and making sure you're asking all these questions. It helps prevent errors on the attorney side like these types of systems are really important and they're worth all the work to get. So but you're the one bringing it to the table and that's you know part of your value so remember that.
01:24:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And yeah I'm very I'm on top of it like if a patient says oh my accident is 12 there's multiple occasions but there's there's a particular occasion situation I just want to tell you real quick. Patient said oh I had my accident was on the 8th of December but I didn't go to the Kaiser until the 12th and then on the attorney side the date of the accident is the 12th. So I told them I don't want to record something until I talk to you first. I said this is what the patient told me. and they verify it on their records like, yeah, oh, they're very thankful. Yeah, thank you for telling me this. That's why, that's why there's certain lingo that Mark told me that I have to write, being involved in a motor vehicle accident on or about. Yeah, it's not like on like, but like, you know, those things. Yeah, I'm very, very grateful or I think Mark right now is on a mode of, he was not being, he's tired that he's like on, I don't know what's the term, but he's on a work mode in a way. He's just, and surprisingly, we are calm Mark. We have dinner here at midnight. have, we cheers on a Sprite.
01:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
01:25:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then we have a, he bought some, you know, the popper. He was actually in the grocery when I called him that something happened, so he came right away, but he got poppers for a few years. And then we both agreed that we're going to get through this. We are very blessed and we're grateful for that. could have been a work second.
01:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:26:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Can't imagine, you know, happened to him. Because I'm the one that is leaving.
01:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's not.
01:26:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah. He just randomly decided he's going to leave too. So that's why we don't know how random is this.
01:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if he didn't leave? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you were watched over.
01:26:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, I believe that too.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You both do so much good. Like Mark, Mark has been very good for me, for my family, and been a blessing for me and to be able to get to see now I'm going to cry to get to work with you.
01:27:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm very excited and I'm very grateful when he told me that I was like, I'm very excited. And then you're a woman. know he has, I think that anyway, the point is like, it's a woman and I'm going to be able to connect better.
01:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I don't get to work with women because most women aren't making enough money to pay my prices. And if they are, they're really kind of underground, like we work underground, like, you know, and the ones that are not, they're not kind of thing and like, oh, like, attention that, like, I I don't like being , but not for the girls, you know, for my guy, for like my little inner circle kind of thing, you know.
01:28:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is my daily outfit, I'd rather, I know I love luxury stuff, they're freaking...
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'll also go climb a tree still. I was the tomboy, I love my nails, I love everything, so much, but I will put my own worm on my hook, it's still gross, but I will do it because I want to know that like I earned it all, and yeah, so I'm not, you know, for everybody. And anyway, in my industry, there's just not a lot, so getting to work with you is because your woman by itself is really special, but because it's you, Tona, you really, really, really are very unique. Your sweetness and your smartness and your tenacity, that is an incredibly unique, rare package. I know I'm one of those types of people and I get that feedback. I know from people how rare I am and that's how you are. so the fact that I got to work with you, like I'm just over the moon with it. So if you need anything, I'm here for you.
01:29:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Thank you. Well, you already are. I that's why I said this meeting had to happen because life and this is like my anchor and I'm just hanging in on this one because and then they texted me to today, the staff. They're very nice to share your and Dr. Ease. Like, do you want us to take away or tell the medicine tomorrow? I was like, no, I thought about it. It's like, no, I just have to keep on going.
01:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, these are my, you don't want to lose momentum.
01:29:48 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's what will kill you.
01:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes.
01:29:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yes. That's what I'm worried about yesterday because I know who my old me was. My old me was. There's a term I tell Marcus, you know, like when I, I'm in the mud, when I'm very depressed, I, and I'm in the mud, I get, and then after some time, I like being there. And it will be very difficult for me to get out of it, because it becomes comfortable. And I don't want to, to, I've experienced it, recently when my dad passed away. And I know how it felt. I don't, I refuse to be in that place again.
01:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of what I lift weights. I am COVID, like I thought all I wanted to do was have all the free time I wanted and all the money to do whatever I wanted to do. And then COVID came and that's what I had lots of money and lots of free time. And my spirit just died. And also, I, my body shape change, I atrophy, and I did not know how much muscle I lost. so for the last year, I've been being really, really heavy weights. only go like two to four times a month. I don't go often because I actually get weaker if I go too much. My shape has changed, especially the back side.
01:31:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
really like that. I can't tell the boys these things. can tell. I can't wait. I don't, in general, I do, I did write on my, my journal today. And, you know, I just try to meditate a little bit and just things that I want to do for myself. And I know going back to the house, it definitely is painful, but like, it's a process. I'm not going to bypass the grief feeling, the grief process. I'm not going to buy five seconds. Also, it's not normal. don't know. thing. But I am focusing on what I can control what I can focus on, which is this is one big one.
01:32:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So we should also, next week or sometime soon, I would love to know like how do you take care of yourself? Like what are you doing? Do you have?
01:32:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I don't do anything.
01:32:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A nutritionist and a trainer.
01:32:28 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm telling you.
01:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those things change my life. How I ate and how I moved. And but so many people are going home and they go obsessive and they do.
01:32:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm so proud of Mark. Like you met him two years ago. I am so proud of how he thank care of himself and oh gosh, it's like almost 12 years now. When I first met him, he doesn't like to take care of himself. Like I feel like I have to nag him to go to his doctor and stuff. but now he's and it's so it's so good. So yeah, I need to basically practice why I preach. I need talk. Yeah, I mean, I want to do those NAD stuff too.
01:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it's like, oh, yeah.
01:33:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
are all the stuff I know, but I don't.
01:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. For me, like eating dairy, I eat dairy, I'm like hung over the next day. But I found enzymes and probiotics. Yeah. And then, um, curcuminant.
01:33:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Do I could tell you? okay. I know. Like, because I have, I told you about that, the autoimmune and I need to, I even write it in my notes. It's like, I need a physical exam and blood to work.
01:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have not done that. Yes. Okay, so make a goal like write down your goals and tell me I can be accountable with you and help you but also so I can help you because you can't if you try to do all the things at once it's going to help you so you want to prioritize like what is the thing that's going to give you the most benefit first and then start stacking all the other things that kind of like make that foundation solid but you want to start with the thing that gives you the most the feeling that you can feel the change the most first I think I need to be consistent with my schedule then I pick I get a hold of that then I can do okay so actually but here's the thing I'm gonna tell you it's harder to be consistent with your schedule when you're not consistent with your diet because your diet will screw up your schedule and so if you start with your diet and energy first your schedule will become easier that's what i'm talking about like send me all your Because I'll tell you, if you do them out of order, or if you do them in the right order, each one will become easier to attain when you choose the right one first.
01:35:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. I do fast before, I do daily fast, like I do intermittent, like I do intermittent fasting, but I did a long fast before but it's more of spiritual to that when I was, you know, leaving and after that fast I feel much better. Obviously, I did lost weight and my blood word is amazing. The doctors, like what did you do? I said fast. This is like obviously lost weight. before I try this patient, the joints is better with your lighter.
01:35:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:35:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
alcohol, once in a while, I would, but that definitely flared me up. Yeah. In the nightshades, nightshades. Oh yeah, which is very good in gluten, which is very good, but I, I don't know, that's gonna be very hard to to change.
01:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I have to make some other calendar changes also.
01:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:36:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, actually, I would love to see before I leave on 9. If that's not happening, I think we should continue.
01:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, at the very least, we can do voice messages because there's no good, I think.
01:37:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, it definitely definitely helps. Okay, so I need to change the setting. Will you help me? So I don't lose, because I was worried that I'm going to lose the, what do you call that? I was worried that I'm going to lose your voice message.
01:37:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or I, that you won't leave my voice message. don't know because I did it like ages ago, but I think is it per message thing? Yeah. So it's just an all time setting. It's so weird. They've changed everything so much in this latest update. And I don't even know how to navigate everything yet. Hold on.
01:38:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)

um anyway yeah thank you now yeah but what I want to tell you is now that you've done that your messages can like my messages take up only almost two gigs and also gonna be videos and audio so what I've been doing is I thought I'm gonna lose your message too so what I've been doing actually is I've been sending your message to myself too so now I don't have to do them let's watch message I love that I love that okay all right you feel better yeah I know Mark is like texting me I know that you know he's worried about me and I'll be okay thank you know it's a process and I just don't want to love to have and to lose the love of this stuff Because I do love it. We love it.
01:42:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We love the game. Yes. Yes. Don't know Things are gonna happen and they'll happen to everything.
01:42:10 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So don't let yourself change it because it was Stuff right versus a person versus whatever, you know, and and also remember that that you love it But you don't love it more than As I was looking at mark like if something happened to him and they took a stop, but I wouldn't Probably, you know forgive myself. I will think that it's because of me loving those stuff. That's why something happened to him Like I yeah, so I'm just to have I'm just definitely glad that we're together. I can't imagine We have a great time too in Japan So we always like do uh the business classes it's it's fine we don't need the first classes it's the first no not the first because some first class looks like business class too so it's right but the first time that we have the Singapore Air Force class and it's really good and we feel rejuvenated with some little whole sweeping pause and things like that we feel like oh gosh like I need to work harder so that way if for example also mark is not here I can do this for my own family like I want them to like experience this yeah like that's exactly already what I was like I need to work hard because you want to give it to other people but the energy of having your own is what gives you the energy to go create it for other people so that's really important to understand and that's okay God said that we can have all the things that we want to as long as we want to bless other people with it you know what I just realized that This is actually the year that I have given so much to others, like in kind, whether you're only going to keep giving more money and everything. This is also the time that we got lost, you know, the most in terms of stuff.
01:44:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. when I told you about yin and yang?
01:44:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah.
01:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they always, always will balance each other out. And this is why a lot of people play really small, because they don't want those big feelings. They're afraid of the big good and they're afraid of the big bad. So you just have to know that if you get that great good, you will have the great bad. It does balance it out, but it won't feel like it's more except for in the tiny moments when it happens. So you just have to let it pass through and understand that that is universal, that is that is spiritual, that is divine, that is bigger than us, has nothing to do. with you earning anything bad, good and bad, and dark, equal opposites and all things for eternity. But you do so much great good. me, I always feel like it's worth the bad. But also, the bad is not just bad. It teaches me something.
01:45:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It leaves a gift behind.
01:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it thinks that it can break me.
01:45:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But what it does is makes me stronger. Yeah, I definitely feel there's moments, but I mean, I don't need to talk to you like right now. Like, or Dr. E is like, you don't need to see patients tomorrow. Like, no, I and what I meant is I know you wouldn't understand. Like, people don't understand. But it's like, no, I can't. I have to keep moving.
01:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's why I know that you're going to be okay, no matter what happens.
