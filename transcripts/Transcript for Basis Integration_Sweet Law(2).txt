Hey, can you hear me?
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Hey.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:00:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's okay.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was already, and then my girl came home and she started to have a little bit of a breakdown about trying to find a job and get a job. And I'm like looking at my clock going. need to go, but also they're almost grown up and gone. And yeah, just trying to get it all.
00:00:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll be.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I look like it's but ignore it. You're happy.
00:00:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wait.
00:00:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There it is. Well, it's really there.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really good.
00:00:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Good word.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey.
00:00:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sorry to send you an update list of what's going on. guess. Yeah. I'll send it to you a little bit later.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you're going a crate.
00:00:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. You sit on her lap and you listen and you get to be a better smarter.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would let him, but I need my hands and he will wriggle, but he's actually really happy and it's kind of slow. I let him be there for a little bit, all right. Sorry. I normally come in like minutes ahead of time and have everything open, but little girl, she's the only one I have right now. All right, notes, say month eight, did we get that?
00:01:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I didn't get just said to you guys. apologize. I'll send it to you after the meeting. We're in a smaller hotel, so we tuned two of us, only one of us has a second screen, and it's really, really, really time-consuming to try to do this with one screen. So I will get that to you. I promise I can give you rough overall numbers, but not state-by-state.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, what's the overall?
00:01:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can you have a second?
00:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you need to come here?
00:01:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So 15th are converted plus?
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the 23rd. Yeah, that's low.
00:02:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
December is always low.
00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that low. We did the math.
00:02:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We went and looked at the reports more at 55.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many are out?
00:02:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Three.
00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:02:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If we can get to 80, I'll be happy this month. I looked at each month each December. November is usually fine.
00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
December is usually low. OK.
00:02:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
People put off calling tough for the holidays unfortunately. Yeah, I don't like the fact because we're still spending a lot, obviously. But just kind of is. But I'm not expecting a lot.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, how were your ads doing?
00:02:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They're not. I turned them off. They suck.
00:02:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, come on, man.
00:03:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They me here Why I'm like they were not doing what they're not doing what I think I'm doing what I think they're doing So then we're as you yell at him and get that report all be solved wait what report?
00:03:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The search crew report that he's gonna get next month because he doesn't want to be mean around the holidays while he's on vacation Yeah, the report that shows why Devin can generate kids with Dan can't oh Mark Do they Understand yeah, they're at like six He just doesn't know what how he does it Or last month was just one random down month, and he's just Charlie up from there Right, but the idea is that he didn't correct anything Correct, okay You
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm okay.
00:04:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, he in the bank, this is at seven right now in December.
00:04:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So we have, this is gonna be five off, but one attorney referral, three blue steel, one doctor, which is really low. Three clients returning, five Felipe, 10 monkeys, one news, seven valiant, one website and the rest are Walker. So Walker's the last majority what we're doing. And mostly Washington.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how is the Walker change working for us?
00:04:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We are not We'll try that in January. It will hopefully save us a little bit of money.
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, when we get the report, I'm just, I mean, if the variant was able to get 10 a month, even seven, and so far the cheapest, has been the cheapest, I don't know if that's changed with what's happening.
00:05:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So the cheapest?
00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the cheapest?
00:05:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Outside of client referrals or whatever, yes.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But Dan, we haven't been able to replicate any of that. What do you want to see happen, Dan, and what do you think will happen, and what's your kind of path that you're on to work these?
00:05:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I don't want to spend a hundred grand to figure it out.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And so, it's like I use the publicly available data, and I'm like,
00:06:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
it didn't work like i spent like three grand like this isn't this isn't right so what i'm what's public isn't correct clearly so i'm like all right well and he doesn't know what he's doing so i'm like this dude like lucked his way into this so it's like a happy accident and the question is what's really going on and unfortunately i don't think he can answer the question but daily ask this question because a hundred thousands obviously a lot of money okay it's a lot of money but if you're telling me if i give you a check for a hundred grand you could for sure figure this out which i have questions about but let's just assume it for this conversation it would be worth it if we can start getting cases that a more attractive cost per case over the long run because our you know cost to just acquire cases three or four grand So if you're only spending three thousand, that's the same as one case. I don't know how you're going to be able to really do this for us than 30 grand.
00:07:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's all thing. need a bunch of money to like figure it out. And then there's no guarantee that you figure it out, right? So it's like, we have like all the data from pure 11, which isn't great. I mean, there's something in there. And then there's this guy, but we don't have his data. So it's like, there's worked, his worked. So it's like, OK, there's, there's a way to do this. Clearly nobody knows how to do it, right? Or they'd be, they'd be working, you'd be working with them, right? They'd be selling to a lawyer in every state. So and it all comes down to the keywords, right? So the keywords for a type of keywords aren't car accident lawyer.
00:07:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is not the keyword. We know this, right?
00:07:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That is the one everyone's body.
00:08:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And that one was the people right now are coming through for his valuation questions, whatever monkey's doing. Those are like the two things that people are coming through with. Yeah, what we do plus there's people bidding on other lawyers names, which is okay.
00:08:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Those other guys are doing the brand play where they're big. we've been talking about it for two years, three years now. Yeah.
00:08:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like we haven't made any progress, which is a little frustrating.
00:08:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah.
00:08:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But Dennis are in made progress. These vendors are hitting this other most more miss than it's my wide margin.
00:08:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But it's like here's the whole thing. In my view, you purchased his data. So you should be like, give me the data. You purchased tier 11's data. Those guys, they don't give a . They don't care. Right. They're like, yeah, it's yours. You spent the money. Here it is. Now they I know what to do with it, right? The problem with them was their premise was incorrect. They, and they clearly didn't totally understand how PI works. And what they did for Mike Morris was, in my view, based on what happened, was that they just judged his brand, right? pulled more brand cases because they were brand, brand-based ads, which is like the easiest thing. And then that got the more cases. But at the end of the day, it turned out the numbers that they were telling us, they weren't really getting reports from most. They were using the conversion data in app. I'm like, yeah, that's not a retainer. And you get to, like, with ads, The ads, certainly, guys, same thing. don't read, have a handful, but not most. Most of their guys are not actually reporting back to them. So they're like, Everything's a retainer. No, it's not. Sorry. That's not the way this works, right? So even those eyes They would be the cheapest case literally, but I think they would be the cheapest if They're referred out were actually being tracked, they weren't because we didn't have a referred out tracking system So when I saw that and was like, oh, referred out.
00:10:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I only learned later. Oh, it's not To be referred out Mm-hmm.
00:10:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Wow. I mean, I don't know if Isaac went back. Actually, I don't he did It would be it would be good to go back So it's like cuz that's early around and it's like if we went back and could confirm for sure that the tan or so Which isn't that mean if you send Melissa names I can I was like we can actually say for 10 I can manually pull. Yeah, it's not crazy I mean you're yeah, we just got to find out and then we can do the math on that because then Those guys would be maybe not the cheapest, but they were in the zone. But the problem with them was that they were calling everything a retainer and it everything that got signed. was like, OK, it's signed, but it's not we, you know, they're going to refer it out. And then they were under the belief that their guys didn't refer that any out. And I'm like, well, if they're not doing that, then they fundamentally are doing something wrong, right?
00:11:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They they're the problem is a lot of firms again will sign a lot of cases that we would refer out, speaking, just because they were so tight.
00:11:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, without a doubt.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's exactly what they were doing. Look, people are signing some of the things we were referring out. So clearly people see some value in this. And I'm not right. hundred percent of time of what we refer out, that it's not a low. It's a low value case. So why refer it out quite frankly, right? case I'm wrong, or even if I am right, it's just some money, which is not great for us, given the amount of work that's involved. But I don't want to try to build a let's spend a bunch of money to try to get these cases to. refer out where my average referral fee check outside of the monster cases that we know are monster cases is less than two grand.
00:12:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:12:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It just doesn't make sense.
00:12:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So the name of the game with Google is what are what's actually converting? Nobody knows.
00:12:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So it's like again, we've been doing this for two plus years. And I feel like we haven't made any progress on it.
00:12:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, we haven't really run Google ads because of that problem. Well, we did through tier 11. then I was like, dude, guys, this, no, once I went in and started editing it, I'm like, yeah, no, this is part of me, like, didn't want to tell them what to do. And then part of me was like, well, I'm not going to let you do that. And it worked to a degree.
00:12:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then didn't their last retainer end up being like $11,000. And we thought, it's like in the beginning, it seemed like it might work.
00:12:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And then it got really expensive. That's the problem is that all it takes is like with Valion, one bad month and the numbers go completely upside down because and then the other issue with Google is like I mean this literally just happened to me last week like last week so we now have a new product that we've been selling for like a year but it's the certifies management accounting exam right so CMA exam is what it is for short or whatever so I was running ads and we're getting sales so I kind of wasn't paying attention right it's like over getting sales and just for fun Z's because I went into up to instances of this and this is probably what's happening with Valion but they don't know it so you're wasting money you're needlessly spending money because they probably don't are probably not doing this first example is that the Empire the Empire building the steel building got right so he hits me up and he's like dude are crushing it blah blah blah. like all right cool whatever. I don't really do with that site but I do log in and like check the leaves or whatever. So when he said that he says oh it's going great of course I go look I'm like okay well maybe it can go better and I log in and these ads have been running for years literally years and I go in and I go into the search query report and there's Google helping me. Now all of sudden they're adding I used to block the word garage I blocked the word prefab I block all these sort of core words that I know imagine that like you have a core word like prefab. Nothing prefab occurs here right but if you don't block prefab they're prefab building prefab shop prefab shed prefab this prefab that they prefab everything I'm like dude we're prefab nothing right so you phrase match block So, a long time ago, I blocked Garage, whatever, a couple of other ones, right? Years! Years! Nothing's leaking in. Last time I logged in two months ago, out of nowhere, shop. I'm getting hundreds upon hundreds of clicks with the word shop in it. Like, why is shop suddenly in this account? Well, that's Google helping, because like a building's a shop, right? Guys, building's a shop. We should help this business out by sending the more shop keywords, i.e., should spend your money, because you're managing the account too well that we can't squeeze money out of you. So, all of a sudden, we have shop, hut, two? I selling a lean two? No, I'm not. Thousands upon thousands of dollars, and these useless clicks are never, not one of them converted, and they're never going to convert. I go into my account, CMA. running for a year, I've gone in and already done this negative, this strategic phrase negative matching, right? find like a root keyword. I'm like, all right, I'm going to block it at a phrase level. It'll block anything before or after it. We're good to go out of nowhere. Apparently, there's a medical assistance exam because, you know, certified management accountant and medical assistant, obviously, those are the same. mean, we're Google. We're super smart. We have AI. Let hundreds upon hundreds, thousands of dollars of clicks for medical assistant exam on my ad that says, certified management accounting. That's Google helping. So that's probably what's happened with Valiant. So even if even if we figure it out, then you have to be, you have to figure that out, right? So you have all the data from tier 11, which like I analyzed and it's like, I'd have to do much deeper analysis. And then I'd have that. errors, which is probably pretty deep. mean, they're spending a lot of money, like the average cost per click is pretty high. You think it's that they're looking for settlement stuff. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't. Or maybe they've just tripped into some phrase that they're not targeting, right? Because most of time people build the thing and they're like, oh, I'm targeting this keyword. But when you go down to the next level, Google's helping you. So while you might think it's this word, they're throwing in all these other unrelated words. Well, in this instance, it could be that the word is related. You didn't target it and it's converting. It's what's that word? What's the actual search terms or terms? What are the search terms that are actually converting? It's not the name campaign. It's not the name of the ad group. It's not the name of the keyword unless they went in and did. Super, like I do, super phrase negative matching, and then you can, even then, when you go in the search terms report, it will ultimately show you what's coming in. There's the days of, hey, I have an exact match keyword, and that's the only thing that's going to go in. Those ended years ago, and Google's constantly helping. It's literally Semester. That's where I landed on this. I'm like, when I saw this the other day, I'm like, these come on, but that's how they make money. So nobody knows what to target. That's the problem.
00:18:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Not to take away from your point, because you are partially right. Wasting money is bad.
00:18:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:18:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not whatever. But it's going to be is purposely engineered to waste your money, and you have to fight constantly.
00:18:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. what all we need is like a couple breadcrumbs. I'm thinking they have breadcrumbs. We just need to see the breadcrumbs to not waste money. It's like, okay, and again, this is not my best argument.
00:19:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
ever made If the overall amount is an accessible number, even if they're doing it a wasteful way They're still generating something that I need at a price point that I can stomach Even if it's not the most efficient way compared to what we've done so far with you, which is Super efficient.
00:19:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Here's the thing. We're right. Here's the thing What I'm saying is that if you knew that it could be even better Because if we're not targeting that keyword and they're getting it Through, you know, this tributary ancillary whatever we want to call it. It's like, oh, what if what if the campaigns were built around that? It would do better But they're not so they're they're get if they're getting them by accident. What happens if they were doing it on purpose?
00:20:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
it should understand you're getting more and maybe cheaper they can give you the report or you're firing Mary it's not simple I think it's just a simple way let she have the kid right fresh as she has both kids yeah simple threat no big right so that is an option we're gonna cut them off right now they would be very silly to cut them off concerns that she won the cheapest ones right yeah that would that would be a very very bad idea but it's an idea it is an idea this is true or we really Dan into wasting money you know you can't fully Dan okay we question we questioned Dan until he's able to do this
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and Dan, with the perspective, first of all, it's not your money to waste, but second of all, it's an expensive investment in an education that will reveal something. Even if it's definitively, we're playing roulette and there is no other game. So now we know we are always going to play roulette. But we always know the house will win, all that we can actually do is mitigate our losses as much as possible so that the house doesn't us, because I can't use that word.
00:21:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. The strategically would be, you know, you don't do it in California, you don't do it in multiple states. mean, maybe you don't even, maybe you only do it in like a major metro, right? Because the benefit of the whole thing is that we all speak the same language across all these states, right?
00:21:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So it's not that someone in Massachusetts is, if it works in one area, it's going to work
00:22:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they're like, they're not searching something different, but they are searching something different than what we think it is, right? So it's like, it's figuring out what it is, and then make sure like the track, like, I don't even think the guy, they're tracking isn't even set up right, because they probably are getting conversion, right? It's like, what's a real conversion, a real conversion is a retainer, which we have. But they are probably not tracking their keywords back to a retainer, so you could say, it's that one, or it will lead, like, I even know.
00:22:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think they are, with their air table and everything else that you got.
00:22:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What's in the air table?
00:22:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All their leads.
00:22:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh.
00:22:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
didn't, like, daily with, like, a breakdown if it came from, like, injured, non-wrapped, and something else everywhere, third criteria is.
00:23:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
got you.
00:23:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But I think we should pick a state. I don't have a problem.
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You do it in Arizona.
00:23:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know if Arizona right now because there's a lot of California money going to Arizona at the moment. Because they're not going after these keywords. Okay. So then if you are short or certain on this, Dan, I'm telling you, go and spend $30,000 to figure this out. would rather drop 30, 40, 50 grand for you to figure this out. We have someone for the next five years that's going to save us money.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So here's the year forever that it would, you know, for an investment of 30 to 50 grand for forever is totally worth it to me.
00:23:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm going to go drop $50,000 on running the TV infomercial system.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If they work, like, and I feel more confident in Dan than the infomercials sort of. OK, but let me ask Dan this question, though. How much time does that take you? And where's your interest level in doing that?
00:24:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I really just have to, we have all the data. I just have to go back to it and be like, all right. I mean, I can look at their stuff again, but then just be super, like, super judicial. Be like, all right. And we try to keep it super duper tight and then smart. just try to. I know what it's not. I just don't know what it is. So it's like, I know I don't need to go run car accident lawyer. There's no point in doing that. So I'd have to go back to the tier 11 data and then if these as give us anything that I would look at that when they give us that.
00:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is this a puzzle you want to solve?
00:25:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, God. Yeah.
00:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:25:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, I'm you, this is the ultimate one. No one, no one knows how to do this.
00:25:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nobody can figure this out. This is what we need to pretty much when we're doing anything that we get it.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But here, here's what I want to make sure happens is that there is a clear set of parameters because you both have different modalities and different mos, basically, Dan is way more conservative than you are. And there has to be a place where, like, imagine this is the Venn diagram of the spending parameters and the pushing the batteries operation. There's a big area of dance circle. that and that is nowhere near that middle section that overlaps and that I think is probably one of the bigger issues than combined with actually getting the data from Valiant. So I don't think that we've made it, we've done the work in the conversation part of it to make sure that we are super clear on what you actively, aggressively want to spend and are willing to lose in order to what we can know and what the pace of it is. So there's a big difference between spending $30,000 $50,000 in the course of a month or two versus the course of a year and that case will signify to Dan, okay, well, if it was my money, so I'm Dan, right? If it was my money, I wouldn't spend $5,000 in one month or $5,000 in one week or whatever, but so if we get really clear with, I want to spend an X amount of dollars and X amount of time to push it as much as we can and find out what we can find out. Like I think that that's the conversation that we need to and those are the parameters that we really need to solidify to know what is the volume level of aggression that you want to have happen that hasn't happened for reasons that make sense to Dan and all of us right so that we are operating in the way that you're happy with Mark and that down is like okay I'll push it that level I wouldn't if it was my money but I will for you you know what I mean because I think that that's what it has been.
00:27:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well it's not even yeah but it's not even like a money thing what you what you would do is take the valium data for a year which I don't which is around take total spend per month total lead like confirm what's a lead like I don't know like that all their leads or leads right or you know but they should be in Lidify, right? it's like, go look or in and lead flowing. So it would be, Hey, it's 30 grand a month, 300 leads, go look at that and go, okay, yeah, that's correct. Or it's not like, maybe there's leads that aren't leads. I've never actually looked at their leads. And then you'd say, okay, their cost per lead is X. So that's your first thing. It's like, if I'm not getting leads at X, something's wrong. Like, it's not going to turn out well without a doubt. That was the problem with tier 11. I was like, you guys are not going to work because you're not getting a lead at X. Their lead, if your lead cost is above this. And I know all I know from all these vendors that I've hired before, and we can also look at the value conversion rate and then sort of blend that with, but we just keep seeing 5% across the board. It's 5% although valiant, I think is higher. So it's like they're doing things better on two ways. is, so it's like, okay, what is the target cost per lead? And if you're not getting a lead for them, you already know that the keywords are wrong. And then you'd be like, okay, different approach, different cut, different set of keywords, or whatever, whatever, I mean, that would be it, everything's driven by keywords. But we have to come at a target cost per lead, then we have a target cost per retainer, they could both be based on their numbers, or it could be based on, you know, the blend of all paid media. You've the blender going in the background now, so.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can't hear it at all.
00:29:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, good.
00:29:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, really.
00:29:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Wow, that's hilarious. You really don't hear that.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. but what happens?
00:29:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, you down a little bit. Yeah.
00:29:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So I know right now, like, today's.
00:29:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, now I to do that.
00:30:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but like right now today. know it's not run as today because Christmas shopping craziness, whatever right I Would like Dan to spend at least 30,000 and up to 50 grand by the end of March That's probably reasonable.
00:30:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
was also good. was gonna say like yeah, it's super easy to spend money, but that's not the goal Right it's sort of almost is though in this case It helps you figure this out again. I don't It's been 30 grand in a week.
00:30:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That would not be oh Sure, think that's easy You could spend 30 grand today if you really want to just buy cars and keyword on everything. That's just gonna wish you I get it But I know you're better at this stuff than this guys Let's see the result also. I know you were following up with Gert on Bing. Did anything ever happen with that?
00:30:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They have a shut down for the year over there in Europe apparently
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yes. Yes.
00:31:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Christmas markets. Yeah, dude. What? Yeah.
00:31:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a thing here, by the way. It's kind of awesome, but it was freezing cold, but it was really fun.
00:31:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So the last snow globe. Oh, nice. I've not heard from Gert other than I showed him all the stuff we did with the news. And then he's like, okay, we need to plan for cleaning up the content. said, yeah. So that's where we left off.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think we have a very, very short window to try to get head upping before other people do. It's to take advantage of Chad CPT search engine.
00:31:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:31:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And I really want to maximize whatever small advantage we have. And I'm assuming open AI is going to win the AI competition, which is an assumption that may prove not to be true. There's like Google, Willow, everything else is kind of incredible. But open AI seems to be the one that's leaving. So if we've got, let's say, a six month to eight month head start or other offer. People are going to figure this out in the not very distant future. I don't know why I didn't click from my brain, but there's other people who are clicked much more simply. OpenAI, Microsoft uses Bing, OpenAI, but together. don't know why I didn't see it. Anyway, if we know this, I really want to try to build whatever we can around Bing from an SEO perspective, from our website, which is different than Google. Yeah, a little bit.
00:32:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I really need that to be our focus for Q1. Is that the context of how it works? If you rank how you'll show up in an AI result?
00:32:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Okay. So it's a little different than Google SEO. You can't PPC purchase. You want to respond to it yet? So that will at some point. But the AI system trying to find the best answer, which is usually the top result, the top organic result.
00:32:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:33:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So like yesterday, I was using, was like, hey, I was in a car crash in Los Angeles, helped me find the best attorney that I can find. They recommended me because I'm relatively sure it sees that I have a sweet love email as one of the law firms because it, I'm sure, saw the sweet love email. And then it had plenty of other ones because this was mildly interesting. And then we should hear about the Raman Museum. It had Barnes firm, Woolish, your law firm, law firm, Larry's Parker. Then said check directors like Avo, Justia, and Martindale, Hubble. And then it gives you like a, it just gives you a little thinking, thinking like a, but not like a full-blown URL. Yeah.
00:33:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, interesting that they're doing this.
00:34:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because they don't update their information, maybe once here, they uplift the information. I say they and talk about open AI.
00:34:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:34:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So if I say, like, what's the best one for me? And what's their number? Now, it's to make a firm, Rose, Klein, so make a law group, which is not a big law group, and they suck, and Barnes firm, which is a larger firm. But there's their sources. So I am relatively sure there's a way that we can juice the system by putting some money in some time behind it, because people don't spend a lot in this stuff. Like, they spend it on Google, not on Bing.
00:34:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:34:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So if we can put some resources behind it, I mean, even in the worst case, it will still pay out long term. is there are people who search Bing and quite frankly, remember we tried some Bing PPC and like it worked for a little bit, didn't work and I lost focus because I tend to lose focus a lot.
00:35:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to say your Valley employees, if they should run it on Bing, it will just be cheaper.
00:35:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not only that, but we really should be paying way more attention to being with all the things that Microsoft is doing right now. Like Microsoft's kind of been, I don't know, but they've been trying to pull forward in some things, but I think that there's been huge money and I'm just going to say, I wonder how much of the divorce between Melinda and Gil Bill, like almost like maybe she throttled some things. I don't know, did. That's just totally like left field for me.
00:35:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
anyway, they've shifted their focus away from being a Microsoft computer company to being an AI company. They've moved their entire future.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or it's just like global dominance in the same vein as like Amazon, like wherever we can grow. me let's grow it. But my point is that the competition level has pulled forward in a way like it hasn't in a long time. And so at the very least, using it as well as we use Google would be in our best interest, especially to do it before your competition is doing it. Because you know, like if people let's say people are using chat GT more and I'll give you an example there's an 80 year old woman in my church ward and that is using chat GPT. So what we think the market base for AI users is probably wrong. There's a lot of people in technology that were older that are staying on top of it. And anyway, so the market base is probably a little bit bigger than we think who will be using it. And those are also some of the people that will be telling their kids and grandkids, hey, go use this company. They went and good. did research for you. But I don't think the majority of your competitors, the higher end, probably, you know, that are more tech savvy will be. But anyway, I just think it behoves us to to definitely at least not ignore being and put it as high priority as as Google moving forward.
00:37:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's they don't have anyone near the volume, but but, you know, right now.
00:37:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right now. And again, if we can get an advantage and start all just small things, volume versus like what it will give us access to. So, you know, we know that there has been a time where certain companies in the earlier stages of development or evolution reward users for spending money with them. So, maybe the volume is lower, but maybe the targeting is better.
00:37:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And so the cost for acquisition is lower in the x. so we can get to see people to be a lot better.
00:38:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So in the end, it ends up being highly worth the effort because Google is still trying to throttle us and, you know, bend us over our barrel while being is like, let me give you, you know, the keys to the kingdom.
00:38:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
My kingdom is small, but it's glorious now. And there's also still Facebook, of course.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is not meta.
00:38:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's not going anywhere, especially Spanish market for meta.
00:38:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I've got that in the same, you know, boat as Google at the moment.
00:38:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So that's true. is pretty playful, but so they keep sharing from them somehow.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, no, and the whole point has been diversification, right? Business 101 diversification. I'm just saying, I think that there's potentially an incentive program that we might be able to attach to and being that, you know, isn't maybe publicly offered or anything, but it's just, we can give you more, and we'll give you more targeted leads than our competitors, at least for a moment until they get into a level where they're, you know, with them and they get more advertisers. I would bet a ton of money that that's an option. So, just saying. Okay, so do we have anything else to talk about on the leads from any, any other, Dan? So, what would your strategy be? it be, oh, so we've got roughly three months for $30,000, roughly $10,000 a month, and he wants you to spend $30,000 $50,000 by the end of March, and that seems to me like, I'm like, I can think of a couple times you've,
00:40:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that money that aggressively and also you it did exactly what you thought it would which was not really pan out very well um do you see yourself being able to do that I mean I've never done it for PI right so it's like it's always been like uh like Salco's wanted to do it forever I'm like dude you're gonna spend a shitload of money and and like a shitload and there's no guarantee really but and that was cold here at least you have like with Salco it was like I don't know anything I don't know what a retainers were I don't know what a retainers what tart what the lead cost is so here you have target data at least um and it'll just I just have to dive into the data and pick pick my approach I mean again I know what not to do so there's enough data that I mean I can revisit it and, you know, go, okay, yeah, yeah, don't do this, right, which is like car accident lawyer, car accident attorney, like all that crap. And there's other ones. And then I'm literally looking at valiance leads right now. I'll go look at their leads. I've never actually just looked at their leads. I'm sure there's something to learn by just looking at their leads and their lead volume. But just put together sort of the funnel calculator, if you will. Okay, this is this is what you want say. I wouldn't. The cost per click doesn't really matter. It's really about the lead, the clip. can't effectuate a cost per click. It just is what it is.
00:41:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
My cost for a click can be such a red hairy.
00:41:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. then I'll just see if there's other ways I can look at what I'm from the outside and sort of figure out what's going on. And then look at what I did look more into what I already did because I didn't really go that deep into it, I was like, oh, this isn't going to stop this. Yeah, so I just need to do like a deep dive. But other lead stuff, so we built this referred out thing for HQ. Now we have to get them to use it, I think. basically that, I don't know how to get that across to them. Like, hey, you have a case that you think can be referred out. Go fill out this form and then your guys are going to take it over. Basically, that's the way it would work.
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, is that something that we could hash out? Because that logic, I thought that's something that my brain kind of lends itself towards. Well, can I help?
00:42:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's already done. Oh, it didn't.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not how it sounded.
00:42:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry. Oh, yeah, no. done. We just need to get it across to Robert, because like, Robert doesn't respond to Eric and I, so it's like, Mark's got to do it. So we build it.
00:43:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you aware of that?
00:43:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, well, I'm re-awearing him right now.
00:43:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll mention some more. This is just the hard time of year to get hold of anyone.
00:43:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, fine. So it's like, it'll be great if like he starts using it like the beginning of the year, but it's like, send them a link. It's like, just use this form. And I think all he has to do is just make sure he uses the same email address that he has. And then that will come into the system and then fire, it'll fire this thing and then bring it in to litify so that your people know, hey, call on this as a referral. And then, you know, once they start using it, we can say, oh, tweet this, tweet that, whatever it is. But we need him to know it's there and then to start using it. then you have to, I don't know, because he's like, we don't do that. I'm like, okay, but it's my understanding that you could. So, that's why we built this. then for TouchBot, TouchBot 1.0, we put it at 1 you have to think about, in my view, it's like we have a calendar for you in LeadFlow-E. And well, it's two-fold. You have to decide how often you want to touch them. And then it would be like, you would create these events, whatever. That's the first step. How often do you want to touch them? And then what, if these are just outreach things like, hey, what's up, up, whatever. Or around holidays, right? are some, obviously, you could do, like you said, you could do a New Year's One, a New Year's One, right? goes to everyone. And then there could just be, you hit them up every three weeks, like, I don't know. I don't know what you're envisioning here, obviously. Only times day, you want to make sure you just touch all of them. So you decide what schedule it is, and then you decide what the thing is. Hey, it's a holiday. It's just an outreach. And then we build all these touch things into this calendar, and then we load them up into, we just load all the doctors into one single automation, and it runs for a year. Now, the way it works is, if they respond, and we can change this, but if they respond, the AI will take over, so it would start talking to them. We can make it not do that, but if they respond, and then you respond from your phone, it will break it, and then the AI quits.
00:45:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so we talked about this last week, so we need to make a decision about what to do in that situation.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, he marked in here a this only you heard this.
00:46:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, it's new to me.
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you heard about it on our call Yeah, but you're right.
00:46:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So when it breaks.
00:46:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't mind it going to my Cell phone because I can just respond from there it will But that's fine. Then I just mainly respond the AI is sitting there and if they were like hey Thanks, Mark, and it would be like no problem We can put a delay on the AI so that you could jump in and then that break it up could actually work Okay Isn't involved at all, but the AI is definitely involved to Variate the initial message. So we're gonna.
00:46:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, that's it. Let's start with not having it respond And let me see how many responses I get and then we can go from there All right, so you need to map out your touchpoint and then let give us the sample message and then it feeds the sample message
00:48:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
and it's happening like I mean if they go to his phone once they're going to go to his phone every time we'd have to make sure his phone's hooked up so we he's a contact and then we assign all the everyone that gets entered in that automation gets assigned to mark is like the owner so then his phone numbers as long as it's his cell phone in his contact record then the outbound it will look like it came from mark's phone no I get all of that what I'm saying is how do we make sure it's working so what I'm saying is I think that each day we should either get a report from lead flowy that goes to mark that says these are all the messages you should have received the mark checks his phone make sure yep yep we're we're on point and and just make sure that it's working because otherwise you have somebody who's you know we think is getting responded to but isn't or we think that we've seen but we haven't because technology sometimes breaks that's awesome yeah yeah I don't know. I mean, I'm sure there's a way, but I'm like, okay, so I don't know that it can do exactly that. But I mean, we couldn't notify Mark when it's sending out messages, right? So before any messages go out, a text mark and says, hey, your Valentine's Day touch is going out. Maybe. Something like that. And then it doesn't have like a report of, hey, automation received or sent five messages like that doesn't exist. So you could alert him that messages are going out, so he'd know. And then we just expect some responses. And if you get none, then maybe something's up. And that's all I can think of off the top.
00:50:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, we can add one or two phone numbers of, like, people, I guess, or even my own cell phone, just make their ghost there.
00:50:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you, uh, no, you can't message.
00:50:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, let's say we add both Tina and Dan to it.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I mean? Like, just a couple of phone numbers.
00:50:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just, there's been no use case for this. So off the top of my hand, I'm sure there's a way, but I don't think about it. But there could maybe be like a separate automation that like only to, so like, these are actually separate automation. So I'm like, um, maybe there could be like a third one that's does some sort of reporting or witchcraft. Oh, that's all always an option.
00:50:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is my go to one day.
00:50:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I can think is used to me. I need to drive around, but I don't have a car. or something. Evelyn. You're going to have to wait until she goes back to school for me to get the really good ideas.
00:51:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. It's time to go get your golf cart, Dan.
00:51:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You would think so. I never.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's been time. It's only been like.
00:51:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's been trying your golf cart forever.
00:51:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. He did. This is the same person who won't spend your money, won't spend his money.
00:51:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we surprised buy a new guitar?
00:51:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no. I appreciate these facts. It's not that I don't appreciate it because it's what I would want. I don't want some neolously wasting money because they can't. It's just something we've been talking about for a long time and I know a large component of this is literally just money to try things until we find out what it works and just an unfortunate reality of what this is. I know Dan's been trying to crack this problem for years now. Like this is the ultimate Rubik's Cube of PPC.
00:52:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep, it really is.
00:52:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think anyone's ever done that they haven't.
00:52:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the biggest thing is that is is we have to there that huge difference. Anyway, I'm beating a horse, It's hot spot. Beat the horse, oh my god. Anyway, it's just- Do you want to hear random good news instead? Yeah.
00:52:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All their settled one of our cases for $11 million, which was a super weird case.
00:52:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
He's gonna keep hitting numbers like this. gonna be around for a while.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:52:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Do the passenger and drunk driver's car who has a FedEx vehicle? the way, you don't know any of this confidential. don't know I can give it any more information. Um, what we don't know anything. Exactly. Uh, we got two million on the case. I had to fly to you before, which is the case use of why I need access to a jet. So that's great.
00:53:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, I got 1.3 on a homeless dude in the middle of the road who got right over by a car.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
This is all in like the last two weeks.
00:53:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, yes.
00:53:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Wow.
00:53:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, no, no, Yeah, last week, I'm still not done. Um, Pan's just got 2.5 on a weird death case in Arizona that we had. And then I'm missing one.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the UPS kid that, um, the kid that ran into a UPS truck?
00:53:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, was Arizona that we flew up before I went to, um, Arizona. It's a USPS, so it's federal, but Pan's still wants to kind of take a look at it. So I think someone will take it because it just doesn't make sense. It's going to run into the back of a large truck. But we're waiting for medical records. Okay. Of course, it's the motorcyclist at fault. I mean, but we're waiting for the matter. versus see if he's on any drugs or anything. he's not any drugs, he's like runs his own taco stand. Like, he seems like a fairly responsible guy. Like, I only met him briefly, obviously, but like it doesn't line up very well unless he's on drugs.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish he has propping on the UPS practice.
00:54:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He like, if he's USPS says federal, so he wouldn't get that until we go into court. But the problem is he then comes to a month past. So he can't even like it's gone. Whatever was there is gone because was in a coma for three weeks. So like it's not just fall, but yeah. So we'll see. There's another large one I don't remember what's on my head.
00:54:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, well, I mean, first and foremost, I just wanted to know all the sources of all those because that.
00:54:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Felipe was the one who just flew out that might be garbage. The other ones were news news with the death ones. We're the 2 million that you just did with Socko. So the 1.3 and 2 million we did in-house, which is cool. So 2 million is the most we've gotten pre-litigation.
00:55:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Those are both in-house.
00:55:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, really? And both were monkey.
00:55:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Wow.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
OK, good at random death stuff. That's like my secret sauce. If you go.
00:55:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not morbid in my car, but at all.
00:55:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, but I mean, just be good at what you're good at.

Yeah, I know.

00:55:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)

00:55:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mark. So every now and then, monkey comes with something huge.
00:55:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's the thing. That's the whole curve buster that makes the entire model work.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how you get a marshmallow in your garage. Can we get a P&L for 2024 by the end of January?
00:55:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sorry. Sorry.
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
uh oh fully yeah all these cases that i talked about they're not going to pay till q one next year just because we settled them and it's going to take time to get money and instructions and whatnot i just want to see what what everything else is we need money you what we made money so that's good it's good what what the last time you told me what three grand a month so three sixty okay good it's like you don't hear any of this no it's great because it's loud as here like these people do not care from on the phone do not care i mean don't hear anything that's great no it's great it's uh like i can't hear you guys i'm wow this is apple apple's getting it done
00:57:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, okay.
00:57:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, crap. It's one o'clock and I gotta get ready for a food you call.
00:57:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, so how did him? Let's get him on touchpot as well so we can have as many touchings as we can.
00:57:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does he need to touch people?
00:57:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He does.
00:57:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm going to hang up when you call. Because the issue is he has multiple fingers because it infirms their community more than one person like for example in our office, which food you do, which is nice, although it's another issue. He reached out to the systemic teams and bodage team lunch, which is really nice of him. Some animosity in the office because like reception doesn't get lunch. anyway, it comes from a good place, but I'm more than sure it's the same thing where he's reaching out to certain case managers and different firms that help get more business to him, which is absolutely smart, absolutely works. I don't know, did you take our, we give doctors lunch idea and run with it and repackage it to him?
00:57:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably it was definitely
00:58:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
uh group com because I sold that from someone else so I'm not even yeah it works you're not even in the same business and competing for the same thing so like chona um yes well okay but that was we did this before chona came along this is fair and i want to see fuji win because i love him and i wouldn't have thought that you guys were in competition with each other we're not okay um but i'm glad it's working but again sorry mark and after my life so you have a puppy so even emotional support animal go on your lap or in your crate but again these things work so like he may want to do that because again it's just being top of mind like all these things come to talk in mind because as much as i'm add squirrel i feel like most people in this business are as bad if not worse in terms of attention spent especially if they're smaller shops because they're just like dragged in thousands directions at once this is so easy to overlook so it's like yeah yeah but if you You know, depends on how often they want to do it, whether it's once a week, once a month, every quarter. For me, I think it's probably once every like 45 days. I think more than that, it's a little bit too much.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then so... but that's why the next thing follow up being a cut spot, that was the entire point of it, is that if you're two days top of mind, then you have to have some touches going out to make sure that they don't get you, but they don't need to be, you know, here's a gift all the time, just like, communication, and yeah.
00:59:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And I'm always doing some relatively cool stuff along with the business stuff. So it's not hard to come up with that's actually interesting, like the Japan stuff is interesting, the bear that doesn't look like food, but his food is interesting.
00:59:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Dude, I had to look at that.
00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, I just, I had a thought and then I didn't need to go, but what if, like, because I know you have, you know, different parties and things like that, but one of the ways, so Maya Angelos said people will not remember what you said. They'll remember how you make them do, right? So what are the things that would be memorable to your doctors? Is there experiences that they want to have, but can it be related to their profession? Could it be a way that you can show them how AI can help them in their business, how they can save time, how they can make more money that has nothing to do with sweet lot really other than the fact that they're going to remember that you're the one that helps them and for their profit margins and they didn't have to pay for the training or whatever, you just said, hey, I want to get this to you and maybe have put together a presentation that's related to them that, you know what I mean? What can we do for them to serve them and help them make more money that really has nothing to do with you other than the fact that the law of reciprocity suggests that they're going to feel like they owe you, so they're going to keep sending you business. I think on that, it's a difficult question, but I, yes, some will get it more than others, but there's a good, good answer there. But if you, but if you invite everybody on their teams, somebody is likely to, you know, be like a doggy with a chew toy at that and be like, oh, yes, I'll, I'll head that up. And, you know, like, we'd have to figure out what it would cost. And the thing is, it could be very, very simple. But if, you know, old dogs and new tricks, if they're not going out, especially in this profession, it's an old profession, most of them are not going to be, you know, super into it. If you can find the simplest way to teach them a very simple tool that you can show them and remove all the friction points, right? So basically, and it could be something that we built or that, like, Dan built and Dan owns and sends a check to Mark or something like that so that you're, technically even owning it, I don't know. But that wasn't the point. The point was how do we teach them something so simple that they can use, but it will save them time, it will save them money, and it will illuminate opportunities that they had never thought before. So now you're the guy that makes new things, and they're going to want to send you more business because they're going to be grateful that you showed them how to compete better in their market.

Anyway, that's the best thing would be if we can get their patients and stuff out to their patients to remind them they're here or temperature and keep on whatever else, but that's taking on a larger, larger load. But if we can get them to do it, um, frankly, that way you have them forever, like they're never leaving you. That's the most important issue we can get into, yes.
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could take a whole year doing that, and then when we build something very similar or come up with a very simple way to teach it, or even, you know, find a profit partner that you can align with, and you can say,
