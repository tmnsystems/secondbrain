00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's weird, it looks totally different.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What looks different?
00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The zoom screen, like it never said. Host is joined or trying to address. That's rude.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Your audio is so garbled. What? I can't even try to figure that out. Dan? Is that Dan in the house? lose you completely? The hook. Are you Mark, you're in retrograding? Does it show you muted? It doesn't show that you left, but I can hear nothing. It also doesn't show that there's audio happening at all. Thank you.
00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
You You It's like it doesn't know whether to use outside. So it doesn't know whether to use the data or the laptop. Oh, so I got ready the data. See, I always do the opposite actually. I tried. at first and it would connect. But it's like, that's weird because I've got like nine bars or whatever. Fully loaded. Nothing.
00:03:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it goes. And who I am just counting down the minutes until I can take a nap. I am so exhausted. I am fully supportive of seminary because my girl is happy and it's doing good for her. But it is killing me. Those psycho 5 a.m.
00:03:31 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
people.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something wrong with them. It's also like, I will do everything to get into the flow of a proper schedule. will make myself stay awake for practically two days and wear myself out and have exercise and get all the sunshine. Do all the things for good sleep hygiene to get to bed early. But what happens with that fail is I will be exhausted that entire time. come eight, nine o'clock, maybe even 10 o'clock. My body's like, the moon is up, let's go. It's just, I don't know if it's a moon energy or just, but it has to be something circadian.
00:04:11 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Regardless. Yeah, let's go through.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but it is. And at night, since my whole life, my brain and my body is like, I got my second third, something just to win, like adrenaline kicked in. And it's not just a busy mind. Like it's everything. And I can, I can do my best to manage it, but I cannot make it good.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, not a little win. Anyway, it's weird.
00:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Body's bodies are like complex.
00:04:47 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I know.
00:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's this whole like spirit inside of it. And like, how much does that?
00:04:53 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
have no idea. Nobody knows.
00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, nobody knows. Anyway, before I ask you all the business stuff, how is your darling wife doing right now?
00:05:07 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I think she's falling down. We didn't get the whole month. I mean, Mars able on birthday, so that's going to be a wound, which is so great that her birthday falls so soon after she moved out. But, you know, like, they're texting all the time. needs some hilarious. I sent her some shoes.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She wants you, she needs shoes.
00:05:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
She likes them. And then she's always like, check and look by my iPhone. Where's my baby? Okay, she's at them all. She's downtown. How is she getting to these places? Is she alone? like, why are you asking me?
00:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't relate, so.
00:05:56 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah. She does it with both of us, Mariel's got the day off. from school. She was just doing that. Where's burial? It's out there, Travis.
00:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have Verizon and they have a smart family.
00:06:09 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
So I have find my stuff, know, that, because we all have iPhones.
00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Verizon's smart family also has trackers and alerts. like, I know all their haunts, basically. And so I have alerts for like a school and home, especially in their dads and particular stores that I know that they go to a lot. I get these notifications every time they go, or they leave and I'm just like, okay, I know where you're at, you're good. it's not a, it's not a talking, no, but it's not even a trusting. It's just, uh, your head case. Not there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:06:50 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
what's funny was it didn't exist at all. That was what I pointed out Yes. Do you have the benefit of that? mean, don't know if it is a benefit, I don't know it is. Um, I don't use it. I never said they're going, where's Evelyn?
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. It makes us new product.
00:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah. I do. I do it like when she's out late, when she's supposed to be home. like, girl, she's she's around.
00:07:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I think I've done it at all.
00:07:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
What did you say? I don't think I've done it at all.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would I would do it once in a while. I do it once in a while.
00:07:27 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
just to see she's on campus.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's hard though. Like, hold this person inside your body.
00:07:35 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
don't.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We do.
00:07:39 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Well, I got that.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's totally different. All right. So what was this call I got ditched for yesterday?
00:07:49 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, it was David Kannick. I totally do not remember if it had a new schedule. And then I'll put my coffee alert and I was like, oh, oh, he's fine. Yeah, maybe I agreed to it. I don't remember.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It did seem familiar when I saw it, I like hell's crap.
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Uh, because he's like, obviously that poor that's it. The business is imploding. You're getting garbled again and I want to hear this. some of the time.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:08:20 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Somebody's calling you. Somebody's calling you. Somebody's calling you.
00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's you. How is my audio?
00:08:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Does it sound any different at all? It's louder. Sorry. No, no. I mean, I turned it down on here, but it'd be just in general.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's louder. been playing around with audio and microphones and stuff because I'm a nerd and I like tech and light audio.
00:08:53 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Are you like on a microphone?
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It's a road podcast, a USB mic.
00:08:59 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would not have guess like yes, see that's the thing that I think a lot because actually here's what's the real thing is that Apple's speakers and cameras built into the iMacs and the Mac pros are really awesome.
00:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, okay. So David's businesses imploding. Wait, which one?
00:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, yeah. The resume. Like he hired somebody else and now they're like restructured. He had the amount of pocket and pay severance for like a time off that the person had a crew because whoever their boss is. I don't really understand the structure. the boss is didn't actually track the days off that they took. So this person was like, I have all this pay time off that I never used, but they did use it. There's just no record of the music. So he had to come out of pocket like 8,500 bucks after they let her stay from mom. Let her know that she was getting laid off. Let her stay for a month. She promptly stopped doing her job and or doing it well. And then after the fact, was like, oh, p.s. made a bummer of Fox eight time loss. So he had to write a personal check for that. But I guess.
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is she related to Jamie?
00:10:26 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, right. I guess that like in the industry, we'll call it, right? The whole entire industry is taking a dive in the last 60 days and they believe it's directly related to the election. Because the anxiety, the fear anxiety, industry. that's spiking. And he said, yeah, I've heard from, I talk to people and they're saying they're down 30%. And that's the number he's seeing. So, yeah, it's not a good business, it never was.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so weird to though, like here's the insight into that, the way that the election impacts certain aspects of the economy, it really shouldn't, because like go about your business and live your life, you disrupting everything by you just sitting there and waiting for this thing that has such a delayed effect, first of all, just, it makes no sense. But that is the, that's the power of it too, and that mental, like how much fear and how much power we've attached, not I, not you, collectively, those community people, to all these things.
00:11:50 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Well, here's the thing that I, I didn't say this to him, but I'm like, um, me cynical, you know, whatever do that.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, I thought that was your first name.
00:12:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, uh, most people are not that plugged into the election. So I can like, I don't think, I don't see how that's true, like maybe, maybe that, that index.
00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, who is that index based on? Is it his ads not working as well?
00:12:20 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Because that it does change a lot whole, the whole thing, like it's just down across the board, but with leads.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So it starts with leads, right? But, but that's what I'm saying. It could actually be more that they're not aware that the basically so much of the media spots get taken up by.
00:12:38 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, well, there's that too.
00:12:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's a good point.
00:12:42 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
That it's not actually that the market has changed.
00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just his access to the market has changed.
00:12:48 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, I don't, I don't think he's actually seen, I don't know about, I mean, that would show up impressions. I don't know if he dove into that, but I mean, the reality is that like they're selling way less and there's way less. it's way less revenue. And he's just, he's like, Mark, he's, it's, it's overhead, intensive, and it's labor intensive. I would argue in a way that it doesn't need to be.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:13 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It was funny. was talking to Lisa, and I was like, she's like, have you talked to David later? know you're still talking over two weeks. he, like, she's like, how's his business doing? Like, not great. I was like, you know, he's, he's a pretty smart guy. But I'm like, you know, he just doesn't see like what's going on there. And Lisa goes, is he that smart?
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, when you do the math thing. Yeah.
00:13:40 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
And I go, well, I mean, he is, because yeah, but she's like, he doesn't have any foresight. She's like, he talks about it. But he doesn't really have it. Because he does, or he doesn't really look forward.
00:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He has theoretical intelligence, but not practical intelligence.
00:13:59 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Right, child's like, Okay, boy, because he should have seen firing the number one salesperson having a detrimental effect. Like I literally was like, how did you not think this through?
00:14:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and this other thing happened. Internal sales team, instead of I don't know, hungry people who are earning it on commissions that he doesn't have to pay all that stuff for.
00:14:22 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I was a person. There's no benefit in having an internal team.
00:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but that's an ego thing. And David definitely has a big ego. It is not obvious, generally, but because he really does a lot to try to pretend it's not there. But if you look at what he does versus what he says, he's very much protecting ego in a whole lot of things and trying to inflate ego with a lot of what he does.
00:14:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
And I think that he thinks or thought he might be past this. I think he thought that it's the it's the real company curse real company out of staff, right? So if he's going to get acquired and I'm like, dude, they don't acquire, they don't want to acquire bodies. They want to acquire cash flow, right? So like, if your big goal is to sell it, create a cash flow business period, recurring revenue cash flow business, the less bodies the better, the less moving parts the better for the acquirer, right? They just want to get all the systems in place. And to your point, if they're outside centers and outside closures, that can just be replaced on a dime by that, that, you know, and any even better. But yeah, he could do that. He won't. And it is ego because he wants to make everybody go out. He wants to be able to talk to him like, what benefit is there in that? If you focus on the goal, get the close, then you better watch it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think he's one of those people that company size and I have these many employees and we're this big. They're a really big thing for him and it's you surround his neck.
00:16:19 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yep, I don't get it. I told him on the call, said, dude, I have 14 employees, health insurance, payroll, and I did that. And my takeaway was I will never do this again because he was asking me about like mom and red 13. I go, there will be no employees. Like, no employees. He's like, you can't do that. I said, watch me. Watch. I go, the only people that will be employees are guys eventually and maybe me, maybe not even me. But I'm like, we're going to be stakeholders. And I got the only way that they become employees is if it makes so much money. that it makes sense to get health insurance for them and me. Get health insurance, get 401k plans, because it's just kicking off so much cash, I don't want to give it to the government. But I'm like, other than that, no. They said, about Eric? Eric your employee? said, no, he's not. He said, well, you're going to watch out for the government. I go, I already did it. He's like, what do you mean? I go, I told Eric, you've given his wife I a business and I said, you need to make sure that you make money through that business or you can't work with me anymore. I will not, I will not get tapped up the shoulder by the California government. I'd be like, this guy's an employee. I go, they have their own business. It makes revenue off multiple clients. Eric got you just took on a freelance client this week. I'm like, there's no threat of that happening. And he's like, oh, okay, wow. I know exactly what I'm doing, not that. So anyway, yeah, he's probably going to be out of business by the end of the year, to be honest.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I know what I going say is that that right there is the reason that in the course that I am still working on, is that the first thing is principles and priorities and establishing values, and the reason is, is because if you have defined what it is, and I don't think anybody is right about it the first time for the most part. It's not until they come up with what I'm about to describe that they start to realize, oh, that's not right, because you have conflicting values and you can't keep conflicting values, have to choose something. And it is come up with Mark a lot where he's like, well, yeah, but I want to grow as big as fast as I can, but also I don't want to come into the office. So which is your bigger value? What's the one? you want the most and or like I want to have as higher profit margins as possible but also I want my people to be happy so like you have conflicting values which one is the one that rules and so David has an unspoken value of I want to be king of a domain and I want to have people that I Lord over yes yes that's that's really what it is and because though he wouldn't be able to admit that to himself but it is the driver he'll never and and so number one it's great because somebody like you can go look at anybody that you're talking to and figure out one way or another either asking directly or indirectly what are your pay attention to whether or not that's actually you know, their actions support that or not, because as soon as you recognize that you're working with somebody who has a value that they won't even consciously admit, you cannot work with them, not not wisely, because they will implode. They will destroy whatever they're touching because they're not even honest with themselves about the thing that defines all of the choices that they will make.
00:20:24 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah. Yeah. And then it's like, if, right, and if you look at those values, this what I thought when you were saying, I was just imagining the values as gears, right? So it's like, hey, if you're, if you're a value of time at home in this gigantic gear, it's taking up like, yeah, it can turn the thing, but you have to recognize how it works in relation to the other gears. And it's like, yeah, that machine works, but it's not as if it can't necessarily get you where you want to go. You have to restructure that machine. The design can only do a certain outcome or a certain thing. so Mark wants to be at home. That's a cap that there's a cost that comes with that. But then if you really value that, is there a cost? The cost is, yeah, you're not going to be as big as you'd like. But your values are saying that you don't really want to do that anywhere.
00:21:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. You're actually happy because you have enough money to do the things that you want to be, to be where you want to be with who you want to be. That's the definition of success and freedom, really. So, yeah.
00:21:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
mean, if Mark wants to grow more, this is what I was thinking about this yesterday, the day before. He needs to, I think we talked about this before, but maybe not. And this is like a full on Dan Kennedyism. And it basically is, you know, he who can spend the most wins. Mark needs to be like, I can pay $7,000 a retainer. And how does that fit into the model? Well, It's in. You got to lose some overhead.
00:22:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:22:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Period. And you can shift that money to say, okay, the same amount of money is going to come in, man. can put it towards getting buffering throughout the business. And the story, right? There's 3500 goal or 4500, whatever it is, it's, it's happening out, right? And so this is interesting because we hadn't figured this out before, and I'm realizing this right now, that before he was looking at the cap as like a body's cap, right? Oh, pods are over done. it's like, these, these are where the things are happening out, where they're capping out is the retainers and the costs that you're allowed to pay for. If you can't pay more than 4500 bucks, you can't get more. it's the ultimate thing. It's the ultimate showstopper. Even if he goes and gets more money, if he's... Not get that number, you can't, but the minute you lift that number to like seven grand or whatever, or up to whatever it is, right?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's why things are changing, though, because he is shifting and he's carrying more about that overhead a little bit more specifically. But here's the thing that happened in his life that is allowing for that change. He has friends and he's going, And that was Salko.
00:23:25 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Salko made him do that, but him going and having actual friends means he doesn't need the business to be romper room.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the disruption is coming, but he still, you know, of tend to hearted and does care what people think and so it won't be a rapid thing, but knowing that and being able to observe that the values are changing more because the needs are changing. So the value didn't change. value is Mark wants to have fun and needs to have fun. on fun is a big part of his life and fun with people and socializing is a big part of it. So it existed and was fulfilled by Sweet Law. And now it isn't and doesn't need to be. And so now Sweet Law can behave more, you know, on a business basis with actual real values. But that wasn't like we couldn't have first of all known that or made that happen three years ago, two years ago or one year ago.
00:24:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
So anyway, there we go back to the gears. The fun here is being taken out of the machine.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's kind of the fun.
00:24:36 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah. Right. If the fun gears were moved, then the machine can operate differently. Yeah.
00:24:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so that's also there are two machines, right? So that's a cog. There's the machine, there's a machine that is the visionary. And there is a machine that is the business. And where we work together is where the two combine because they are separate and to. But the business doesn't exist without the visionary, and so it's like this kind of, I don't even know how to describe it, but No, but it was like he was, he was trying to get everything out of the business, and he was everything, everything for his life.
00:25:16 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
He was getting out of the business. And now he's there's a by application, and he's like, Oh, if the business is just about the business and I don't need to get from there. Well, that that alters how that thing can function. Right. I was talking to Sal, and he's like, I don't know why Mary even works there. And I was like, neither do I. He's like, she's overpaid and she doesn't do anything. And she's like, she's been on maternity leave for like two years. And guess what?
00:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing's changed. Because she does a little bit, and it's just it's access that for Mark to not do more. So Mary is there as to take a little of the burden off. That's it. And it's in it and it's a convenience expense.
00:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
And it's an inherited thing that's like, it's, it's, it's part of this thing that I carried through that he's gonna have to reexamine and be like, sorry, like, it's time to, time to move on, like greener pastures.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and he, but before you, or you hang on to her, but I'm like, here's his cognitive dissonance is because he calls her his right hand. And she's really not and she really hasn't been. But it makes her feel good. And I think that he's just, I don't know, complimentary and uplifting of people he cares about and likes and also knows that it's a, it's kind of, it's psychological.
00:26:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I think he believed in it.
00:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that makes sense, though, too.
00:26:57 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yes, I think absolutely. And I think maybe she probably really done.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, and so way more than he does now.
00:27:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
And she might have been right for that version, for that size of the business. Right. At the very beginning, she could have been integral. Well, I know.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:27:11 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
don't The gross in three years is kind of phenomenal. Yeah.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You look at every aspect of it.
00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
So I was like, uh, you need to start calling me your right hand. I'm doing more than she is.
00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did he say to that?
00:27:29 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I don't know.
00:27:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those two, it's like, they're like an odd couple. Are they like Oscar? really are. And they talk constantly, constantly. I'm going to ask. I'm going start calling Mark Felix. And then wait, so he's like, wait, what?
00:27:45 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, totally.
00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was the nice one.
00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yes.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They are the odd couple. Yes. Oscar was the mean one. But it's funny because they're both kind of grumpy.
00:27:55 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah. No, no. Salka's mega grumpy.
00:27:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my gosh.
00:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay, let me, so I forgot to save my notes last week, which means my notes to see if you didn't go. One of them was there was that Van Floey should be brought up on the Monday call per Dan's request.
00:28:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, we did it.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then what? You did it. Oh, yay. And that... Nice. Yeah. wanted to see what Sean had mapped out for the SaaS tier pricing.
00:28:35 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Uh, that I do not. I'm actually meeting with him, like, at 2.30. awesome.
00:28:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, why do I have JD funnels guy? What's that about?
00:28:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Well, they're doing the Spotify app, and they're going to change the look. Oh, okay. Or they did the Spotify app.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how's your... um, martial stuff going.
00:29:03 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I've taken a break.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, not a purpose.
00:29:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It's just like, I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get back into that. But I've been working on, like, fan flowy and mom a ton, like, mapping out all the stuff, like the books written, Greg, Greg and I are doing the cover and the worksheets right now and I'm mapping out the community funnel and strategy and the ads and the ad copy, like, I was literally just doing that. lead magnet, I think, is going to be this fan growth thing that I just came up with, like, this super fan system. then when the book covers done, I'm gonna take that into all software and then eat it from bark and then she'd spit out, you know.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that, um, design or whatever it's called. Yeah.
00:30:01 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
So hopefully Greg will have the, I mean, his first cover looks cool and then I, I just got this morning. So I had said Greg a bunch of stuff and I was like, he was looking for work and I'm like, here's all this stuff. You, you tell me the order in which you want to work on these things.
00:30:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, I'd like to do the mom stuff first and grow. sorry.
00:30:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Go ahead. So we're doing with that.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. That's, I, the seasons, I was just thinking about like the seasons and the, is a thing when you have like so many different things going on. Sometimes they're, they're just is, it's almost like, it's, it's a self initiated sprint of sorts. Like all these things kind of coalesce together at the same time. And so like, there are certain things though, like you have basis is. always there but there it has different seasons where you work on like that's that's me in my course like it's uh it kind of keeps building itself but it's it's the thing that will happen but it's not the thing that is the most important it's basically my product of I'm doing all of these things so I want to capture it and and share it but the biggest thing always has been to me has been the real time service whatever it is whether it's mom or being you know jauncee or daughter or sister whatever all those things are always like top priority mission student oh my gosh you know I'm so busy right now but I'm so happy with it I'm exhausted but I'm like happier than I've been in maybe or cry maybe my whole life exhausted like happy yeah yeah yeah but but you know there's there's always been something to that like the happiest I've ever been I've always been the most busy not busy but doing things like giving them high school 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. going to school going to my favorite classes going to my sports Well, but Maria, I don't know if you've been watching her and she might email her she She sent me a couple messages this week She she was like she is not emotional, but she almost got choked up and she was like thank you for coming into my life She's like I can't believe all these things are happening and you're welcome Maria I Dan and we like it would not exist without Dan, but she and she's equally blessing me just because I get Like I feed off of everybody else's energy. So when I grow their energy there that energy just comes right back to me And so it's basically like I'm creating a battery pack in other people that I just plug into so like they're like you're helping me And I'm like yeah, I promise you. It's mutual But things with cool people She's so smart like it she she can write things down very quickly and she can come up with a very quick tactical approach. So not just, oh, we should do something, but she's like, and I would do this, this, this, this, like, she will come up with a step-by-step plan to do something. But what she's amazing at that most people aren't is if I point out where she's sabotaging, if I point out what's going wrong, she will just, you can see it on her face, she's like, oh . And then she, it doesn't feel good, but then she comes back and she's like, you're exactly right.
00:33:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
That is what is wrong.
00:33:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's what I need to do. And then she fixes it like immediately. And as all the people that I've worked with in my life, I can think of, I mean, it's less than five people for sure. I want to say it's close to three or four people that are like that. So she's exceptional in that way. And, but she loves to do all the things I hate to do. She loves making videos. She loves talking about stuff. And I'm just like, you know what, let's come up with this offer. this This the thing that popped into my head. I was like, what if we just, because she needs to make money, because she spent all her time making everybody really rich. And then when her dad died, she just, she wasn't doing anything except making other people money. And that's why her offers were all over the place, not for her, but because her partner needed, this is between us, really shouldn't say that. Anyway, her partner was desperate and needed money. And so Maria was like, I'll save you. And she goes and puts out offers. So she was being reactive partner. Yeah, business partner.
00:34:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, she called one.
00:34:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they do this boutique thing together, but not anymore. Anyway, ask her about it, because I don't want to be like, I told everything. Emma, are you not thinking of my door? I thought I heard her not getting on my door. was like, I'm not ignoring her. Anyway, so what I was thinking. I was like, you know, there's a no brainer offer to me if people actually knew the value. But she's got all these eyeballs. I think that it's... if we can figure out the words that help people understand it quickly, then I think it's a no-brainer offer. But this, I'm getting ready to tell you. It would be she and I creating a marketing and business plan for somebody. So this is kind of like a person who has been making money, who has made money with a good product, a good service, but never done it consistently. They're either caught in a lunch cycle or they're just doubting themselves or maybe like the economy disrupted them, maybe something unlike just happened. either way, they're not consistently good at it. But they've got assets, whether the assets are their knowledge or things that they've created. And so we would come up with multiple types, like versions of offers, right? We'll take all the things that you know can do, all the assets that you have. and package them in different ways, and you can take which ones you want, and then either offer them in different ways, maybe it's low-mid, high-ticket, if that's something applicable, maybe it's a recurring subscription, basically just showing them all the different ways they could use what they have to create no-brainer value, and they'd have to be pre-qualified, but then the second part would be, so that's the offer. Then we would come up with the basic marketing plan, which Maria can do in her sleep, so can I, and that would be, first of all, whatever the hook is, which means we've defined the avatar, she and I would do the market research first, which we can do very quickly and well. Come up with a plan for one or two avatars, a hook for that, and then a plan, we won't create any of this, but just the structure, we'll write it all out, so they'll have the plan, and then there will be a business plan. create a project management thing like so Trello, in a PDF that take a plug into base camp or a song or something like that, that is custom for them based off of the things that we said that needs to happen. So if they have to go create some copy, create PDFs, create content, create videos, whatever that is, we will include all of that detail in the plan so they don't have to figure out all of this, right? And we're not going to fulfill it for them, but we will give them access to people that we know who can do these things well and do them inexpensively, and then support them through voxer and email so they can get like a private voxer room with us, ask questions, we're not available during the weekend, but then get like personal one-on-one mentoring, we just don't have to lock down our calendars to do it for $6,000. If somebody had offered that,
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
And I don't know, I don't know why, I don't know why Seth isn't buying this off you right now.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seth already has me though.
00:38:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
No, no, but it sounded like him. Hey, you need to take a note here and go back and that whole part of the transcript out. And then feed that into chat. You can have it turn that off that into an offer. just laid out the whole thing and I was like, oh, she's laying out the whole thing. In her own language, I was like, she's got to go back and grab this. And then and then have a chat to turn into an offer and the name. Yeah, no, everything you just said, I was like, this is make a great ad. For sure. And you're calling out a very specific avatar. And I do think that they're out there and I do think that and you called out all the different ways that could have gone sideways, which can then pull in more people whether it is that they're stuck in a cycle or it is the economy. Whatever.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we've had multiple conversations like this. I should actually go get those out of the transcripts because we've written some stuff down, but I, but I know.
00:39:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, you and her.
00:39:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:39:10 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
We've been talking three times, three to four times a week. Yeah, you should absolutely do that. So I actually, uh, just weirdly. I think the reason I thought of that, because I've never considered this before, but I'm listening to a book on songwriting. And the guy was like, which is kind of weird, but he was like, record your conversations and then go transcribe your conversations and then read through them and highlight things you say that are interesting. I was like, that's weird. And then he gave an example of one of the songs that he wrote and he, him and his wife fake the conversation. I don't think actually recorded the conversation between him and his wife. I think he's recalling it, but then he took lines from their conversation and burned them into lyrics. I was like, God damn it. that's a great idea because he's like you're going to talk like you.
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a whole library for you so because I have all my fathom recordings and I made a custom GPT that sorts all the transcripts because it can automatically tell who the speakers are where the timestamps are so it's job is like I put the transcript there and this job is to strip out everybody but me and then strip out any of my personal communication and keep all my business conversation and business strategy which then I had my friend go and she's putting this into a massive master file to build a Tina custom GPT because you can only put in 10 files and so all of my calls are spread out but I could run them through and give you a whole bunch of your stuff if you wanted I'd have to have her do it and I'd do it because I can't automatically I don't have a script for that if you had a script for it I've got
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
the transcripts, but I don't know if I need it.
00:41:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, no, because then you would have all these lines like, you would have so many things you could pull out and you could go if we stripped out everything and it's just down and you'd be like, what are some cool things that I said about this?
00:41:16 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
what have you spoken about? No, no, yeah, let's do it because I always think in the other day, I was back to thinking about writing a book. Now that I wrote a book with GPT, I was like, I could probably take myself put it in there and then I kind of know my ideas, right? then like, I used it again on some of the other day where I was saying idea, money, execution, I said, but you have to realize it's fractal, right? within the idea or other ideas. And then you have to look at that in the same sort of three ways. There's the idea, there's the money, there's execution. So I was like, Oh, yeah, if I told that to chat, GPT. So what I've been doing lately. he is. I did this with Maria. So Maria had her emotional opera thing that she saw for 27 bucks. I bought it. Feel free to tell her this. I bought it, downloaded her video, put it into the script, then took the transcript, X worded out of that to PDF, then fed the PDF to chat TPT and I said, analyze this and tell me what it's about. And it was like, you know, was Maria because I told the script, Maria, like this is Maria talking about the emotional offers. go, great. Write me a framework based on what she's talked about in a road of framework. I said, I want to make an emotional offer. What do you need for know for me? you're buying an offer like this? It's like, I need you to tell me all these things. And by the end of it, I had an emotional offer at all. And then I set it a sales page, the sales page for the book that I'm emulating from mom. And it was like, it put all this together. And I was like, what, what is the sales page even? Which emotion? In fact, there's the emotion of helplessness. That's is. I was talking about it. I was like, okay, so I've been doing that a lot, like downloading, downloading people by people's training and I'm running a crew and then having it and last for me. So not to spend an hour. Super helpful. And then I'd also, I mean, when I wrote the book, I gave you an example, an example book and a bunch of stuff that Mark wrote. And I realized that like, oh , I could give this thing other people's books. Like, I'm super into what's my book, the automatic customer I love, then there's a lot of stuff that we do, whatever it is. I could get those books and upload them and then be like, these are things that I reference all the time because people do that in their books. They go, oh, well, from this book, I could be that and then put it into the context of the thing that I'm talking about. So, it might be interesting to get myself.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering if.
00:44:01 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, so can I have this idea? I haven't extended it to Facebook, but it would absolutely work. It would absolutely work in Facebook groups, particularly. So David Kefaneko there, he is sorry in the thought leadership business now, because you know, we've started business. And anyway, so we were talking about that at some point. I was like, and then I was doing my whole. Oh, I'm going to sell this to you, by the way. I finished it, but I didn't send it to you. So I did the Reddit's great. And then I used chat TPT to like come up with categories and then categorize all the posts in that music thing. And now I have a breakdown of like, hey, is how this these 1000 or 800 questions break down across these categories. And now I might go when you're like, add some categories into that. But I. Get all that, and I was like, oh, this is interesting. And then I started thinking about David's thought leadership thing. And then I started thinking, what if I hit subreddit, right? this one. I created categories for it, but the data from it. And then I just started monitoring that with AI, with the API plus AI. And what I do is say, hey, when there's a post on mixing, I want you to recognize the post on mixing. The title of the thing is the question, right? But they could also go into the script, like the actual post exit with it. And then it comes in, and let's say I'm Sean. So Sean is monitoring this subreddit I was on. Hey, there's a post on mixing. pulls it in. Then it looks at its Sean resources, because Sean is uploaded. We've uploaded Sean. We've uploaded Dawn's answers to other things, and we have the AI write the answer for the Reddit post, and then it alerts Sean that says, hey, have a new comment for you on Reddit, and if he goes in command to go, yep, that looks good, it's submit, and then it schedules it to be reposted on Reddit. All of a sudden, having this very active person in these subreddits around very specific topics that you're choosing to comment back on, in a way that doesn't occupy all your time to sit there, go find the thing, read the thing, write the answer. Instead, it allows you to become like this bot leader in these subreddits, then you do the exact same thing on Twitter, you go, okay, here, I'm looking for tweets about this. When you see a tweet about this, grab the tweet, bring it in, write a retweet, tweet, or write a reply, and then I look up and go, yep, that looks good, submit, and then it just schedules it to go out. No one would ever know that you're using AI or it's like, it's not a bot. It's more like, it's more like when you get in the robot, right? It's like, it's a person and a bot. But if you did that, every day, if you just started all of a sudden showing up and displaying your authority, dude, you become, you become a thought leader, you would absolutely get leads. And I'm like, oh my God, I could have built this thing. Just even if we just use it like, I had Daryl Thorpe go into this recording thing and read it where there's 3.4 million people. And all of a sudden the eight time Grammy award winner is responding to your . People would be like, what the f except it's it is him. Right? it's not him. So imagine doing that in Facebook groups, right? you go join these different Facebook groups and it's just watching the group. And it's like, Oh, Tina, you're commenting on this and you go, yeah, that looks good.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boom. So no.
00:48:03 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It's great.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't even like really wrap my head around that though.
00:48:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It's great. know. I told someone and they're like, dude, that is such a great idea. Are you gonna make it a product? said, no.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
be cool is?
00:48:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Yeah, I just need it for me. I could get Mark, Sean and Daryl in Reddit consistently posting their no, no, their expertise. It would translate into and then they'd be doing it in the context of the mom brand. They'd be make references to that. They'd make references to fan flow. But it would be in the context of answering the real question. And then the split, like the slang authority tapping into reciprocity like all those things.
00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I can't possibly do that.
00:48:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Hey, no.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doggy.
00:48:58 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
No. I'm up on the protein, she goes, I'm on the protein and comes out covered in dirt, what are you doing? You're lying, you're covered in dirt too.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me show you some of that. Oh, I'm feeling that the job that I asked to be done did not completely get done.
00:49:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Good job.
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, the extraction process goes ongoing through all of the conversations and literally all the traps. And I'm also looking at the output and it's only 180 provides where all of the calls total. And obviously I didn't talk in all of them. All of them. I mean, yeah. I'm pretty sure the job is not done. got built eight hours for it. Very close. I knew I might just not be able to. All right. right. All right. right. All Okay, so anyway, I do have, because, so what I did was, because all of that stuff should have been pasted into chat GPT, and she has a different account that I gave just to her to use just that custom GPT and put all of these transcripts. And so anything that had you in there, I could say, now tell me everything that Dan Ryan said, and all of them except one says there's no instance of Dan Ryan and the one that did have it, it was all- That's I don't exist, Tina, I am just a space invaders graphic, we all know this. I know, oh my gosh, that was the wildest thing to be, like when you reached out after Dan, or yeah Meredith, shared my,
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
like you're just a space invaders guy like you're real what so I wear a by shirts in this company called Dixon and their thing is like everything is limited edition so it's like they make they don't tell you how many they're making but they have a they have flannel they're short sleeves and these other things called party shirts they're like this sort of blend material anyway so you buy them and then it's they're limited edition right so they're never going to make them again which I didn't know at first so I'm eric bobbie when i'm like oh my god I love the shirt because you don't need to iron it like the ones are made of bamboo and the other ones are made of this stuff like golfing that were wrinkled ton I'm in three weeks ago they put out a space shirt I was like who bought it it's like they're making close for me the space invaders centipede those were my two favorite ones an impact man in this pack man and really only I miss Pac-Man because of that scene in the middle where they can oh yeah for the basis update basis is done and they are building their building wolf are on it uh Frank said we're done we're we're building a site like we're not we're we're gonna go build it we're gonna find whatever is left the wolf are will be on basis 2.0 october 20 third second fourth 24th 24th that's what we did that's what yesterday awesome yeah frankly no we're done we're done we're doing it we're building I love it um I just like I'm flabbergasted I'm like wait what that's so I was almost anticlimactic because I didn't ask the question
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, that's wild. So that's a thing.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It's like, I don't work on it. It's like, there's nothing for me to work on. I used it the other day. And I was like, hey, I found this list of this. It was so funny because Eric's like, oh, it's great. But I was like, hey, business and it's going work with like, oh, it. I was like, it's not that bad though. Not right. It's just a little tiny thing. And then I pointed out a couple of things. And they were like, fixed on the good catch on the ground.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, OK. when will you get back to the Google Analytics stuff?
00:53:36 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Because we've got another 71 goals that depend on that. I got to actually submerge them on, hey, they move to circle. And it's actually, I'll go do it right now. I don't know where to send them stuff now. Like, is it a sporting circle? I'm going to go with this. But I need to ask them a question about one of the things that doesn't appear to be working correctly. And then I need to also. who's one of the things that I made, it seems like the numbers too high. I need to go and match up that number with me, meta-rich and see if they match. They should match and if they don't match, then I got to send that to Mushy, though these are matching, so I'll say things off. Yeah, so if they answer my one question, that'll fix that thing. And then Mushy, if Mushy is things working correctly, then I can start to use that to make sure. I mean, that actually might be done as far as the stuff that I've wanted in place for most of the new ones. No, I still have to add I got to add the custom meta thing to the leads. So that's working, that's been running for like two weeks. So now I got to go back to the background and Mushy will be can I do this custom meta thing? And, uh, that she will, yeah, I don't, I don't pull together to stop it, don't, then I decided already that I'm not, we have to build a container from scratch. We're not going to use the one that until a bill because it's too complicated, which is fine. It's not a deal, but I'll put it up over. So that would be a good plan is to have the container ready for the new wolf. Boom. Okay, so what was like that? Uh, the 24th.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got the, okay, that's when it's going to be ready. So what are you, you're going to have your container.
00:55:42 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Your I would like to, yeah, I'd like to have, yeah, then use it on that site.
00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the C Dan has a self imposed task.
00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Just so you know, she's out of town.
00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's what out of town. I kind of guessed that because my invoice goes out, but it goes out automatically and then I get an email about it. But then PayPal's like, just to know your invoice has not been opened yet.
00:56:14 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I'm like, this is either sick or on vacation. So yeah, she's like this.
00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The lamb.
00:56:22 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Okay.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't even really know actually if I was like that. I'm supposed to have to complete his GA for container by the time Wilfer goes live. Nice. There's 2.0. October 23rd.
00:56:43 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
2.0.
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's wild. Okay. Um, but I'm, um, hold on. Okay. So that's the problem. But that is the problem.
00:56:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
why is your face all dirty? What? dog. like space it's like just covered with dirt. I don't know what they're doing. Somebody's digging. have a puppy.
00:57:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a puppy and a puppy probably found a whole dig in for me to hold the dig in. All right. Well, everything that I have to ask is either dependent upon something else who status I already know about or isn't in the area of working on right now because you're full with other things. don't have anything else right now, but I will say these notes. They actually go to Stacey this time.
00:57:41 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, the other bit with Maria was so she even went by about the film. And it was like she has like a follow-up email that's like I'm just checking to see if you got the thing. Can you apply gas? Of course, I'm like, I know this is you're just it's like an engagement thing. I'm like, I know. So then I read her an email.
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Oh, yeah, I will not respond to your email. And she wrote me back this long as he was like, oh, my God, I've spent my copy out. You're so funny. A bunch of Star Wars references, I was like, yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I actually got her back to tell her her sales page is finally going to go live and only took eight months. You're welcome.
00:58:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, she's awesome. Like, I wouldn't say like that kid is awesome. she's like 10 years older than me, but she's still like, I don't know. I pretty much feel like mom around almost everybody.
00:58:37 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Well, I mean, my plan is still to like, I'm going to give Greg Greg's going to dissolve the AC funnel, right? going to be back to Eric and Abish, I can DJ him like, no show tonight. I'm like, Hey, needs to be built with blocks this way. Oh, can it be done? And then Frank is telling them like, Hey, look, if you need a block, like go. find somewhere else and just and then make sure you're going to need that block and then build it. He's like, just we're not going to build new blocks. He's like, we're done.

We're done building blocks. You guys sound good. There's a puzzle.
00:59:26 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Ayo.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you very There is no audio on your side.
01:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
There was music.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what's happening. There is music or was music.
01:00:38 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Was you didn't hear that?
01:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
01:00:41 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
It was crazy. It was like some dance song drum beat.
01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the soundboard was working.
01:00:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I just can't hear it. The output must be like, it must be a monitor setting and it must be. Oh, wait. I know what it is. I was like, man, team. This map music is not what I thought it would be.
01:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What music?
01:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Your map music.
01:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My map music is brown noise mixed with green noise.
01:01:10 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
You don't hear that. I'm here and clapping and audience-like-like.
01:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what you said here.
01:01:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
No, I didn't hear that. Yeah, I heard.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Damn it.
01:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Well, that was- Oh, so you have that thing, that road thing too?
01:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the road caster. I got that like last year, and so the reason, the only reason I actually got it out was because this this mic has a USB port, right? So I was trying to move the microphone and it broke the USB port because I didn't realize it was stuck there. Having to find out, lots of people have done that. It breaks the connector on the inside very quickly. Both looks. But it also has an XLR cable. Well, I have XLR to USB, but I don't have the cable for that. And so I'm like, well... I wonder if the Roadcaster Pro could connect to it, because I've got the XLR cable, so I plugged it into that and it plugs into my Mac with the USB and I'm like, I'm just gonna go with it, so I have a little bit of it. Okay, oh that was it, oh yeah, the Halloween text, that was funny and then I just totally disappeared in this. Let's do it though, but the body of stuff I could hear, I'm so fine.
01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
Also, why is it not coming to right now?
01:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, mentally stable, nobody was racking. All right, Daniel Son, you go have a good weekend, take good care of yourself, don't forget the GA4 stuff because now you have a deadline and also another 71, we got a percentage to overcome, which actually I think that you already did, but anyway, whatever, that's what mean.
01:02:58 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
no, I think I think we're hitting. I could tell you he was bummed because we lost subscribers this month or whatever, but we didn't. I'm like, the math is right. That's sealed. I'm right. We overshot and now we're going to come down. We're over the ceiling, but I'm like, the average is going to be the ceiling. But that's good. like, this is a good thing. Then it shows me, yes, all right, now go add new customers. That's the only path forward is to have new customers period.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you shatter the ceiling? That was a question still, right?
01:03:37 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
I mean, that's why I'm building all this stuff, right? It's like, this is why we're getting the tracking. It's like, now we know I never had that formula before, like I said, glass in formula. I do think it's accurate. So if it is, then it's like, okay, now change 30 to 35. It's like, okay, we have to change 30 to 35 or 30 to 40. And then figure out what tactics create new customers or not. Or it's like, or it's like with March business or whatever. like, you know what? is what it is. It is no path forward, but I don't think that's true. I think that we can go. We've never really tried to require customers. Or we could figure out if it's a reality or not.
01:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, we need you to do your math magic.
01:04:27 - Dan’s iPhone (3)
So all the math because nobody else does it. Yep.
01:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. On that note. Have a great day. Great weekend. And I will. the calls.
