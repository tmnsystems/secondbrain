Hi, this is going to say good morning, it's not morning, though. How are you?
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
Pretty good. How are you?
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Got you Patrick in here.
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hello.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have your chicken breast for lunch today?
00:00:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I did eat the chicken first today.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the whole thing.
00:00:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
wasn't. It's a bar, so it helps.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're Lauren's one of the meetings that was just me and Patrick were talking about having to do one of the exercises that I recommend. And I was like, is there any habit that you have that you do just because you know it's good for you? you really hate it and he's like yeah eating chicken breast and I was like yeah I get that.
00:01:07 - Lorenz Schuerch
There's only so many ways you can make chicken breast look taste good and none of them are healthy so.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and then you defeat the purpose of having chicken breast and you're like but spices man learning how to use spices will change the game and the type of cooking that you I've learned that. I also don't have the energy for that so I can't be bothered. All right let's see let me get open my notes. So I have this combined. I do need to have a separate one for you guys. I got way too many times going on. How's your guys this week Ben?
00:01:59 - Lorenz Schuerch
Very good. Yeah. Pretty busy.
00:02:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, have we had any contemplation about schedule and organization and goals and since we last spoke?
00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
I mean, yeah, I kind of know I want to organize the teams when I have those absences coming up, come up. But yeah, having one less team member every month, you know, that stresses everyone out. So there's things that are that could have a potential for falling through the cracks. So that's a little stressful, but we're making it happen.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. so trying to think, oh, you sent me. Let me go open your email. Last week it was just you and me, right, Lawrence?
00:03:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not as you, Patrick.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me and Patrick, okay. I'm just going to tell you right now. I'm still dealing with this early morning seminary and it is not working for me. The opposite is happening. It's not that I just can't get up. I'm waking up at three o'clock in the morning randomly and can't go back to sleep with the crap. I can't. Hey, sorry.
00:03:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, my kids go to school on the other side of town. So I have to get up at 5.30, so I feel your pain.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Wait, this is ridiculous. Okay, open this. So intake. I'm gonna. Dang it. You guys in this Microsoft stuff. Friends, can you please copy the document that you sent me? Anatomy of the case and just put it into an email. And I can. And copy and paste it and put it into a spreadsheet. Because I don't want to deal with trying to log into Microsoft. Actually, I probably can do this. I don't And that was finished with the last time.
00:04:14 - Lorenz Schuerch
So you should have next couple of seconds here.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. And where's the one that I was working with Patrick? I have so many sweet ones for the cheese. Surveys. Oh my gosh, I forgot to put the door and those birds are going bonkers. Can you hear that?
00:04:47 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My child has got these two parakeets and they're quiet except for when she's gone. They're like, yeah, we're going to fight. So it's nobody here to tell us to behave. right, waiting for that to come back through again. There we go. All right. the heck did I put the one that you and I were working on? Patrick. I'm going to move over this here. Oh, I forgot how that pastes. We spent the whole time doing that last time through our progress budget. Patrick team tasks. That's what it was. I'm going to paste Lorenz's stuff on a new tab. Actually, let me go look and let it fire real quick. I did it. I have to set a reminder because we have one person that creates these reports for us. I figured out what I can get for you guys as a report that you can look at, but it has to be created. I All right. All right. We'll get everybody set real quick. Okay. Those are so quiet.
00:06:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
We're the literally the two quietest guys in the hole for.
00:06:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were with the light chatty is chatter box ever and then you're just quiet and Mike. I like talking, but I don't. only talking to myself or necessarily listening to myself. I'm just like, feel like I'm monologuing over here. I am monologuing over here. Do you need another teens? Okay, let's take a look at this. What? 30 days, refreshed. I'm 24. So somebody has already looked at this today. Um, dropouts and subouts by team. How many cases do you have right now, Patrick? Because you've got a lot moved over.
00:07:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
165.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, it's about same as I was last week, I think. Um, record count. Let's see. Drop down, set down, total list. I want to look at it by let's see, I know what I'm not supposed to show and that is not in this room.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch
Why are you not supposed to That's not in your business.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what is it? it to you, why are you asking me? Don't play me like nice stupid geez. You're gonna get one by me. I don't think so! How you met Ronan?
00:08:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
The dog? dog? well I've seen him on camera.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's so cute. I randomly get Ronan pictures sometimes. It's just probably awesome. Let's see. Where's the report report? That was after that. Now I'm Okay, this is good. I can do this. I can share screen. Okay, so this is just the last 30 days, which we know is a terrible type of snapshot. That's longer. So we're gonna go look at the last 90 days. That would be We. And also, Patrick is still new and it doesn't even have an average case load, normal case load. Okay, average resolution speed by team over the last 90 days, that gap is closing pretty good. So it's a roughly a 15-day gap between you and Samantha Lorenz. I know how Tyler's is faster. I guess he's better than I think that he is. I don't know.
00:10:30 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have to work him up as much.
00:10:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, is that necessarily a good thing if it's that?
00:10:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm not trying to stir the pop because I just all like things sometimes, but I'm not that good at thinking about things. just blurt.
00:10:49 - Lorenz Schuerch
No, but I do agree that faster is one thing if you're getting full policy limits on them, but let's look at that.
00:10:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think closing that on a week.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, he's pretty high on that too, but this average fee per attorney, that is much lower and not an issue. Nate doesn't count because he's litigation. Yeah, and then cases closed while again we're going with speed rather than quality. This is really probably the bigger indicator. I mean, this is pretty big getting. I wonder how that even happens if that's just look at the draw, but I don't. This doesn't seem like an accurate correlation. I need to. Let's think, you know, I don't know where my snuffing notes are. I'll just send her an email. The blue is less than 40%, right?
00:12:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
My blue is 40%.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh! I have the brain. You're right. Good job. Good call. eyes. Good looking out. Okay. Way better. So he's less than that. Okay. That seems more right. Do you guys know how hard it is to find attorneys to hire? It's hard. This is a very long time. Just something to put under your cap. Should you ever need that information that you didn't hear from me?
00:12:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got a problem on people's. Okay. So anyway. Um. Okay. Um. We will get a version of the report that for sure you can look at and it really should have all of these things just that some things are connected to other things. And, uh, you know, it's an entire business and running a business has different level of responsibility and that information is important. So to the point of like, what is it? Don't worry about it. You want that responsibility. You can open your own practice. It's a lot. It's a lot to run the business. I'll tell you. All right, I'll put some subouts by team. So I wish that this was separated. I really need dropout and subouts because they're very different, right?
00:13:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. don't want to hang on to cases for too long, right? If they're not, if you find out that they're not viable.
00:13:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so drop out and then subout means to be separated. And then also validate, you know, it's probably the right correlation for the twice between. Oh, actually, I want, let's see. I need a number. For. Below. 3% and. Above 40% or 4% higher. Save. Okay. Okay.
00:14:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's other.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. That's what I need. Wait, where's the other. Oh. Oh. Okay, I don't, I don't know, um, dropouts. And so dropouts, as you got rid of the case, right? You just like, I referred it out, referred out, right?
00:15:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And stuff out is they went somewhere else. So maybe other is like, it shouldn't have been a retainer in the first place, because they already had an attorney, or the case was closed and it already been settled, and they came in and they were trying to like, do it again to see if they could get better results, because I've heard that that happens, or that they know, because that would be, yeah, is so if they had waited too long, didn't have any insurance, Like, are there different qualifications where you wouldn't refer it out, you just need to go, this is not a viable case?
00:16:07 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, that's when we drop it, you know, like there's no insurance to go after, or there's...
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, then maybe other is referred out.
00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that those are the three categories, either it's just, it's not a viable case. They went somewhere out, or we referred them out. And we want to track them, because referred out is still some source of revenue, dropped things. wasted time and we wasted money. And so we need to track that, because that's potentially an intake issue. So anyway, which is something that we're also working on. Intake is really, it's a whole different process. And I've been working really hard to try to get more attention onto the intake. Process, because it's not super effective. And I'm saying that because... As you can tell, all of us have work to do. All of us could do things better. We could all be more optimized, like we show up and we get a job done. But the job can always be done better without necessarily like brow beating and trying to be a perfectionist. all the things that we're doing are not really perfectionism type stuff, right? It's not about never make this mistake, never do that, never do this. It's more about sorting the tasks and using the time better and paying attention to specific types of things, prioritizing, valuing, things like that, versus always do this, never do that, blah, that type of thing. So anyway, but if we can improve the intake process, and a good portion of that is the way people show up on the calls, like the clients themselves. So some of them are liars. I don't know a portion of them, some of them liars, but most of them have never been in a car accident before. Don't what to do. So this is a new experience. They don't know you. They don't trust you necessarily, right? And they don't know what they need to communicate to you. So if the questions aren't asked at all, or if they're not asked clearly, you know, there's, there's so much nuance to that. And we've talked about call control, even on the attorney level, when you're dealing with the clients, trying to figure out how to keep a person who's not good at communicating, or not articulate, not focused, not willing. Like your people have to be able to extract specific types of information from people who it may be just really difficult to extract from them because they lack the vocabulary, lack the coherence, they lack the the interest, all of these types of things. So it's not as simple as here's a script, follow this script, and it's going to be perfect every time, because you're like, have you, I mean, I know you have Lorenz, but has anybody ever tried to put clothes on, baby?
00:19:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's really hard.
00:19:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really hard. The baby will do what the baby wants to do. It's not just like, hey, get dressed. let me put your arm in here, put your legs in here. like, no, I don't want to do that. Yeah, it's, it can be like that probably talking to clients like, look, I'm just trying to help you. And they're like, oh, no, don't want to do that. Anyway, yeah. So that's what we're dealing with is we don't have this perfect hygienic, hygienic, what's the word, like, pristine, there's a goal. Yes, something like that, you know. like like Intel has this it's pristine like but that's not the word I'm looking for environment where they make the um the processors but anyway that's just like this this perfect environment that is that works the same every single time so you get the same kind of output every single time that's not what you're dealing with you're dealing with people people at every point a different person at the insurance agency a different doctor a different um client a different person on intake who took the report like there are so many different things that and that can affect how it goes and like you guys we're different people every day so um you've experienced many different versions of Tina so far it's like tired cranky hungry wait that's me all the time maybe I'm gonna say anyway um but but if people are run down if their brains aren't working and optimized there's all kinds of different things go into here. So it doesn't make any sense to say, this is the way to do it every single time, just do this, and you'll get perfect results. you have to do, first of all, is teach everybody to be able to think critically, who you're talking to, what are you dealing with, what do you recognize about the situation that you've come into contact with before, what are the treatments that you can apply, so like if you've got somebody who is hesitant, resistant to share information with you, then one of the things that you want to do is remind them why they're calling in the first place, why you're talking to them in the first place. They've been in a car accident, there's been some injury, and they want to get the help and they don't want to pay for it. The only way they're going to get that outcome is to be able to work with you, and the only way that you can be successful in helping them accomplish that outcome is by telling you what you need to know. But I guarantee you most of the time that conversation isn't had so explicitly. So those are the types of things that we want to be aware of is what are the different ways that we can communicate and operate to get us the best outcome no matter who we're talking to and what the situation is. And in order for you all to learn how to do that and for your teams to learn how to do that through you, you have to be able to learn to evaluate all these moving parts because all of these moving parts have an impact in the overall outcome, which is what your client is interested in, right? So anyway, so now we're looking at these types of things. Let's go ahead and get to zoom on my way. I think it's, it is not that one, it's this one. Okay, so we're on I'm going to show you what Patrick and I were done before we get to your stuff that you shared with me. So, you know what I forgot to do is get a drink. There's nobody in my house to go fetch it for me, food, whatever. Okay, so these are the breakdowns of the types of tasks that Patrick could identify in the case process, which will go and compare to yours. And then I asked him to tell me who does it, and then what we did was we looked at the different stages that these things are in and which things can be done simultaneously, meaning not necessarily like one person doing it, but you don't it's not contingent upon another thing to be accomplished. So, if we're waiting for one thing, we can be working on the other thing. So the introduction call confirming the coverages and liability, liability that over there. Order initial documents such as police reports, hospital records, health insurance liens, sending defendant insurance inquiries, requests for D&B insurance search requests, order policy limits. I'm just going to keep going. Oh, I got to move that. Continuing client medical referrals, whatever, can read the rest of it. So what we found here, so obviously introduction call happens first, right? There's a chronological order to some of these things and a dependency upon previous tasks in some of these. So you can't have this stage, right, until you've had the introduction call. You can't order the initial documents, you're not going to do that until you've confirmed the coverages and liability. And then sending And the defendant, the insurance inquiry request DMV, obviously there's there's some dependencies here. So now what we have here and down here set up for treatment is this whole group of activities that can be done without having to just wait for this to happen or wait for that to happen. So that's good to know because when we're looking at the timeline and we're reviewing the cases and looking at what can be moved forward. Let's say this isn't done or this is done and this is done and this is done, but this isn't. We can be working on these things. So what Patrick and I did last week also is we went into Lidify and looked at just all of the cases that he had open. Now, we only got like two cases in and there was one that hadn't been touched for. Three months and one that hadn't been touched for two months. And so one of them was clearly that person was in treatment and the other one was probably that, but there was a little, there was a question mark about it. But here's the thing, even if we know that they're in treatment, you've got, and this is something I explained to Patrick, you've got a person on the other end who their experience, and this is going to come out in their reviews, and this is going to also impact how they feel when you get to do the distributions conversation. You've got this person depending upon their attorney, and they want to feel like they're cared about, that they're known, that they're remembered, and that they matter, that they're not just a paycheck. So if I don't hear from somebody for six months, three months, you know, I'm like, what's going on with my case? Even if they told me that these are all the things that have to happen, there's something that clicks if somebody's just like, hey, just want to check in on you, want to make sure that your treatments are going well, see if you have any questions, and just let you know just a reminder this is where we're at with the case. There's nothing that we can do until you treatment. And so there's really no need for you to do anything, but just want to let you know that and just want to make sure that everything's okay. Can you imagine what that feels like when your attorney's office calls you like that. Now imagine you're like a lonely old lady that got in a car wreck or a cranky old dude and nobody's cared about you because you grew up hard and there's you know what I mean? Like there's a there's a lot to be said for nurture and concern, and you're already in the habit of talking to people very frequently. That's not a lot of time, especially. If you don't really actually have to ask them anything you and you could pick somebody on your team who's really good at this both of you have people that well I don't know about you so much Patrick I don't but I would assume so have people that your clients like talking to we don't want to spend too much time with this but you do you know like you could you can kind of deputize somebody on the team to do these follow ups that really aren't only just to let them know we haven't forgotten you. So I don't think anybody should go longer than a month without being followed up with even if we're in treatment and we know that the treatment is going to take six months because there's this whole long thing of they're supposed to go to 20 chiropractors visits and it's going to take however long you know what I mean. Even if you do the math and you know there's no way they're going to be done in a month. Checking on them within a month just let them know hey we're going to follow up with you check on you see how you're doing and then actually do it. There's this whole psychological thing. that happens with people. That's like, first of all, you set an expectation. Second of all, you met that expectation. I'm going to feel like when you tell me you're going to do something, I can count on that. And also, when we get to the distributions conversation, I'm like, I feel a little bit differently because you reached out to me, you checked on me. And honestly, like, I felt like I was just kind of going through this alone. I'm stuck in the middle of this. My back is hurting. My neck is hurting. I'm not going to get paid for a while. I have to go through this stuff and nobody cares. But my turn is called and checked on me. That was like, I was good. I needed that. Not even a tiny little thing. So the other thing that we talked about Lorenz is doing a top to bottom file review once a week, all of your cases. But I'm not talking about going into every type of detail that you guys do. I think as a team, all we did was open up the cases. Um, just looked at the conversation and the notes to see how long it had been since anybody had contacted them. And if there was a very apparent somebody should have said something either because of the time that had gone by it exceeded, you know, a month or something like that, or there was a lack of clarity in the update in the notes and the conversation, right? Somebody said, I'm going to do this, but there's no clear evidence that it was done or that it's being done or that there's any issue or any success, you know what I mean? So it would take you, you know, with the amount of cases, you have how many open cases do you have, you know, uh, two, forty, three, I think. Yeah. So you probably have about a hundred and more. Wait, what did you tell me Patrick? I have I know your volume changed.
00:31:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
165. Yeah, so that's my total. don't know what's open.
00:31:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, wait a minute. Total meaning all the cases you've ever done or ever currently have on my list, but I think open means like not settled, I think. Oh, okay.
00:31:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I consider a settled cases until they're closed to be active because there's still work to be done on me.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:31:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Me too. So it could be done.
00:31:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have some 165. Yeah. So to me, uh, yeah, when I stay open, that's what I mean is that it hasn't been, you haven't received payment. Basically when you receive payment, it's that's done, but I might be incorrect on the verbiage.
00:31:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
So I'm down to 230 now.
00:31:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:31:57 - Lorenz Schuerch
Isn't it? the two, Hank.
00:31:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, Probably some of it, but also leads have dropped tremendously this month. It has slowed way down. We are about 65% of volume from last month, so there's that. But there have been some cases gone to Hank, but not. I mean, I actually know. I don't even think he's in this report. So yeah, yes. Those only resolutions. I'd have to go on, I don't know if I need to share, I'm sure. guess that would probably be okay. But just because I don't know what the report will show up, I will look at that later and see how many he's got. Anyway, was I up?
00:32:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Going through the file reviews.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, yeah, thank you for being a teacher, Patrick, good job. So anyway, Lorenz, what I was asking Patrick to do and I would like you to do this as well is just that. Just take and it will go much faster as you do it every week. But just open them and see when was the last time that that client has heard from somebody from Sweetlaw and unless you get distracted and turn it into something else, it shouldn't take probably more than a couple of hours. And once you do it the next week, there will be some of them and maybe you have a way of marking them where you can just go, I sure don't need to check that because number one, I know they're in treatment and number two, it's only been a week since somebody checked on them so I don't have to look at that. But is that something that you would be willing to do?
00:33:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, yeah, I thought it was something that I thought the... Can you click on your matters that already voted that last call? Yeah.
00:34:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you click on that, um, can you, could you share your screen and show me what you look at?
00:34:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay, go. can you see my cursor?
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:34:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right here.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Okay. Now, let's see how many cases you let's, let's just go scroll all the way through, but okay. So, okay, let's pause. All right, so, what I want you to do is validate this, can we just pick a couple of cases randomly, two, whatever, and look at that and make sure that that is correct?
00:35:22 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so this one's supposed be 9-3 for the last so I'm to mute this last one, September 3, like that, we love the call, the client, by the client list, we all
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on, so was there anything that was supposed to happen after that? So here's what I want to know. Because we're trying to improve the overall length of time to resolve a case, right? if you ask a person to do something, statistically, how often are people going to do most of those things? Most people going to do those things quickly.
00:36:35 - Lorenz Schuerch
That's your experience? Oh, I don't know, Tina, couple of months I've had people gone for two weeks at a time, so it's everyone's been a little bit swamped. I kind of get, I have to use my dad voice with John this morning for letting a few things fall through the cracks, but honestly, he's been handling the caseload without Barry for three weeks now.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now I was just trying to imagine Lawrence's dad voice to apply the model. So most people, I think, if you ask them to do something, unless it's urgent for them, they're not necessarily going to do that quickly.
00:37:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
So So how often do you follow up with them without like being this type of thing?

If it's a move something forward, I'd do it weekly. And I would just do a quick text message. You're like, Hey, just wanted to check and make sure that you did that. And how's it going? Or were there any issues, whatever, you get a response back and they're like, Oh, just be like, okay, just wanted to check. Because we definitely want to get that check to you, know, something like that, or you're just kind of nudging matter of fact. There's a great book. That's right. I don't remember who I thought I can do for a minute. It's called nudge. Um, but it's basically that we all need nudges. We all need nudges for different reasons, but a lot of times it's simply because something isn't top of mind. But not being top of mind doesn't mean not important and not a priority. It just means it's not top of mind, especially these days with all of the different things that we have going. And here's what I want you to think about. And we're going back to just kind of when we get down to distributions. Distributions are going to be impacted by how I feel about you. I don't know there's different people, right? Not everybody is going to feel this way, but a lot of people. There's this there's this law of reciprocity that is if you take care of me. I don't want to do bad things to you, right? So if you were helpful to me, I am not going to get upset about you earning your fee. There are different ways that we can improve the perception of our value in service towards us. Most of it is going to have to do with their sense of feeling about how we care, as well as efficiency. And there are a few little things that we can do that don't take a lot of time and requirements and energy from us, but require us to be consistent in doing that. One of them is a nudge. It's hate, just a reminder. know you're busy. You probably just want to make sure that you've got this done and that everything's going OK and see if you need any help. Now, what they don't know is that the whole reason that you're doing it is that I don't know what percentage of the case is slowed down by. clients not doing their part, but it's going to be significant. You can only control how fast you can go. You cannot control how fast the insurance company goes, but you can influence it to a degree by your tenacity and follow-up, right? You'll have even a greater impact at improving the and influencing the pace of the client doing their steps to move through it with little nudges, just wanted to check, make sure everything's okay, and then when we get down to the case, and they're kind of reviewing in the back of their mind how this experience went, man, they were always there like helping me get through the process, making sure I didn't forget anything, seeing if I was okay. You don't have to increase a lot of your time and effort to do that because most of and do you guys happen to? to mark or signify and type away when your client has a preference between text and calls.
00:41:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
We usually just write it on that left side.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you, it is something that you guys consider.
00:41:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I've only had like two that are like, call me, don't text me.
00:41:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That doesn't necessarily answer my question.
00:41:30 - Lorenz Schuerch
So your question is, is there a system? Does a system have a way to differentiate between contact through text or contact through calling?
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only does system in terms of litify, but does system in terms of your team and your operations style?
00:41:53 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, I think Mark's made it pretty clear that he prefers texts.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I did not know that.
00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
it's good. And the problem is my experience in Arizona, clients definitely do not prefer text. There's a heavy lean towards phone calls, especially for Hispanic clients and our older population, which is a lot of Arizona rises.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So that's something I want to work on a little bit. But let's just assume that we can accomplish most of these nudges through text. So I'll give you the promise of the book. And it's basically a lot of the books are... Anecdotes reports stories that support the claim and basically it's that psychologically most of us need nudges. There comes up some type of resistance for different reasons and it could just be number one it's not on my mind and that happens frequently because we have so many things distracting us. Number two it could be I'm not in the mood for that. Number three it could be I don't have that number available to me at this particular moment. All kinds of different things. So a nudge could be number one it serves as a reminder. Number two the energy of the nudge right the reminder message could be such that it's encouraging and hey just wanted to check on you all they care about me out. I want to do my part I want to make sure that this case gets done I'm gonna go do it again it's not gonna work like that with everybody but The point of all the things that we're doing isn't to perfect everything, it's to improve what can be improved, right? And then to get the compounding effect of those improvements. So coming into something like this, if you look at your case and the last note that was there was, I asked the client to do something three weeks ago and there's no update. Does it matter, do we want to know that they've even gotten into a body shop and a repair we do? Because like in my area, so I got the wreck because the lady just ran it to me, sorry Jesus, it took six weeks, my car was in the shop for six weeks. And I wasn't even being neglected, I live in a small town, I was a dude from high school, you
00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
who's giving any text messages and updates.
00:45:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We just don't have enough people to get the jobs done quickly and efficiently. So if we spend three weeks waiting, I'm going wait for Patrick for a minute.
00:45:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I haven't met Mary yet.
00:45:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sorry.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
haven't never met Mary yet. Anyway, okay, so. Or is that okay so if it takes like I was saying from. my car took six weeks for them to get done in the body shop. If we're waiting three weeks for them just to even make that phone call and choose a shop, you know, three weeks there, then six weeks, like we can't wrap this case up. That's a big bottleneck. So we want to at least every week be trying to make sure, hey, did you remember to call that and get between drivability? They maybe hesitant to get that done, but you are held to metrics and stats, right? Sweet law doesn't get paid until the case gets closed. It is on you to get the case closed. So to me, there's no reason if something is in the hands of someone else, for you to not be nudging it ever week going, can we move this along? Obviously not with that tone. Like, hey, just want to do. Remind you can't remove this a lot. You know, that's what's really happening. Anyway, so this is what I would like you guys to be doing and you can deputize people on your team. You can use your resources, but at the end of the day, do not do not abdicate this. So it's your job to make sure it's getting done. If you want to assign somebody to check on it and make sure that everything is being touched, do that, but then you come in and you do an audit. So you you check, you know, maybe 20% of your cases and make sure that everything that you look at is falling under the expectations that you have set, which is nobody is not getting responded to within a month. So if you know they're in treatment, there is nothing else that can be accomplished other than them completing treatment. We're just checking them once a month just so that they know we haven't forgotten them. We want to make sure everything's okay. Anything else, if we're waiting for anybody to be doing anything, we're not doing it whether it's the clients or the insurance company or whatever to make sure that that's getting done no less than once a week. Which means like because Lorenz you had gotten to a thorough file review but it took you about three weeks to get through all of your files. What I'm telling you that is that if you this process alone and you should have enough understanding of the base off of the improvement that you got when you changed your file review process. If you go through everything at the bottom once a week, not necessarily quite as thoroughly as you have been doing right with all the team but just looking at it and making sure that the movement is happening, I pretty much guarantee you that your days to close is going to decrease. Significantly and fairly quickly meaning if we go look at it weeks like a month from now There should be a few days shaved off of Maybe it's not quite that fast. I don't know because you are still impacted by other people's timing outside of your team And you can only manage your team But for sure, there's going to be an improvement so that's what I would like you guys both to do and I just want to keep having these conversations as you come back and say What did you notice like what is the frequency? How many cases did you come across and I would love you to take a little note so that we can look at how it is now and Then maybe look at it 90 days from now and go Okay, I'm coming across a lot less that weren't actually getting touched and it seems like things are going faster I'd also be very interested to know and I would love for you guys to kind of note this too Does there seem to be any type of feeling change in your team? And in their experience with Pete as they turn into somebody who's not just, okay, I've got a case to close, but a person who now nudges, and nudges a gentle work, right? It's not a push and shove and coerce. It's a, you know, you think of nudging, nudging is kind of a close, intimate thing. Like I could shove somebody, I don't like, I don't have to get, like that contact is different. You nudge somebody, you don't, you don't nudge somebody you don't like, you like, or don't know, generally. You're nudging somebody you know a little bit, you're close to like, hey, just want to get you going where you got to go, right?
00:50:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes, no. You're alive, I love you. I'm just trying to picture in my head how, because I'm a, I can nudge, but sometimes I'm not that gentle, so I'm trying to.
00:50:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you to? you even know? I know you, I understand that. So, it takes practice. I mean, I got Portuguese, I got African, I got all kinds of angry people in me that like to drink alcohol and fight, and I'm a Virgo, and I'm a firstborn girl. They'd soccer for 11 years, coached it for five years. I'm telling you, I understand these things. But, you can learn how, and it really is a great thing to learn how to do, to nudge. So, the way to do it is to know what matters to the person you're trying to nudge. What is their value? And that's the conversation we've had, right? Their value is, I want to be done with this. I don't want to hurt anymore. You can't control that, that you can help them, make sure they get a provider, and they are getting taken care of, and that their insurance policy is covering it. So, you can help with that. And, they want to get, make sure that the payment comes through, so that stuff is taken care of. They don't have to worry about the financial burden and they probably don't want to spend any of their time doing this, which means as soon as the case gets closer, sooner they can stop thinking about it. So rather than it being about, we need to get this done and I want you to get this done, it's just a reminder. I know you want this case done, of course they do, right, even if they didn't tell you. I know you don't want to be dealing with this. I know you've got better things to do and I know that you want to make sure that you get as much help as you can and that's what your insurance is for, right? So I'm here for that. So the best way to make this happen is to keep it going and keep the momentum as much as we can. So here's what I need you to do. Now, that feels like a lot of words. There's a reason I talk as much as I do. Well, there's a couple of them, number one, I'm just that way. But too, is that I've actually learns and it's one of the reasons I talk fast because nobody wants to hear all of it, but they need to. I can, I know what people need to hear and so I make sure they hear it quickly in and out. This is what you need to know to do the thing that you need to do. You will understand it like if you think about it, the majority of our conversation is why you should do what you need to do. This much of it is here's what you need to do and this much of it is how you need to do what you do. Most of it is spent on why you need to do what you need to do and the reason is if people are not bought into that recommendation, right? They don't do it. You're not, they're hand holding you're they're watching them. They're not going to do it. Even if they called you because they've got this case to solve in the first place. For example, how many people know that in order to feel better, they need to eat better and they need to exercise. Everybody knows that, right? How many people want to feel better? Everybody, probably. How many people do the thing that they could do right there in their own house to feel better? Make that much, maybe? That's my point. So you got to remember that you're talking to people who know what they need to do and probably aren't going to do it in a timely manner. On your team, the clients, the insurance companies, and that is in your way of your goals all the time. What you want to show them is how it's in the way of their own goals. Also, does that make sense? So, first you increase their awareness. You continue to keep them aware nudges and then you just support them and encourage them and direct them and small little steps. Okay. This is this is your one job. Go call the auto body shop. I'll check in with you next week. By the way, that's another thing that you can do set an expectation. I'm going to check in with you next week. Guess what you just did. I don't want to talk to this dude again. I better get it done. There are a lot of people who are just trained because the institutions of school and work create us to be this way that if somebody tells us to do something and they telling us that they're going to check up on us, I'm going to do the thing. That is most people. Most people are the institutional people. So you can tap into that knowledge and that psychology by setting the expectation. to know here's what we're going to do. I need you to buy in right? This is you want to get this case done. Okay, so now you're accountable to me and to you because I'm going to follow up with you next week. And now I've implied that I'm going to spend more time on you making sure that this is getting done and thanks to I guess the institution. We expect them to comply into the job. So there's a benefit to understanding a little bit about psychology and and using it to your benefit. Now it does increase I don't think it actually increases the workload. I'll tell you why. I think that when you realize that, okay, so there's there's different types of work that we have to do, right? There's mental work, there's energetic work, there's physical work. Um, and all of those are loads on us. So let's say I talk talk to a really terrible person for two minutes, physically, time-wise, that's not a heavy load. Energetically, that could mess me up for the whole day, right? Now, let's say I talk to a really nice person, but they yap my ear off for an hour. That's a lot of time that has an impact energetically as well, because at some point I'm going, I'm not able to get to the rest of my work. A really nice person still impacted me in a negative way, because I didn't manage the time well, and you know what I mean? So there's all kinds of different ways that this can happen. So what you want to do is look at all the potential friction points and bottlenecks that can keep you from getting to your goal and understand how to prevent them by a particular type of handling or massaging in this situation. So one of them is frequent touches, which means, for example, let's say I don't talk to somebody for six weeks and the place that I left them was they're supposed to get a hold of the body shop. Well, six weeks later I found out they've called three or six different body shops in town. Nobody can get to them for like six months and really what they needed to hear was making an appointment anyway because now you're six weeks down the road and you're still six weeks further. You're 12 weeks away from getting it done because you didn't get the job done because you were annoyed by the fact that you have to wait longer than you want to wait and all they needed was somebody to remind them like it's futile just do the thing. Like have you ever just been in a situation where you needed somebody to tell you it's not going to get better just do it? I do. I know it. I know there are things that I just know and I just want it to be a different way because it's so stupid and then somebody's like just do it because you can't process. This is leadership, you know, it's it's stewardship, it's understanding the nuance of everything in the job, including the psychology, like the mental processes of your clients, of your team, potentially even of the insurance companies that you're dealing with, although those people are just like brick wall sometimes brick wall robots are like, this is our proudest thing. This is what we have to do. I'm not annoyed by people. But sometimes you can crack a hole and those like hard people. You can just talk in the depth, guess how I know that. Yeah, okay, still the runs. Did I? I want to share this with you because I'm going to make it you do this. Hi. Share, share, share, um, with, and, and, okay, so what I want you to do around, and I'm gonna, yes, and hold on, share anyway, let me show my screen, do, I know we're over time, sorry. Okay, so what I would like you to do is kind of format your data into something like what I did over here. This wasn't what Patrick did, this is what I set up, and I think Patrick, I gave you an assignment, but I didn't share this with you, so you couldn't have accomplished it, which is see if you can fill this section out, phases and time estimated to complete. Now, a range, this is gonna be a range of time, obviously, right, um, there, there's not gonna be a set. This should definitely be done in this amount of time, but, but give us a range to the best of ability and Lorenz, I want you to so I'm thinking that you Should really have similar stuff.
01:02:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
You do not need to change your language, but ultimately we want to have kind of Patricks Yeah, if that works for you, you totally can I mean I It seems like it would save a lot of time. I can just edit As I see fit, but I can just use Patrick as a base and change the names and Yeah, so you can um, I'm gonna make this pad right Seems like it's pretty similar to what I came up with So I'm gonna do this.
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it does seem very similar. I'm gonna Don't don't whoa. What the heck that is not how that works It's so weird, you know what, if I go like this, let's try that one more time. If you go crazy on me, okay, so we'll call this Lorenz. And then that out, you can, we're gonna take this off, you can go look at a reference. I would like this info on your team too. And then, so both of you, so Patrick, fill out these things the best that you can feel free to collaborate with each other. will do that anyway as we work together. And then, let's see, if there is, let's see, if there's an action to be performed, the case should be the client, I guess, will be contacted less. that once a week, okay? Thoughts, comments, concerns? Annoyances, completes?
01:04:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, Lorenzo, if there's like extra stuff that you added, try and keep it in because I also want to see, or maybe I could just look at what you said there.
01:04:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, and notice you have more, you're more detailed on the case opening stuff. I might have added more items like...
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what Lorenzo had, information gathering, get RA, get signed RA intake, attorney intro, like there are some more nuance to what you shared.
01:04:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
I'll be doing a treatment of that too.
01:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and you guys can work on that together, we can do that on our next call. So next... next week as a you and me Lorenz case that time. Or if you guys do you guys want it to be both of you every week?
01:05:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
I don't mind. If the Patrick's cool with that.
01:05:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
don't mind either. I don't know if you have a certain like if you were supposed to do certain normal ones, but I don't.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a boss and I can do whatever I want to get in trouble with the market. Have we met? I look like the subservient tied to you? I got into this business so I could be the boss all the time. Okay. Anyway, no. I mean it's whatever works best and I feel like so I wasn't sure I felt like someone one time might be better, but actually I feel like there's there's enough similarities and I think we probably have more productive calls with the two of you together. But I want to leave room if there was, I wanted to, and I don't think that there is any need for it, leave room in case there was anything that was maybe of a sensitive nature on the team, or you didn't want to talk about it in front of anybody else, but it doesn't seem like there's any of that, you guys are both pretty open, your teams, you know, you can talk about them a little bit, and the individual. It's not like we're talking very personally or anything, so that shouldn't be an issue, but I wanted to make sure that there was space in case that did work better, but I do think that we would have the best conversations if we did it all together every time.
01:06:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think so too.
01:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's slightly, it's one more call a month for you guys, and if there's a need to reschedule, we can do that.
01:06:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's nice to be able to have like the same time every week as much as possible, but some things, sometimes something will come up, so just there might be, so Two weeks, my wife and I is anniversary is this weekend, but we have a soccer tournament. So it's not happening. So in two weeks, I'm going to try to take her camping and it might fall on Tuesday.
01:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So if that's the case, then Patrick will just have to deal with me by himself, or we can reschedule. We can do either one, depending on how much time that you're gone.
01:07:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
01:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So sorry, Patrick, but all right, you guys, I will let you go. I feel like I feel like it's going good. I do know how this organizational stuff ends up and it generally just it creates a level of peace and certainty because things are so structured. You just know what you're doing. You know why you're doing it. Your team knows what they're doing. They know why that they're doing it. And so what we're doing is removing a lot of the mental. friction. And that is what can create a lot of drag throughout the day. And over time, it's like, okay, I'll give you this analogy, then we'll go. Do you remember what it was like when you first learned how to drive?
01:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember like being at an intersection for the first time and you're trying to process all this stuff about your blinker and the light and do they go or do you go put gas and like break and like all of the, and especially if you're driving stick, that's a whole another amount of calculations that you're putting in there. learned a mistake. So you have to mentally process every single thing that happens simultaneously. And if you're wrong, you die. No pressure. But eat and listen to the music and have a conversation. And then I'm not stressed out and driving is peaceful. Like, when did that happen? I don't know when that happened. But somewhere along the line, this thing that I have to process and just almost shut me down every time turned into something I enjoy in a super easy. That's what this does. We take the complicated things and turn it into a process that we practice over and over again to where you just show up and you do it. not only is it easy, but you're good at it. You're not one of those drivers that's running people off the road. You're one of those ones that's like, I see you crazy person. I'm going to give you a little bit more space, so we're not going to have a wreck. I don't carry out my merry little way. So that's what this does. That's how it kind of brings the pieces that you just get super clear on what needs to happen, and why it needs to happen. you can make multiple kind of difficult decisions without really thinking. about it because you understand the nuance of all of it and how to anticipate and how to react instantaneously. Make sense? Yeah. All right. Y'all need to calm down. Just lay off the caffeine, the coke, whatever it is that you're doing. That's keeping you so hyper. Just chill out. Have a good day.
01:10:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
crazy.
