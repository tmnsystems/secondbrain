00:00:40 - Chona Sweet

Hi, you need to get a ton of brand new Mac.
00:03:06 - mark sweet
Oh, thank you. Yeah, no, she needs like a Windows that everything runs on Apple that nothing else runs on and just creates more problems and headaches that nothing else. I'm going to hear these things because she's her own business.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you can give your wife some awesome technology as a man, not her partner business.
00:03:26 - mark sweet
Go to your goods to cause it and show her the orange boxes of doom.
00:03:31 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, no.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the orange boxes of doom? need to know now.
00:03:41 - mark sweet
Choose. Her mess stuff.
00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it's better. Well, she took them to get on the call with me that you're paying for because her computer was too ghetto.
00:03:55 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So.
00:03:57 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, she can make decisions about how she wants. to spend her friends in different ways.
00:04:02 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
He doesn't like Apple.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
He doesn't like MacBooks. I like Apple. I have an iPhone. I just don't like them for computers where everything else is Windows based and it makes everything turn.
00:04:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Hi.
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not worth spending the time arguing on, so I probably have an extra laptop somewhere in her office that could magically end up in her hands, but it's not an Apple. It's as long as it's fast. I just care if it's fast and it should have solid state drive and like all the RAM and VRAM and everything else. Huh?
00:04:35 - mark sweet
That's fine.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you Mark. Thank you very much. I love you.
00:04:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
like you. The doctor, Dr. Rickwood, said he will get me one. I think he already ordered and that's Windows that could be faster.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just at the very least, like if it takes a while to do meaning, then it's inefficient and that's not that that time is no.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I agree.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It compounds and it costs too much to wait on technology that's inefficient. So you were, let's just do this because you sent me that message and I've got your notes about I kind of bullet pointed them with question.
00:05:17 - mark sweet
You guys want to talk together for a few minutes? Well, I just finished up one more quick thing that I do have to do. Okay, why don't you guys talk for a moment and then I will be back by in 10 minutes.
00:05:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:05:27 - mark sweet
Sorry.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fine because that's what I was saying we could do anyway. So, Okay, so the meeting I probably will ask a little bit more questions about but the insecurities, let me mute my phone about the male dominated nature of the meetings in the field.
00:05:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
mean Yeah, that one is that day I just feel less than and
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one thing I would say, being a woman in a man's world, that is not the same as doctors. I said, medicine is the oldest and women just weren't even allowed, even consider a woman. It's too delicate, can't handle it, it's its own kind of thing and that is a long indoctrination period that's generational because a lot of doctors have doctors in their family. They're talking Ivy League and indoctrination where, you know, like it's a culture intentionally. So one of the best things that you can do is really listen in the beginning, even if you have good ideas and pay a close attention. So if you're meeting with the same kind of people often, you want to study them, no. who they are, know what their strengths are, know what their weaknesses are, know what their blind thoughts are, and formulate what you have to say before you say it, not reactive, which I'm sure that you're good at doing, but be strategic about it. I don't know how well you'll be able to be heard in something like that. But if the first few times you wait to say something that nobody has bothered to bring up or acknowledged, and you can say it clearly, succinctly, and in the realm of, okay, here is a problem, here's a solution, or here's a problem, and here's what it's costing us and why we need to have a solution, that type of like if you you'll be respected faster and waiting until you can do that will help. So are you going to be in a situation where you're dealing with the same doctor frequently?
00:08:10 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the other thing is having so are there women around at all or just a few of them or none?
00:08:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So I guess in those two specifics and I that I said one is when I was with Dr. E and we go to the three hospitals that I have to go. We're in the doctor's lounge because we got food. We're in the doctor's lounge and I'm the only female there. Okay. became like like if I can like shrink myself I have that feeling like Dr. E though no he's a good person, he always include me like, hey guys, this is my new nurse practitioner, this is Chona, like introduce me and then I said hi. So, what is your body language and your eye contact when you're in that meeting? I guess, well, there's the two settings. The first one is on the doctor's lounge, so it's more relaxed, we're eating. So we're, there's just everyone is in different tables. I think, I know I was able to like hide my feelings of, you know, feeling little, but during the Zoom meeting, I don't have my camera on, but for some reason, I feel more, you know, less than in that particular space because they're talking, all of the panels are male doctors. and lawyers, and there's no women that speak up during that Zoom, and in general, I've attended a couple of them, and there's maybe two or three out of 50 people, so there's, you know, not a lie. But I guess, like you said, I think there's a lot of it being new. Like you said, there's a lot of people.
00:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what's wrong?
00:10:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
As soon as I feel more comfortable and in all aspects, like the main job right now is the one that I'm just, you know, to get the routine. The second and third, I don't know if you remember, like the main job, then the second of the PI and the third is Washington. That's probably going to be a while. I hope not. The second one, I have a new patient today and I was nervous, I think there's some frustrations in a way that I don't have a lot of control on putting the patient to the list, putting the patient on the appointment list. Even that I don't have that capacity and so I have to, there's multiple point people that I have to talk to and that's what frustrates me a little bit. I feel like it's inefficient, I feel there's too many hands and if that's what term but I had my first patient actually, actually it's marks that I am, that referred to us.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, so I'm excited about that one, so there's something to think about is what you can do, like what are some of the things that you could do in order to feel more confident and strong? And I think and I don't know if you would be able to do this and maybe you can do it in breaks and later, but just write down some of the things that you notice. I'm gonna give you a lot of things actually to tell you and these are about mental fortification and strength. Also, do you like reading books at all?
00:12:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do read books now on my phone, but I'm still old school. I like to read not I'm locing on fiction, but that's good.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you like psychology books or the book or persuade
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Psychology is always. I think it's everyone's favorite.
00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not.
00:13:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Some people are stupid. I love it.
00:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do too.
00:13:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do too.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'll give you a list of some books to check out. And if you don't enjoy them, then don't read them. Okay.
00:13:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, all your books would be good too.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you'll like this. So, and I'll tell you why I'm going to recommend them. But they have to do. I think they'll be very useful for you in the dynamic that you're in. Okay. There's a power dynamic always in play. And there's two values out of reading these particular books. that is number one. Know that there are people who are consciously employing these tactics so that you can be aware and observe them with the people around you and know who to write clearly. There's a lot of times as women we have intuition. which we can't validate and we can explain how we feel to some people but they'll be like yeah but whatever so but then if you go read the toxic she'll go they did this this this and this therefore this is who they are and what they're doing right and then it's really hard for people to refute you when you're like this is the problem right so like if you want to tell mark or if if there's somebody else that you're working with you can you can be very specific other than i i feel this way you can say i observe this habit this habit this habit that is um like part and parcel with this type of behavior whatever you know what i mean so you might laugh at the titles and i don't know if mark here's that but um one is called the art of war i think i've heard that before but i haven't read okay um the other one is 48 laws of power okay why robert green who's a psychologist i think And I think it's also 48 laws of human nature. And then he wrote a book called Pre-Swasion, which I think would be good. they cover a lot of similar topics, from different angles and different anecdotes. So the art of war is short. And it's very, the language is more like ancient philosophers. It's by Sun Tzu, an ancient Asian philosopher. But 48 laws of power actually breaks it down a lot and gives a lot of anecdotes and stories and how these tactics were used historically. The reason I think that it's so powerful is because when you start to see the behavior, you're like, oh, I noticed this person does this, and that person does this. And it just increases. So you have a background in psychology, but when you apply this psychology towards a professional dynamic, and you don't have just a professional dynamic, it's a specific dynamic of doctors. Doctors are for the average user unimpeachable, what they say goes for most people, and even if the person disagrees, they will capitulate. That is a powerful dynamic, and it's not questioned or softened, so that's what you're up against as just the foundation of starting. So for sure, there should be a warm-up period where you strategically just staying relatively quiet. Not playing small. I want you to take up space. I want you to lean in. want you to look with your eyes. I want you to make a comment. Like, you know, if something makes sense, you know, I want you to use a big girl voice and project a little bit, but not, you know, trying to be a man, not trying to be masculine, not trying to be hard, just in, in Chona's natural power, like whenever, so think about what you sound like when you are convicted and you feel like you're in a space where you can say exactly how you feel about anything. What does that volume look like? What does that body language look like? What does that stance look like? That is, I want you to be conscious of using that there, but only when you're confident that you know what you're talking about and that you have something valuable to say because this sooner that you make a strong, solid, you know, impression, that the better your opportunity to influence change will be. Speaking of influence change, influencing There's one more book that I would love you to read that hasn't it doesn't have nothing to do with psychology, but it's called switch by chip and then Heath and I can give you a list of these and write them down later and The subject about it is how to make change stick when change is hard and something like that but it It It talks about I don't know basically looking for what are the angles that you have? To use to get the change that you see that needs to be made to that needs to happen and How do you look for? you can leverage right so let's say you want to make a change and the first objection is We don't do it that way. It costs much money. It takes much time I'd have to hire I'd have to train. It's difficult. It's depending the blood mark love blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just swinging. We can't see if he's there, because he's not on video. Anyway. But that's the pushback that you get. So what you do is you basically anticipate proactively all of the objections that you might get, and before they even get a chance to object, you address them. So let's come up with an example of something that's today.
00:19:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
day. Yeah. So that example is with this new patient that Mark says, Oh, I have a being patient. And so he said, you know, he says, you know, you can call the patient at this time. So he set me up to talk to the chiropractor, which is very helpful. And you know, we just discussed a little bit of what he did to the patient so far. And then I hold the team, email them, I said, I need this patient, if you can please add this patient to the list as a telehealth, and as a lean patient, telehealth, under Dr. E. So, in the response, well, I said at a time clock, I didn't write a time frame on when I need the patient to be added. And by the time I need to call the patient, said, can you please add the patient? And then the response was usually with lean patients, we need to see them first in the office. But the thing is with this type of patient, we need to get them when we get them. So, I have to do what I have to do. Dr. does telehealth as a new patient. I guess the pushback was, this is not how we do things. Basically, that's what she's saying. So, I, my response was, it's okay, I spoke with Dr. E about it, but that was, that was my excuse, but yeah, I should have had a better answer and not always anchor in Dr. E as the reasoning or the final say.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so yeah, now, what would be the logic and the reason why it would make more sense to do telehealth?
00:21:29 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it's more of, I guess more, I guess the reasoning would be to get them in our system as soon as we can, because some of these patients are hard to, well, I don't know, I just heard it from our, but some of them are hard to talk to, you have to, you know, so it's just a matter of, like, time we need to get them when we can get them, right?
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that you might say is say, well, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, would you want to choose telehealth, and then you'd be quiet and let them answer. if they try to circumvent the question, the question was, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, which by the way, this is the option and you tell them, you know, confidently, would we just not see them at all? Is that what I'm hearing?
00:22:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And I just want to make sure I understand. Right. And fortunately, the patient is a little bit of a, you know, special that's the term that marks use and she's okay, but finally, she agreed for some reason she agreed to come tomorrow to the office. So then I have to send an email again, can you put them tomorrow on the list? So I I sound redundant. I asked them to add today and then add tomorrow, you know, but to me, I got all 99% of my information that I need, and I just need the patient just wants a lot of hand-holding of the explanation, so it's actually good that she's coming to the office tomorrow, but I feel okay. Sorry, I just need to be okay, not conforming to their system right away, or I don't know if that's the term I'm trying to see.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, there's a few different ways you can look at it. Do you need this job? Are you going to be just fine if you didn't have it?
00:23:54 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, especially the extra, I guess this is the second part of the business, I guess. being one, which is what I wanted to make sure that we are good.
00:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A big part of this power dynamic that people are able to have is that they feel like most people need a job and so they will tolerate certain types of behavior because if you don't, you're gone or you're not life miserable. And if you know inside your heart, we're like, I'm either going to do it my way or I'm not going to do it at all because you don't have to have this job. And it is not the only opportunity for you and Mark to do an arrangement like this.
00:24:37 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
They're like something.
00:24:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you believe abundantly that there's going to be a place where you can fit without playing small or holding back, that will come out energetically. So, now I have been called a and all kinds of things many times, but I don't use this energy to plow over anybody. I do it because. My best interest is the company's best interest.
00:25:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
want to see everybody win.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to be clear. want to be frank and I need you to know you don't get to plow for me. So either I'm valued and I'm valuable and I'm wanted right because I'm not here just for paycheck. have things to do that are important to me. I care about this company. I care about these patients. If you don't value that. If what you want is a robot, I'm not your person. I am autonomous. I think I have things to value now. Do you have to conform to the system sometimes because the system makes sense? Makes the most sense is leveraged. Fine. Show me how it's leveraged. Show me how it makes the most sense so that I can buy into it and support it and get behind it. If you can't show me how this system makes the most sense and I have a suggestion that is good for the company. company and good for the patient and then I need to know I'm where that's going to be heard. You can't, I wouldn't say you just dive right in there immediately but I would say that you at least try to have that type of conversation because if you come in and play robot and then try to be autonomous that's not going to work very well. Right. So if you have a question, present the question. Now if you have a follow up question or follow up argument then you might think strategically okay is this the time for it or do I kind of progress through the you know the the barriers right a little bit at a time but basically every time somebody pushes back on me I'm just going to say okay but at least once this right you know so that they're aware that you're thinking about the process you're thinking about the value you're thinking about the system and It matters to you. Does that make sense?
00:27:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Yes. So Tuesday, I spoke with the manager by myself because I wanted to learn how their process works because Dr. E, you know, he's not interested on the logistics of this. He just he just wants to make money. But at the same time, I know he's a good person. He's a good doctor, but he doesn't want to, you know, diminution of like small things. he went, so he basically just dropped me off to the to the manager of the office and say, you know, you guys figured it out.
00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if his priority is making the most money though, and let's say, let's say that getting the patient in the sickness is the fastest way to the money, right?
00:27:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That's why he he agreed because I asked him right away. He said, I have this patient, I get them and get them in. But then, you know, that's why he sent the email. Because he's in the OR today, so he sends the email to the people, the key people, and says, you know, moving forward, China will be included in all PI cases, know, CC her, this and that. And then, you know, I respond to that email, I have a new patient coming in, this is the info, please add it to the list for telehealth today. So that's how I said it, but I know they have a system that, you know, obviously I'm new and I'm still learning their system is something either I will have to conform and maybe adjust based on how I think will be more efficient for us.
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is a hospital, right?
00:28:52 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So it's a medical group. So this is clinic. So it's private, yes, which Dr. E Owens and he has. of a, okay, I have a, he have a manager, but he's just all over the place. I cannot rely him to just do the, I will have to drive this, because he's just nice and he spread himself to thin. He's just, I won't, I just won't have, he's gonna rely on me, basically.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So doctor, I just want to make sure I understand the dynamic theory.
00:29:26 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Doctor E owns this medical clinic, medical, he's the one right, just him.
00:29:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He owes it.
00:29:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And so, okay.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he hired you.
00:29:35 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And we did that agreement with Mark and I.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what is the scope of your stewardship? And let's let me break it down that way. Let's start that. What would you say is that you know clearly is the scope of your stewardship. What does he expect out you rather than just taking care of patients because you have a slightly different type of arrangement?
00:30:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So he wants me to basically wear different hats. Yeah. That's why the first two out of the three is with him with his medical group. So the first one, like I said, is the main main job, seeing patients in the hospital and clinic and calling patients is telehealth. That's the main job. And I get paid per patient on that one. Now provided he gave me a doctorate that's all great. So he's very generous on that one. The second part where the lean personal injury cases is where Mark kind of negotiated with me through him and with him with Dr. E that I get half, I get the percent of every patient seen. each visit. So let's say if it's a 500, each visit, I get 250. And every procedure that that patient does, epidurals, or any procedure at all, I get 20% because it's a patient or it's a client that comes from our sources, our meaning marketing, like our sources. But he has his own as well. He has his own personal injury cases as well, but he wants me to basically take over that as well. So, so he wants to urge that, but separate, merge, separate.
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask some questions though, because then my brain gets kind of stuck on logistics and then I can't really process anything else because I just like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? so who pushed back and said, you, you have to see patients in person first.
00:32:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What was the role of that person. So he he's one of basically second to the manager.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:06 - mark sweet
So like Cheryl.
00:32:08 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, that is the one who says because I didn't text Cheryl because it's still early. I know she hasn't gone to the office, but I should have texted Cheryl.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, your channel command is a little interesting. That's what I want to hear about.
00:32:26 - mark sweet
So the easiest way to make an analogy is Dr. E is me and Cheryl is married.
00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:32:35 - mark sweet
That's the easiest way.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but who did you talk to that told you no?
00:32:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She didn't. She didn't really said no.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kind of like who tried to say no.

Reminder that, hey, you know, typically we see the patient in the clinic. She's led. The her name is led. So who's second to Mary Han? Is that Michelle? Yeah. so you know I think maybe again because I'm that person who tried to not bother people that much that's not your job it was nine o'clock ten o'clock and I know that Cheryl the manager doesn't really come then till one because she's a afternoon late type of person she works till 12 one to you know she's a she's that person so I try to be I guess consider let me let me just clarify mm-hmm you can either be the person that Dr. E wants to run things efficiently and make the money or you can be the person that doesn't bother people you can't be right and I email them at 10 a.m. say I have an incoming patient please schedule the telehealth under Dr. E so telehealth there's no specific time needed as long as it's on the list, I can click on it and chart on it. They can schedule at 3 a.m. doesn't matter. But comes 12 o'clock two hours later, it's still not added. And the call is scheduled at 12.30. So I just wanted to ask, can you add the patient? Because I don't know how to, it's on the back end. It's on their end to add the patient on the list. So that's the time when I text because I know she's there in the office already. So that's why that's the whole dynamic on that part. next time, I'll just text Cheryl right away.
00:34:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So something that would be really helpful for me is to be able to see kind of an org chart. Mark, maybe you can help with this. So I can understand what the hierarchy is and roles and responsibilities in relationship to and I will be able to understand your dynamic much faster.
00:34:59 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. It's really I mean, I talked her multiple times. She is approachable and not really at the same time. I don't know if it's just me feeling inept and, you know, not confident yet because I don't know the whole situation. I don't know the process that they have. still learning all through it, so it's possible that that's, you know, but I sent an email. I sent an email. I have that communication, but I guess, you know, email is not as urgent as text or call, so.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that would be the other thing too, is just learning the chain of command and also the pace. You need things done and learning what gets you, what results, then just kind of observing what are the bottlenecks. if you need something done and it takes x amount of time, then maybe it only takes x amount of time If this person doesn't, and maybe it takes this amount of time, if this person does it, all the details about how things operate, how things operate individually by specific people, as well as by task. So if you have the most money-making opportunity, as well as the ability to feel confident in your own skin and in your role, the more you understand about the organization, even if you're not responsible for managing it, the more that you understand it, the more you will understand how you can, again, even if you're not technically responsible for it, you can have influence over it to make it go a better way for you.
00:36:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. I just know that Tuesday night, when I talk to Cheryl, the manager who wants to be on the loop for everything, you know, medical to the practice, which of course, she's a manager. And she's very clear that she told me she doesn't want to take another project, which is aka me, because she has a contract that's coming, they have a contract that's coming. There's 300,000 patients rolling in soon.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:37:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So she's overwhelmed with that. And they don't have the manpower to like deal with that. And that's up in the air. I mean, it's not up in the air. It's just it's like an upcoming storm that they have to, you know, ready themselves, ready ourselves, because I will have to see those patients too. But then when he talked to Marc, she talked to Marc, I was there for a while. Marc, her tone change, because you know, Marc is very good in talking to people. And you know, Marc is, how can I help you? How can I make it better? You know, I'll float this.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think this is a woman that doesn't like working with other women because there are plenty of those.
00:38:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not sure. I think it's just a power issue that she wants to be in, know, wants to be on the loop. What do you think, hun?
00:38:12 - mark sweet
I don't know. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is their structure doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah. pulling in different directions. It's a very, very classic visionary and integrator situation where it's visionary. Listen to me, know, listen to me. This is how we actually do it. And frustration that obviously boils over between the two, just somewhat naturally, if you use the word naturally, but you know what I mean. so the issue for Chona is she's got to kind of navigate a tight rope. Sorry, not tight line. Tight rope between these two different people who are pulling her in different directions, partially because her, the CEO doesn't deal with anything financial. So she really doesn't have any visibility in terms of payroll or who's getting paid what or what happens. That's all Dr. E, which makes all this even more confusing because we're just trying to suppose to go to. she's trying to serve two masters at the same time without taking any one off. My advice would just be have a group chat with both E and Cheryl, that way everyone's on the same page and sees the exact same thing, so there's no issue or problem, or E, Cheryl and Cass or whatever it is while we're getting to figure this out, because I can promise you whatever they're doing now is not going be what you're going to be doing in six months. Because there is no structure, and so he's looking at us to come in and help those structure put processes in place, but we can't just go and do that rough shot because Cheryl is really upset. So we have to involve her in the process, slowly make the tweaks so she can see how much better everything is. E starts seeing some money come through, so he's happy and then the process evolves.
00:39:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
But I just remember when we talked to her.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that we're not doing it right now and then now here comes a patient today so I don't know if she's not happy about that you know this this is a thing like I think like I like oh my god and she's probably not happy with this but it's only one patient so it's fine it'll be okay the biggest issue and this is always been my experience and I know Tina will talk about this when an integrator doesn't feel like they're involved and they're on the outside that's when they get really upset so this goes back to I'm gonna I'm gonna take this here Jonah because the fastest path path to liaising between those two roles when you're not even that is structure understanding the structure so I get that you don't have all the numbers but what you're going to want to do and mark you help figure out how we can do this as best as possible and it's probably conversation with Cheryl and with Dr. E and my Maybe with you. I don't know how how this dynamic works. This is you, but hold on, but so Somebody needs to frame and and chona you're new to this. So if this is not necessarily I'm saying do this right away. Okay, I'm talking about this will be the game plan and it will be understanding as much as you can about the system and how it operates what is fluid and what is friction. What that does in terms of revenue, right? Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the bottlenecks in terms of getting something accomplished in a timely manner and having consistent patients coming in and revenue and then also how is this stopping all of these things. if you are going to come in and make the most value, you would have to understand everything about the organization. That's going to take time, especially if you're not in a position where anybody would expect you to ask those questions and even when you're expected to ask those questions, in case in point somebody I'm talking to on the other side, the sign right here is they don't always want to have give you the information or they don't have it or don't know where to go get it or it's a pain. But to make the most change with the least amount of friction and problems with the least amount of disruption to the current piece, you're gonna want to understand the ins and outs of everything and everyone as best as you can. So whatever you can do to understand that asking questions, taking notes and then bringing it back here, bringing it back to Mark hopefully with the three of us, then we'll start to get some insight into, okay so for example when I'm working with people, the first thing I want to do is make their lives easier. So you would want to not just make Dr. E's life easier, that's but you were hired for it, but you want to make Cheryl's life easier and you need to understand what bothers her, what stresses her out from a position of, that's my goal, Cheryl, how can I serve you?
00:43:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
what can I do to help you?
00:43:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. then when she gives you a little bit of information, if you have formulated a follow up question, ask the follow up question. And if she's not approachable, then just say, Hey, is there a time when I can ask you some questions?
00:43:28 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
just really want to understand this because knowing that you run all of this, I feel like the best way for me to support him is to support you.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that would be sincere. That would be the truth that that's that's her role in dynamic. And eventually, if you do it really well, and she doesn't feel threatened or anything by that, then you can have number one, a good ally that is just enjoyable to work with, but to actually getting good results. Right. you're new, there's a lot to navigate, but the fastest way to navigate it safely is to figure out the topography ASAP.
00:44:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right, so that's why I've been spending, because I know she's an afternoon night person, I would spend some time doing four hours with her, just talking, we talk about a lot of things, we talk about our dog, we talk about like, I'm trying to understand, you I wanted to understand her as a person, and I wanted to understand. It marked, you know, he talked to you too, and right? Yeah, and she helped with something. She asked me, because I asked questions, and I wanted to learn, and that's what I did the other the past couple of times, I've been seeing hers, like I wanted to understand not just the lean part, but the main job part, where in, you know, I can, I'm sure I will have more questions. It's what I told her, but I'm kind of like cementing that relationship between the two of us, because she is going to be that person, guys.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So if you capture any of that in email or text, I would love you to share that here so I can help you. But maybe if she's open to it, if you're having a conversation, say, do you mind if I just record this so I can go take some notes on it later? You probably.
00:45:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Probably know.
00:45:36 - mark sweet
Knowing how she is, she probably won't respond well to that.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, And she's super paranoid about all of this stuff. Yeah.
00:45:45 - mark sweet
What they do like is a lot of Medicare and grievances and all sorts of other things. Okay. So I totally get what you're saying, because you just don't want to have to try to remember things and write it down later.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you take notes while you're talking?
00:45:58 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Right. I can already.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to take notes on what she told me about specifically on the number two, the lean patients that do. the thing you want to keep in mind is that as you're learning everything, your ability to manage and remember it all perfectly is probably not going to be great. When you capture it, then we can start to kind of categorize the data and formulate what you want to do with it, but being able to see it visually, taking it out of your brain first of all makes it accessible to us. Right. That we can help you. But second of all, it helps you sift through instead of having to, wait, what did she say about this? That's mental effort. That's exhausting when you add that to a 10 hour day, nine hour day, whatever is on top of that. Now you're trying to go be strategic after hours. The more that you write down and organize that data, the less your brain has to work. You've already got a lot. to do. So you want to manage your mental resources and your energy resources. So getting copious notes or at least very well organized main thoughts, you know, captured.
00:47:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So yeah, I mean, I can tell you what she told me based on the what they do because I asked her what did they come in from different sources, right? They have a big one, which is the now, Dr. Gannal Manau Gannam, but it's a big chiropractor group that brings them patients. So the moment it comes in, they create an email chain between cast, share deal, Dr. E, they put the patient's name there and the birthday. And then they will say this is a new referral from this attorney's office, and these are the medical records, please, you know, schedule the patient. And once the patient is seen, by that time, hopefully, we had the MRI because we're supposed to be this specialist. So they should have gone through the conservative therapy of chiropractic treatment and or physical therapy. So they have an MRI. So by the time we see them, they said that that's the decision-making of let's do an epidural or not. We can recommend a procedure, however, we can't do it right away until we okay it with the lawyers. So what they do is they email the law firm. So this is the other steps, like email the law firm telling, attaching the notes, which Mark said it's a no-no, but anyways, I'm telling you how they do it. And then they will respond either the lawyer, the case manager of the case, will respond says go ahead. you can do the the drill. So once that's done and they schedule the patient for an epidural or for any procedure, which emailing notes like that is not HIPAA compliant, right? Right, that's how they do it.
00:49:16 - mark sweet
It's not HIPAA compliant, it's discoverable in litigation, so it looks at the lawyers driving the care, so there's a lot of things that are right.
00:49:24 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is I'm telling you like what they do and how they do it.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was just okay, that's good to know.
00:49:30 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is how they do it right now.
00:49:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that does though is it speaks to priorities and it also speaks to business understanding and just overall health of it and so that's what I'm curious about is we do it because we do it because this is how we do it. We do it because it's easier and faster to do it that way.
00:49:56 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, I need to do it that way, but yeah, you're paper trail, which Mark talked to them. That's not, you know, that's not, that's how it should not be done.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, so that's how they do it.
00:50:09 - mark sweet
Sorry, can we just talk about this just a teeny teeny bit more. So part of the issue that they have and why they want paper trail is some of the loaders they work with are not great to put it mildly. so Bill, the loaders say, yeah, do it, do it, do it, whatever that is, whether it's injections or surgery or what have you, but there's not enough money to get that done. And then at the end, they will say, well, no, we didn't mean that we don't have enough money in this way. In Cheryl's eyes, hey, we have a paper chair, we said, do it. This is your problem. You better cut your feed to make sure I'm paid because you said do it. So I understand why she wants to say it's not like she's just trying to be lazy or problematic. Like there's a very valid reason for it.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, is it solvable by having a secure portal? It's just that email cannot be secure. So it's not the communication itself that is illegal or unethical, right?
00:51:12 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, this is the issue because if you're sending to the lawyer saying I need your authorization, that makes it look like the lawyer is trying care and that's why it's bad.
00:51:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, let me just understand this real quick. The lawyer is going to say yes in policy limits, right? Right. Okay, so can we not make this correct by talking to the insurance companies and knowing what the limits are or getting those those limits like having the lawyer send a report on here's what's available left like is what is the way can't do this because two reasons one the insurance company doesn't tell you.
00:52:01 - mark sweet
Two, if that was sent to the doctor's office, then it would look like the doctor's office is only treating based on insurance, not over what the patient actually needs. I understand these are all things with stupid distinctions because the reality is what happens is the doctor will just call our office and ask, hey, do I have authority to do this, that, or the other thing? because it's a telephone call, it's not discoverable.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:52:24 - mark sweet
Okay. So it's, it just is what it is. I, I, I'm just trying to understand it all, really.
00:52:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Question.
00:52:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's possible then that we can just have internally among us, like I spoke with, oh, that's discoverable too.
00:52:41 - mark sweet
Like I spoke. it's all discoverable to some level.
00:52:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, not see seeing the lawyer, not sending them anything, but whoever called that lawyer will have our own discussion, our own email chain saying this attorney, okay, to do this procedure for this.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
So when you get subpoenaed in litigation, they ask you for your entire medical record. If that is part of the medical record, you turn it over. So it's part of your medical records.
00:53:13 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Email is part of medical records, no.
00:53:19 - mark sweet
Email communications are part of your records.
00:53:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. not the records, yes. So I don't know then, how would we have a trail?
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you can do is you could, and I might be wrong, but I'm looking for this. if the process is called the attorney and get permission, then what you can have is some way of selecting or just saying we don't write this thing down until we have that conversation. So if we've written this down, that means we've already contacted the attorneys and they've approved it. And one thing could be, Dr. recommends X. I'm conferring with patient or whatever and really what that means is I'm calling the attorney to find out if that can happen Attorney said yes.
00:54:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So patient is scheduled so how is the documentation is being done now is that We recommend patient will benefit from this and this Injection costing we say approximation of the cost And you know how many treatments needed or and or if it fails, you know This other procedure can be done with quotation of the quotes and it marks that it's okay to put that on the medical records So like something that you could do is that you put that And then maybe there's an indicator that somebody acknowledge it and is working on it and it could just be as simple as Noted receive something like that that internally.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody knows that doesn't go there until you've reached out to the attorney If the attorney says yes, you can do it then the next notation is Scheduling um or recommendation accepted and then you schedule it. So the language is not decipherable by anybody that I called an attorney and got permission. You just know that that happened. There's no record of it. But internally you would have to know don't do this until that.
00:55:19 - mark sweet
Cheryl's concern and it's a valid concern is it's great we have a phone call.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the proof? Yeah yeah yeah.
00:55:26 - mark sweet
And that's going to be a problem. So they may decide that they would rather just run the risk of looking like idiots in litigation.
00:55:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's straight off. You have to pick a off. Yeah.
00:55:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Which what they've been doing in the practice they've been doing it for a while now. They actually have a lot of their own lean patients. This is how they've always done it. And now I'm learning through Dr. through Mark that this is not the right way to do it. Now I'm coming in trying to change the structure while Oh, not in the guys, but it's the truth is to make it more efficient and kind of offload that pressure from Cheryl as well. So that's where I'm coming in.
00:56:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah. So the questions that I would be asking are, what is the most expensive? So if you get litigated, somebody suges you because that's what happened. Number one, the company has insurance that can help with that. So what is the potential risk and what is the likelihood of that? Not that anybody knows that I'm for sure, but you could ballpark it.
00:56:34 - mark sweet
So it's not them getting sued so much. It's when you have a car accident case, right, between Mr. and Mr. Jones. And so Mr. Jones's attorney's only job is to make Mr. look like he's not really hurt that all this should have been resolved very quickly and chiropractic care would have resolved. And that Mr. Smith's attorneys are the ones who are driving this because Mr. Jones has a large. policy. He didn't really need these injections and surgery and everything else. And then so when defense counsel of Mr. has emails showing that Mr. doctor asked for the lawyers' permission to do a medical procedure, it falls into the defense's narrative of they didn't really need this. They're just doing this for the money. So my question is, but it's more difficult.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my question is, what is more detrimental to the business? Having attorneys not paid for something that they authorized, so this is frequency and amount, how much is that up to or the cost of litigation for such a scenario is that? Which one gets more expensive?
00:57:48 - mark sweet
My guess is going to be it's more expensive by not having a paper trail because the attorney is that he works with it.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then that's why. the systems in place and they're making an educated risk or at least a intentional, like, conscious risk. But- That's right. That's frustrating as that is. Yes, but I mean, but that's business, you have to make trade-offs. So, and if it's the nature of it, and that's what's more expensive to them, or potentially risky. So, will Chona bear any, could she bear any liability personally for any of that?
00:58:33 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, because everything's being signed by- Okay.
00:58:38 - mark sweet
So, it's not going to be tied to her per se unless there was some sort of investigation or the FBI came and raided it.
00:58:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's not compliant. We know it. doing it anyway. All right, so we'll move on past that topic, yeah?
00:58:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:58:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, probably- prep so it's late and I will have to find a quick wrapping up thing so I gotta take my daughter again this is in the beginning there's just a lot of discovery and figuring out I would love okay let me think about if I were gonna have you read one of those books first which one it would be the 48 laws of power okay um it's it's dense but I think once you start getting into it you'll see what I'm talking about about the application and the second one would be switch um but I do think that you would enjoy some of the other ones and I'll all write them down but we've got a lot going on so yeah maybe she right now is trying to figure out how to navigate some of these interpersonal issues that's why I'm recommending these two books have you read 48 laws of power mark yes please
01:00:07 - mark sweet
I'm sorry.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't hear anything you would say. Have you read the book 48 laws of power?
01:00:12 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. that's what I'm recommending that she read even though it's dense because understanding that dynamic and all the different people. I just think it's a good book overall. But I know what I was explaining to her is watching how you might notice some people applying particular types of tactics and be able to recognize and identify specific behaviors and mannerisms and know who you're dealing with a little bit better because you'll recognize those patterns anyway. Okay, as well as how to navigate it. But also just some insight into like what to pay attention to and kind of choose your strategy for how you want to insight change as well. as how you communicate your reasons and logic behind the change that you want to make. So it's all strategy but the on a personal note and just being able to enjoy the place that you work understanding people, understanding how to serve them while understanding their motives, understanding how you can help them accomplish their motives as long as they're good. you know and be of support of those around you and knowing that all of that enables you to serve two main missions which is helping the client, patient, get what they need but also having your own success, personal success in leadership but also monetarily so you can earn that money which allows you to do whatever other things that you want by your life. So it's um It's not a fast, simple thing. really have to be conscious, mentally. The more notes that you take, like I said with everything, just even thoughts that you might have.
01:02:11 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
you gave me that voice message today, and I transcribed it and put it in my notes so that I could save it for later.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that in the future because everything that you notice is probably useful and it just kind of helps you get your bearings. Like I said, topography. Once you understand where you're at and who you're dealing with, then you can understand how to navigate it better.
01:02:36 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
