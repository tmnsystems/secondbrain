00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just a little bit. He's probably going to be between six and eight pounds.
00:00:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, love it. Love it. When does the puppy arrive?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Between the 14th and the 16th, he's being flown over or driven over from South Dakota.
00:00:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are you going to name?
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His name was Hudson and we love it, so we're keeping it.
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's great.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My baby. You'll be sleeping with me, he will be in my arms all the time.
00:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been funny to get a picture of Hudson and Merlin beside each other.
00:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. He will be traveling with me. That's part of why I got such a small dog so he could travel easily.
00:00:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's funny minute. I were just talking about that the other day is like so limited because of him. But we don't, but we actually said, but I'd rather be at home on a Saturday evening, cuddled up with the dog on the couch than out at a dinner party. But anyway, that's cute.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm so excited. So Emma, she's my 17 year old, she'll be moving out soon and her dog Aphrodite is companion to our dog CODA. So Aphrodite will eventually go with Emma, but we have learned through experience dogs are much happier with companions. I didn't know that until I had a dog that had been alone and then got a companion and changed into a puppy all over again. And was so much more playful. Like I thought she was happy before. She was not even close to fully happy. And then when she died, CODA just was like an old man and then we got another dog and both of them hated the new dogs to begin with. But they played and they still, CODA is seven now and he still plays like he's a brand new puppy and he hops like a deer sometimes. So Aphrodite hasn't been altered so she could have puppies just at least one litter. we have been trying for years now. find a daddy and can't do that. So, oh hello Marlene, this is Vicky on. So I'm like well we will just we will just bring a new daddy home. So we will have a puppy for Koda and then Aphrodite can keep one of her babies if not more depending on what they can have and that's cute. They will have companions and we will have puppies and then I will have a dog that actually just belongs to me so when the girls are gone I still have companion.
00:02:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that would be hard if the girl is gone and the dog oh that would be really hard on your heart.
00:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and my heart is already just taken as much as it can bear so yeah yeah anyway yeah I wanted to have something to show today so I got to work also I just want to do this and have it done but this made me happy do you like this?
00:02:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just think you're cute but also I like I like the colors I think it looks professional I think catching personally, but I can change anything we don't like.
00:03:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like it. Um, wait, the gray, I mean, I like it at first glance, but then I just realized the gray there, did you want it to be more of that royal blue since we kind of carry that to the Gen X CEO brand?
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can.
00:03:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But you tell me what you think.
00:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think about that?
00:03:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's pretty cool, too.
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, I don't know which one I like. I can flip the gradient too, so that there's more blue than black. So let me, uh, see, I might be favoring the blue only because it carries into our other things.
00:03:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But the gray was cool too. I look like purple on my side, but, um,
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, let's change that blue a little bit then. That hurts my eyes.
00:04:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think the first version of the blue, which it was kind of blacky blue looked pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool versus the gray. I don't know we want to let's see if we can.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think what I could do is add in one more blue to make it just a little bit more of a peekaboo in there. You see that? But that does still kind of hurt my eyes.
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does it really? Okay. So, um, show me the gray again or maybe just duplicate it and have the gray underneath?
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we can do that. So actually here's what I'm gonna do. gonna and then for here, edit, um, actually over there, there, that one, better one or two. Um, and then there's also just, sorry, what if we made it just back? I know we were using the blue, but I was just thinking about that YouTube branding. Oops. Because what we could do is bring over the red, you know?
00:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's cute because it goes with my top.
00:05:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wearing a I know, right?
00:05:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's perfect. It's kind of cool. And the only reason why I thought like a lapis blues because that bracelet I'm wearing one is the white gemstone. I forget what it is, but the blue is lapis. Um, so matching that blue, even right there looks nice, but you said that hurts your eyes still. I don't want to hurt your eyes there so that doesn't it might have been just the brightness of the blue. Okay.
00:06:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So change the that and we'll duplicate that yeah I don't know what it is but that immediately oh I'm looking at it it's that contrast right there just like aches but nobody else is going to be staring at it no so oops I'm only thinking because the Gen X brand is going to have the blue right like the Gen X force the wait what do we call it Gen X
00:07:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yope.
00:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I forgot that. Yeah.
00:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Gem X CEO.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Really? don't feel like that was the right color. Which of these pixels should I grab?
00:07:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, uh, there. Yeah, that one's a little darker one.
00:07:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That makes it almost great. then, um, hold on. All right. One. Okay. Oh, okay. see here at it. And then I'm going add one more. There.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool. Like it. That's it. That's one.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, no, no, move this one up. Um, okay. So then, um, we can use that. we've got color and branding. These fonts are like that font. It was a default one in a template that I grabbed. Um, and then Roboto and Roboto is just nice and clean and easy to read. These on the eyes. I had it moved zoom out of my way. I hate when it won't move.
00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Whoa.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Oh, it made me stop sharing. Sorry.
00:08:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I still see it.
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you do?
00:08:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do not see it.
00:08:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Why? It's gonna turn the heat down.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on second. Okay. Let me. It's okay. see the dance. Oh, I somehow pinned myself for something. Why? The heck is happening? Okay. I'll stop share. Start share. What is going on? All right. We're back. I'm okay.
00:08:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
now can go to here.
00:08:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not it. I'm ship sites. Yes. Go away. So courses. And so the memberships, they have courses and they have communities. And so this is a product. YouTube fast track, which I'll go modify that and inside of it. We've got the intro and I'm going to click on preview. And I'll change all of that. How do you feel on? I made a favicon. They have all these slots to fill out. don't know if we like that. I thought that looks like fast.
00:09:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think that's fine. Yeah.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for doing all those little things. And then I can make this bigger and then what I'll let me see if I can. And I wonder if I can copy the style. Put that down here and. and paste? No. All right, how do I duplicate this? I wonder if I publish is a brand template and then can I use this as new page? Okay, so then I can change that to that. Well, and so then that could be our module title like things like that.
00:10:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and so we could
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Preview like you can see the little favicon at the top right here And we could change that to have the gradient behind it as well So that it's more branding We do anything there. So I just copied and pasted and it took it really well This is what I used for your picture.
00:11:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can change that What I love about it is that it's that's truck and your hair is blowing so it's almost like speed Yeah, that was taken in I think the new tall one of the closer to Vegas one of the is it Bryce? National Park. Yeah Gorgeous guys there.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So there's a little formatting anyway Yeah, there's there's some formatting issues I can fix but So I got everything in here. There's a an ability to mark us complete for them We are too or do I need to give you a section of the video from the recording there. Say that again, please.
00:12:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry, are the videos there as well or do I need to give you the section of the recording for the video?
00:12:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, I'm in the right one. Just videos like the links to the videos or?
00:12:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
the 60 minute start guide I think is great. That'll be like videos there because there's two videos already. just need the transcript video. But I mean the original master class that I recorded, oh, do you think like because actually when I was creating just earlier today the lessons for you and stuff, I realized oh, I have to take okay the first 20 minutes of the recording here or okay this part I have to re-record because we're not teaching VA sourcing stuff in the front end product.
00:12:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we could put we could put videos in Here, even if we embed them into the page, let's see. Oh, that's, I'm scrolling up here, add files. So not to file.
00:13:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Or a video right here, upload audio, or we could use embed code. OK. The other option I had is that it's the book, like you've created, and the three videos for the 16-week quick start. And then we give them the whole two-hour master class recording. That's the other option. But I was envisioning breaking that recording out, you know, into, like, say, you know, four or 20-minute recordings or something.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I like that. OK. So I started something and designed our also.
00:13:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Looks nice. Nice.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we've got multiple formats we can use. This was just my first version. I've never really used it before and there's some formatting issues Like you would think it wouldn't overwrite on its own header, but Whatever.
00:14:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I had some glitches using it too like overall.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool But yeah, it was kind of funny some little glitches Cuz like I don't know you can just drag it up, but then you have to drag everything up. So That would be really annoying And then like it didn't recognize emojis. So have to go fix all of that Yeah, anyway, I Would have to I would have to learn some things so we we could do it in PDF format But again the PDF format does make it easier just to steal a pirate pass around That I don't think it's a major issue I think most people have integrity and aren't gonna do that and I think that people that would steal are going to find ways around it or not Pay anyway
00:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. I'm not too bothered about the swiping and stealing because I still remember when I was at my heyday and doing a lot of W so's and stuff in the warrior form. lot of people ripped it off and on black hat sites, but some of those people that found me through there ended up becoming like a $3,000 high ticket client and stuff. So I kind of see it as publicity, that's free. Yeah, so I am a person who likes a PDF so I can scroll through and kind of read.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I and I I like multiple modalities because everybody does differently. So I like audios. I like them. Like if we had it on private YouTube, unlisted and private YouTube so that those that want to listen can just listen because most of the apps don't work really well. Sometimes they can be glitchy, but YouTube as long as have YouTube premium, you know, and their phone. lock and they can just keep going. So audio, visual, like audible video, and then this where they can print it out if they want to print it out. And then the membership side, if they just want to go like step by step through the modules.
00:16:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I know I like it. It's cool.
00:16:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm willing to do the duplication so that we have it available in every way that a person wants because there are so many different brain types. I think that adds to retention.
00:16:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it reduces refunds for a little bit of extra effort.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what do you think about how it's going so far? If you could give me a list of things that you want to see or improve, then I can go through and complete it. And then the next step, the next part of the conversation would be let's choose some page templates for sales pages. things like that for the actual like sales, check out all of that process.
00:17:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Yeah, so I've got, yeah, I like how all that looks. I've got a Google Doc, I started with some of the lessons like based on the two hour thing, you know, do you want to show it to you and see if there's the two together?
00:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:17:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. volume down. Yeah, so, so yeah, it's funny because without looking at PDF, like in just what I prepared in Canva, right? Like all this stuff. I then kind of try to see how can I melt the two? obviously there's a welcome writer intro and then module one set in the stage fundamentals. And And this was all covered in the presentation, right? Except for this one, because most everybody said they had YouTube channel, so that's why I didn't teach that in the live master class. But I should at least have that. And that would be easy to do, because also I can show me creating the Gen X CEO YouTube channel, right? Because we're going to do it. Yeah, OK. So I just have to be recording this video. And then I thought there'd be a section, like if I'm going in there, call just worksheets and templates. So I thought I'd kind of like it, usually, to be separate. Because I did have a lot of people, yeah, a lot of people asking me, are the templates again?
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are the again? I'm like, yes.
00:18:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Page 12 of the presentation. But that clearly was not a good way to deliver it. And I love that. Yeah. And then module 2. model these best practices that I went into. your YouTube description, high converting thumbnails, sneaky pin post to boost engagement, and then module three or phase three. Well, really, that's phase one, isn't it? Find your golden video research and planning. I'm also wondering if this could just be called setting the stage. Yeah, and then this really then becomes module one or phase one that then matches matches the 60 minute quick start, right? Find your golden research and planning, because then and then we have module four, which was, um, go back in here.
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're just in templates, we're talking about making them a separate section, so they're super easy to find, right? Yes. Okay, we're sure.
00:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So we had the three phases here was find your golden video, create your framework set up for success. Okay, um, so that's the case. Let's, let's marry it. Phase to create frameworks after success. We say set up a post, but anyway, then then it marries it well because they can have the PDF in their hot little hands, or they can go to the training specifically for phase one, two and three of the 60 minute quick start. Yeah, which is because then then it's good so so this then becomes. So all of this stuff really actually cut this will end up going. probably somewhere under here and in the phase three, I'll double. So, I'm going to back here. Open the Google Sheet. Okay. then this would go up under here. Great framework, score it and then solve for this size. So, distracting because I have the big bay window there, so when people
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a lot but I see it. Yeah.
00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Appute tools, simply according to this, you can't approach this. Upper tools, we're going publically. Yeah, I think we just, uh, and some of these, I actually already made a high permitting thumbnails because in the, under the, here, the gold, this is really the golden ticket, the spreadsheet here, but here, and that can be down, but it is a, and before and put onto YouTube, but here's the crate thumbnail, so I have a video on how to create a thumbnail here.
00:22:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And this, I didn't go into a lot, but you know, editing, I probably should have that there and that would be something I have to record, or I'm, I'm just cool because I can do this once more morning for recording, I like to record mornings, not the evenings to description. I'll pull to YouTube and don't forget to tap on the whole lot of shows. I'm not sure how to, I don't want to create a phase four upload your video, but technically it kind of is because I like the threes, you know, the, the, the, yes, and it's a whole process uploading the video, like if you've never done it, or, you know what I mean? Like there, it is a process in and of itself, so maybe less than four and I don't want to make a one hour bill, so I like to break it out. upload your video, YouTube using, upload to YouTube using done for your template bundle. I don't know if that becomes less than four, high converting, you know what,
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, because it's a huge part of why this is some works.
00:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. you don't want them to overlook it.
00:25:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So like, not a lesson.
00:25:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because then you can talk about the psychology for why it converts and why it matters. And it doesn't have to be wrong, but you need to drive home. important that thumbnail is split testing thumbnails, like all kinds of things.
00:25:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So do we want this then as like, is this highlighted enough? Or do we want this also maybe as a bonus? Maybe this is high covered thumbnails and just my video on how to create the thumbnails. But maybe we have a bonus secrets to high converting thumbnails. it stands out because it won't stand out unless it's at a high level. You know what I mean?
00:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um,
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, secrets through by converting thumbnails are secrets to optimizing thumbnails, right?
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Something like that. So what if the first one is choosing your thumbnail? This is Secrets to High Converting Thumbnails.
00:26:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The bonus you mean is Secrets to High Converting?
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and the lesson could be choosing the right thumbnail. So there's a quality difference. The right one versus High Converting or Maximize Converting, I don't know, something like that. Like, something that attracts viewers. Thumbnails.attract, but that one, I think she should be choosing her thumbnail.
00:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't want, if you're going to make a bonus, the bonus needs to be the, like, super, like, sounding name. Okay. You know what I mean? And that one should just be, here's the instruction for thumbnails.
00:27:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. Because, yeah, the video I have kind of walks through that because, like, by using, like, this cool tool here, right, when you enter a YouTube video, like, I'll just hit submit on what the last YouTube video is on. Oh, that's funny. Well, maybe this was the standard they have. me choose a different YouTube video. Actually. Mmm. That just looks kind of rare. Just do this, dude. Copy. Right here. Yeah, so that particular video, I kind of show them, okay, you really just model off of this. I don't think that's a good thumbnail, actually, but, you know, whatever. But typically, you'd have some words on it and stuff. say try to model something, and that's what I actually show modeling it. Whereas the optimizing, the bonus, I think, is super powerful, because like I even did this the recently. It's actually kind of cool, Tina. I just posted one couple hours ago. I had a much longer time to post, but I realized it's going to take me an hour to record it, because I'm doing a real educational video. So, after investing probably four hours of doing yesterday, I'm like, oh, going to record tomorrow morning, and this one, I just put up because I needed to get my consistency up. anyway, let me, this one here now has one. 2005-35 views, but the original thumbnail that I put, which I modeled off of some of else's, actually did not have, it only got to maybe 300 views. And the minute I changed it to this thumbnail, it made all the difference in the world. And you know how I knew about it, and this is what I can teach in the bonus, is I went to vidIQ, because I ended up getting it's like only 10 bucks a month, and I didn't teach at the math class, because I wanted to teach more free tools, but I think there are some tools people should get if they're serious about it, and it's not. Yeah, the advantage is this. Yeah, so if you go to Optimize here, so it gives you the title score, my telescope is about 80. Now some of them I don't optimize, because my viral one, it actually only gives it a score of like 50 or something, or no, no, 50, 80 or something. Oh, 82, thumbnail 76, yeah, this is the viral one. So I'm like, But anyway, but this one wasn't doing as well. So when I clicked on it, it actually gives you some of the feedback on my thumbnail. If I click here, it said it wasn't, so this is, this now says your thumbnail is off to kind of start with a great topic match and emotional triggers. The other one said, because I wasn't smiling as much in the other one, that I did use. And so actually it said, it's not really showing a lot of emotions in this thumbnail. You could improve it. So it was like an A, the score was, I don't think their score is quite on, because I think the score was 80 as well. But the minute I changed that, it really helped see, because it says great emotional triggers, whereas before the video didn't have as much emotional triggers, seeing the improvement facial figures, so features. I did, because everything's cheap here in starting where I live, I did book a photography session December 12th, just to get a few pictures more. It was supposed be facial because even though I could take some good ones or a man who could take some good ones with the iPhone and all that jazz, but it's still sometimes good to have do it, you know? Yeah. um, yeah. So it was like 300 bucks. asked, yes, 400 Canadian for her to do a photo ship, which is really good. So I'm like 800 and bigger cities.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, so, so I thought that was kind of cool. And, and the other thing, I mean, I'm going off topic, but it's just incredible stuff like it'll, like if you click thumbnails, quick landage video without uploading it, it'll create a thumbnail. I haven't used that yet, but, but I noticed the, I use it for the outliers.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I use it for because it saves time at three to one ratio, but it also gives you ideas. I would love to see what it creates as a thumbnail real quick.
00:31:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Let's see. Choose video. So I'm going to just, oh, I'll just wait a couple of sudden. Um, uh, start with video. Couldn't, or. Describe the sounds for your crate. Choose video sounds good.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said you can give it a URL also.
00:32:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, did it?
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:32:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I want to thank the best well works. I know the one for imposter syndrome. I need to change the title because that one is sucking. That's not loud. Might take a minute. Oh, yeah, that that video is going to change the title and the thing analyzing video. That's cool.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A subject line for that could be how imposter syndrome is keeping from being rich or something like that, because it's the money thing that really grabs people. Like if you look at the headlines that are winning, they had dollar signs on them.
00:32:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, when I went to ideas and then I'm now saving ideas, because I just found the section of the IQ yesterday. It gave this as a very high the truth about imposter syndrome and their entrepreneurship.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The truth is a big one That's yeah, so I was thinking of changing it to that and I would I wouldn't see what it thinks about The one I just said I could just add a curiosity. Oh, what do you say again? I said how I'm How imposter syndrome is keeping you from being rich Or keeping you from wealth or whatever I Or is costing you thousands Yeah, we can split or even a fortune.
00:33:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, like that What what is this it's a I It's belted what's it supposed to You
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, um, yeah, but it's kind of cool, but it's got some weird stuff on it. Yeah.
00:34:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change text to overcoming impostor syndrome. No. Place red top with yellow dress. Oh my god. Um, I can't. Oh, there we go. Feel like a fraud. A bunch of them, compliments unlocked, unleash your potential.
00:34:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's kind of cool.
00:34:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. I wonder how it works. these are the old school YouTube that used to work and now they're saying more realistic, um, pictures of you work better, but it is kind of interesting.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can say, um, I have seen that, um, so, um, big title, divided line colors, and a picture of a face with the emotion of the thing. I've seen those on the top performing, like when I go to YouTube and search for videos, the winners have that more often than not.
00:36:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, I bought her a course a while ago, Molly Kaiser, so I kind of modeled little bit off of hers as well. I was going to look for the other one. Here it is. So here's the three things to find impostor sims. we could, I'm possibly costing you thousand, could change that, and then kind of your, your idea, go like this. Is that YouTube? I don't know. I think I know what you were talking about, because I used to use it. means something like that. Like the person on half the side.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Go. Well, let's see, you know, who does really well too is Matt Wolf. There, that, that one was good. That guy that had a megaphone.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I used to use those. didn't perform as well for me.
00:37:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he's changed what he's been doing.
00:37:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's doing all AI ones coming.
00:37:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, he's been doing. So Matt, man, I met him in traffic and conversions with Joe Fier, like, yeah, 2012. They gave me a ride to the airport. It was my second Uber. My first one was with Rich Shuffering's like right-hand lady, Linda Ingstetter or whatever. Anyway, but him and Joe did all kinds of different things and they vacillated and didn't really, know, they'd have ups and downs of business, but the downs were really, really bad. And then when AI last year took off, he just started making videos about it. And his YouTube channel blew up. He had like nothing. And then he would get like a thousand new subscribers a day telling about AI. Like you could, yeah, just the, he posted it on his Facebook talking about the growth of it as it happened last year and it was nuts watching it.
00:38:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You could also watch the dark circles on his eyes getting deeper and deeper. So, yeah, see, like these ones are, she has more reality style.
00:38:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:38:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but he also does really good job with like just AI covers and gets a ton of views with them. That was one of the things he thought was how to make your AI avatar with the different expressions. But you'll notice that they do have the expression that matches What you're talking about, even huge news is there's not any really particular, but it's like, hmm, like cool.
00:39:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are we looking at? Yeah, yeah, One month ago.
00:39:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't think that's a great title, but if you're, if you follow as YouTube channel makes good, but I don't think it's an optimized. Done now about huge news.
00:39:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, look, he's talking about Opus. Hopefully you use Opus, eh?
00:39:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Opus Pro?
00:39:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Well, if we come back to... Oh, funny, asked it to remove this yellow text, but it didn't.
00:39:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wonder how good chat GPT or even mid-journey could do in dumb nails. I haven't used mid-journey in forever because chat GPT was doing better.
00:40:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah they do have different styles. Yeah I can play around with it. Um I do kind of like um like some of the competitors are digital marketing so there's Molly Kaiser and then oh wait how come the other time Myers he's just blowing up his channel he's fairly new how kind of ties isn't there I noticed too so something like that in there so there's a dollar amount but then there's like logos of the things that we're talking about so like we're talking about Canva we're talking about chat GPT like they put the logos of the things they're they're talking about like if you were talking about vidIQ you could put the vidIQ logo in the thumbnail um and in the title instead of just like the secret tool you could do both right so yeah searching for vidIQ would also see your video yep but people
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
who are just wanting to get a secret tool they didn't know about, could come in that way.
00:41:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I do model her, so the ones that do well, do have some of them, how do you have the PDF or Canva or chat should be T signs in there?
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure we have some time to go over the things that I need to be building stuff. I will pause on putting the course together until you've finished your outline because that structure I will duplicate in the membership area and then in the PDF.
00:41:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so it's no longer module one, she's called setting the stage, just to confirm, set in the stage and we got module and then we got phase one, finding the video, phase two, create your framework, phase three, set up for success, I'll flush out the lessons. I just wanted to get your opinion on, we'll have that bonus, this one, I have this for my video ads, easy, make Of course, it's actually really good secrets to lift light and pose and it's stuff that I learned a lot Well, I'll just show you and I can edit out.
00:42:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does that mean?
00:42:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Seagor to lift light and pose. Okay, so I Basically a lot of people don't know to lift when they speak have good lighting and See how you're posing like if you're like this really laid back, you know, doesn't look like you have confidence, right? So poses like what's your confidence and stuff? And I kind of learned that from all the photography courses Really used to take and then he did a British film documentary one week boot camp in South France and the guy who taught it Was talking a lot about this so like and so this part has colors and clothes what they say lighting tips and tricks So I don't if we want to clue that as a bonus, but we can call it maybe something else if you want Secrets to camera confidence or but and everyone loved this I actually taught Oh, I know
00:43:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It could be like elements of a successful video, unknown or secret elements to successful videos or high performing videos or high engaging videos, I don't know, something like that.
00:43:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's nothing in here to make them engage than I'm teaching, but if they're watching, well, yes, light and oppose incompetence and energy definitely impact engagement. If somebody is boring and monotonous, people too know. yeah, so the best way I teach this part about this was from League of Blonde. That's his old video though, so I don't know if we want to use it or not. This is all about lip, white, and pose. want you to have that and bring on your head. Lip, light, and pose. What the heck is that? OK. So what that really is, lip, light, and pose is I can't say better than the face moving with the wreath. Don't sit right now on the street. OK, this is from the movie, The Bleak Lawn. This is a great visit to the town, And the movie, this is on the tube that took from it. And it's from Ben-Nagel, move it to the tube. And it's too. And we call it the Ben-Nagel, and I know it's excessive. It's not exactly what I mean by lip, white, pose. But I think if you always imagine this movie before you do your own video or selfie, this might help you a bit with steady constraints or conflicts. So I'm going to put it Let me split it up.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember this scene.
00:44:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I'm going show you a little bit of a megaton engineer. In my experience, it had a 90% success rate of getting a man's attention. And it's appropriately. had an 8 I don't expect you to bend down and pick up pencil and snap, you know, you're just out. Anyway, I do want you to remember that movie when you're doing a video, so you're like, lift, light, and hold, so basically you're lifting yourself up, right, right, checking the lighting around you, and then hold, was saying, you know, having to do one foot back, like right now, my right foot's back, and I'm left to the floor, you get to sit down in the bottom there. Oh, but that way, I'm looking right at camera, what's the mean is? And again, meaning not in your back foot, it's terrible, and then also, if someone were to come and push you, you can follow it. So, you just don't look solid, you don't want to look solid on your video, because why not, you know, when you're going do the new anyway, why not use all these tips to help you.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyways, do you have any stats of our videos that are, you know, that you can find examples that this isn't performing so well for a high performing creator. And here's one where they're posed differently and the video does better.
00:46:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't. I mean, I can look. So yeah, so I don't know if it's relevant or not. I just know that, you know, these are things people need be aware about. I'm aware of like clothes, with say like solid colors, all that kind of stuff, psychological colors. So, I mean, I can just take out this beginning because it's made easy. Anyways, um, you think that's more important to look at you, right? Because what if I teach this and it's not right? Because what if YouTube likes people lying on a couch talking?
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just want to know like what the current data is and also if there if we can, if we can give them data to back up.
00:47:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
the claim. Yeah, because the thing that I have loved from the beginning is how it's been data that has driven your system. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you're right. We only got 10 minutes left, right? Because you got to go to want to just talk about next steps.
00:47:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I will pause and putting the membership stuff together. But are you okay with the format of how this looks for people?
00:47:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's great.
00:47:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So then let me go back to this.
00:47:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean, tomorrow, right? You're still on. Yes.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me show my screen. And hold on. me just confirm that I have no conflicts tomorrow. I have tons going on, but no conflicts.
00:47:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:47:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tomorrow, I will have been a mother for 24 years and be my daughter's birthday.
00:48:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, nice.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It would be if I wasn't going through the things I'm moving through right now. What am I doing? Oh, yeah. Okay, so details customized afterwards. I don't know if this is title price action. No, no, no. Details advanced. Okay, products. So I don't know how Oh, that's kind of cool. So it's discoverable. That was the thing we were talking about in school. Being discoverable. I wonder how much it costs. Holy crap. Okay. So, um, marketing is probably not in there. You must slip it to your links. Okay, there is. YouTube Fast Rack, which is called this. And the cost is one time. What are we saying?
00:49:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a price text override.
00:49:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Put it in test, create. All right, begin access now. Don't want a specific date. Check it out to access coupons. Recognize dimension. So I've already got that. I think it was. That one. then get link. Okay.
00:50:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, such a new, you know, fight on go high level.
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I do have resources with Dan and Jason and Chendale. Oh, here we can add upsells. We'd have to create the products first. But so let me show you these things. So I have different folders. So and it has low ticket funnel. And I can. don't really love anybody's stuff. One of the things I was thinking about is maybe. Going to get some high level. Snapshots or like templates or whatever. I'm trying to preview. Button. Oh, here. So this is a template that we can use. Being very good. right now. Maybe just because it's loading. Anyway, lots of elements that we can use and then just get rid of also if we don't like them. Who is for? How is this different than other products? Is there a guarantee? you offer more in depth? So I do like that one actually. Let's see which other ones. Oh, there's Corrosius. His, I don't know, to the preview. You've already seen these though. So this is clean and simple. So all of these are here for us to use. What I can do is add you, but what I would rather do not that but like I would like to know like this it would be worth our while to go through and look at some things and just pick something and start to work with it yeah this is the guy I bought clients and community from hi ticket it's not I did buy this but I don't really I bought their community service real good so and this is a page I bought from a page like this but it was straight I like the dimensions of that yeah it's very clean but that's like just an opt-in right that's not a so really you can't get here unless you watch the youtube video first there's a video that promotes this particular thing okay um yeah and so at the end of the video it sends them to this link god okay So, Authority Amplifier, that's all your call.
00:54:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're gonna say it's like a book call. I like the style of that for book or call final, but yeah, I don't know when we would ever book a call.
00:54:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then and Samantha, let's see. Oh, step two is the sales page. You might meet a book or call. Yeah, that's the sales page.
00:54:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Very small sales page.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it works very, very, very well, though.
00:54:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, it is funny, like Maria went, do you ever follow her? She uses all these short forms. sales pages. She's doing about a million a month now. She has more of a catalog model, like lots of low ticket products that she sells. it is interesting. She literally will just have like sub headlines, testimonials, though of course bundle graphic, you know, of the course, and some bullet points and then buy it, you know, which, you know, my $3 funnel that I used in clip funnels, always seems to convert nice too, because super short and sweet.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there is, there's a lot of different types of things that convert. And I think it comes down to the most, the headline and the offer and the removal of friction. I think, and friction comes from things like too much stuff on the page, too many decisions to make conflicting information. So visually, they can look incredibly different as long as those psychological elements are present, it'll still convert. Ugly, simple, old, sales pages still convert really well.
00:56:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, God, yeah. I show you that longevity offer that Alan Sotanic showed me that's killing it in this so old-fashioned? Oh, shocked. Frank Hearn's stuff still, you know? I still like Frank Hearn's stuff, actually. I'm more model his stuff in the past. I liked... I think we end up being right making a combination of what we've seen, so it's just simplistic.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, maybe a combination of crushes and...
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, why? Because I'm in... don't know, I can't.
00:56:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Crushes and... I think I'm next. But you said Samantha's funnel does really well because all that was was like one row.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even think it was... marketing agency that makes millions and millions and millions and they use time and through tested things and they work really well. But, um, it showed me the Fishbowl funnel copy again.
00:57:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, Samantha's?
00:57:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:57:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because we don't want the book of call funnel. just want like, yeah. So they come to this page after they entered their name for freebie?
00:57:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, because this is the first page. I see it. Yeah. Rich. Oh, it's a contest. Okay. Because I was thinking I could easily create like a YouTube channel optimization for cheat cheat or something. If we ever wanted to do like a triple wire funnel or the first with a freebie and then the next page is the $27 one because sometimes that we're What's that?
00:57:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We hate spam. Your email is safe with
00:58:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's okay. So and then showing the sales page again. Wait, can I say special price 20 hours get this deal? This reminds me of cut ages ago. Everyone was talking about like daily deals. That's what reminds me of. Do you remember that the ages ago the daily deals on?
00:58:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:58:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's the video price. And then, you know, that is interesting. I would love to test something short and sweet like that because I'm darn good on video. So I could do a pretty short and sweet, nice video sales order, maybe even sneak peek. this is what it looks like on the inside of the membership. Now, just out of do you have time to open up dndt.com. And just click shop. And any of these, like automation sales, yeah, anything. She changed formats about a year ago to this, and she said it made a huge difference.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's making like a lot per year now. So it's just. This looks like an on support template on our page. But yeah, very simple, very clean.
00:59:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that was actually long. Some of the other ones go to the giant headlines. There's lots of color to divide it so that the guys don't get busy.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's pictures. There's huge testimonials. Yeah, sorry.
00:59:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
do you want to look at? Yeah, just go back to her, her website and look at. Yeah, and do automation sales unlocked. think that wasn't even shorter. She has great ads for that, by the way. That's it. Yeah, so she's assuming you've come here from somewhere. That's an ad. Yeah, she's running good ads to that.
01:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Probably her $27 ones are short and sweet too, I bet. Well, she's assuming you know we're from Instagram. Like most of her traffic is from Instagram. See, that's it.
01:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yes, these really clean, big fonts, easy to read no matter what device you're on, pictures, the claims, the color alteration.
01:00:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that.
01:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my favorite. We could model something like that. And I can look for a way to do that.
01:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I do have to go.
01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I will look for ways to kind of model this and see if I can find anything that we can just plug in play and kind of update or then see if I can. get somebody to make it for us. like almost no money basically.
01:01:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
01:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then you just finish putting everything together so I can get it housed in the way that we've outlined it because the way that you're putting it together to flow really well into the way the structure and organization I think will make a big difference in how people feel about it. Somebody at my door, oh I have to go and I will talk to you okay.
01:01:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wohoo. Bye bye.
