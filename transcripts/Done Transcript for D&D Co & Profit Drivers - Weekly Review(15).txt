Mm-hmm.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So... Hold on. Speaking of my brain. How is my brain? Okay. Actually, it probably really helps me to look at my notes and stay focused when my brain wants to go thing, thing, It's been a productive week, but the problem is I've got all those billions of things in my head. Oh, okay. So, just little by waiting on Stacey for some, actually, she probably sent me a reply in the hand.
00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I actually know. He... You're probably not on it, but he started talking to Mark. He needed Mark to do some stuff, so Mark and him are getting in touch with each of the vendors. So, I think Mark gave him a contact at every vendor, so that Josh could be like, hey, I needed to do it like this. As far as, like, sending... I think the state names or whatever you think that they'll all comply. Oh, yeah That'd be good. Um, I I I love that you feel Josh I love when Dan goes down rabbit holes and comes up with a like gold nugget dude that the guy sawed that I found to do the high-level stuff is I Love him because he just gets it done Andy makes it better like Josh I'd have referred to them. It's like JD funnels or whatever, but they were the dudes I hired to make The custom I bought their custom value updater, but then subsequently they built like The Spotify app and then they built they just built another thing that they released I got a test Tuesday meeting with them tomorrow. He's releasing another thing so I'm making All these customizations to high level with them. They're super cheap, super fast, and he always makes it better. Like this, I love these. They have a four or four page from the front is the code. Great idea. Noria is pretty good, like it works.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have five, oh, I don't know what trust index.io is. Nevermind, I thought that was a trust pilot. I was like, they have 24 or five star reviews on, but it's not trust pilot. So, dude, I don't wanna check that out. It's gonna go ahead a little. So, cause I'm thinking, you know, business 101, diversification, and just lots of different little things. Number one, because I get bored if I stay on the same thing all the time. But, So all things kind of feed each other as long as they're relative. Um, but I like having the agency, it's basically affiliate level stuff. But anyway, having, I want to have a smallish go high level kind of package offering that has the built kind of some basic automation, basic templates, things like that, that is just a side offering, like it's not the main thing. It's just a, cause the monthly fee is not that much. to break even, and if I had a regular amount of traffic coming in with people who are interested in business development topics, there's going to be a portion of those that will want that. So anyway, just thinking about it.
00:04:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it all depends on who you're talking about.
00:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. For sure. But since this is going to be my My baby basically, for a few years, because my babies are grown, I get a lot of exploring to do, and yeah, anyway, okay, so what features, oh, the report functions just down here, oh, that was Mark, Robert, I needed to leave myself good notes. Oh, okay, and high level, I was about like, does your, because we were talking, I should probably go to Fathom, so it didn't take good notes, and that's what my note taker is for, but about what mom needs, because we were asking, I was asking questions, and there was too many, I don't know.
00:05:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Stop it, oh my gosh.
00:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Please, yeah. which is the right one, that's not the right one, where's my Dan called? September 19th, and it seems like forever ago, and also too soon. Um, well, once you get your win, okay. This is not a very good summary, project update, center, retrospective. They have all these different summaries, and some of them are good. But some of them, none of them great, that's the bottom line. Anyway, um, these are the things that I wrote down. What features does Mark want? What functions do you want? And what are the most important things that need to happen for your artist? And I know it was talking, oh, circle. You were going into circle in membership groups. That's what the question was about.
00:06:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you decided to circle. I decided. on Circle for Mom, I don't know that I think it's too cost-prohibitive for solo artists at certain levels. But it's like, okay, we build ours on there. There is a lower tier, you know, $49 a month version. I don't know what the other dudes that I mentioned charged, but I mean, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood. Or they're getting a rip. Maybe they're getting they got to be charging something. The pricing's not on their site, of course. So it's like, let's be honest, someone has one or two songs out. The last thing they should be, this is my argument, to mark all the time. It's like, dude, we do not want to create jobs for these people. So if their job is releasing songs, not managing their community. So at some point, it might make sense based on the volume of fans to have a community and then to manage that community or pay someone to manage that community. But if you're just starting out, like, we need to figure out, like, hey, when you're this tier artist, if you're starting out and you're getting all their email addresses, you can start a community whenever you want, right? don't need to start it. Step one is build that asset of an email list, which is what they do with family. And then you could then coach them into, like, hey, when you get to this level, you might want to think about starting a community. And here's what looks like, go sign up for circle, potentially, right? Or maybe high levels is at a place where it will work for that. I actually got a response from the high level of devs about, like, customizing it. So, but it's not going to work. The reason it doesn't work for Mark is because you can't embed mp3s. And I'm like, which makes sense. It's like, what poor sky is really embedding an mp3? No. So, that that's sort of the key component of why it doesn't work at the moment. So it's like, okay, we'll either go get around to it, and then we'll just change the advice. Oh yeah, no, just use hours and then unless and until you just direct them towards circle. But again, I don't think we need determine who should have a community. Like Sean's band should have a community, right? On has 400,000 subscribers on Spotify. On gets, you know, millions of, he has over 60 million streams on Spotify, but Sean's also the cobbler's kid and has refused. So it's like, he's not doing all the things that are right in front of him. But his band and an example of one that probably should have a community, right? He's on tour. He's releasing singles consistently now. He hadn't been, but he's doing almost all the things right now, except for the fan flow he did.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we capture things here sometimes that I don't know how it I think I don't know that you remember it to take it back to anybody to turn it into a task like do you have a task for mom would there be a place to put the the highlights of these conversations where you're exploring some things kind of almost like bullet points that you might not otherwise like what are the criteria for who should have a community it doesn't have anything to do with following size releases like I've literally never said that before right so that's the thing is I like rather than it doesn't do me any good just to know how to keep it how do we what would be the best way to put this somewhere where it goes into additional conversations with them or yourself
00:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
the team to uh so first off that's fan flowy that would not be mom um this is fan flow yeah yeah so and then uh you could so you could send it to Stacy and be like hey this is this is for the Monday call okay right so we talked to him every Monday um so yeah that's probably the best case of it so she'd be like hey here's this thing he you know damn brought this up make sure to bring this up on the Monday call because he he'll forget which is 1000% true because mark and then come with the list and we come with nothing so now we're going to come with a bit of a list or maybe we have access to their list maybe maybe if she gets access to the list and we have us we centralized the list that they're using i don't even actually know oh they're doing They come with a list every week.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Of things to talk about?
00:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't know where that list lives. It's certainly not in teamwork. Even the mark made us set everything up on teamwork. And maybe it should be in teamwork.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that Stacey can help with the structure of that. But I don't think anybody will help you dig into it.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that's a question for Mark. It's not a question.
00:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But Stacey can ask it or remind you, whatever. So here's what I did was just said, like, I've got a fan flowy section. And then at Stacey, the above note. could you bring it up on the Monday call? So she brings up, how does Mark bring a list of stuff to talk about on the call? He has one, where does it live?
00:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Should we get that into teamwork? That's what I wrote. Yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she brought that up mission accomplished, right?
00:13:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You guys would figure it out from there? Yeah, and then we have to bring up the other bit that specific bit like, what is the criteria for someone? Maybe it's not for everyone. Right. shouldn't be teaching people that. Right. So it's like, just like we're not going to promote it as part of employee, because it doesn't live in pamphlets. So it's, although I don't think we were planning on promoting that.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and what I have there is what I read, which is need to determine who should have a community. Yeah. They aren't for everyone. How big should your following be? What are the other criteria releasing consistently? her question, Mark, like, anything else that you come up with, but that will spark that conversation so that you get some guardrails, basically. on what's being created, and some definition, and some structure.
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good to me.
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, and then... So, is there a community that... I was talking about what marked me, done what you need in terms of community. Is there a community that is joining between you two? Is it for mom?
00:14:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it something separate? Yeah, mom is the... Imagine that like, mom is like the umbrella, and it's like... So, fan flow is a service of mom. If we do this distribution thing, so there's this idea of doing distro flowy, that would be a service of mom, while we're flowy, service of mom. Just then it's like these flowies, right, exist over here. And then mom would also have potentially this idea of... well, not potentially. So then mom would also have like, hey, the book is from mom, it's not from time blowing. So this, it's the independent artist compass guide to, you know, navigating your musical success and like that. So the book is like the, the D lead magnet, right? That's like the Maria lead magnet for lack of better term. And then so I make my plan is to make the low ticket funnel with the book on the front end. And then the book has, it's, it's the book is promoting mom and fan flowy, right? In the actual text. But mom has the community. So we're giving away the checklist or we're giving away. So the book has like, she just did this. And it just made this number up. has like nine checklists or nine worksheets, summer checklist, so we're not so we'll come worksheets. It has nine worksheets in theory. Each one of those worksheets could be a lead magnet. I don't I don't think the L.R., but for sure, the royalties one that we've already used has worked, and then the release one that we've already used has worked, and then there are two others we could test or we don't need to, but they're integrated into the book, but they're also going to be these standalone lead magnets. What I did before was I ran ads to the thing, brought them into Lee Flowey into mom and Lee Flowey, and then I was distributing the thing via email from there, but as part of...
00:16:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you say lead flowey, when it's music related, it's always fan flowey.
00:16:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is that correct? No, it was Lee Flowey literally at the time. Now mom will be inside of fan flowey, but it was literally in lead flowey. There was no fan flowey.
00:16:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how long ago it was. did this last summer.
00:16:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was getting leads for under two box and I think what I did was they they it was a Facebook messenger at I think it was a messenger or a lead and I forget which to high level and then it maybe was a landing page somewhere in somewhere in there I don't know where it was exactly but I can look it up I asked them if they wanted to join the Facebook community and and I need to go back now just for my own nerdiness and be like what was the uptake rate on community so I actually don't remember but what we're seeing with these fans of this one dude is doing the community thing for this one band and the uptake rate on people joining the community is like over 50% which is interesting so here what I want to do is like deliver the thing through the community so it's be like oh okay here you know so in the Gary, get them in the high level and then according to my circle guy, I can zap over that to circle creating the common circle for them and then send them that be like, Hey, here's where you here's where you can go. know, you're in the community and that's where you get your thing. Or maybe they don't if they don't join the community I just send them the thing and then I try to enjoy the community one of the other. So the mom community is going to be comprised of in theory, musical artists, engineers, producers, music makers. Let's put that way. Thus make our music. So that community is like the shared community and then there will be courses in there potentially that we sell them into all that good stuff, but also from there. don't think I've talked to you about this, but ideally, I think the play is to like build a community and then try to do equity. crowd funding on top of it. We're like, okay, yeah, we're making our own music and now we're making our own label. And you can all be part owners of that. And then raise do equity crowd funding through like we funder or there's another one start engine. And there's rules, right? I think you can only raise like three million the first round, yada yada yada. But you're literally raising, raising, doing a capital raise through non-accredited investors, because it's this thing that came up during Trump. And some people are raised, gives millions of dollars doing it. But the trick is supposedly you build the community first. And then you tap into that community. So I'm like, okay, we have all the pieces to build the community. And then we just need to work out the model. think about some of the model that we know sort of the model is fan plowing, then the coaching would be on top of that. We don't have any date on that. And then this idea of buying catalogs, like I think I talked to you about that, Sean's catalog is for sale. You buy the catalog, and then the third bit would be to actually like sign an artist and do a rev share where you're getting a piece of royalties. then the final bit is this distribution, distribution revenue stream. So basically, if you, we wipe label this distribution service, and then we would tell our people that when you release a song, use Distroploid, when you get a rip of every song that gets released through your software. It's very tiny. But if you've got hundreds of thousands of songs getting released through it, it adds up. I've got to sort a map out. And I started doing a little bit yesterday, like map out how all the revenue was. He may be going to exist and then we start to fill in the blags like, okay, we're making this much on SaaS, we're making this much on Coaching and label services and we're making or this much on forces We're making this much on label services, which is like a done with you tier And then we're making this much as a label, which is done for you tier where you're potentially Putting money into the production of the song and therefore you're you're acting like a label Except our deal is not going to be a label deal. Like so With Sean, I did not understand this until he told me when Sean signed with AF AFM They get a hundred percent of his catalog. They own it And he gets no streaming revenue Why did he do that? That's how labels work. So what the benefit for them was that that they open up the door to them touring in Europe. So I don't think he's in a 360 deal. have to confirm this. But a 360 deal, if you don't know, means these are newer. A 360 deal means they get a piece of everything, streaming, merch, I don't think he's in a 360 deal. I think he's in more of a traditional deal. And that's like the catalog. merch and tour, they have no part of and they gave them money that he has to pay back, right? So and they're not that payback is not happening through his streaming revenue, right? So it's not like, hey, it's 50-50 and then we're taking 100% until you pay us back and then you get 50%. They have no percent. AFM owns the entire catalog. So they, did I not tell you this?
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:22:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They recently approached Sean and I don't know what to do. He tells, I still have to get them. But it sounds like the heads of the label that signed Lansdowne left, whether it was amicable or not. I don't know. The new people went to Lansdowne were basically like, we don't want you guys anymore. So we will sell your catalog back to you for $250,000 or something like that.
00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:23:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they don't have the money. So they came to me and said, do you want to buy Lansdowne? I was like, really? What does that look like? What it looks like? And I might be wrong about the $250. But it's in the neighborhood. What it looks like is currently Lansdowne makes between $8,000 and $10,000 a month on Spotify, which AFM takes all that. So I buy Lansdowne catalog. I get 100%. I instantly start getting paid $8,000 a month. But then obviously it would be here with me. like, you guys should really be using fan flow.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You guys should really be using all these tools, right? But I would instantly start making 10 grand a month, let's say, plus whatever increases they see, because now they are going to tour, they are, they're headlining a tour in Europe in the fall. And what they told me is like, oh, there's other bands that you could go by their whole catalog just like that. And then put them in the mom machine, help them put out new songs, help them, you know, harness what they've already got. And then you, you own all the streaming, or whatever deal, whatever the deal is. And Sean's scenario is all about it. So I was like, oh, that's interesting. Actually, so I just told someone about that. I just told Salco. And he was like, wait, what?
00:24:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right? He's like, that is, okay. I get some money.
00:24:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go with it. He's like, we need to know the exact numbers, but he's like, I'm going to run it. He's got this buddy who's like this baller lawyer. And he's like, get the details and I'll run it by Ryan. But he's like, dude, I'll throw money into that. Right? I was like, yeah, no. So, and then they had like two other bands that they know of that you could do it with. But there's tons of them. That's the thing, right? So when you look at them buying Elton John's catalog, this is just a smaller version of that. Right. But those guys are never going to go like try to grow Elton John.
00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would you?
00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. It's a proven asset that just does what it does. Here it's to a degree. It's a it's an asset that can be at least somewhat enhanced. And then the big question is like, you know, it's spotify number one in 10 years. I'd say no, but so you use like a five year window when you're when you're buying these things be like, hey, look, we're not Looking past five years. Yeah, they could they can still be number one. Well, could take it up. Like we don't know what's gonna happen. So this is the price based on that.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The to me, the ideal investment is something that's already making money regularly, but totally leveraged because once you leverage it, then it's just compounding, but with really little effort, especially if you have the system.
00:26:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's all digital.
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you don't have to do anything crazy.
00:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I was like, yeah, that is so big. Yeah. So it's like, okay, factor that into mom, right? That's a revenue stream with you acquiring acquiring and then leveraging, like you said, and then also just finding an artist that's happening right now, right? They don't have any of that, but then you think they have the potential to build the catalog. Especially if they follow all your systems, right?
00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we have this system, the continuous release strategy.
00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
which is like, hey, you know, you're releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks. Period. That's your job. You have to make the product. right.
00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's say that the artist didn't do anything and you just use a system to keep them top of mind and get new people to be aware of them. They don't create new content. Just new people discover the music, discover they like it. In three years, you'd get your money back. then after that, it's all profitable. But what we know about music is that when you like it, you like it. So yes, there's new things entering and getting into it. There's that competition. What would be interesting is, is what is the attrition rate of downloads and listens when you don't do anything to promote it? Like what got it there in the first place? What was there? Because if the machine of just you might like this song or the machine of just putting up the clips on social media so that new people are seeing it and discovering it, if that's all you had to do and inexpensively, right, to at least maintain the amount of downloads that happened, the streaming, listens, right, however they call it, then that model just over and over again, even here's what I love about it because normally like if you invest in a business, somebody still has to perform something, business still has to operate, you still have to get new customers but generally that means something that has to be fulfilled, nobody has to fulfill this, this is just a thing, like you have to do something in terms of the system but it's not somebody you can't it's you, it's your system, it's not, you know, it's mostly software for the most part, are automations and just checking the stats and making sure, you know, all the automations and the tech is working the way that it's supposed to. But it's not, because if the model is the success is dependent upon creators creating, writers, writers, singers, and those, you know, music artists, a lot of times, I mean, just created to be dramatic, life happens, they can't perform, they break up blah, blah, all these different things that create this volatility is absent in that model, like that's nuts.
00:29:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and that's why, like, that's why you would acquire 100%, right? with a new artist, they're going to make money, they're incentivized to keep making music, right? you have a, the split is totally different. And then maybe you're also getting paid back. But if you're, if that's done in the context of it's your engineers, it's your your mixing producers, it's your songwriters, you have them inside this machine and they're not, they don't have to go pay $5,000 to get a song made. You could get a song done really cheap, comparatively. They don't have to go pay to get the video done. You're talking to them, like I'm pugging to Jim about this, like Jim and I were going back for an email and I said, Hey, what's the version of like? So he had mapped out a course like to make your own video and I'm like, dude, they're not going to do it. I'm like, yeah, we can sell the course, sure. Some people will do it, most people won't finish the course. And I was like, what if, what if we just showed them how to make a shot list and then they do the shots and then they submit the videos just to be edited because they're not going to edit it, it's Facebook's. And yeah, so I was like, you could, so then it's like, hey, you get a music video and this is how you shoot it. Like you hear it, get your eyes on. But I waste to change the camera to these settings and storyboard out your thing and then go shoot those and send it to us and we'll edit it. And it's like, um, and then, but then that's for like the done with you artists, right? like, they're not there. You're just helping them. But then they're releasing the song through your platform. You're getting paid on their song because they went through your distribution platform. And so, yeah, it behooves you to help them get the song out, have it do well, but you don't believe enough in them or or it's maybe something you don't believe enough in them. You can't work with everyone. Right. So you have to let the cream rise to the top and then the cream you're going to go, Hey, we want to work with you. And then and then we're going to take over all the things that you're the social media and the data that right we're going to take away the jobs. And then for that, we get this and you get that and we're going to help you, you know, people. more consistent.
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what is the structure of like, how does Mark and Jim and Sean and everybody get paid? Like, mom is your company. What does this structure look like?
00:32:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I haven't even said it up yet. So, right now, we're just building fan flowy. I'm funding it, but I haven't really spent very much money at all. And then they're putting in this equity, right? They're building all the stuff with me. The bands that are on it right now, no one's paying a subscription yet, but they're also letting us break their , right? We've definitely screwed up a couple times. But you know what? can screw up when it's free. So, the plan is the stupid spotify app, which is not going to prove to know I'm hopefully in a reason that tomorrow I'm going to get some missing some good book. And I resubmit that. That's probably going to take another eight weeks. Not only knows if we're going to get approved. We have to wait.
00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was that my daughter wants in right as you said that's getting approved?
00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need the Spotify app to get approved. That's the missing piece of the MVP. Once that's approved, then we're going to start charging for bamplowy. So I was waiting for the book, which is now done.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is finally done? Yeah, it's done.
00:33:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're just writing about author parts. Mark's doing it right now. So the book's done. I'm mapping out all the checklists or worksheets right. I was working on that this morning. I'm going to send those to Greg and have him do one. I can't even do one. then he would look like I might have to do a cover for the book too. But it's mom. So it's going to the bands are paying them a done with you fee. I don't even know what it is, I don't even care, but they're like running the ads for them. And they're like giving them support, they have a Slack support group set up and whatever. So whatever bands are on there that are just paying them like a monthly retainer of some sort to get access to the software and then get access to them to run the ads. So like Johnny's putting up ads every day. But they, you know, it's a grind and it's like not scalable. So the scalable version is DIY and then that and then coaching. what I want to do with the book is like bring people in, show them that it works, put them on fan flowy and then they can, you know, send from there. Hey, want to come with you? you want to come whatever, get them in the community, blah, but the software is like primary. Employees like the real Year the main gear There is no financial partnership structure arrangement at all no those guys love that , and I'm like no We're not incorporating something that doesn't make any money Right, so the the deal is 50 50. I get half they get half That's the that's the deal. That's the understood deal That they brought to me.
00:35:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't care how they distribute their house, right?
00:35:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I mean I don't I think that to a degree that I don't think they really get it. I don't think Mark understands that like This can be everything that he thinks that he's ever wanted it has the it has I want to say potential, but I'm gonna say it As it has the all the pieces are there, like the puzzle is not together, but it's like the pieces are right in the they just need to slide it over and click it in. Like, yeah, slide it over and click it in. They're not spread out on the table anymore. So that's what he was dealing with before is like the piece, the piece of the puzzle wasn't even on the table. Well, now they're all in the table and some of it's put together and it's like, okay, what do we need to do to click this one in place, right? It's not as simple as picking it up. It's like, all right, what do we need to do that, right? So they're they're all there, but they're not all in place, right? For example, the distribution thing, like they had talked about that and then Sean and Sean found the saying and I talked to them and now that piece is just sitting there and it has not been put in place, but it can be. But there's no point in putting it in place right now. However, the piece has been defined, its location where it needs to go is known about the domain. Like, it's there. we just got to wait to then go click. There's no point putting in a place if nobody's using pamplowing.
00:37:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just like the community, like I started it, it was working and I stopped it. I said, I'm not building community right now because there's nothing, there's nowhere for them to go. I have nothing to offer these people other than a checklist. That's not enough. And I learned like, okay, I learned what to ask them and I learned, okay, great. Down. Check. Peace is there. It's not in place.
00:37:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, do you have, I'm just trying to think about Well, the other bit is like, they, I didn't come up with this equity crowdfunding thing until like a month and a half ago.
00:37:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, and I got it from listening to one of Joe's podcasts and turns out, the girl that he interviewed lives here, but now I can go meet her whenever, and you can do a sit-jow up. But once I listened to that, I was like, oh, this fits perfectly. In that context, if you're going to do equity crowdfunding, I guarantee you, you need to have an entity that looks a certain way. So I'm like, great. That's what the entity is going to be based on. It's not going to be based on a distribution of bears or whatever. It needs to be based on the idea of like, hey, let's say I want to go rate is $10 million over time. Great. What does that need to look like? That's not that you're going to go public, but when I have a company right now, it's 50-50. It's me and Denise. I don't know how many F&T shares there are in D&D company, and I don't care, right? But if you're going to equity crowdfunding, that's going to matter. Because you're actually selling shares. So, you know. We had an entity, it would be getting dissolved and reformed with this. So it's like, okay, now it'll be like, hey, I want to build because I think I'm going to put that piece of places. Therefore, this entity piece, I think needs to look like this. And I guarantee you, if we build that and they don't equity crowdfund, it won't hurt us because it was built that way. If it's built in a way to allow equity crowdfund, it's not going to a negative from a distribution or equity standpoint. It'd just be like, oh, you have a hundred thousand shares and it could have been a thousand because, you know, that's what you needed to go equity round or whatever.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what do you have defined right now that is what is going to be, if anything, that would be sold, that has a price point where you could do those financial calculations?
00:39:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think Sean has mapped out the SaaS tier pricing. I don't know it offhand. But I believe he did. I think you've done him and Eric were in a setting up. I don't know if it's inside a family, but I think Sean did it. And we're like, I think the low level is like 97 bucks, right? then the coaching and stuff. They I don't know what they're charging, but whatever they are, I would probably raise the price. So I can get that from them. So it be like, what does the done? What is the done with you tier? And what does it look like? And what is the price? And then the done for you would be this label level thing. And you can't really do that. Unless you had more, but I don't. And you can't do it. But like, if you're going to do done for you and you're going to pay to produce someone's song, what is they've done it, right? So Mark and Sean have, you know, after after what they've done. But like, they work that guy, massive man, who's this rapper who PS they're like, he can buy his catalog. So they work with him. I don't know. So with him, I think they worked on a like, and maybe this is maybe there's like a done for you barter thing, where it's like, hey, we're going to come and do a song with you. And we're going to make sure that we can work together, which is essentially what they would do with him. But they only did that because they couldn't like sign him and be like, we're going to do every song with you. But as I say it out loud, and I'm like, maybe it's that. I don't know what that deal looks like. I don't know what, I mean, I know Mark and Sean worked on it and I know they wrote, but I don't know that they actually charged mass anything. They should have. They should have charged him to mix it. They should have charged him to produce an engineer. But I don't know that they did. In this scenario, you would. But what does that look like? Or, yeah, so that that Or that's that's not even done for you. There's that tier to like you could have a tier where you're like I mean, I guess it's done with you production tier There's a done with you marketing tier done with you. Yeah, it's done with you. So then the done for you There should be like some sort of like hey, we're gonna try this out And you're not signing them to a deal. You're signing them to like a single like that Assuming that could be a thing And then you would just take your done with you pricing and say this is what we're investing You're not paying any of this.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what we would have charged you down here and for that We're getting 50 percent of this or 50 percent of the streams or whatever it is So If somebody okay, so let's say Dan starts running ads and gets people to the book And the book gets people to lead flowy. would be splitting 50 percent of whatever revenue lead flow we make.
00:43:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I get paid back everything first. So I have to calculate all that which stays and I could do it but I just let me in. So I calculate my total investment, I get paid back 100% first and then we go then it's 50% of net. So then you have to cover any of the ongoing costs, the cost of lead flow, the white label, the cost of whatever it is, right? There'll be different costs, right? If we add the distribution in, that becomes like 900 bucks a month. If we add in this circle, that becomes $300 a month, right? So whatever the 50% of net, I get paid back everything and I'm 50% of that. And then the net's like moving moving item for whatever period.
00:43:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then with, in fan flowy and the services, the sort of done with you and the done for you, those guys are fulfilling stuff and that's what they're doing for their 50%, but you get 50% of that also, is that right?
00:44:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so the done with you and done for you was like really mom and it's so it's done with you, they'd be on fan flowy, right? it's like, hey, you're using fan flowy. So we won't work with anyone. I think we don't work with anyone that's not even fan flowy. So it's like, you don't, these are even available to you. You can't just come in from the outside. You can come in at this done with you tier, but the first thing you're going to do is start paying for fan flowy because we're not going to help you promote us all or promote yourself if you don't even have this fan after and grow up system in place, right? So done with you, done for you, that's mom level stuff. And in my mind, it's like an ascension out of fan flowy. Well, fan flow is with inside a mom, right? the ground level of mom is like the book and then fan flow is a service and then it kind of goes up from there.
00:45:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what I'm asking is, is everything under the mom umbrella being split with them 50-50?
00:45:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. someone came in after the fact, after we have an end of the year whenever all the money would go into a mom account. So they would pay mom right now. They're paying bam rock or whatever. They wouldn't pay them anymore.
00:45:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it.
00:45:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or maybe they would keep the ones that they already have and then all the new ones whenever one of the other.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. OK, that's more clarity, I think, than I've ever seen. What I'm going to do, a lot of these notes are already structured as is. I think would be really helpful. for Stacy to have so that she can house them somewhere and she's in the meetings.
00:46:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I assume she's in most the meetings. That one, yeah.
00:46:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I met most meetings like with you guys about these topics. Anyway, I'm gonna highlight some stuff. might even make like a tiny little just kind of mind map as a visual starting point for helping facilitate that conversation that you guys will be in so that because you know how it is, we see it, they see it literally same page because now a page exists to be able to look at it. Since you're getting so close to being able to start ads and, um, you so much, um, start ads and, uh, and sending traffic, um, So, but you can't sell stuff you haven't defined and you're building the technical aspect of it. But anyway, you know, the offer and the physical fulfillment are two different things, not that it's physical, it's digital, but you know what I mean. So, it's just bodies are weird, damn, they're just weird and inconsistent and annoying and frustrating. Like if I do the same stuff every single day, then I should get the same type of results. But do you think that that's how it works? No, Dan, that is not how it works. No, it is not. No, not at all. That's okay because I'm a boss at figuring it out and then solving it quickly. I'm just annoyed. have to work so hard at it.
00:47:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it is not a plus.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not. It's really not. My sister has like the easiest life. She has them. is she's got no issues. She's just like flowing through life, not thinking about nothing. And I'm like, if I don't think about anything, I'm dead. So that's nice. I'm not even being dramatic about it. That's the truth.
00:48:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, it was the truth.
00:48:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. That's good. Okay, I'm not gonna save my notes yet, because I don't want to trigger the app CC until I'm done with that. How is the Google analytics stuff going?
00:48:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I jumped in Wednesday and I looked at a number. I can't be right. It's way too high. I gotta go figure out why that's so high. So I think, I don't know, stuff might be double firing. So there's two numbers I looked at. One, I have to confirm, which is my new customer customer variable customer event. So I have to go try to match the that up with meta rick and see if it should match. If it doesn't, then I'm going to circle around a mushi and be like, this is wrong in this way. So if it's over a ronder. Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to get the date that he put it. have that date. But I see if that's working and then they do this past stuff. It's only way you can describe it is like you fire an event on a URL. So like I set up two paths, which are literally our paths, right? So our paths are choose a path, go down a path, go to the product page. I created an event so that I could say show me the ninja only path, which would mean they start on the paths page, they choose to go down the ninja only path, and then they end up on the product page. And then conceivably they go to the next page and they check out right. So that would be the entire thing. So it's path. selection down the path, product page, checkout, and then purchase. So initially, I think the first two were missing. I set those up. Now I see them, but like, I want to say that like the individual path pages are higher than the path selection page. And I'm like, that's there's no way that's true. is the only way to get to those is through that page. Some like, it should be that they are half or roughly, right? They should they should sum to the total of half or or near the path could be higher because people don't want to work. But I looked at that, whatever, and I was like, that's way too high. That the numbers between the two paths were pretty close, which makes sense. But they all they seem too high. then they didn't seem to really relate to the way the path selection page they should. good. I don't know what's going on. So I going to dig into that and then run it by my buddy over there at Mercer's Place. And then this other one is, there's something wrong, like, it does video percentages. And I think it does like 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, not 100, or does play 10, whatever. And I think the only ones that are registering are play in 90. I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Pretty sure there should be some other ones before 90. And then why is only 90 working? So I got to send that into them and be like, is this something about the trigger is wrong? I'm assuming like the con, I'm working. But it's, it works on the beginning and the end. I don't know, so I swear I did it right, but I'm going to send that into versus people to be like, any idea whether this is happening?
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to, like, if you just, like, screen share one day and just kind of show me what you've set up so I can visualize it, because so often we're talking about things, and I think I follow it pretty well, but, you know, the visual, it's a whole new kind of understanding. Okay, so how's sales going for another 71?
00:52:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Steady, Eddie.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:52:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't get a big pop on. We didn't notice that we didn't get a big pop on the new release type. Like, you do to a major score release of the calls. We just had one of those when it was, like, moderate, not great.
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
whatever we know so that was that's 2025 don't want 2025 I was trying to figure out what the different types are because I remember looking at them with you and they're like the 21 or whatever there's going to be in 2025 and how they were broken down let's see okay I don't like to get my notes real quick and see if there's anything else I want to ask about although that the whole mom stuff was a really good oh any updates on just the weddings stuff at all that whole wolf or thing.
00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, pretty sure Heather, you know, Heather's smart or whatever. But I think she's basing her price on the total amount of money she's made there. And then she's putting a multiple on that and like, Oh, sweet, no sweetie. That is not how that works. And then she's also basically get on the fact that like, Oh, she did say this. Oh, yeah, the gen tucks revenue wasn't good in 2024 because of a bad contract.
00:54:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's going to remedy itself. And then it will be, you know, like, hmm, that's not how that works either.
00:54:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Her number is not based on reality. But she's like, totally checked out at this point, like, we were supposed to have a meeting, same page meeting today. She's like, I think we should cancel it. I was like, okay. And I mean, just making good money. And she's got two babies now, right? Yeah, and she's like, I just don't want. I don't put any money or any energy towards it. But then she did that in Slack. I don't pay attention to Slack that much. And then she's texting me. She's like, Jamie's really pushing for a meeting. And I was like, are you talking about? It's like in Slack, I go, oh, I didn't see that. So then I went, then there's Jamie trying to keep this meeting that we're supposed to have today at night. And she's like, well, Jamie's like, I think we really need to get on the same page where Heather's future is unsure, right? The very Jamie thing, right? And then I was like, okay, well, there's really three, she's like, oh, Heather's future is uncertain. I go, well, if you wanna relieve that uncertainty, then you need to exercise your first writer refusal. If you're not gonna buy it, exercise it. And the 60 days goes away. And then he can proceed. even whatever way she's going to tomorrow. And of course, Jamie doesn't want to do that, right? Because she wants to be in control. And so she's like, well, if the meeting is contingent upon me making that decision, I say we post upon the meeting. like, the meeting is not contingent upon you doing that. But I'm like, here's the deal. There are three outcomes here. Other cells. Are there, oh god, what did I say? Heather cells. No, you buy Heather proud. One, Heather cells, two, Heather stays in some sort of non-engaged, you know, whatever capacity. But I'm like, this is just, they all equal the same thing. Uncertainty. I go, well, we can lower the uncertainty by you making your decision or not. If you're not going to buy it, just say no. And then we can move to step two. And then, but here's the problem. Step two and step three, no idea how long Those are going to take, right? It could take forever. Yes, no one's going to buy this thing. It's like, what are we doing? Like, I understand. I just want to get the sales page up, charge them $600 bucks and bucks. Because I mean, I thought it's the same principle, right? I about buying it. I was like, nah, I'd rather go buy Lansdowne. Because that's, I'd rather work with Sean. And I don't have to work with it to your point early, right? I don't have to work with anyone. I own the thing 100%. And they can't take the off Spotify. Like, I'd rather go do that than this. And now, of course, now I'm stuck with this software that we developed up to like, thanks, Heather. But I don't think, I mean, I don't need them for that. I think, I I don't think Jamie's going to like, F with me. Right. then she, so then subsequent to that, she texted Heather and like, can you tell me where you're came up with evaluation and can you send me like the countersigned documents of this and that? And Heather's like, I'm not doing that. He's like, you don't have to. We had the rotor back. I came up with it. It's an SDE evaluation based on all the remote, which is wrong. And then she's like, I'm not, I'm not doing your due diligence for you. Like, if you don't have those documents, then I'm not going to get them for you. Um, which is fine. Totally acceptable. You should have them. And then that's where it's at. So then I was like, when's the 60 days up?
00:58:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:58:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
November 4th. So basically nothing's going to happen until November 4th. And then they'll shut down for the year. stops working in December. So it's like, what are we doing? Uh, so yeah.
00:58:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I don't understand what's happening. always operated so clearly and smoothly before.
00:58:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just kidding. Well, that's the thing. I mean, part of me is like, like, what are you doing, Heather? you didn't, you didn't need to do this, you know what I mean? It's like, now, now it's like, you're kind of up. It's like, you're getting a motion.
00:59:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's, that's exactly what it is right there, though. Yeah. done with you, Amy, it's a big off of you and cut off your nose to spite your face because I hate my face and the face is Jamie.
00:59:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And I mean, it's in the context of like Joe making money now. And I'm like, yeah, for baby, it's the combo.
00:59:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if Joe wasn't making money, this wouldn't be happening.
00:59:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I know. But my argument to that would be the money that Joe's making is not real money. It's not, it's not a, it's a business that could disappear tomorrow. It's, he's building the wrong business, right? So he's like, he's doing And this AI consulting with who I would say is a scammer. So I'm like, that's great. Now with, he was an ascending kid. He was like, I can see a space, but whatever. Yeah, so they're doing this AI consulting thing where they're overcharging people to do it, right?
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, come on. separate?
01:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, he lives here. Mike came in, Mike came eggs.
01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that dude.
01:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I never liked that guy. I never really came to be alone.
01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you ever do anything with Mike the same?
01:00:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh.
01:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hung out with him once or twice, so that's about it.
01:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, Joe worked with all of them, which is fine. So anyway, it's like, you know, he's ignoring his own business for that. And I'm like, I don't dude. I don't know if that's it. It's a great idea, but whatever. I mean, my plan is still to, I now think Joe, I mean, I'll get with Heather and be like, all right, let's build Joe's business. And on basis, and then sell his courses, and he should build a podcast or network in circle and sell the courses in circle and do that. And then sell them on to your basis, podcast, and dang. And yeah, let's go do that. And then just charge Jamie 600 bucks a month. Part of it was, I was also thinking like, I should just go to them and be like, I'll buy 25% from each of you.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, for real.
01:01:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right? then I'm like, I own 50%. And then you guys can both check out. Yep. Except it's not worth it to the grant, yes.
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yep. But. So you throw something at them that's, you know, gets them by.
01:02:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
problem is Jamie is going to check out too. They're both going to check out.
01:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, whatever. But that's okay because, well, never mind, she owns the YouTube. I mean, because the content really is the only thing we're buying.
01:02:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I realized also this week that, like, they built, it's the wrong model, right? It's like you're, it's not going to be this huge course. So I mean, same thing, the them on circle. Like if they start, if they got rid of the Facebook group and they put every lead into a circle community and then you were selling the course through there, you're selling the course through email, you're selling the course through circle, but then in circle, they're helping each other, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you, you bolt on like, of course, this is not going happen. But it's like you start what models in that industry work better Zola Zola is doing 120 million a year It's like okay. Well, what how do you go build a baby version of them of what Zola? Which is like they give free websites, dude. It's ridiculous I think they make most of their money by offering free websites and then on the website. They go put a link to your your Put link to your target registry on this button and then when they do that they append their affiliate URL to the link That's wild. I have it is I just realized how late it was and I went on as I've been waiting. So I gotta go.
01:03:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a good name That's wild. Anyway, to be continued 20 mil That's yeah The whole the whole new craziness anyway, okay, you And your special sweet wife go take care of her. Good luck with that Thanks. This ending you guys did positive vibes.
01:04:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Try not to cry.
