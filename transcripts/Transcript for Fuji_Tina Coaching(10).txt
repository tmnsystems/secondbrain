00:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Hi, how are you? Good.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am not. Huh?
00:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
COVID number three.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. I haven't had that for two years, but I've got asthma and terrible allergies and I'm allergic to everything around here. And yeah, just trying to figure out, but I think I'm gonna have to do shots.
00:00:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I've been avoiding it. Oh, allergy shots?
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I kids immunotherapy can backfire sometimes. so, but at this point, the the benefits are that the medicines don't work for me. I've done everything I can home you pathically. But anyway, I'm physically miserable. I can't think about anything else. I haven't been able to sleep. So I'm grumpy. Hi, Fujii.
00:00:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
You know, after you told me you got was it COVID and then it like wiped you out for I actually went and got my COVID vaccine because, you know, my whole family had COVID about two months ago. but yeah, I was around them. never got it. So I was like, okay, time to get another booster.
00:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
After you told me your story, was like, oh man, I better actually do this.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody goes through it differently. But because I've been hospitalized with ammonia four times in my right lung is almost collapsed and it scarred like, you know, you just do some basic math and go, I'm probably one of the ones that is better off getting it, whatever's going to happen. Okay, so let's go over your homework. And get some traction for ya. Allergies are a .
00:01:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I've gone through periods where my nose runs and yeah, just so thankful.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
never had it. Yeah, some of my friends, because I grew up in the country, you know.
00:01:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah. Some of my friends had to, yeah, do the shots and it was terrible for them.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My brother does it. My mom smoked the whole time she was pregnant with me in the 70s. I have a spine of But I asked your throw this arthritis, my skeleton looks like I see cucumber with all the spurs, I had cataracts and seven, like, I have fibromyalgia. It's just a mess. And I don't like thinking about it.
00:02:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I'm like, I got stuff to do, man.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't, whatever. I try not to talk about it, but like, it is work living in my body. Anyway, okay, are we in the one document to roll them all?
00:02:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Like, where are we at? Yes, let me get that open.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll open it too. One. It's time to get the humidifier and essential oils out too. It's at the bottom of homework recap, you know. All right, all good. I had that open anyway.
00:02:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I just got back from jujitsu. Oh, yeah. You encouraged me? We're gonna do... That's right, love it, felt good.
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's good.
00:03:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I've beat up today, but you know.
00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not too bad once in a while too. Sometimes we need to, we need to, we need to have somebody like, you know.
00:03:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
That's about 50-50, like half the guys I beat up and the other half beat me up. How it should be.
00:03:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At least 70, like, 40, so 30. I can do math. Anyway, you know. Got to up that a little bit. Come on, Fuji. You do it. All right, let's see. Okay. Number four. Good job. Personal change. I have to look at all the headings first.
00:03:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
RPVs completed. RPVs are.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Return visits.
00:03:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
All right.
00:03:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Visits. All right. Um, so it's change from the month of month. Number. I told you this, it's from Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, good job.
00:04:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Bless you.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Missouri. Revenue expenses profit by the month. My job. Elizabeth expenses. Rough number of visits. Wait. Rough number of visits.
00:04:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Like for what. This is. So I looked at how much I paid her, and then I divided it by her salary, which is $35 a visit.
00:04:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Elizabeth's visits. Yeah. I should have, she should have seen about 186, which if you look on the left column H, like he loved one 79 and we, we think the differences is because she does work notes and work notes paid $12.50 per.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Worknote.
00:05:01 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So I think that's why it looks like she billed for more than she did.
00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah.
00:05:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you track work notes?
00:05:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Not easily. I have, I'd have to, we'd have to pull like, my system still uses Google Calendar. So I, that's how we're counting these visits.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you could create it as an event in the calendar also, like performed work note or something like that. If that's your current system. Or put it in a spreadsheet or something.
00:05:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. So put it like in the calendar.
00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
me ask my manager where he's counting the numbers and then we could just put the work notes there. Yeah. I mean, none of that is a really great system, but if, at least start tracking the relative data. So because what you don't want to have is doubt, cast in any way. and not not for the benefit of your relationship and not also for the benefit of the finances. And so once we start digging into things, you're gonna you're gonna want to make sure that you can track everything just for those reasons as well. It's human nature sometimes to just wonder.
00:06:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to my manager about that. Okay. Everything else lines up like so Jasmine here, she had 27 and then that correlates with how many we counted on her calendar. She already had 82 and then it shows that she had 81 visits. So that was probably counter-core by two work notes she did. Okay. Yeah, so everything else works pretty well.
00:06:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome.
00:06:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And then Diana hasn't gotten paid. So I think she's gonna pay me. She won't. don't know. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So. Hey, this is Henry. Yeah, I should ask her.
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to highlight this one so I just remember like this is where I want to look at most. This should have a conditional threshold too. See if I can do this quickly which is make it red if it's over 400 or do we want to make it over 500?
00:07:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Can you walk me through how you do that?
00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You highlight F. Okay so hold on second I'll show my screen real quick. You see it? Yes. Now I've got to get the zoom out of my way.
00:07:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Hold on. So you right click on F you know.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah hold on. Okay so um not the whole column I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like take a section that's gonna cover a few years basically. I'm going go to, I'm sorry, conditional formatting and then is greater than, what number do we want it to be?
00:08:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, 450.
00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
450.
00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Right? 500 marks says that's starting to get 47 and 400 is probably right on. So I think 450 would be a good like middle ground to shoot for.
00:08:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's, I'm going to change it to 400 just so you can see it.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Format. So format, conditional formatting.
00:08:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Mark didn't have like a, you know, a, you know, scientific way here. Right. working days. can see 20 patients a day to most people. 400 would be the max one doctor to see. And I was like, okay, yeah, that makes sense. See? Okay.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, we can change this. Did you see that? hold on. Oh, close that. I go over here and then I click on this. No format, conditional formatting. It'll show me this one that's already there. And I can change the range if I wanted to and I can change the number here.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I think if you change it to f2 colon f without the 63, it'll do the whole rest of the row. Without the 63.
00:09:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool.
00:09:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I think that's it. Yeah, it's an out of it. How long are you going to thousand? Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that.
00:09:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I did not know that. Good job.
00:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's quite each other things.
00:09:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I did last night. Good job. Well, that's interesting. Okay. So my goal then is to get 450 visits a month and I or 400 say and I only did that in August when because I think in August we had the prior month we had 373 referrals. So some of those got booked. August, I think that's probably why that number was so strong in August, because the trailing month had so many referrals that we pushed to August. You see, like July, I had the strongest number of referrals ever, 370 down referrals. Yeah, lot of those we pushed to August to just to fill the dates.
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes sense.
00:10:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So I think maybe what I need to do is I need to start shooting for another like 50 referrals a month.
00:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and maybe also that the target be roughly 375 referrals a month. Yeah, 400 referrals a month. Yeah, something like that.
00:10:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, okay, I know how to do that. just, I need to, I need to, I need to make myself do it.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
could get that. Okay, what do you have to do to do that?
00:11:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Well, When I got this incredible number from zero or my 87 that first month and 120 from zero, I was literally cold calling like probably eight hours a day. was calling like four people an hour or five people an hour and just talking to people at law firms. That's how I did it. So that sounds fun. Yeah, there's lot of denials, a lot of secretaries that when let me talk to their case managers, but I don't know, I got through to enough and yeah, it was pretty incredible. Like from zero, I thought so. And then I did that pretty much though all the first months, like all these months, was cold calling and I stopped in about October November. And then I hired the management companies and it got me to where I am now or not management companies and marketing companies. But now they're just flat.
00:11:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's not really doing anything. Have you talked to them about it?
00:11:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Like what can you do to get more? Yeah, and again, it goes back, they're just like, you know, we put you in touch with these law firms, it's up to you to close the deal, you know, we're trying, but you know, sometimes having the doctor talk to them closes the deal and they'll start sending it to you. Honestly, I just haven't done it. So I need to get back.
00:12:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's some targets, let's get some targets about what you will do each week in volume rather than a particular day. It'll be up to you, but I would recommend though that you block it in your calendar on a particular day. However, those types of conversations are our specific energy types, right?
00:12:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Like if you're not in a good space, you're not going to have the best results.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The thing about time blocking for me is not that I'm rigid about it and not that it exists on my calendar in a rigid way, but that I'm aware of roughly how much time I want to spend on it. And so it flew it in my mind. At this point, I don't even put them on my calendar anymore. I just know that that's how time much time that I need. And also because I, I create so much space on my calendar.
00:13:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So it works that way. But basically like whatever my big rocks are for the week, the most important thing.
00:13:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if I want, if I think that to be effective, I need two hours, then I'm, I'm making sure that I've got two hours and it's going to happen sooner in my week rather than later. Oh, and, um, to get it done. Yeah.
00:13:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yes. So then nothing.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And because, because you don't know what's going to happen throughout the week, you could get sick, whatever. And then you lost that opportunity. But if that was a leveraged activity and that if it was important to growth, then, you know, you've kind of missed the boat and now you're delayed and you don't know how long you're going to be delayed, whereas you could be reading the benefits of having done that work. So you, you definitely want to put the, the things that are most important first.
00:13:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Well, I would like to, I would like to do this more intelligently. So I think what I'll start with is maybe I'll commit to one hour twice a week. And that should be, I I call it one person every 10 minutes, sometimes faster if no one talks to me, but I feel about six patients, six law firms an hour. So I'll try to call 12 law firms in a week. And I think my strategy this time is first, I'm going to look at people that have referred to me, but haven't sent anything like they referred to me once, but then they never sent the second one and follow up with those people like, Hey, what happened? Is it just a matter of me reminding you that kind of Yeah, speaking of that, I wonder like, how much a direct response type of approach might work? What do you mean, like, actually, is going up with their door?
00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, direct response is something definitely to look into. It just I'm trying to think about how I want to do this. So if you're going to be in business for yourself, all business needs new business needs new sources of business needs new It's all different even if you're, but even if you're B2B business to business or B2C business to consumer, you still need lead sources. So understanding, marketing and persuasion, but also understanding what makes buying decisions. And buying decision could also be applied to whether an attorney refers somebody to you or to a different doctor. So it's a dense read, although it does have a companion that was written by one of my clients. It's a book called Breakthrough Advertising. Breakthrough Advertising is a study of over a hundred years worth of marketing. And it was written in 1996, the author actually passed away, but his works belongs to one my clients, who pays his wife. anyway, but it's referenced repeatedly by marketers and copywriters. But what he did was like, like some of the old ad campaigns, he just studied. so many of the ad campaigns and you could see the psychology, you can see what are, why certain calls to action work and it was just, it would be worth the effort on a lifetime value, by the way, to kind of look at that and see why people buy what they buy, do what they do. It'll help you with it, it will help you with this, it'll help you with the test prep stuff, oh yeah, and it'll take, it'll take time but learning marketing psychology and buying psychology will be really useful for you. Marketing is everywhere, you'll start to see it in schools, you'll see it in businesses, you'll see everybody's using propaganda, right? Propaganda aka marketing for your particular topic or or thing or whatever. So anyway, if you've got Edit. You should get the companion companion guide. think it's BreakthroughAdvertising.com. I don't want all of this. Because the whole reason, I told them to write the book, this thing on the left, Breakthrough Advertising Mastery, because this is so dense, people don't finish it. And so this has like glossy pictures and breaks down the stuff that you actually need to know like levels of awareness and the whole process. What do you call it? Kind of just the process of rising through, so becoming aware of, especially for Delta, right? They're not most of your people are not even products aware. They don't know that there's a thing that exists where they can go get a brain scan report and use it to kind of help them map out their longevity. Anyway, but yeah, this would be really good for you. I think it's a long term assignment. It's not a hurry up and get through it. It's kind of wrapping your mind around things, but yeah. Because so direct response to this was like I was thinking about maybe postcards, but in addition to your phone call, one thing Mark does is he has Jasmine, I think, go and meet doctors. But he goes to their offices. She goes to their offices. And rather than meeting with the doctors, meets with the people at the front desk because they're the ones that actually are doing their referrals. and they buy them lunch and do things like that. And it gets a return. We're still trying to track the return because it doesn't work equally across the board, but there's
00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
definitely some lift that has happened.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
learning how to like measure things would be good. And there's so many different reasons why somebody would choose you versus not. Maybe you're at the top of the list physically and or maybe somebody else pissed them off that day. Like there's so many reasons it could happen. But what you want to do is increase the likelihood that they'll choose and why. And people whether it's consciously or subconsciously go where they like somebody most. So like ability has a lot to do with it. But the other thing is just simply being top of mind. If you're at the bottom of their mind and somebody else managed to get there at the top. And the thing that can cause being top of mind could be just frequency.
00:19:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
That's why we do repetition right?
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because it gets stuck in your head and you can't. So how do we create that? Is it through any kind of like targeted ads where only only those types of doctors would say, hey, don't forget, that would be rude. Anyway, but postcards just, I don't know. So the logistics of it are not something I know or can know, that would be what we have to discuss, but I'm giving it to you to kind of like mull over and think about how could we apply that type of understanding about why people make the decisions they do, which is just being top of mind and then also like ability.
00:20:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, it was one of my friends that he owns a tree company, like tree trimming company. And he's like, he's like, don't even worry about telling them about your product. He's like, just ask what they do and find out what they love. And just, if you can get to know what they like, they'll remember you for asking them what they like. So I actually have to force myself to do that when I'm cold calling like, you know, Secretary, she's like, oh, OK, I'll go back and look great. So if you have a second, what do you do? And so now I try to do that. And the thing I struggled with back then is keeping track. I just, as soon as I hear it, I forget it.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then, yeah. So you know what you can use Chat TBT for that?
00:21:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, I don't know.
00:21:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, somehow record my interactions or something. So what you could do is just open the app. And you could basically just wire talking. First, open it and say Chat GPT. Like, I'm going to have this conversation with this person.
00:21:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I need you to repeat this data.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, interesting. And so when she says this, you said, oh, OK. So you like blah, blah, blah. And then you say that, Chat TBT records it. And then when you get off the call and case, so and so, remember these things. And it has memory. So you can ask it to remember that and then go back.
00:21:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And then be like, summarize. I'm trying to keep track of, or I want to remember what we talked about, please create a one pair of summary about what we talked about, so I can give a 100%.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then like, if it doesn't give you a good summary, say, okay, but you missed this part and you missed this part, these are the types of things I want you to pay attention to.
00:22:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
These are the types of things I want you to ignore. Oh, that'd be fun. Okay. Yeah. fun doing that.
00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:22:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Game of thought. I just, I just sent you a new invite, my, my manager made this, it's called Canteo Sitas Sitas.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know what it's got, I think it's a lot of firms. An email? Okay.
00:22:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
We shared it. It's a Google sheet. And look at sheet two, I'll call it summary, summary sheet, or look on tattoo, I'm sorry. So what my manager did was he looked at the prior month. So these are September numbers and he showed me how many each firm sent to. So, like, La Lazari, these do the same, but they are my bulk, right? sent me 86 in September, sweet lawyers was number two. That would be, I all Morgan sent number three, right? And Toronto Law sent number four, so solution now number five. Anyway, when I was my thing that I was thinking when I target those, when I do these calls, is I was going to go after these people that have only sent me one or two and essentially be like, hey, how was my service? You know, what can I do better? How are you? Can I get to know you?
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I don't know. I hold on, let me just do this real quick. Data, source, column B, one, two, three. Whoa, I just did it, and then I undid it. That's weird.
00:24:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
It's possible that my manager used a formula to bring these numbers in.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I do undo then. Let me see.
00:24:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, he was using count a function, I think.
00:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, let's see.
00:24:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So I think he dragged all the referrals into this cheat one, and then he used a count function. To bring in these other numbers here. I don't know.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can ask him how he did it. Okay. Well, then here's what I'll do is copy. Okay. Okay. Special values only, and then sorry. I just want to sort it right now. Yeah. Oh, what is it? G. Okay.
00:24:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
That's what I want to see.
00:24:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. The majority of your cases.
00:24:57 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
These are the same. I should just go to 60.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus 26, it's 86, right?
00:25:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Change that really this guy. That they're the same. OK, there you go. Cool. Thanks. Looks so pretty now.
00:25:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's do this. OK, so this number is 37. This number is 25. That's 36. And this is two hundred and fifteen.
00:25:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I've met these case managers in person. I've met suites in person. met ILS in person. Never met these people at all digital solution. I've met them. I've met them. I've met BD and J. I've never met these guys. I met these guys. Everyone else said all digital people. So these two.
00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've met these guys.
00:25:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Actually, met these guys in person.
00:25:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's do it.
00:25:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
But wait, how many of these have you met? Do you want me to like mark them in green? I met these guys, met these guys, these guys.
00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was a painful green. Does that not hurt your eyes to look at? You're young, so probably not. Well, that's better. No, it's like your question though.
00:26:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
it not? I like to make it to me.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
see it wrong.
00:26:41 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I met this guy. Okay, yeah. That's a little crash. Wait, there's a same one? Oh, crash and crash. should be 11 then. I'm going delete this one. is my preventable choice. Okay, yep, that's it.
00:26:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about these two?
00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. Oh, yeah, that's the same because they're reported to 13. There you go.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you always want to start with the win first.
00:27:27 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
You know, a lot of those areas actually has case managers that are like, you know, they rotate. They actually have, I think 34 case managers. I've met 20 of them, but I could start reaching out to the other 14 that I don't know. Yes.
00:27:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, but what you should do is ask a case manager that you have a good relationship. Say, Hey, I was thinking about reaching out to some of the other case managers. And seeing if we could get, you know, more going, who do you have any recommendations or somebody really? like that I could talk to and kind of warm that up because, again, it's a like ability and a know ability. So if they're talking with each other, you like it. Anyway, we don't know that that would work, but the likelihood because it's a human being, right? And we like who we like and we help who we like. So I would take that approach first.
00:28:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. So I asked for like a warm referral essentially. Yeah. Okay. How many should I do that and how many should I do just like?
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would literally work that whole company and then go down the list of all of these things.
00:28:42 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So Mark, when I used to get like closer to 100 when I was starting these guys and Mark was like you need to be very careful that, you know, all your referrals aren't coming from one source.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's okay.
00:28:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I'm wondering if maybe I should start like a little lower down.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on here, like maybe in the middle. Well, yeah, you could. So this one, then by that logic, anything under the threshold of 21. Because percentage-wise, so let's figure this out. So this equals this divided by And then format number percentage. Whoa. Oh, don't make me do that, pay special. don't know. Man, you want that. Okay. if I do it twice.
00:29:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Thank you to put dollar sign, right?
00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
divide it by two 88.
00:29:50 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah. You have to put, I think you have to put dollar sign to lock the second value. So I'll ever change.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, Nora.
00:29:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
you. let's say you do it.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, like where?
00:30:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
It's like there.
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
30. I think it's dollar sign before the G and a dollar sign after the G. I think you put one dollar sign in front of the dollar sign. what the dollar sign is. In front of the 30, I think.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, got it.
00:30:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So fixing the column and the cell. believe.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you want to keep dividing it by two 88, right? Yes, I don't want it to keep dragging down the cell below. Okay. Which is what the formula would have done.
00:30:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, there you go. Oh, thanks.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great.
00:30:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah.
00:30:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:30:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So this is a bad mark. Yeah, this is actually about the number. Mark was like, make sure you're not getting more than like 25 to 30% of your pearls from one place. Hey, we're right there, actually. Hey, okay. Good.
00:30:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't to earn her money every week.
00:30:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So I'm like, how do I offer value? I know solution now. They're pretty small. Beverly's pretty small. So I I actually think I'm getting most of these guys's referrals now. and Jay, these three are massive. I know I can get more from them. Hillstone, I can probably get more. is about all they're going to give me. JT is big. I should really get more from them. Wilshire, Marques, I probably should not take any more from Wilshire. Alpine, I don't know. MNY is giant. It should get more from them. Barnes is giant. I should get more from them. Okay.
00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who? I didn't start this at the beginning.
00:31:34 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Did you say Morgan and Morgan? Yeah, they're gigantic.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
KJ.
00:31:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Let's mark all of these so that you can start going down and you can just have a list and you don't even have to think about it and just come in here and start working the system. Okay. Oh, yeah. I don't know why they're not sending me more.
00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm seeing a little Benji. That's gigantic. Boom. Is that?
00:31:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Or is it?
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you say it? I'm sorry. Fung.
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Is that Anne? Yep, something wrong, caught and fung.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark was trying to get her to work with me, but he's like, she didn't want to. He's like, she needs you, but no.
00:32:12 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So funny. Um, I know her husband really well, TJ.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he said that they've got little kids and I'm just like, man, that's that's rough when you're trying to grow.
00:32:27 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I think because I'm just turned 40, so they're going to be true. You know, they, uh, I think that was their third or fourth.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, they're, they got their hands full. Yes, they do. That's a lot.
00:32:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
A lot.
00:32:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So it's now 50 mil, so they're getting up there.
00:32:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what he was saying also. And that starts to come with management headaches and managing poor kids is a lot also, even when you get help. As you know, with.
00:33:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Ew, huh? Yep.
00:33:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay.
00:33:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
right. So B, A, D and J, I actually know one of the case managers really well, so ask for a warm lead.
00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Before, let's see. Yeah.
00:33:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. So I don't know how I divide. Some of these, like, I don't know. I don't know, like JT. I don't know.
00:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alpine M and Y and cool. Before you write anything in here, what I'm going to do. Is put a goal to if we doubled. What we got from each one. Yeah. So I'm going to, um, double. So. Where's the yes? Okay. we're going to, I'm just going to do this. Equals this times two. And then I'm going to take these out. This, this, this. Holy crap. That can't be right. Oh, what is this number? I need that. to be some.
00:34:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Let's see this.
00:34:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So currently we have to flip over. So we're at 300 and we want to get to 400. So if you were able to get double from each of these existing law firms, which would be easier to get a more yes than a new yes. Yeah, it's true. You would be able to hit your targets 50 more a month. Yeah. So just massaging these existing businesses would strategically make more sense than trying to go get new ones. Okay. Because you have, let's do that first.
00:34:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And it's less painful for me because I because when I call someone that's already referred to me, I feel better because I'm actually just showing my gratitude in instead of asking for something necessarily. So yeah, it's an easier call for me. It's like less painful to do.
00:35:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and think about that and everything that you do, there's all different ways that you can create leverage. Right now you're leveraging existing relationships rather than going out and creating new ones. And it reduces the friction on an emotional level for you but also on the barrier level for establishing a new relationship, which is significant for it. So anyway, but good job that he already had done this.
00:35:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I'm gonna have my, I'm gonna have my manager. I just changed the first tab, the raw data. So I'm gonna have him do this every month, essentially just drop in like October's data and then make us a new tab, know, for October. Make us a new tab for, know, September. Yeah.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's do this. This is great. Thanks, Gina.
00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And so what do you, what do you think I should do for like, like, for BD and J? Actually, I, I text with this case manager that sent me all 13 names, Grace. So I should just ask, hey, Grace, I'm trying to expand or I'm trying to get a few more referrals from good sources like your firm. Can you put me in touch? Like, do you think you can put me in touch with one of your coworkers kind of thing?
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, I'd go about it two ways. I mean, I would, I would say two things. Say, hey, guys, there's couple things I want to say. First of all, thank you for all the business that you've sent me. know, just, just kind of a one-man show trying to take care of family here, whatever.
00:36:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Your, your version of this, right?
00:36:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sincere. don't say it if it's not real, but just like, just wanted you to know, I really appreciate this. I so, and then go, well, okay, maybe it's three parts. So one, want to thank you too. wanted to actually like, I don't know if you can do this. I don't think the attorneys can do this. is whatever, but can you like send her a lunch some year? I did that for a lot of Zari in the first month. I was sending them DoorDash.
00:37:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I sent like 15 DoorDashes to their specific case managers once they sent me a referral. stopped doing that because it was just a pain.
00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then you outsourced that, have somebody else do that for you. But those relationships are huge. And man, people, food, it's not just a way to a man's heart, right? Like, know, was just like, feed me, please. Thank you. Um, yeah, DoorDash is a great way. So say, so one, thank you. Two, I was wondering if I might be able to send you something, like, do you ever like get a craving for a dessert in the middle of the day or lunch or something? I could DoorDash it to you and, and, uh, whatever, like, I could just have it, like, you just either plan it right then and there or say, here's, here's. to my guy, he's going to reach out to you. you just be like, Hey, whatever his name is thought I take you up on that offer, like whatever doesn't seem the most awkward. I don't know. But then the other thing would be like, and because because I'm looking for growth, I thought that I would also and and I would say, you know, like, I don't want this to take away from my thanks. But I would also want to know, is there anybody else that in the firm that I may talk to or any other thing that you might send over? And like, I'm still grateful for all you do. And I'm still going to keep checking in on you and taking care of you, because you make a difference in my business and my life and my family, like, because that's my approach. Like, when I think about my family, I think about their families, like, we're all people. And it's real, like, and I can be authentic about it. So it has to come out whatever is authentic for you.
00:39:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Anyway, It's not true every time every time I get a referral for July. It's like I think every time I get three referrals I'm like that is one less day of anesthesia. I have to do I mean, I don't know anymore, but like it pays the same So that's why like I tell the case managers every time you guys send me a couple like thank you I I yeah, I get home with my kids for one extra day a month, so That's what I'm talking about and Like maybe I can't do that for you, but I can feel your belly and I feel like give you some happy food or something like that like Yeah, what do you think about I used to send them lunch and it was hard to coordinate because you know They had to not bring their lunch on a day. I had to get it at a certain time, which I did But it was just it was a lot to coordinate. What do you think about like you said just sending a snack on DoorDash like What do you think about just like cookies or? Something sweet or coffee because then I don't have to necessarily have it on a day where they deliberately don't bring their life lunch and deliberately during their lunch break, you know, hour. Sometimes I get got there late and then I missed their hour and then they're like, oh, I had to eat it later. Yeah.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about me?
00:40:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
you mentioned like just sending a dessert. Okay, so you think a dessert like cookie or what do you recommend?
00:40:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cakes, pies, but you can you can ask them like, what's your favorite kind of dessert? And then find something nearby that offers that or like, what's your favorite dessert on DoorDash or whatever, just randomly send it and be like, it'll keep until you're ready for it.
00:40:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay.
00:40:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it doesn't have to be like that hot kind of thing. But you could do like, dessert. I like, I like fresh food anyway, better than some of the gift baskets like Harry and David's. I do like Harry and David's gift baskets because they've got good quality food, but a lot of them are garbage. But I wonder if you could do like a DoorDash code, like if they were really smart, they would have like some corporate account where you could just give a one-time code with a certain kind of limit, like, and it's almost like works like an Amazon car, but it's a right? dash card. Door dash card.
00:41:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I hate your cards. They all expire and I hate them, but I see what you're saying.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, so what is harder? Is it like coordinating or doing something like this? So there's door dash gift cards. When do they like how long before expire?
00:41:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Also, who's going to let that expire? I don't want to let them expire, but like I forget to use it.
00:41:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No door dash. Okay, gift cards do not expire. So then you could also have your guy or anybody on your team be like, hey, so I just wanted to see if you use your gift card. Don't you know, because we might send another one or whatever.
00:41:45 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I don't know. But you look up that first link down there.
00:41:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
says send an e from door dash. Yeah. I mean, that's what I was talking about anyway. I'm not an actual physical card.
00:41:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay, so I could like just get these and then just send it. I'm kind of afraid because technically anything I send email can be audited, but maybe my manager sends it to them, then I can like kind of skirt around them, I don't know. I don't want show that I'm buying the case managers. That's why I would do it through my phone, but I guess it's a peanut my phone too.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything that you do anywhere, anytime could technically come into something, but it could be sent from a Gmail account, Yahoo account, an AOL account, like. But if it's unethical, I don't think it's unethical, doctors think they're referring sources all the time. Managing sources that be are overreaching as they are, you know, not bad.
00:42:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
It's like if I get subpoenaed.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and managing kind of like, whatever, it's a little bit.
00:43:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's when I'm getting that.
00:43:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Oh, I see.
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's overreaching. Okay.
00:43:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Um, yeah. Well, me try with Grace. And let me just do the standard where I'll just be like, hey, my, you know, oh, But then Paul's going to need my door dash code.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, set up a separate account.
00:43:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah, but I have a really nice account.
00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have.
00:43:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Oh my gosh, Fuji.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the point of the system is getting new leads.
00:43:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So you want to keep it as simplified as possible.
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So don't, don't like overthink it too much.
00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. I'll pay for the, I'll pay for the dash pass on the new account. We're paying for access. Remember? Okay. And one client is going to pay for all four years. Yes, you're right. Yes, I get it.
00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One referral pay for the yes, I get it.
00:43:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. Yes. Okay.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's very good. Thank you. I know we all get into our miserly. phase from time to time and don't do the big picture math.
00:44:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
But yeah. Thank you for reminding me. OK, so this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to first get Paul, my manager, and account. He actually just messaged me. He's like, hey, what else can I do to help build the business? I was like, well, you're doing great on tracking the numbers. That's very helpful. But now we can actually go after new business together. So I'll give him a door dash password and account. Now, I'll trial this on the people I know, like, Grace. And then just be like, hey, Grace, my manager is going to reach out to you to buy you a little snack.
00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then let's set it up. What you could do to help him kind of do this is have him go do this retroactively.
00:44:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So wait, is this all time? So if you look at the raw, look at raw, the other town.
00:44:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So when he did this, he copied all the September inbound referrals. OK, so what I want What we're do is do this retroactively for everything. And then what we're going to do is we're going to get the existing pace of increase, right? So that we have month over month the average increase for this firm, for this firm, for this firm, because you can take into account that that was probably already going to happen. Then what you can do is give Paul a bonus when that threshold goes above and beyond what the projected increase would be. So this is minimal, right? Pretty much any increase here is going to be good, although I don't know the previous number. So we don't want to say that until we've got the previous numbers, but does that make sense? So like whatever our original rate of increase is, you don't get a bonus for that. But anything that exceeds the threshold of the existing rate of increase, then you can get a bonus for it. And maybe it's $20 for every 1% or something.
00:45:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
That makes no sense. literally throwing out numbers, but so you can see the math that I'm thinking that we can use something to apply to. He's very happy right now because remember he lost his other job, so I had full time so now I'm paying him 3000 a month, which in Guatemala, he's like, oh yeah, I see like definitely figure out a way to incentivize him for like next year or or even just incentivize him in general to keep working hard.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and you have to keep in mind too that whatever I can show you on my screen, my master list.
00:46:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yes, actually I need to share with you. I'll just put you on, this is the one we can't mess up, but I'll put you on.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Peter, don't touch it.
00:46:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Got it. I'll put on email should be coming soon.
00:46:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, there it goes.
00:47:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So this is how I run, this is like essentially our, our database, it has column A, the name, second column is data birth, third is the data of the accident, and then so on and so forth. And then on the L, M and N, it's the data referral, the data service one, which is like sometimes too. This is where I was extracting the other data, like I did, I did that mirror, so I said mirror data, and this is where I was getting it. But I think there must be a way that Paul could mirror the data, and then essentially just pick September's data, and October, like if he manually sets the rows that September, October, and then he could pull the data without having like copy pieces. Yeah, it would be a range. Oh, yeah, range. at the range and then just be like, hey, I want this data, put only the offer name.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the range could be like 10, 1, 0, 24 to like 10, 31, 24. Yeah, October and so forth. Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay, I'll work on that. I think that that might make it more efficient. So I'll pull this data into another spreadsheet. And then from there, like tab number two could be September, number three, October, and then you and I can set it up with that, those formulas you did. Okay.
00:48:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. remember, we do want all the historical data, have him do it. It's worth the effort because then we can see the trajectory and the rate of increase if there is any. But then if we keep doing it, we can also see what stalls and as you've seen, every time we look at the data, there's some kind of, oh, I didn't know that, and oh, I didn't think about that every single time. the new thoughts create, first of all, new questions and new thoughts on top of them as to what's the lever, right? What's the thing that you could leverage? for example, automatically just sorting the firms and seeing how drastically they compare to everyone, and knowing that Lalazari, how do you say that, I don't know? That they're at that 30% threshold, but nobody else is anywhere near that. so just reaching out to those existing ones and targeting for more if you can do it, all of this, right? It's just you have all this information, but it creates instant clarity as to what is the best logical next leverage step to do in order to get where you want to get it. So one thing I would like to do though is Let's see in the one document to rule them all probably. So revenue is not directly proportionate because it takes a while for the cases to close.
00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
That's why I really like tracking it with the number of referrals and, you know, for the month. I think that's just a very solid way.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So I guess just because normally what I would do is do a projection and be like, okay, if we increase this by 100, then what do we get, but we can't do that because that correlation doesn't really.
00:50:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
On two years, we'll see the benefits.

For sure. For sure. definitely going. yeah, just maxing out that threshold of how many people are coming in and then also creating the system and whether it be some sort of automated or at least delegated system of contacting people so that you get them in per second and third visits. you know, necessary and it's ethically makes sense to try to get somebody to do that, but those are the biggest revenue levers you can use.
00:51:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
You don't have to worry about ethics, Tina, just say what you think, and if I'm like, oh, that's pushing it, I don't tell you, but I want to hear the unfiltered things that you would do, forget about I know what you mean, I don't know what ethical or not, so I always want to put that caveat that I'm not suggesting to do anything unethical, but sometimes something might be according to your business model and things that I don't know, so I want to hear the unfiltered thoughts that you do. Okay. If I think it's fishy, then I'll be like, okay, well, probably shouldn't do that, but if not, I love the idea of creativity. Okay. Oh, this is great. I love this call. All right, this is. All right, so what I am committing to is I'm going to make a new spreadsheet and what we're going to be looking at is law firm data. So I'll work on that. I'll finish that before the next call. I guess I should bring it into this one though Paul is going to be using it too. So I don't want Paul to see this. Okay, so I'll have it on what Paul can work on. And then from there, I'll pull it into this one document to rule them all thing. Yeah. Okay.
00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we'll have and this will be kind of like our dashboard of, you know, KPIs that we're looking at to see how we're doing and what we could be doing better.
00:52:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Did I have a second tab on this one document or should I try to put the law firm data on the same tab.
00:52:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, and not put that on the same tab.
00:52:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
would definitely put it separately. So once Paul processes the law firm data, then I'll take that. and mirror it onto any other tab.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yep.
00:53:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Will you set the notes this call?
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I will.
00:53:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And my homework, I guess.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will do that as well. This will be a really good use of time. you're going to commit to one or two hours a week next week starting.
00:53:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
six patients, six fluffers an hour for two hours. if I don't have a response, I don't want to let myself off the vote. if Grace doesn't get back to me, I still want to, I still think I should be calling.
00:53:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I recommend that we make this and the other homework assignment, the penalty homework, because that's how important they are.
00:53:54 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
And I don't want you to not do it. Oh, I'm just saying I don't want to not do it because I'm going to tell myself. My head, oh, I'm just waiting for Grace. But if Grace doesn't get back to me, I should start calling another law firm, just cold calling.
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 100%. There is not, I'm done until you've actually had a conversation with somebody.
00:54:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
OK.
00:54:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me just choose them right now.
00:54:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16. OK, I'll finish these. So I'll call at least one case manager from each of these 16.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Well, fill up your hour.
00:54:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
So if you can't get a hold of somebody and call them all, what would you do? In my hour, I just move on to the day. Or, well, if I've already called on 16 in the hour, then I'll start going through the people I know, like, hey, Grace, I'll do this message. Or no. Maybe I should do the message first, is that what you're saying?
00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I'm asking you what will you do with your time once you've used it all and didn't have enough conversations to keep the two hours busy and you've gone through the whole list.
00:55:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
What would you do? Well, I should, I want to, I think I would probably do this buying people lunch thing.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So set up the door dash for, yes, that would be an excellent use of time and towards that single.
00:55:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah. Well, should I call first or should I do the warm leaves first? Well, wait, wait, on these, I already know the case manager that referred, so it's, it would be warm lead already because I know the case, so I'll just call him to say, thank you. I saw you said one, I wanted to see how it was.
00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I said was that one, you should say thanks to, you should do the door dash offer three, you should ask for the introduction or more cases from the height, from the high first, like this one.
00:55:57 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Okay. Yes. Oh, that's good one. So number one, get door dash. for Paul, bite the bullet. Number two, thank these people that have done one-offs and offered to buy them cookies or dessert. Three, go after the case managers that I know personally and then ask my ask. Okay, I can do that.
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then in addition, get disorganized so that we've got all the data from all the months and then we'll create a formula where we can look at the rate of increase month over month and then you figure out and bring to the table next week unless you already have put it into place and let me know what you can do to kind of deputize Paul and help him, have him help you accomplish this so you're not having to do all of it and you're leaning more heavily on him, allowing him to improve his value and also maybe earn a little bit more money.
00:56:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
No, mean I totally expect him to do this because I am paying him. ridiculous amounts for what I'm all intelligent, so I will try to assist him in making it clean like this for us though.
00:57:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, the biggest thing is just that it's optimized that it is Kind of like error-proof the better the system is that the least likely it will be to make a mistake But also the clearer it is and the better if he can understand it, then he can know how to be successful Faster and then also that takes time off your plate So you have more time for higher level activities like this, which is creating the strategy for what you do next Okay Good job, Pudgy All right, that's it.
00:57:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I will send you the notes. I'll go. I was gonna tell you one more thing that I got excited about You know the position referral thing. Uh-huh. And the rest I don't that thing was where would I see this I think you gave it the homework it was called Fujinaka Growth Forecaster Spreadsheet and the physician recruitment where's my drive that's called Fuji Growth Forecaster there it is yeah and if you look August 2024 there was a big drop-off between July and August for Renbaum recruiting went from like 9,000 to 4,600 and that was because for the contract I made 5% off my recruitment for the first 18 months and then it reverted to 3% so that's why there's this giant drop-off in the amount I made so what I was thinking was asking the owner of that company hey when you put me back to my original 5% in return I will do what's called editing work for your for your doctors like when they submit their med that legal report, I'll edit it, I'll read it, fact check it, make sure it's okay. So my wife and I were exploring and obviously I wouldn't be doing it. I didn't tell this, but I would, I would have, I would train a couple of Guatemalans to do it for me and using my chat TPT thing that I was just going to ask you what would that cost you to do? Yeah, essentially it would cost me about the Guatemalan, each Guatemalans about a thousand a month for full time. So I would have two, so about $2,000 a month to do probably two to four hundred reports. So I think it would make, like the margin would be about 70 percent, we figured. Okay. So like if I made, like just this account would make me $5,000 off, I don't need, I don't need two of them to do it, I just need one, but it made me about five extra thousand a month off of $1,000 of cost.
00:59:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that that's a great plan to do that. Yeah.
00:59:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Yeah. is like this other column. Here at CME, this contract is fixed at 2.5% and this is how much I'm making, so for these guys, I was going to go to them and be like, hey, can you give me 5% and I'll do all the editing for you, and hopefully this will double.
01:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really good.
01:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
I would expect this to double, and then I would have to hire second one at that point.
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So again, I just want to reiterate. So getting all this data organized and it not seem tedious, but every time we look at it, it marks a question, which returns revenue very quickly. So when we looked at what's his name's face, and I still don't have an answer yet, and then you probably don't have it as to if he's happy with your reports that you went to chat GPT because he was yeah, he's like, I'll let you know. He hasn't complained yet, so that's something, but almost every week we find something that can be. that you do very quickly to get you thousands of dollars more, if not more. It all comes from analyzing data that you already have but haven't been looking at or organized and then looking at it. So just a reminder that it's the same thing with Mark and it takes him months to just do it and then one day he'll be like huh and he'll finally just go get some numbers together and we've got a whole new plan. So if you were to do stuff like this every week, which by the way we're not finished with all of the homework because one of the things was to basically do the level of work that we just did with July for all of your businesses. But when all of them, when we have that understanding of their data inside out and what the leverage points are for every single one of them, your ability to double your revenue without increasing your time spent working. Just we just get their songs. much faster. I really do think that that's possible, especially because of what happens every time we do look at your data, you're like, Oh, we can do this. And like, that's brilliant.
01:02:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3)
Love it.
01:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So let's keep doing it. All right. Well, you it's Monday. Have an amazing week.
