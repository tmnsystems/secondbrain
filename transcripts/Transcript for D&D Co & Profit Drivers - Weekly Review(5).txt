00:00:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, what does... yeah I do.
00:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So shows you where to brush like timing wise so it's like front front back of each quadrant and then it can tell if you're moving if you're moving the brush too fast if you're whatever it'll like giving an alert be like you're too much movement and then when you're done then it'll go back over these areas and at the end it gives you like a little report sometimes it's like well this this area still not good it doesn't have you rebrushed but it just lets you know like hey and it's all good like your your smile's all sparkly. I'm like okay oh I've had this one problem area she's like all right just because I told her she's like all right the moment of truth she's like oh wow yeah no it's way better and I had a regular non-app version of that brush that I've used for years.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah That's amazing.
00:02:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know who knew um us because data Yeah, exactly That's so funny like I mean it is but it isn't the like numbers for the win number so the truth what I say number so the truth Right for real and then it's like oh, yeah imagine having all kinds of health apps, which you can't Right Yeah, they've got your kind of get and then obviously just don't be consistent like I use it. I've adopted the habit You know instantly I use it every day. I use it every day for the day.
00:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got it That's crazy. What's it called?
00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's the version? Sonic care Something I Must go check this out before I forget song. Yeah, I'm gonna act it on Amazon And I got it because my brother had it and I just was like, oh, that looks different and I looked it up.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what to send to myself quickly. So, okay, cool. I'll send that to myself and then I can focus because you distracted me with something shiny but useful to health because like, I only had my very first cavity like two years ago. And it was, it's in the back and it's between two teeth and after they filled it, I still kept feeling pain. And so I was like, how do I fix this? Because I don't think I'm doing all the things and you want to know what made that pain go away? What? Well, chewing gum was xylitol.
00:03:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, wow.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep, not only that, like my jawline has changed and my facial muscles like are gone bonkers. Because it's kind of tough game, um, um, you know when people cleanse their teeth and you can see stuff like you couldn't really see much if I cleanse my teeth. And now it looks like everything's just popping out of my face. Like my facial muscles have changed that much just from chewing gum. Like it's wild. The things that make a difference. But yeah, but now I get data. So we like that.
00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you had your call with Mark already?
00:04:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like 10.30.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How'd that go?
00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it was, uh, I don't know how you, I don't know if it's Magneto or Magneto. Yeah. guys, so I didn't know who they were. Mark talked them once and then was like, all right, let's get on the call. What's funny is like, I'm literally getting on the call and I don't know if Mark's like, he's like, well, Dan's going to be joining the call. And he's like, Dan's really smart. Like I mean really smart and the guy's like, oh, okay, and then that's right when I came on. I was like, all right guess i'm called over. I don't need hear anymore So they I wasn't understanding what they were saying at first. I had a piece of together and it's because they had talked and I was like all right and I at first I thought they were in agency that also Provided a boat room meaning hey, we run the ads on your site your account And then send the lead to our phone or say in my head. I'm like, hey, I can make that work I know I could do that And then I've asked them that I go, hey Hey, my getting was right and they're like, no, We were referring to your phone Okay because they're like an agency agent And then they said no, we're not because we're performing both of And I go, okay, so there's no management fee, there's no percentage of ads, they want to get paid on qualified lead for retainer, preferably retainer, because they're like, that's where you guys are really making money. So I guess par kids sort of gone over some of the numbers with them in the first call. And so I only, it was like an hour meeting, but it only had a half an hour. I didn't realize I was just needing an hour. So at some point I totally, you know, I was like, okay, I do this all the time, by the way, just so you know, because I know you'll love this. I literally go, okay, this is the part where I start swearing. And then I start swearing. So I just told them, said, hey, look, here's the deal. It's going to be a 5% conversion. I can tell you right now. So the question is, can you get a cost per lead that works out of 5% conversion? And the answer to that question is yes or no. And the only way that changes is if Mark is willing, or for whatever reason, decide that his cost per retainer can go up and then that changes all the numbers downstream. But, you know, we'll go into this with the target cost per retainer, obviously. And then, you know, I was like, where are you guys stronger? Facebook or Google because they brought up a boat. So, I'm like, what? No, we don't know. I go, no, dude, one of the up. We're not doing both. And I said, I don't have a preference, but I will just tell you that I've yet to see somebody figure out of Google at scale. So, and we hired a firm that had it all had cracked the code. So, I was like, I told them the whole tier 11 story. And I said, you know, we do the whole dog and pony show, which he has. I don't want to hear that. And I don't want to see that right now, right? Let's just talk about. that we did the whole dog of pocket show and then when numbers started getting put up on the board it became Plainly evident that they did not know this business.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so I said look if it's not Clear to you. I go have you ever done? Car accident. No, I go okay And I go so here's the deal if you want to get into this space You could not find a better partner to work in Period and they said we recognize that They're like after our first conversation with park. We realized that he is operating on a different level and I was like correct So I got I'm not there. Yeah, I said look I gotta jump off this call And I said I'm gonna be Plain, know toes transparency mark. I am not against hiring these people And then I was like, I gotta go. And then, so Mark just texted me, then they dropped a set-up fee on him. So I'm gonna go back and say, hey, the set-up fee be paid to your level. Whatever that was, I think it was five grand. We're not paying, they want a 15 grand set-up fee.
00:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not happy. No. Yeah.
00:09:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. you're in it for the loan haul, you're gonna pay for more than 15 grand. Yup. Some kind of fee sure, I ran sure, that's fine.
00:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a WAM van. Thank you, Offer price right there.
00:09:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they're not gonna be building the funnel we are. So there's reasons because they're like.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know.
00:09:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, they were. Because they're on high level. I said, we, they're like, you use high level wheel-setting the landing page. That's the landing page on high level. And then I explained all my first party tracking, and they were like, really? said, really?
00:09:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah-ha-ha-ha. Hi.
00:09:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My name is Dan Ryan, and you've listening to You're going to get that go. All of that will go into high level. Don't worry. And they said, wow, that's great. Yeah, I know. So I go, it's all going to come down to leave guys. Period. And sorry. So we'll see. I mean, then I literally did jump off call. But they seem nice. I mean, they, they, they definitely, they definitely understand. But now it's just like, that's all well and good. And, but you can either generate these leads or not. Their background is all mass force. So mass ports are over, ostensibly. So they're trying to transition into envy. They're doing other areas of law successfully. Like, I think they said, bankruptcy. And with those clients, they've learned that they have to go in and like, do the Tina level to like, consult on. Hey. your team's not doing a great job here. Hey, your business model should be more like this. And they are, those clients are picking up what they're laying down. And they're like, we clearly don't need to do that here. I said, no, you do not.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you do that.
00:11:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Mark said, oh yeah. So Mark also said they want to do meta. should. That's where they're the strongest. They should go with where their strengths.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, exactly. If that's what they know, that's what they should do.
00:11:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. So it's a good thing I've learned Mark and learned to trust him and that he's one of those good guys. I've finally got to know enough of him. Like, I know you. Okay, I'm gonna give that context for a quick. So I was like, when his dad died, I'm like, want to be careful how much they say because like, I didn't know his how, whatever, Chona. Yeah, the whole bonding thing when people, learn nurturing. So he's good. And but he was like, do you have signal? And I'm like, uh, no. And I'm like, oh, am I missing something? Why? And he's like, because messages disappear. And I'm like, Hey, I know I can trust Mark. I have no idea what this is about. And if there's anybody else I'd be like, that is inappropriate. And so as soon as we get on there, he's like, okay, now I can start telling you about all these things that technically for business reasons, he can't tell me. Sure. And I was like, like, I knew you had a good reason for it. But I could not like my brain didn't. I didn't know what I didn't know what it was going to be. But yeah. Yeah, no. So I'm really glad that he has that. So he's giving me some insight for what I can do to help him with Jonah because like he's been trying to dance around things and I was not picking it up at all because my brain just like, I don't know. When I'm in an analytical mode, which is where I'm at with business. I'm not picking up on nuance at all. I'm like, that's a question.
00:13:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, because there are things he's not supposed to be a part of and be helping, and he's not really doing, but I'm asking questions and wanting him to do it. He's like, he can't even tell me he can't. Like, he did that and he felt uncomfortable telling me that because it's just like, right. Anyway, so that only happened a few days ago. So, I'm going to get to new insight, but like, Tona got sick and she's been overwhelmed. I don't know where you guys are at with this, like the doctor follow up scheduling sequencing thing, but the whole, there's two things going on, three things. One is that there's a limit to what he technically can do, can't do. There's a limit to the pace. She can go combined with what he wants her to do because faster, faster, faster, but I'm like, dude, this is all new like she's having to wrap her head around it, but also physically the workload like this was not her life before and that's a huge adjustment, but also mentally and emotionally being in the workforce dealing with patience and then bureaucracy and all this other stuff. I'm like the speed that it's going is really good and Don't try to break it and don't forget. That's your wife. Don't try to break her and then the third thing is just the the diplomatic way of building a business inside of somebody else's business So That cannot go fast, especially when the doctor they're working with basically has the equivalent of Mary in there. And yeah, so, and Jonah is a woman, not a man, so that makes the threat and the way that the threat is handled, you know, an issue, especially also because Jonah is Filipino. So, you know, her tendency is going to be to kind of bow a little bit, but also Filipino women can be like crazy strong. And she's like, she goes in between both of those. Like, he's got the strength in her and it comes out sometimes, but then other times she feels kind of cowed. And so, like, she's vacillating between these two parts of her. like, that takes time. All of that takes time to learn basically at the dance.
00:16:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, so, uh, just- Well, in listening to this, now I'm wondering, like, should we- does she need yet a third person, like me or Eric, starting to chirp at her, or is that gonna be a bad thing?
00:16:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, it depends on what you say, but it'll probably be useful. She's crazy smart. She loves the system's component of it, and I think she loves anything that will be leveraged. I think she's got a nerdy component in her, for sure. The things that frustrate her are being hand-tied with the scheduling and interacting with her own patients, and then physically having to write things out because of her language, um, barrier, because she's not, you know, English is her second language, and also she doesn't feel like she's got good handwriting at all, which I can- Well Mike I've been typing my whole life. I had one of my daughter's teachers tell my daughter that can't possibly be her mother's signature. I'm a the it ain't you guys.
00:17:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My handwriting is horrible.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ableton sent a card.
00:17:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Ableton sent a card to Denise the other day. Hey she writes in cursive which I thought was interesting and it's great. I'm like oh my god she has such nice handwriting. It's striking.
00:17:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah my girls do too. Well my oldest just got amazing handwriting and I'm like yeah this is chicken scratch it's terrible. Anyway so those are tonus issues. I don't think although I would really really love to be CC'd and looked in on anything that goes to her.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well that's I was gonna say next.
00:17:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes because I really feel like so every time I talk to her she's like thank you so much. I'm so glad you're in my corner like I feel like I'm part of this. I've talked about Ironman suits like around my geniuses, but like I'm part of that for her like she takes a deep breath and like anyway. So that way also I can sense that something's overwhelming her. Maybe I can help field some of the questions but either way I can just probably help smooth up that process and like I said make sure it doesn't have a well mar. So yeah I don't think we need a whole back. I think that would be really helpful but depending on the day she's having and the week she's having having me in there to help out would probably be good.
00:18:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right well then I held off because they were gone and she was sick. Is she not sick anymore or still sick?
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's finally back to normal.
00:18:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay then I will send an email today and it's very simple where the leads come from. That's where we start. because Mark didn't know and I didn't expect him to know but she someone there is gonna know. Mark can't tell you. Okay whatever.
00:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well actually what this is my point though maybe we have a signal conversation instead of email and other things.
00:19:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well we have to see where they're coming from in the office right like how was she getting.
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't think Mark can talk about that at all so she can. I want her to tell us.
00:19:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I want to see how are you gonna like we want to avoid this parsing and Xavier because it's not scalable. So it's like where are these leads come from? Who is the lead source? Are we gonna have to get with that lead source like unfortunately with you know a bunch of Mark stuff we do have to use Xavier but we don't need to scale with Mark right we don't need to have a thousand marks. If you have a thousand marks I would never want to use it.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm meeting with her tonight at six o'clock. Do you want to be there for a few minutes?
00:20:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Let's check in.
00:20:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, Thanks. But I'll send that email today.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:20:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And you now know the context completely because it's literally going to be like one, two, three, live. Yeah.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. And then anything I get confused on, I'll ask Mark and I know a safe place that I can ask him.
00:20:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right.
00:20:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. I've been like pacing on my phone because my freaking blood sugar has been all over the place. It's kind of a good thing though, because now I know like why I feel why I feel sometimes, but I don't know why it does what Six thirty last night and I ate a good, good meal and it's. that I've, like, kept, well, actually, I probably should have had... No, I had a ton of protein. Anyway, point is, it was low, and then I went to bed, and it just crawled up until the time I first ate. then when I ate, it dropped, and it did the same thing yesterday. It kept rising with no food in my body, put food in my body, and it dropped. It dropped to 70 after breakfast yesterday morning after it had been climbing all night long. Like, I went hypoglycemic after eating.
00:21:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that seems weird.
00:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it is weird.
00:21:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, it reminds me of, I'm gonna have to look it up. So this dude, I don't like this person, but he developed some sort of diabetes like you, late in life, about a year ago. And he was like, this is impossible. This is impossible. like it's impossible that this is and it turned out to be something else and he and he corrected it first i think um i know this backwards i don't know if he no he's uh i'll have to uh i'll have to check there but i don't want to do that but i will i'll do it for you thank you he corrected it with by it because he was like there's no way i'm doing this there's no way i'm going on insulin there's no way and it wasn't it wasn't really diabetes but what you just said sounded similar to what he experienced that it was like all over the place for no reason like as if it were internal almost that it's most likely an issue probably with my liver and my pancreas um but i can't figure out i'm not going to get on insulin and i don't need to
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you. It's not in the danger zone. And the only time it's gotten really high has been because I had a lot of sugar and then went to bed. But the thing is, those times I had a lot of sugar, it was because it just kept dropping and dropping and dropping even when I ate.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, I'm like, what the? should run by Jenny Roberts. You probably nerd out on that.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm already nursing out on it. Um, and I'm feeling hot and dizzy right now. And I don't know why, although I think, yeah, it's, it's so I do know why. So it was at 136 at 1131. And it is now at 81. And guess what happened between then and now? I ate. Isn't that supposed to? Anyway, I got it. Um, so this doesn't feel good and my brain is going and my heart, my heat is going. Okay, so let me go to my damn mouth because I got it. It's hard to think right now when it's doing this, but at least I know like not crazy like my body is clearly doing so Yeah, yeah take a more brain with it. I Have my notes. Oh go to my nose. Oh Also, perimenopause. I'm just saying I got some out girls and go through the second.
00:24:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can I just tell you?
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
double double It's whale and trouble. Okay, and it ain't the cauldron burning. It's my body At least it's not affecting my nose. not really. Oh, we got our massage chair yesterday Yes, my child was very happy. I wasn't unhappy. was pretty happy Okay, we like oh another 71. Oh, so where What's the status of the new offer for another 71?
00:24:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is that?
00:25:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Melody, the infusion of... Okay. She's like her team does all the infusions. And I don't know that it was because they weren't ready or what, but my guess is it was because of that.
00:25:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then, so yeah, so it's not that bad. We weren't, you know, we're not launching until after Black Friday. it doesn't matter. If it's ready to go, we literally just change the products in the cards and it's live.
00:25:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So when you said they asked to push the meeting until when?
00:25:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This coming Tuesday.
00:25:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Until... I can type. All right. Oh, yeah. So we talked about doing a simulator of how much the revenue would change if you change the price and we went down a little rabbit hole. Do you do you do anything after we talked about that?
00:26:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We did it on the call. I remember that.
00:26:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So it was $432,000 and you were talking about doing it. Did you talk to Jeff about that?
00:26:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
because I'll do it when it's closer to closer to right.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. Sorry. I really am starting to struggle mentally right now. It's me off. Um, so just for reference. It was out. 138, and then I ate, and now it's 81 and going down like quickly, like it's a drop off. I'm gonna text the T for reference just so you can see like, and also maybe you'll think of that guy when you see this and tell me what you think. All of those spikes were not from eating. All of the dips just, I ate something, and then it went down. But it has gone down from 138 to 80 in the course of an hour, and that feels like . I'm swearing a lot. You see, you know. Okay, um bullets for Jeff. No guarantee this keeps working.
00:27:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yes. Okay, so you're gonna wait.
00:27:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Huh? Huh? Hello? Did you lose you? Dan?
00:27:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What happened?
00:28:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to turn off some on my phone and see if this works. Is this better? Because if not, it's not me. don't think it's me. Ten. I just heard you, but it was still choppy. What the crap?
00:28:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just heard in. aggressively. Where are you right now? I can't hear you. Ooh, let's just try a phone call. I'm gonna end this and call you. Hangin' up. Zoom. Zoom.
