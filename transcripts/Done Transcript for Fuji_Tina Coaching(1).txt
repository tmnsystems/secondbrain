00:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning. How are you?
00:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Something happened to my speaker. Hold on. Where is my speaker? Testing, testing. You hear me now? Yep, there it is.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. Good. How was my birthday?
00:00:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good. Yeah, she was really happy at the beach, I think. We are going to take her to Disneyland next week, so that will be her other little two-day Disneyland trip.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. And next week we're good for 10 a.m.
00:00:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's a good question. Let me double check that. Labor day, yeah.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we will be good. Okay, good. We're having our little vacation.
00:01:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We'll be back Sunday night.
00:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not a problem for me either. like, I like not moving my calls unless I have vacation or something going on if I vacation, but otherwise stay on track makes it easier for me.
00:01:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, cool.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Mark works pretty much every weekend. So I mean, every, every holiday. And he's another Monday meeting. And the other client I have on Mondays too. So let's see. I gotta go back to your emails. had them open and then I lost them. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was definitely on the it's not. So in terms of just looking at your stuff. For me, the thing that always to look at is just just awareness. So, there's lots of things that make an impact on sleep. Think about what they are, notice them from time to time. If things aren't the way that you want to, try and change the things that do make a difference on sleep just biologically for everyone, see if it helps, but I think the biggest things that you've noticed is that getting enough sleep makes a huge difference for you. You did take a nap a couple times and you're, let's see, trying to remember what happened with that.
00:02:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think I had any apps, did I?
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
might have been the macros I was thinking about, because anyway- Oh yeah, I saved this. Yeah, so anyway, yeah, paying attention to that, we don't, we don't have to go into that, but all of the practices. is and again with the holistic approach is because your business runs on you and you run on sleep and you trip in and everything else so do pay attention to it do what you can but the other thing was being obsessive about it doesn't do well so it almost seems like i'm being contradictory because we dug into it too much there's a difference with how much weight you give something mentally so i look at it but i don't think about it the rest of time i look at it and go huh maybe i'll try this put it in an experiment and then i'm not thinking about it anymore i don't worry about it so and knowing that you can make adjustments throughout the week like you did that with ester ester was giving you extra time to sleep in right so that was something that you did I do think that macros didn't make a little difference, but that's okay. If it doesn't just pay attention to those things, we don't need to talk about them. If you have any, you just like notice things are bad, rough, whatever, just see if anybody else has any ideas. if I have ideas, that's fine, but I love the business stuff too. But the holistic approach is always just, how are you? How are you taking care of yourself? Are you taking care of yourself? Do you are, you know, that's it. So it's a small conversation, a little bit every week, and I'll ask you that, are you taking care of yourself? How are you doing? Have you been feeling? That's important. The details can be up to you, but what happens sometimes is I'll catch up. Like when you got on the call today, there was an exhale, and that could have just been nothing, or it could be just, there's a lot going on, and I'm just trying to get focused.
00:04:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so as I get to know you a little bit better, I'll run back from an open house. So I was trying to rush in the
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
door to make the meeting see there's lots of little things so I'll ask about it because I just want to make sure because we don't usually have people taking care of us in our business now you have your wife taking care of you but seeing how that correlation is to the business and also she's going through so much right now she needs to be taken care of so that's that's just kind of part of it so it's it was a getting to know you all these things love it all right so did you happen to notice any correlation with movements to sleep at all uh it's hard not I I really don't know I mean yeah yeah yeah I for me I can make the correlations but because there's so many guardables it's almost always that some things are good one day but the other things are bad yeah so and that's again why knowing what things make it difference because some things will be bad. But if I can get the other things in, for example, if I just was super stressed out or whatever, and I didn't get a lot of movement, I just walk, I pace my house. And I sleep a little bit better. get to sleep better. I digest better. Blah blah blah. Anyway, okay. So you got all the reports done. Yeah? Yeah. That felt good.
00:06:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And you're down and here's happy with you. Yeah. And well, we'll see he hasn't responded. I texted him. I said, he sent you all the reports. He said, okay, I'll look over him find you didn't he changes. I'll let you know. So I'll feed those into the model when they come.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like you said somebody was happy with you about it though.
00:06:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, my manager, Nicole. That's what I said and your manager, right?
00:06:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah.
00:06:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. She was happy.
00:06:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's been bugging me. She messages me every three days.
00:06:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're not going to let those stop pile anymore unless he gets Oh, about it.
00:07:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that was fun though, because I could I could I want to try to keep training in the model now that I know I'm getting closer with it.
00:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay, so let me where's my notes, I have them open. I am tabzilla over here. Um, I'm going back and forth. Actually, I just need to keep multiple windows open with your message and my notes. Spending any time on Delta. And you got her, let's see. um, it's Esther's manager. What's her first name just so I can instead of saying Esther manager, I can say a name, one word.
00:07:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's Nicole.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's Nicole. Okay. So you have the confidentiality and trade sequence.
00:07:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, that's her. Yeah, actually, uh, last. Yeah, I emailed her, talked to her and I messaged her again, and yeah, this is reminded of her, know, and then I then I told her how to do the, the requests for Q and E that requests for Q and E numbers. So yeah, she hopefully she'll get on that.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Did you give her a due date for requesting them this time so we can get them soon?
00:08:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was gonna have, I was gonna have a wait till September 1st.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when do you think that we'll have the most recent reports?
00:08:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They usually take about seven days, so if you request sit on September 1st, then maybe about September 10th, do want to get it?
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They're the state, they're like DMV.
00:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then she's going to request them on the first, or roughly that every month.
00:09:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I also had her send me a brief. Extra night of brief email about how many upcoming visits we have and how many visits we had the previous month. So I'll start having her check that and giving us reports so we can see how we did the previous month and how we're looking at how many appointments we have booked for the coming month.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. And did you ask yourself why you haven't done that yet before?
00:09:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, just that I, you know, I do it sporadically, but I never had a system that to watch that. So now you're going to do that. Yes. Good. Now, because I was sending you the numbers and I know that I know the cash flow coming in and you know I can watch that weekly how much cash comes in. into the account but I don't know but I don't know how like my current month is or the month before was.
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right it's great because when you when you watch those patterns it gives more certainty so sometimes it can alleviate stress but also like if you have it and just think oh I'm not doing well but the other thing the other potential issue is complacency and apathy about it and just like do the thing and then you realize that there's a pattern of a little less a little less a little less and it's much harder to try to correct what's happening you know when you're not watching it so and it's very it's so much easier to maintain than to catch up.
00:10:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure that makes a second believe that. I kind of want to put it on the manager a little at the end because I was listening to I am I did leave a little bit to kind of power her, I said, hey, what, what, tell me also give me one sentence, what do you see in this trend, and what do you think, if anything, we should recommend what we should do. So I do want to put it on her because she's supposed to take everything off Esther's plate, manage the whole business, that part of it. So I did kind of put that in there to send me a little sentence or two every month about what she sees in our numbers, because if my numbers drop off, she's not going to have a job, right? If something has to get cut, Esther's going to come back to work, we're not going to need a manager anymore, you know, we're going to tighten ships. So it's in her best interest as well to like make sure my numbers stay popular.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Love that.
00:11:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So we'll do that.
00:11:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazing job delegating, very, very good.
00:11:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Now that I think about it, maybe I should just have her since she's actually in the county, maybe she should just put this into a spreadsheet.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. of everything that you have. So, then the other thing is potentially you might want like kind of like a dashboard workbook. So with Google Sheets, just like Excel, you can pull data in from multiple sheets and documents or because sometimes if you put too much data, they get big, they take too long to open. So pulling from multiple ones might be the thing to do, but either way, whatever, you want to have all the pertinent information in one source as often as possible like a snapshot slash dashboard so that it's very easy for you to be very mindful about where everything is and it's also very easy for you to track and make sure that whoever is responsible for getting the data is doing it because you have one thing to look at and is everything populated. So... Let's see, um, KPIs are, um, how many appointments coming in? how many get canceled would be a good one. So what else are you tracking that matters to you that, you know, a difference in your business? Thank you, Mise.
00:13:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, yeah, so there are initial consults where I see them the first time and and reevaluations where I see them subsequent times. So I want to make sure that I'm getting enough initial consults. So I actually told her to split the report. Tell me how many initials new patients I get because that tells me how I'm going to be how I am doing. And then how many follow ups I get follow ups just tell me, you know, what's the kind of the reoccurring business, but it's the new. all the time that comes in. So I did have her split that report up like that. That's really the biggest thing that we're that I'm tracking on the health of the business. Everything else is pretty constant that costs for the schedulers, the cost for, we pay someone to pre-call the patients so that I don't have to talk to them so long. The cost for the story to pre-call and we pay someone to summarize my records for me. So they take all the raw records, all the Kaiser records, and condense it into 100 pages. like all those things are pretty constant. So it's really just how much inflow we have that determines our number.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so everything is referred to you, right? Yep.
00:14:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
by attorneys, only I feel like you said that there was another source.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, this, is it's a lottery pick based on what I write, write, sorry, I want to go, I, I will probably for a while mean go live medical with me. Yeah. Okay, so that's the lottery. And that's why we want the report so that we can try to get that now. I mean, it's 100% a lottery, right? They don't remove anybody that got something last month and we don't know.
00:15:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just we think that like they don't tell you how it's done, but they tell you it's by zip code and and your proximity to that zip code. But we have tried putting like two names, like we put myself in two zip codes to see if it doubles my count. It doesn't really double it. So we think there's more to the algorithm than just, you know, zip code.
00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if they don't share that with us.
00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We're not. You did explain that before, but again, there's a lot to kind of memorize about how the business works. It's a very niche area.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Okay.
00:16:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thankful for the very profitable for us for the time I spent on it.
00:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can only be in 10 cities at a time, right? And you have that max out. We're going to get that reports where we can do some numbers. Is it possible to get a retroactive? So when they send you the reports, is it for the month or do they send you the whole year? Do they send it broken down by months?
00:16:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, what do I to call what I want to call this? I'm just having her send it month by month.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because what would be really interesting is to see some historical data over like the past two years month by month plotted to see if there's any kind of variation or any kind of pattern to observe by location.
00:17:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we have all the data. We have it all. It's created a sales force, a custom sales force.
00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I mean, the, the, the, so how many incidents, how many doctors over time.
00:17:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. Don't give it to you.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just have to request it from the state. So when she requested, can you request that so we can have so we can look at the, if there's any, any kind of patterns that might pop out in terms of is everything pretty consistent. Is there any kind of big jump, whatever.
00:17:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So kind of like a month, a month by month. Over the last two over the last year.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
something right so by how many incidents and how many doctors and the population I'm sure the population doesn't change a lot but we don't want to make any assumptions so there are so many zip codes and there are you know development areas what do we not know that most people are never going to dig into and this may seem like not a big deal but like when we so I'll give an example for sweet law that I feel is totally appropriate and uh you're not going to go tell me maybe it's not appropriate I don't know I have to think about this just operations-wise but basically what we did and I can make it generic enough that it won't matter is that we looked at a few different things that impacted the business um like where where things come from where the leads come from um states things like that and what we noticed is that we have a dependency tea upon a couple of things and didn't seem to have a lot of ability to increase those. But we just put some effort into that and it created some leverage to show where a couple of things dropped off that would have cost us the business like just put us in a horrible situation. We had mitigated that by knowing what the data was and manipulating it to the best of our abilities and it ended up making all the difference in the world. For example, because you are able to move locations easily, just kind of get a satellite office, whatever. If we happen to see that there is some shifting happening, you could do that. I know location that's just exploding right now. but for whatever reason, no doctors are increasing there or it's not increasing at a proportionate rate. And maybe that's only going to be for a short amount of time before somebody gets there. That short amount of time could be a year and half, so it takes you six months to get there. You have a year there kind of dominating the area because nobody else noticed.
00:20:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll add that to Nicole's thing. She's going to send me that when she first requests this, she's going to send me a draft of the email.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So to that email, I'll add, I'll tell them, I want to separate Excel tab for each of the previous months as well, going back, I'll even go back six months over the beginning of 2024. Plus, I would imagine that there's a correlation between construction and accidents.
00:20:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I don't know. It's by zip code, so.
00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so like if there's a development and there's just a lot of popular development happening in a particular location, which if a developer invests, that would happen. Anyway, I don't know. But looking at the data is how it helps us to figure out is there anything that we can really do about it. So if there's not, do you have the option of getting another doctor that works for you, that is that a possibility that it's completely separate other business, but that you hold the purse strings and.
00:21:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so the way the business works right now is 100, you know, 100% of the money comes in, so 2000 a report. And then I pay me personally, and the doctor pays 40% to be 46. B46 is the billing and collection company that Esther owns. Okay. So our former company called Ava used to be that collection company. We actually had 15 of my friends. I recruited them in the. that. And so we were doing revenue of about 750,000 a month to that company. And that's the one that our partner was a and we closed it because we're like, we don't care how much we make, it's not worth being a business for that guy. So we actually came. was tricky legally because we didn't want to get sued for, you know, essentially closing a business starting a new one. But that's what we did. closed the old one, started a new one with just me and one of my friends who's my oldest friend. So we could argue in court that, well, I knew this guy before Ava, before we closed it, he's my long friend. That's why he came to our new billing company. So our current billing company has me and one of the QME that we make that Esther's company, B46, makes the 40% from. But yeah, it's always a quite, we were thinking like Esther thought, do we want to expand again? Maybe we can't I take the same 15 doctors because of non-competes, but we could go out and recruit 15 or however many new doctors to get that remedy. But right now, we're in a good place in our life, and it's pretty simple with just me and the other doctor for her and our manager. If we were to increase or double the size of that doctorable, we would have to increase the number. Scheduler has increased the number of editors, historians. The whole operation becomes more difficult with each doctor and astronaut just made the decision work. Right now, anyway, we're not going to expand, but yeah, you're absolutely right, your sense system. That is a way you can expand is get other doctor, private doctors to work for our building company, and we take 40% of their cut. We take a cut of 40%.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that something that you think about? This is not the season of life, but you want to do it? I just want to understand what all the goals and the values are. are because I love that you guys have put a limit on and understood what happens if you scale up the burden of management. I think her having her company that she does really is a great kind of partnership because understanding that a lot of people just don't take that into account. They don't think about how much work it is to manage that increase. But it's a lot. And everything is a trade-off and sometimes that trade-off is just not worth it.
00:24:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I love that you guys have thought about that. Yeah, we think that, you know, we increased back if we built back up to 15 and we're doing revenue, you know, that revenue. have ways we think we would have been more profitable. Like we we we've now outsourced 50 percent of her workforce. So we have three W-2 U.S. employees, which are incredibly expensive, right? like 7,000 a month. And then on the backside, actually have three Filipino that are... the cost of one US workers. So, you know, if we redid this, we know how we would scale it in the future. But, you know, the profit margins weren't as impressive. Like, you think, oh, you know, this guy makes 15,000, you see seven patients, he makes 14,000 of revenue in one day. 40% of that comes to our business. Well, we were actually only seeing like profits of our cut. We were only seeing like less like 5% profit maybe. And that was because we had an entire US workforce. So, we think that when we did a Filipino workforce, we could probably get closer to like 20% profit margin. But, you know, much is that for the amount of work? Because now your operation is just ridiculous. And is that that much money for that amount of work? So, that's the other thing we're balancing. Like, it's just, we, you think it's really profitable because it's like, holy cow, you know, 40% of $2,000, to schedule this. doctors visit but yeah the profit margins just weren't that high and I've talked to other owners of building companies and they say the same thing yeah our profits are like 20 percent and or yeah or 8 percent other one says 8 percent so yeah that's the other reason we're just like you know we could wrap back up to the 15 doctors but you know is that is it worth it for that amount operational headache right um maybe one day I'm not sure right okay so let me make sure that I I write this and keep asking that question yeah we've thought about it quite a lot because it's so yeah we I mean you know from a recruitment standpoint I don't think I'd have trouble bringing in other trends to do this it's such a lucrative gig but yeah I mean there's just a lot how do you get to it's so lucrative and then it's five percent so like
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the doctors, it's lucrative, right, because you make 60% of $2,000 per visit.
00:27:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And if I see, if I see seven patients a day, which is typical, that's $14,000 and I get 60% of that. So that's like $9,000. mean, a doctor, there's, there's very few doctors in the United States that can make 9,000 a day. Plastic surgeons will hit that. Yeah, maybe just plastic surgeons can hit that. I mean, but there's very few doctors that can make 9,000 a day, except in this. So.
00:27:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's two components to this. That is your billing company gets 5%. But you as a doctor, generating those leads for yourself that 60%.
00:27:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, 60% on company gets 40%. Right. And of that 40% we think the profit margins. 10% 5% who knows. Well, now it's higher, right, not because now we've cut out we've done. So now of that 40%, the profit margin closer to like 20, 30%. So our profit is already higher in Esther's billing company now, but the old company was like 5% or less profit margin.
00:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now your profit margin, her billing company is what?
00:28:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We haven't, it's only been open for the last year, so the trailing year, the numbers 30, maybe we think, maybe 20, maybe 15, I don't know. So what happened after that old company closed and we separated from our partner, I bring all my old business, like the legality of that, we're not quite sure. But we took all the business and we just said, more receivables are going to come into this new company, so it looks like we had this massive amount of revenue for very little work. So, technically, the old partner signed off is okay on that, so we're kind of legally covered, but so anyway, yeah, the whole last year and a half, like, revenue for B46 looks very good because we didn't have to do a lot of work for that revenue. But, but yeah, the trailing six months look like the profit margins are closer to 20.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I, my brain wants to ask questions about that, but I don't, I don't know if that's anything that you want to discuss about, but the one thing I would say is I'd get clear on that those numbers. Okay, because they're you're intermingling and you are, it's obviously taking that brain space. How well it's doing. It's an important thing to you into the family. So I would get really clear on the percentages and just go ahead and get your books really clearly caught up and then see what pops out.
00:30:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
anything.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you're doing better than you thought you were, not doing as good as you thought you are, either way, knowing is going to be really empowering, especially with the rest of the conversation that we will have. So the two tracks are interesting. So let me go back to the top of these notes real quick. You said Q and E is your most profitable thing, right?
00:30:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you currently spend about how many days a month?
00:30:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
feel like you said it was like 10 or 11. Oh yeah, I have this up, I was going to show you.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I share my video?
00:30:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you see? see a spreadsheet or do you see a profit and loss marketing by twenty twenty oh that's that's July sorry okay okay so this is my QME calendar okay let me show you September it's a little cleaner August was messy because of the baby so this is the first week of September on the top row second week of September I have two days of work you'll see one day is called depot that's where I do cross examinations from home I call into court essentially and then I have like one two three four five six seven seven so I start at nine and at four and there's always some cancellations and then the next day I work is Thursday and it says San Landro so I have I go to San Landro which is about an hour away and these the visits I have so I do about ten visits this day then the following week I do one two This is three, four. So I do four days of work there. The following week after that, I do one, two, So in the month, I do one, two, four, five, six, eight, nine. Yeah, about nine, nine or 10. Sometimes eight, seven, seven. We usually try to fill up the places, like this is kind of empty. We try to avoid days where we only see four patients. try to, but we're booking three months ahead. So sometimes it's hard to predict if a month is gonna fill up. So like we thought this would fill up with at least six, but it only got four in the lottery in Sanderfell. Okay. Daily City, we're over pack, right? have 12 here. So that's gonna be a really busy day. And Oakland, this is about right. has, think there's seven here, right? So there are six. So that's about right. Stock 10, again, this is a little on the heavy side. There's nine, I think here. Modesto, it's about right, about nine. That's almost perfect. And then Merced, we just opened a location in Merced, California. That only has two, but because we're starting it, we will accept just doing two visits.
00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have a question. You as a doctor can only operate in 10 cities. Is that correct or is it the business?
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, my name, you know, yeah, me as a doctor can only have 10 locations at once. And you see, I actually have two San Jose. I have a, I have a North San Jose and a South San Jose location because I was getting so much in San Jose. Unfortunately, like the one of the San Jose, it just hasn't really borne out. The, the South San Jose location hasn't filled up as much as we thought. But we were getting such high volume there. We thought, okay, well, let's split San Jose actually east and west. We took it. We have a west location that's killing it. Let's try and eat San Jose, but it hasn't borne. out that it's given us more. So it's one of the ones that we might close next.
00:34:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be interesting to see the correlation between your reports, your appointments and the reports and see if it lines up because there isn't an algorithm that you guys can figure out yet to see if there's anything. And that's also something that we can feed to chat GBT. We have to figure out how to get the data to align. But basically if we can put the put it in the spread sheet so that we can say here's all the lottery information. Here's how many doctors. Here's the zip codes. Here's the injuries. Here's what we scheduled. patterns do you notice if any?
00:34:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I could have chat sheet if you look at it because the you know it's the row is built of zip code. There's a number of doctors. and the number of lotteries total, and it wouldn't be too hard to add in my own column to that and say, this is actually how many I got in this one, and then just put that one number, how my manager put that number for any new code, and then now you have all the data on one, you could put that in and attach it to chat to BT and say, hey, look at these, only these zip codes, and the rows associated with them, what trends do you see? Yeah.
00:35:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what correlation do you see? But also I always ask it, what questions could I ask you to help me understand?
00:35:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because I don't know what I don't know.
00:35:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested. What kind of analysis should I be asking you to do? you know, what other data might be helpful? All kinds of things. I ask questions all the way around it, because it has better capabilities than I do, and there are just some processes that I wouldn't
00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
think of and sometimes it's helpful and sometimes it's not.
00:36:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes it's just very simple. So feed it the data but also say, you know, when you ask your question, what am I not asking that I'm missing out on that I could be getting from this data?
00:36:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. That's a good question.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ask it.
00:36:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I actually, I'll go ahead and request, like you said, the trailing months. Maybe I will do the two years, so I'll request the trailing two months of spreadsheets from the state of California. And then I have my manager just essentially go back and just put in. So, I'll probably have her put in the number of initials and the number of reevals. Yeah. think, oh, I don't know. The initials are what really tell me how I'm doing because sometimes I might get eight reevals, like if you don't like those, but some of these locations like you'll see in that like daily. city. I'm like, well, I got 10 people, but if you look at it, it's actually eight reevaluations and two initials. So that means, in the future, I'm only going to have two, if I only had two initials this month, I'm only going to get two return visits, because you usually see the patients.
00:37:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, right.
00:37:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, maybe in that spreadsheet, I don't know, think about it a little bit. Maybe I should just have, I'll put both numbers in, I'll have her do both, but the initial account and the reeval count, but the initial was the one I really want to, I really want to track. Okay. Yeah, but yeah, I'll do that.
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's a great idea. Yeah, so the other thing, the other question to ask chat TPT is, do you notice any trends changing where it seems like, okay, so I would tell it how your business works, fully explain the lottery system and say, my goal is to figure you're out if there's a way I can increase my odds at obtaining customers through the yeah through the lottery system do you notice anything sorry that's oh yeah I've got a that sweet law um in 20 minutes um do you notice anything that might increase and I would tell it all the parameters I can only be in 10 zip codes it takes me six months to create a new all everything give it and make that one chat the chat about Q&E numbers and lottery you know yeah and then come back and let me know what what it tells you what you notice and then we'll take that but yeah let's I love when people will play smart and leverage AI so we can get some really good data really quickly yeah that's really exciting I love it I love it my work on that all right so let me go I had everything shrunk so I could see this. Let me, I'm just looking at your P&L for a minute.
00:39:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Which book would be for July or MFF?
00:39:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, July. July for July.
00:39:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July for July, that's right.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, don't do that. Okay.
00:39:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The P&L. July P&L. July, July P&L.
00:39:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, you have January for July.
00:39:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July's been my best month. My August isn't shaping up to look like this. Like I actually, we settled $100,000 with the cases. August looks like it's going to be close to 60. Oh, wow. Yeah, varies quite a lot. Maybe even 40. I don't know. We'll see.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been doing it this by yourself like this separate from the previous business with the partners?
00:40:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I actually have it ready for you here If you could see this it's kind of small, but I started in April I Started in April of 2023 that was month one these numbers are like how many months I've been in business so Month 16 is July so I've been so as of July I've been in month 16 months It's been open 16 months and these are the number of referrals I got per month. So the first month I got 80 then 120 so on Yeah, so then the Follow-up visits can't be very much Yeah, so These are the number of new referrals, but I don't track the number of follow-ups yet I could probably add that next month So if you have total visits completed does that include follow-ups? Yeah, this is initials and follow-ups.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, just eyeballing that data. I would say you can't have that many follow-ups.
00:41:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, most of the time it's just one and done. I do an initial console and they're gone. I'm the MRI order.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I order MRIs to physical data. Is there a way, so I assume you get paid for follow-ups also. Yeah. And is it a profitable? Is it, is there any difference really in initial sources follow-ups in terms of profits?
00:41:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I reduced my billing by three and so I built 1,200 for the initials and then 900 for follow-ups. No, there's, it's usually just to probe out a percent. I'll follow-up on maybe 250. So, it's still great. anything above like 150, I'm really happy.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, There's multiple questions in this, but the best way to, well, we're always looking for leverage, and leverage is how do we get more out of what we already have. So there are already people that are coming across your path that have given you authority for whatever reason, lottery doesn't matter, but they have to talk to you, they have to deal with all these limiting parameters, right, they didn't come to you because they're trying to improve their health or whatever.
00:42:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But that doesn't mean there's not an opportunity for something.
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you were to think about it, and again, these are accidents or whatever, do you think that there's any kind of follow-up care type of package that falls within your legal ability to offer to them that you would want to do that is just a tiny bit that would encourage them to come back that also might be paid for by insurance and somehow could be connected to, you know, is something that already pays helps them get it paid for and you get money in your pocket and they get a little additional like ethically actual real value. And then it could be something that's just let's increase your odds of making sure that everything's okay for you and that you know how to recognize the signs that I can compare how you work whatever.
00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no, it's you're brilliant to pick that up so quickly. Yes, there is. So right now, I make for instance, we'll just use sweet law after the initial consults done and I take care of that. I wait for their case manager to say hey, my client needs a follow-up visit with July medical. Can you give my client? and that's how I wait for permission but to your point yes I could proactively reach out to the case manager and say hey it's been six months six weeks since your client saw me would you like your client would you like you know for me to check up with your client to see how they're doing in a follow-up visit and proactively bug them the second way I could do it is I could try to get MRI results sent to me right now the MRIs I don't know where they get their MRIs I'm agnostic I just give them the order and tell their lawyer send them to an MRI at a hospital I don't care I could be more proactive about asking the case manager send me their MRI send me their MRI so I look at it and that prompts the case manager say oh yeah they got the MRI why don't you see them again so yes there's there's actually one more part
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
part that I think that you could do that actually benefits you and the attorneys that send them over to you based off of what I know about street law is that first of all tag teaming a doctor and the attorney office saying we recommend you go in for a follow-up to make sure that nothing has appeared since your initial visits because it can right over time.
00:45:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, new body parts that started to get sore.
00:45:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and so it maybe it was there before but they just didn't notice and then it starts nagging long enough that their brain goes oh actually this is bugging me I just didn't realize because a lot of people just don't realize but the attorney's office benefits right because if they if the injury is more significant then higher settlement and they get a higher percentage and then you get more business but ethically we're also helping the person who's busy who really doesn't want to deal with any of this doesn't want to deal with our health issues that might happen. that more problems 10, 20, 30 years down the road, that if somebody had just looked out for them and said, you should go do this, and just make sure, because things do take time to kind of present themselves. So if you could create a system where, look, this is what happens, I need you to put it on your calendar in six weeks, mark a follow up, unless I tell you 100%, we don't need another follow up. And then you pitch them on the idea, the main person say, go make sure your people are doing this, because there's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I'm gonna tell you to do the math and you track it. There's no way that if you didn't implement a system like this, you're not going to see profit margins increase. It may not be a huge amount, but it for sure will be above and beyond what it costs you to do that.
00:46:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, okay.
00:46:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you're giving two authority sources, your attorney and your doctor telling you to do same thing. And as long as you know that you're being ethical about it, meaning there's nobody coming in, you're 100% sure they don't need to be reached out again, in which case you should tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up with this person so that you know you're operating an integrity.
00:47:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's going to give you a lift. Yeah, yeah, I agree. That's what was saying too. Yeah, I, uh, yeah, I don't have a real good answer for why I don't do that. Yeah, I don't have a good answer.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, I didn't ask a question. Why don't you do that? I'm just saying, let's do it.
00:47:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I right now, like, um, I'll have to think of a solution for a way to tag that it's been six weeks, six, eight weeks since their first visit.
00:47:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that actually comes back to you. What I wanted to see was how do you manage your clients?
00:47:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is your just done. This is confidential, so please don't share this.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't.
00:48:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no. Yeah, so when a new referral comes in, I simply, we have an email inbox. I actually don't even have an example here. So we get this email like this from an attorney and says, Hi, you know, my patient wants a new consultation. Please tell us when they fit. What we do is we've added an email program, and it allows us to tag emails. And we tag it as new referral. And once that tag gets on it, it goes to a scheduler. And then once the scheduling is done, they tag it that scheduling and demographics is done. It goes to another person who preps the the business notes. So they go into my Google drive and for a patient. they make a folder. So like they put their name on their folder, the patient's name, DataBird, and then they put this thing, they make an invoice, they do a new patient visit note, which is like a templated note, and then they do a order form note. So it has like prescriptions that I wanna have to memorize. And once my staff does that, then it's ready for the appointment. And so when I get on the phone or the video with them, I open the folder, it already has the invoice, it has the note, pretty much made the order form. I fill in the blanks. After the visit's done, I go through and I mark that the appointment's complete, which is what happened here. And then I okay it for final, and that lets the team send it out. So everything is done with email tagging. So that's why I was trying to figure out, is there a way, I just, don't know a good way to put the six-week tag, because once we're done, I put completed as a tag, but yeah, generally, I don't really know a good way.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll think about You could do initial complete and then follow up for six weeks, something like that. You would have to alter your system, but also, this needs to be in a database, and this needs to be in something. This long-term and scalable. There's much potential for loss, and also insufficient data. You can't go in and see how many cases are in X status. You should be able to see that.
00:50:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have sort of that. I can check how many... This column right, it don't tell me that there's 13 reports that we're waiting on the signature. These are okay for final. I have okay them, but the patient hasn't signed their... consent form, so we can't send them yet. So we do kind of have that, but like we don't have a way to like you know like rolling check like these are there's four people that are ready for today. These are the four that are going to have appointments today with us. So we kind of I can kind of see it like that, but it's all just very real time.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's not a great long term solution. It's amazing for being email. I mean, I'm proud for that. What's it called that you're using?
00:51:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I just did Melli's. Okay, so this goes back to two, you know, early on when we when I was talking to Mark about starting this business, we had said that, you know, we we have I have to be sort of careful that I don't get too big law firms to get big. But doctors, if we get too big, we stick up like a nail.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the insurance company is investing in us.
00:52:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So initially, I don't have to talk to Mark more about this, but he was saying, you know, you want to try to stay around like maybe 400 a month. And again, he's saying, you know, and obviously it depends on the lawyer, right? If you're taking cases from lawyers that confabulate, they lie about their cases, they try to make the patients look hurt, you're going to get investigated along with those law firms. So, you know, his point is always like, take good business. Yeah. And that's what, I mean, we have, I think for the most part been taking, like I've cut out a couple law firms that I know lie about their patients. But I am at that point, you can see from my numbers where we are getting really close to like that 400. so that's why like right now I'm really happy where I am. I'm not really looking at, like if I could just keep this volume, this is, I'm really happy. This is like a one point, maybe $1.5 million a year business for me. At this level, it takes very little work. I mean, I only work on this, what, four hour, five hours a week.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a ceiling that you've installed intentionally. And you're okay with that. And so then the your wealth increase you would want through July or. Delta or other other things and just make sure that this is managed. As well as possible to reduce maybe the time the energy. Maybe increase the profit margins by improving operations, but not increasing business volume.
00:53:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is that right? Yeah, that's a good summary. mean, yeah, it's at a good place right now. mean, like if you look at the P and L right like my contractors cost me 20,000 a month. I mean, that is, and you know, total expenses are about 40. I mean, it's my profit margins are about like for this month, we're about 60%. And I think the profit margin, I think, is only going to go up because I'm going to collect more for the same amount of expense. My expenses, this expense isn't going to go up. So, yeah, mean, I think if I start settling out more cases and I'm starting to make 150, 200 a month, that expense is going to stay the same. And, yeah, so anyway, yeah.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, and I did it again, I blended QME in July for a minute because we're talking about July 1st. So, QME and July have fixed ceilings that the most important thing that you can do inside of them is make sure that you've got the most efficient system. So, it reduces how much time, energy it takes and max profit margins, but there is a cap and you're very near the top at both of them.
00:55:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, mean, July, based on what I've heard from Mark with my current business in California, and QMEs, I'm limited by the 10 locations and physically how many days a month I want to do, or I can't do, QMEs, there are other ways I can expand.
00:55:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can get direct referrals for work comp, I didn't go into that with you.
00:55:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But for July, I mean, in California, this is where I kind of want to sit almost right there. The other way that we could do it is I could expand other states and start opening separate clinics in each state, right, and ramp each state individually up to 400.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is what we're doing with Sweet Law is expanding in the states, and that's been it's been crazy to watch.
00:55:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I heard, yeah, so actually I hadn't even readressed this ceiling issue until we just talked about it. But yeah, I mean, it's this operation. mission is so simple how I have it like with the email like actually now that you mentioned maybe like the easiest path to another million of revenue for my family is just opening it up in Washington and opening it up and I have I've expanded July like these numbers that you see these new referrals I mean we know that about probably 40 of these or 50 are coming from Washington, New Mexico, Washington, Mexico and Arizona and uh sweet loss sending it to us right and other laws because we're in all those states right so I'm following mark but I could branch off from July and open a brand new clinic in Washington brand new one in Arizona that would technically allow me to ramp up each of those states the 400 so yeah I'll think about that actually it's interesting so when you think about it what I would like you to do is do the inventory what would that take what would it look like so what would be the time impact
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for you, what would be the human resources that you need, would be the marketing, like draw the whole picture, what would have to happen, what would be the timeline, what would be the cost, is there, are you going to be negative at any point, like are you going to have to output money, probably not, but if you did, what does that look like? And then, so the biggest math is going to be time and energy impact for you because if that, if we can keep that to something you're willing to do, let's say 10 hours a month, whatever that looks like, really do the math to that and the revenue because the numbers are going to tell you you should do it or not. I can just about bet with what I've seen in your schedule that another state, one other state could be like the whole difference of a year, but also what you learn out of it and the additional financial resources that it could give you to maybe put. towards other things, maybe hiring, maybe marketing firms, maybe better software, whatever, I don't really know, like we're really just getting into this. But doing a projection exercise about what it would look like to go into, and I would be strategic about even the projecting state, like I would run the projections across multiple states, get as much data as you can to kind of and figure that out. So a correlation for, Mark, you said you're in Washington, New Mexico, in California, and Arizona, and then Missouri, because Mark's going into Missouri now. Right. And he's also Nevada and Texas, Texas.
00:58:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We pulled out of Texas, actually.
00:58:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I marked it. That's why I did this. Texas, you don't mess with Texas for lots of reasons. I'll let you hop off, but I love that. I'll run that. Thank you for noticing time because I didn't. Anyway, take care.
