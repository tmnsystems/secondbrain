00:01:11.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Hello!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Esther: Hi.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: Hello, beautiful. Esther!

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Esther: Hello, Tina! How are you?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Tina Marie: This is. Video maybe.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000a
Tina Marie: I wish I could be pretty also, like I don't even know if you're wearing makeup or not. But you just. Even though makeup. I look at you, and I'm like, Ah, I want to be that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Esther: Oh! Oh, my gosh, no way! No, I'm not wearing any makeup actually.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Tina Marie: Seriously. Your eyelashes just look like that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Esther: Um. Oh, I have lash, I have lash extensions, and I got my browse. Um.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Tina Marie: You're just so pretty.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Esther: Nano.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Tina Marie: But you have pink lips and pink cheeks. I look like a ghost when I wake up. I have no color in my face.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Esther: Really.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Tina Marie: And like purple lips.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Esther: I. No, no, my! My cheeks are probably a little red, because I'm using some new skincare products.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Esther: Now, and it's probably just getting. I'm just getting used to them. But I will say what a difference it makes when you wash your face. In the morning I started washing my face in the morning again.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Tina Marie: I have to cause I I've had acne pretty much since, like 9 or 10.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Esther: So.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't go away. I'm like I do not go to sleep without washing my face, or I look like a 13 year old.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Do you have hormonal acne, or just like.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yes, and hormonal stress.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Esther: Okay.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Tina Marie: My body is messed up. Okay.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Esther: You've been through. Dude girl. You've been through some shit, man. I I don't. You.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Tina Marie: You don't even know the half of it. But let's not go there.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Esther: Like. You told me a little bit about it last week, and I was like, Oh, my God!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Esther: Yeah. Um.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Life is. Fun. Girl.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Esther: No, but you always look great every time I see you on the meeting, like you really do.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: It's the zoom filter. It's a girl's best friend, you know, like that some of the things. But uh.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Esther: Mhm yeah. Yeah.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I just you. You always look radiant like I remember the 1st time I saw you with Mari, and I saw you go like this. I'm like, I hope she doesn't feel insecure because she looks amazing like.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Esther: Oh, my God, that's so sweet of you!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Tina Marie: People do not just have babies and look like, no, I'm I'm serious. I'm like, Uh, please. You.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Tina Marie: Ugh, yeah. Girl.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Esther: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it because I've been working hard on my skincare routine. It is nice when someone notices.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Tina Marie: Gorgeous. All the time.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh! And inside out. Seriously. Well, okay, I know we need to focus. But I just look at in like your top and everything like you look angelic. I just.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Esther: Oh, thank you!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Tina Marie: Oscar.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Esther: Well again today I couldn't get into the closet because she was sleeping, so I just had to grab whatever's was.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Esther: In the laundry basket that was washed. So.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Tina Marie: Hello! Eggs go.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Esther: Thank you. Um.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Tina Marie: And I did. Let me open your notes. But I did read them.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Esther: Okay. Yeah, I you know, man, this this week was such a whirlwind, busy week, because.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Esther: My family was in town. My sister was here, and she was staying with us. We had the wedding where we had. Birthday party wedding rehearsal and the Wedding. This weekend our cousin's wedding.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Esther: Um. I'll send you a video of Emmy. But she.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Tina Marie: That's a lot.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Esther: Did her flower girl thing, and. She was so good.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Esther: She like. Didn't even cry. I know if I was.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Esther: Standing. If I was there, standing next to her she would have been clinging to mommy. But so Michael and I no, and I was like Daddy's gonna take her. To, you know. Teach her how to do the flower girl thing, and when she's with Daddy she's got that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Esther: No, no, she just doesn't. Cry and whine like she's with him.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Esther: Um.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Tina Marie: Hey!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Esther: Right.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Tina Marie: They definitely are different in in the environment. And it's it's 1 of the things that I learned. And I know you know this. But it's crazy. How. A child responds to our energy like if they fall down and get hurt. And you're like, Oh, I'm so sorry. Okay, and you cry. Then they cry, too. And that's that, you know, sympathetic kind of mirror neuron thing. But if you look at them like, Oh, you're okay, are you okay. And then they're like, yep, I'm fine.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Esther: Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Esther: No, that's that's the. It's very interesting. You say that because I I definitely find that to be true. I've seen. Kids at the Park, you know who, you know. They'll take a little tumble and they start bawling. And Emmy is just like.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Esther: I'll say, Are you okay? I'm okay.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Esther: She just like Toddles along? Um. But yeah, we definitely was one of those things where. And it's like. Like spiders, too. I hate spiders, and I'm just like little spiders. But Fuji is.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Esther: Like he's like. Oh, you don't want to transfer your fear to them.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh hmm!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Esther: Um about certain things. And I was like, Oh, okay. So I just try not to like.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Esther: Freak out about spiders and stuff. And then she was just like, mommy. Look a spider. I'm like, yes, it is a spider. So no, they're like that. Our our kids, you know, people are like, Oh, your kids are tough. I'm like.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Esther: I don't think there are any. Tougher, not tougher, like less tough than other kids like we just don't make a big deal out of things when they fall down or.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Tina Marie: I made my 1st one terrified of everything, and then my second one. But then I realized, Holy crap! I put that fear into her.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Esther: Their needs are covered.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Tina Marie: And now she's so afraid, and it took years to even try to undo it. And I'm like. That's what is the problem is, we get programming so early on, it takes us decades to deprogram. And it's not that our parents didn't have good intentions. Everybody's different, you know, like.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Esther: Yeah. No one wants their kid to get hurt right?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Tina Marie: Right, and and I was terrified of losing her. But my fear became her fear, and I wasn't even aware that my fear didn't have to be fear.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Esther: Nicely.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Tina Marie: That it was damaging that there was another way like.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Esther: Well.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean that this whole process of evolution, and last night my daughter was talking to me about. You know how she wants to raise her children and stuff like that. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, I remember having that thing that thought and going. It did not turn out the way that I want it to, but.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Tina Marie: I also didn't have the tools that she has. And.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Tina Marie: And I want her to do well. But I did better than my mom, and I think that that's how it is like I expect them to do better than me.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Tina Marie: But it's so fascinating, like the observing the levels of awareness that I've had throughout my life. And the people that bring them, and how amazing.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: Kids can be like, we think. It has to be this way like growing old. I thought you had to be old and decrepit, and you know, look a certain way. And then I'm like, I see, 80 year olds in a gym, just pumping iron and living their best life. I'm like, you know what.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Tina Marie: We were lied to about a lot of things, anyway.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Esther: We were. Yeah, I'm actually curious. Um, now that. Is, is it one of your daughters that has kids or 2 of your daughters that have kids.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Tina Marie: One daughter.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Esther: Okay.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Tina Marie: One daughter has 2 kids.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Esther: Okay, like, do you like after becoming a mother? Are there things that she's. Help!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Esther: Herself more understanding about in terms. Yes, sir, no.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Tina Marie: So 1st of all, she became a mom. At like 19 she graduated during Covid.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Tina Marie: She probably had some of the most damage out of my girls from. Their relationship with their dad. And she's just now she's about to be 23, just realizing.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: How toxic that was. So.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Tina Marie: The environment and her tools were not the most amazing.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Tina Marie: Um. There's there's just a lot of not great things. I think that's coming.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Tina Marie: Um. There there was like a little bit of like, oh, this is harder than I thought. My 18 year old is actually, who doesn't have children, but who's going to school and like trying to be on her own.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Tina Marie: Um seems to be the most like. Oh, this really is hard, like, things are expensive, like, I just didn't realize how much work it all was, but they still only have, like this, much understanding of.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Esther: They're very young. Yeah, at 20 early twenties teens. They're still very young.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Tina Marie: They really are. Yeah, not even fully developed, because my my oldest is going to be 25. So she's just coming into that.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Esther: And then.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Tina Marie: Full brain, development. And I remember I didn't feel like an adult until I was 25 and had been a mom for a year.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tina Marie: And even still, I feel like it's pretend. Sometimes, like I get giddy like a teenager. And I'm like I've never done this before, and I feel like a kid all over again. So it's interesting how. That not just the perception, but yes, the perception is.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Tina Marie: Circumstantial.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Tina Marie: Ah! And yeah, and and based off of experience. And what experiences.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Tina Marie: Have, and had not been, had yet.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Esther: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I I hope that your girls go through.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Esther: You know their lives, and as they mature, and and everything that. They'll be able to.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Esther: Kind of look at. You know. Just just have a little bit more grace for what.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Esther: You went through and. You know how you've managed to come out on the other side because.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Esther: You know you've you know. Everyone has a different journey, and they're adults now, and you know, and your youngest one is going to be an adult like in a few years. So and they're gonna have a lot of growing to do. And.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Esther: You know. I mean, I hope, that they see you now, and you know in the next few years, and be like oh, you know. Just being able to recognize and appreciate how far you've come personally to.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Esther: Right. I mean. Like I. It's 1 of those things where I, my sister and I. We try to have like Grace for our mother. Um, you know, and.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Esther: I think we would probably have a little bit more if. You know, and we we understand. You know, she's a product of her environment. But.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Esther: You know she continues to make choices to this day. That are not healthy.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Esther: You know, and it's very different from someone like you who's who's grown so much. And you're. Intentionally trying to make healthy choices for yourself and your kids.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Esther: And. And I, I view that as very admirable. Um, even if you know someone's marriage like fails or falls apart, or okay.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Tina Marie: I'm like. No, I'm listening. My my puppy wants out.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Esther: Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah, you know, even if someone's like, marriage is coming apart, like, you know, or you know, they're going through a really hard time. I forgot.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Esther: Couple friends that are going through that right now. You know, Fuji and I have a good, you know, our realtor actually has become actually a good friend of ours.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Esther: You know we like. Try to hang out with him whenever we can. But you know he's.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Esther: You know his marriage is. Pretty rocky right now. He's got 2 grown amazing kids.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Esther: You know they're both like on one is in medical school, and the other one is on a medical school track.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Esther: And he's just a really nice guy. But um, you know, it sounds like his wife is pretty toxic like to the point where his kids are like, Dad. Like you keep letting her have her way, you know, like.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Esther: You know, they love their mom, and their mom has done so much for them. And you know they've built a successful business together. But even his kids are like, Dad, you can't keep doing this. You can't keep doing this.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Esther: So, you know, when he talked about separating from, you know, and it just started talking to us. And like, you know, I'm really glad. Dude, that you're kind of seeing some of this for what it is.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Esther: And even though people are going through these tough times, and I have another friend who. Oh, God! Her marriage is! I'm like, Oh, girl, um! But you know I've had a talk with her, too. It's like well.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Esther: You know how I feel about this. If you know you're just. In the can down the road.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Esther: Girl. I just. You know I said. My, I said, my 2 cents, my you, you know I've said my peace. Um!

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Esther: But you know I see my friends going through these things or these hardships in their lives, and. You know, just watching them work through, and I have all the respect for them in the world.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Esther: You know, like, especially when they make the choices that are just best for them, because it's like. It's your life.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Esther: It's your own life. You only got one shot at this, you know whether or not you believe like in your Christian or your religious. You believe in internal life like.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Tina Marie: Hi.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Esther: Life on this earth. You only have one shot at it. So, you know, like again, like I said, my my sister and I. We watch our mom like.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Esther: Make a lot of. You know, these continue to make these unhealthy choices. So you know, there's really only so much grace that we can give her, and I.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Esther: I think that we. You know, we're we've matured to the point that we're kind of like, okay, we know how to weave.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Esther: Learning how to set our boundaries. There's only amount of certain amount of grace that we can give her. You know, and I think that.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Esther: That's very different from someone like you or someone like our couple of friends that are going through these tough times, because. They're truly growing from it, and they're truly like trying to.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Esther: Make. Like choices that are healthier for themselves.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Esther: So I again. This goes back to saying that I hope your girls one day will come to appreciate. Um.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Esther: What you've done for them and for yourself. You know, and that you're you've you. You have a really different life.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Esther: Today than before, because you chose this for yourself. My mom has a very similar life to how she did 20 years ago, because she refuses to make these choices for herself.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Esther: You know, and. You know. So I I think it's different. I think there are just things that I you know.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Esther: Anyway. I feel like you've done so much for your own life, and I hope your girls can see that one day.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Tina Marie: You are so sweet.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Tina Marie: That's the thing. You you hit.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: You hit the point. Whether it be the children or the parents that matters most is that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, we'll choose to see what we choose to see.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Tina Marie: So like. I said, there's no guarantee. Your daughters will be great or not, no matter what you do, you could be the most amazing mom in the world, and they may never see it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Tina Marie: Um. You could be a terrible mom, and they may never see that. We, we each have our lenses that we look through. And some of it is what we're taught in our environment. And some of it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Tina Marie: Can't be defined it. We're born that way. It's it's.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Tina Marie: You know whether it's genetics or spirit, or whatever. There's definitely something unaccounted for.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Tina Marie: But at the end of the day. People choose what they choose.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tina Marie: And we have no control over that. But. Um, and it comes down to accountability. Right? So.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Tina Marie: Like my mom. Finally starting to make some choices that are surprising. So she got to almost 60 without really making any kind of change in growth.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: And she's. She's really made a lot of growth. But I'll tell you.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Tina Marie: Uh! She treats my brother and sister differently, and the difference is, I hold my boundaries, and I've been holding them for decades. And so I feel like my holding boundaries actually facilitated her growth. And I'm telling you that because you may feel guilty sometimes you may go back. And because you were bred to right that that's part of the tools that were used.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Esther: Nothing.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Tina Marie: As you respect your elders and act a particular way, whatever. And so there's this kind of internal guilt like, I know I'm right to hold my boundaries. But I feel bad, but I know I'm right to hold my boundaries, but I feel you know what I mean. So we go back and forth. But I will tell you.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Tina Marie: From experience. Ha! You know cause.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Tina Marie: We're from the south long line of Florida or Uh Alabama, Georgia, which says a lot right there. And so just a whole different kind of culture.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Tina Marie: Um. Of. Just do what you're told. Yes, ma'am. No, sir, that kind of thing.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Esther: Oh no!

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Tina Marie: But um. Holding my boundaries and also articulating. So I do have a gift of articulation that.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Tina Marie: Is not common. And so I'm able to say things that make people think.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Tina Marie: And. Not a lot of people have that gift, but I will also say not a lot of people put the effort into trying to find the words.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Tina Marie: So I'll give you an example. I said something to somebody, and it was. The um.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Tina Marie: An intimate relationship and. It was a lot of hard things.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Tina Marie: But. They needed to be said, and none of them were malicious.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Tina Marie: And. This person has a really hard time receiving and processing anything, I said, let me go. I'm a copy and paste this to AI in a in a non related thing. And say, tell me about this person who wrote this message.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Tina Marie: And one of the things that it said is that this person um. Cares a lot has a unique articulation. We didn't know that, but.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: But chooses their words very carefully. And I said, This is what you need to understand. Is, that.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Tina Marie: If you say something to me, I expect you to choose your words before you talk to me. Because I deserve that respect, even if you don't have the same words, just the effort of just not plopping down and saying, whatever's on your mind.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Tina Marie: So you do that. You, I watch you.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Tina Marie: I watch you choose your words.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Tina Marie: I'll watch you. Take a moment and. Reflect.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Tina Marie: And contemplate. And.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Tina Marie: Whether or not your children or anybody else ever appreciate it. I'm going to tell you you're going to have a huge influence on everyone around you.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Tina Marie: And your mom, too, in case you. And I think we always keep our little girl inside of us.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Tina Marie: You probably know you're never going to have the mommy that you wanted to have right. I've already grieved the loss of my mom. I'm never going to have the relationship where she's the mom. And I'm I'm the mom.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Tina Marie: Because I'm the one that's evolved, and.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Tina Marie: Made the wise choices and done the hard work. And she's the one that's been impetuous.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Tina Marie: And. Thrown the tantrums and acted out her whole life.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tina Marie: So I'm never going to get that. I've already grieved that loss.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Tina Marie: But she's still mine.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Tina Marie: And I still love her.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Tina Marie: And I still want her. So, knowing that I have the ability to kind of.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Tina Marie: Help facilitate growth, but without sacrificing myself just. Holding the boundaries and taking the time to articulate.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Tina Marie: Why my boundary exists. Why it was necessary to create it. What harm was done.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: Um. And.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Tina Marie: And just hope for the best. So. Anyway. But all your friends like that's the thing I've noticed, too, is, there are people who choose to.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tina Marie: Um. Be accountable, and figure out what they can do, what they can't do. Your perspective of.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Tina Marie: We've got this life, make everything. I think, uh make you know, make it the most you can. So, going back to your notes, which I cannot find, I found it on my phone. I can't find it in in here unless.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Esther: Here no worries. I will ping you the link. I didn't put that much, anyway. Um.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Tina Marie: But I love that you were noticing like this works for me. This doesn't work for me. I remember having that epiphany for myself. Probably about 12 years ago. How old are you.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Esther: 38.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Tina Marie: 38. Yeah. So a similar time. In life, um.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Tina Marie: Because it might have only been actually 10 years ago, somewhere around that. Um.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Tina Marie: And it was that. I need to create the things that do work for me that I can't follow somebody else's pattern.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Tina Marie: And. And that.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Tina Marie: I'm not wrong for it, like you were talking about judging yourself, did you? Where did you put it?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Tina Marie: I'm in your folder.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Esther: Oh, I I sent you the signal link of our notes. Yeah.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Tina Marie: And what's it called. Oh, signals on my phone. Okay, hold on.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Tina Marie: Um. Anyway, I hold on.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Esther: It's called Esther's Journey call notes. Yes.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Tina Marie: Copy. Oh, that is it. I wasn't okay.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Esther: That is it? Yeah, I'm just adding to it. I just add to it.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay. Oh, perfect. Okay.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tina Marie: So um, I did. Wanna I want you to explain a little bit uh, because they're not opened up so can't.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Tina Marie: See it, but I I love that you put them in your language. And my favorite part was that you put want because you're like. I don't know how to want. And I got kind of tingles and like emotional, just seeing that just like.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Okay, we're we're putting wants on the table and making it intentional. So I'm super excited to see.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Tina Marie: This. Um what you're thinking and and what you're growing and doing, because I.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Tina Marie: I. This is a hinge, Esther.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tina Marie: I know it's a hinge, because I've seen it. That opens a door to the next stage for you.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Tina Marie: Of. I will create the system that works for me.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Tina Marie: And. I'll and just continue to do that. I always create the system that works for me. Still on a day to day basis. Every time I get into a new group, or a new assignment, or a new, whatever.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Tina Marie: I'm like, Okay. I see what you're doing. Here's how I fit in. This. Does this work together, because, if not, I can't be here.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Tina Marie: But if it does, this is how I'm going to do it. And.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Tina Marie: This. This is what you're doing. So, anyway, I'll be quiet.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Esther: Yeah, no, no, no. I I think I think um.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Tina Marie: I want to hear about it.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Esther: I think this is a good segue on what you're saying, because. Like just trying to.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Esther: What you were saying the last few, the last couple of sessions you ha! We've had. About.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Esther: The last couple of sessions we had about. You know, I'm just like Oh, because I was exploring the idea of you know. Maybe I have Adhd or something, and what you said to me about like, there's nothing wrong with the way that your brain works.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Esther: And that's just so. I've never heard someone say that before.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Esther: You know um. Not like. I've never heard someone say that to me before.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Esther: Like specifically like that in that context, right? Because.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Esther: Um. I've always thought, okay. You know, you're.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Esther: You're going to therapy to fix something. You are going to vote to fix something. And I keep.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Esther: You know, and I think the problem is, I keep looking at myself as something. That need. There's things in me that need to be fixed.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Esther: And. Maybe that's.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Esther: Just not the way to look at it.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Tina Marie: Where's not?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Esther: And and I realized that if I look at that my myself that way. I'm going to.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Esther: Treat my children that way without knowing. Like. There's nothing that needs to be fixed about them, you know. Um, and I find.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Esther: And that was such a profound realization to me like. Um.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Esther: You know, even if sometimes she has, like certain behavior or whatever, there's nothing wrong with her. I'm not fixing her. She is who she is.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Esther: And. You know, if she's displaying some unsavory behavior.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Esther: I'm not looking at her as something to fix. She is a living. Breathing, little human.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Esther: That's she's only doing these things because they're age appropriate. She's only doing these things.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Esther: Because. You know um.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Esther: She. It's not about fixing. It's about me, guiding her through guiding her through whatever it is.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Esther: Um and. I think that was just such a profound realization for me.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Esther: Because I realized that. A lot of what.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Esther: You know my parents were doing to me was trying to correct it, correct. Correct behavior, and what is.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Esther: When you're trying to correct something. What is that implying that's implying that something is wrong. In the 1st place.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Tina Marie: Mute.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Esther: You know. And so, you know, if Emmy wants to.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Esther: You know. Do whatever that, whatever it is she's doing, I'm not going to show her the right way to do it. She's folding her clothes. She's showing mommy.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Esther: I'm going to show you how I fold my clothes. Oh, okay, let me see if my Nanny needs to come in here and put the baby to sleep.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Esther: No. Ah! I don't think so.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Esther: Oh! Dolores.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Esther: That's fun! You know.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Esther: I'm not even there to quote unquote, fix the way that she does certain things. You know, when she I saw the way that she was.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Esther: Folding her clothes. I'm like that's certainly not how I was taught. But it's if anything, it's really insightful for me. I never once.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Esther: Corrected her how to fold it. And you know, and I and I realized that you know what my mom would have stepped in and said, Oh, do it this way. Do it this way.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Esther: That's not my job. Like. If anything watching her do it gives me insight to how her mind works.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Esther: Why is it that she does this part and this part first, st in order to make it look like.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Esther: The end product. Um! It looks the way like I would fold it at the end, but I know the steps that she took were not, and like the creases and folds in there are completely different from mine.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Tina Marie: You're amazing.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Esther: So, you know, and I'm for me. I'm excited to see. Okay, you know. Maybe in a month she'll start folding in a different way. I'm just really excited to see. What that evolution is, the way that she thinks.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh, beautiful!

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Esther: So you know. I have to say. I was quite proud of myself.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Esther: For like seeing this, and and recognizing that.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Esther: And just, you know, understanding that. These are, you know.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Esther: Yes, certain behaviors are unsavory, and we do have to. But instead of like.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Esther: Correcting it is more. I try to want to try to put her on the right path, put her on the right path. There are certain things, though, like table manners, that.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Esther: Like Fuji is pretty. Um. Adamant about basic table manners, and my sister and I were never taught.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Esther: Good table manners, like every one of my family, like. Talks with their food in their mouth, and Fuji's like no.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Esther: We're not going to do that. So you know certain things like that. It's like, Oh, Emmy, we don't speak with our mouth. Well, you know. Eat your food first, st and then after you chew and swallow, then you can, you know, answer the question. So you know, things like that are fine. I don't see that as.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Esther: Fixing things in a way where you're restricting her spirit. Or anything like that.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Esther: So um. Then that question that begs the question of okay. Well, what things are we.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Esther: Correcting, or what things are we putting her on the path on? And so those are the things that Michael and I need to like, decide together. Right? Yeah. Well, if she doesn't know how to do something, you know, we'll show her how to do it. Um, you know. But then, if she wants to do things her own way, it's like, Okay, and it's achieving the result that she wants or we want. Then I don't really care how we get there.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Tina Marie: It makes me think of. And it's interesting because there are some times I remember, the source of a lesson.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Tina Marie: And. Most of the times. I probably don't right, and it and it may be an accumulation of.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Tina Marie: A few different people's versions of a thought, and then finally it clicked because of all of them, like I triangulated my understanding through the different stories. But every time I do the dishes I have a thought that's very similar to what you're doing. I was listening to. In my church we have a speaker. His name is called John. By the way, he's hilarious.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Tina Marie: And he's so funny that I had to ban my children from listening to him at night, because, even though he taught amazing, like. Gospel principles. He's so funny that they would.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: Get out of bed and come, tell me, do you know what I just heard? And it was a joke, and it was funny.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Esther: That's a.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tina Marie: But um one. He had a a talk, and it was like a book on tape, too, and it's called everything we wish we had known before we got married.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Esther: Mm.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Tina Marie: And. One of the things was.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Tina Marie: Putting dishes, putting the silverware in the dishwasher. One of them does it up. One of them does it down. And they were absolutely both positive that there was a right way and a wrong way. And that was programming. That was choice. But really, is there a right way? Is there a wrong way? There's logic for both of them. I don't like getting stabbed, so, you know. Put these things down, but also spoons. Wash better when you put them up like there's testing. There's my experience right.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Tina Marie: But. But to to that point I was like.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Tina Marie: Is my way that I'm trying to tell the girls. This is the way. Is that right? You are so much more evolved. Also, I started at 24. So I'm you know, 10 years younger and gone through so much stuff.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: But. I wish I had been able to give my girls that kind of freedom like their lives, no matter all the things that I didn't have the impact of those types of things.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Tina Marie: I did, and I so I'm celebrating with you. That that's amazing that you noticed that. And you were able to give that freedom, especially because your programming was so strict.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Tina Marie: And consistent, and it's based off of a long history of culture. But I really just had kind of my mom's thoughts and opinions, so I could cut it off from. Larger meaning.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Tina Marie: But I think that when you're when you come from a long like a. A strong culture.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Tina Marie: That that's probably harder to deprogram from. Because, you know you understand the roots and the roots reach out to you.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Tina Marie: You know. So.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Tina Marie: I love that you're having those thoughts, and that you're giving like I don't want to cry, not just because physically like it tingles. And I don't like it. But I.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Tina Marie: How beautiful that this amazing little girl, who is so gorgeous and spirited and strong and smart, and her little sister. Get to experience this, and I love you and Fuji like just.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Tina Marie: This is a beautiful thing that you have, and that you. Attracted, but create through your choice and.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Tina Marie: You are. As a family, but also as an individual just exceptional in this world.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Esther: Oh, thank you!

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Tina Marie: That's the truth.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Esther: That's so sweet.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: I know a lot of people.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Esther: And honestly, when you told me that there was nothing wrong.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Tina Marie: It's the truth.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Esther: With my brain. That really.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Esther: Blew my mind like no one's ever. Told me that, like Fuji like, you know, he's never said those words to me.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Esther: But he's also never like. Criticized me for things, and so I think for him. He's just kind of like. Oh, you know, it's so natural to him.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Tina Marie: Like. I didn't know you needed to be told that there's nothing wrong with your brain. I just thought we knew.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Esther: Yeah. You know um.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Esther: So. And just learning to accept and work with.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Esther: What is already in me, you know. And one of the things that you know going further from what I'd written here for you this week. It's like.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Esther: I have a natural tendency to. Um, you know, you know. And there's actually this finance blogger that I've been following.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Esther: For more than a decade. Now his name is Ramit Sethi. And do you? Are you familiar with him?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Tina Marie: Um! It is it. Um. You said his last name, but is it SETH. I.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Esther: Yes. Ramit. Yeah.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Esther: So he like the 1st time I'd ever heard of him. It was a friend of mine who'd. Um, you know, got me as a gift of personal finance. His personal finance book.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Esther: Um, you know, when I 1st started, you know um. Working.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Esther: And you know, I just. It was. It was good for me to like. Learn how to manage my finances, you know, and stuff like that.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Esther: But then the stuff that I found most fascinating from him. Was, his.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Esther: His psych. Like, aside from the career bits like the career development. And the personal finance stuff. I was really.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Esther: I thought his use of psychology. In money managing was just so incredible.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Esther: And I have to say, Tina, that he was my 1st foray into. Like personal development.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Tina Marie: Mm.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Esther: And the things that he, the things that he talked about. You know, and he has such an irreverent attitude about stuff, and I.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Esther: I actually met him in person at a book signing once. And he's just really really great guy. Um.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Esther: Yeah, the things, you know. He was my 1st like. The 1st person, or the first.st

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Esther: Person whose stuff I'd read. Um on personal development and.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Esther: From then on I've never stopped. You know.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Tina Marie: I I just want to tell you something I just had a thought about. Why, you probably identified with him the most. I bet.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Tina Marie: Because you just said he's irreverent. I just bet that that irreverence gave you permission to break. Tradition.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Tina Marie: And that you needed somebody irreverent. So I got goosebumps for this, too, because I. Have a lot of reverence.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Tina Marie: For. A lot of things.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Tina Marie: But I am intentionally irreverent at specific times. To break.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Tina Marie: Patterns. So, for example.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Tina Marie: Being very religious, and I did grow up that way, but becoming that way and evolving that way. But what I noticed is that my girls were becoming very judgmental.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Tina Marie: Very like. Ooh! That girl must be this because she dresses like that and talks like this, and anybody that does this is bad. So I started swearing more. I started doing some things because it was like. You need to understand that people can be good.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Tina Marie: And have certain behaviors that are different than yours. That the Church culture says is bad.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Tina Marie: I'm like. But if you go read the Scriptures, you'll find that. We're all very different. We all look different. We act different, and you can't tell.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Tina Marie: The quality of a person's heart. From that.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Tina Marie: But for you to hear. The psychology that was clear to you, and the logic and the understanding wrapped.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Esther: I don't know.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Tina Marie: In this irreverence. But being able to see that that irreverence didn't stop him from being smart.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Tina Marie: Wise. Successful and good right that the irreverence didn't make him bad.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Tina Marie: Then. The things that you felt inside of yourself.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Tina Marie: And your. Let's say.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Tina Marie: Rebelliousness against what you were taught and told.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Tina Marie: And conform.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Tina Marie: That probably was very releasing to you.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Esther: I never thought about it that way. But I think you I think you really hit the nail on the head. You know, cause.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Esther: I'd only ever, up until that point in my life been advised. To take advice from people who were.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Esther: You know, presented themselves a certain way, who had certain credentials, who. You know. But here was this person who.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Esther: You know, and this was also around. This is also um. A year. Maybe a year after I moved out of my parents house, too.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Esther: You know that I would. Didn't have that cloud.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Esther: That all that negativity, that that. Judgment all around me, and that was, you know, my, I think that was the time. My brain chemistry was also starting to change.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Esther: Once. It wasn't locked in those chains, too.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Esther: And to come across someone who yes, was clearly very smart, had very good advice, and. Back then I couldn't.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Esther: Kina, for over the 1st 20 something years of my life. I couldn't tell. I couldn't.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Esther: I couldn't. Um. I couldn't discern for myself.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Esther: Couldn't think for myself. I couldn't discern for myself what was good advice, what was not good advice. I just couldn't think for myself. Because I was just so conditioned.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Esther: To follow whatever someone else said. That was another reason why I was with that terrible ex for so long. Right. You know that kind of conditioning that my parents.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Esther: My family put on me, just carried over into. Like my romantic life and my other relationships, and I had no idea.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. I married my mother, basically in a male form.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Esther: Right. So it's it's crazy. And you know what it's like to to break out of that.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: Whoo!

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Esther: And the kind of. You know that kind of freedom, and I'm sure you've gone through. That, too, is just indescribable.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Esther: Like I don't know like.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Tina Marie: It's like being. It's like coming out of prison.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Esther: I can only. It really is. It really is. It's like coming out into the light. It's like.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Tina Marie: You know.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Esther: Coming out, and you can breathe again. So I think that.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Tina Marie: Or for the 1st time.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Esther: Yeah. For the 1st time. Yeah. And I think that's anyway. That's how I, you know, you know, got into a lot of his stuff, and I still follow his.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Esther: His stuff. Um, you know. Um, not as closely, but you know he still got some really great advice here and there. Um.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Esther: I didn't even know where I was going with this, but one of the things he said was that. I'm not a morning person. He's like. I've never, as you know, I'm not a morning person.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Esther: That's just not how I am. Everyone's like, oh, you gotta wake up at 5 Am. 6 Am. Have this routine. He was like. No, I'm not. I'm not a morning person.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Esther: I hate cooking. You can never get me to cook. And he said, I spend my time and my money and my effort.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Esther: On the things that matter to me. Like.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Esther: And so he was one of those people that you know. The 1st time I felt like I had permission.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Esther: And you're another. You again coming in and telling me. That there's nothing wrong with the way my brain works. I'm like, you know what.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Esther: Oh, my God! She's been saying what Ramit has actually been saying this whole time! It's like.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Esther: You know. Don't conform to what everyone else is doing.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Esther: Or what the other successful people are doing work with what is already you. And I found that one of the things that I have a tendency to do is.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Esther: I literally won't do something unless I feel like I want to do it. I really won't like you could set a schedule in front of me, and.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Esther: And I've even made. So many schedules for myself, and my eyes just glaze over, and it just doesn't fucking work.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Tina Marie: I laughed when I wrote that when I read that, because I'm like, that's me with pretty much everybody's text. I don't. I? I used to read books constantly. I can't. I'll listen to them because I can't even sit still anymore. But also.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Tina Marie: I don't know people. Too many words like Get to the point or something, but they glaze over like when you're disconnected. It doesn't matter why you're disconnected.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: But if you're disconnected, life is too short to be involved, and devote your time and energy, and brain and power and essence to something that just is uninspiring.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Tina Marie: I get it. That's I love that you're. Doing that.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Esther: Like, and I think I'm it's just discovering that no. I can't follow a schedule hour by hour.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Esther: Like. There's some people that just operate like that, and I can't.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Tina Marie: I can't.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Esther: So, you know, I think for me it's. Figuring out a routine that feels okay and feels good for me, but still being able to balance it in a way where I can get things done.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Esther: Right like in that crazy, that crazy weird to do list that I put. The screenshot of where people.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Tina Marie: I love it. Medium-ish, just kidding done like I love it.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Esther: You know, it's like, why. I just need to tell myself that sometimes I'm like cause I know that procrastination.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Esther: You know, for whatever you know, reason is like a big part of like how I operate, you know. And Fuji's like that, too. I he's. He's 1 of the most successful people I know, and he's like a major.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Esther: Procrastinator, and it makes me nervous like like the girls we have to get out, Daddy, like. You know how. How come you haven't fed Mari yet. I need you to like get her food, you know, or you know, just things like that. But we are major.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Esther: Procrastinators, but. Somehow we managed to get things done.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Tina Marie: I bet you I know why. Um, because I understand this because I'm this person, too.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Tina Marie: Um! My fiance is like this, too, so we have power, brains. And.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Tina Marie: They can't be engaged all the time, and they call this executive dysfunction. But I'm gonna tell you that's 1 of those other labels that just kind of pisses me off and everything else right? It's not dysfunction, it's not disorder. It's differently function, differently order. I love that they've come up with neurodivergent.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Esther: A misnomer.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Tina Marie: And our kids get to grow up understanding that our brains are not all the same, but. I may do nothing all day long, not anymore, because my soul is like there's so much goodness to do that I love doing. I'm pretty much busy from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed, and I haven't been like this since I was a teenager.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Tina Marie: But um. But I can.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Tina Marie: Just spend all day doing nothing, and in 2 h get done with somebody else, would take. 8, 1015, 20 h to do.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Tina Marie: Because my brain, when I'm focused, I'm laser focused. I go. I have fast tools, my like. I always have top of the line computers and everything, because my brain can process super fast, and so my hands can process super fast like I have great reflexes. If something falls out of the cabinet, I will catch it before it even gets to waist level like I've got like I work really fast. I think we talked about.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Tina Marie: Fast twitch versus slow twitch fibers. I don't know if we did, but I learned this year. That generally people with Adhd are also the type of people that are more sprinters than marathoners.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Tina Marie: And that they're built of more fast twitch muscles. Now, I'm sure that there's not a hard and fast rule for how all of that works especially with Adhd, but.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Tina Marie: The thing is is that. Um, and I was not a marathoner. I can put muscle on super fast.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Tina Marie: I also can get fat super fast, as you see my, my thickness here. But.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Esther: Oh no!

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Tina Marie: But um, but but we're we're literally wired in in particular ways and can function that way. And it number one. It's not average.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Tina Marie: Um. It is not average, and it is exceptional by definition, right and exception. So.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Tina Marie: If it's not average average being the rule. Whatever is not the rule is an exception to the rule. So if you're not average, we know you're not. You are exceptional.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Tina Marie: Um. There could be exceptional bad, exceptionally bad, and exceptionally good.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Esther: Thank you.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Tina Marie: But. I bet that when you sit down and you get something done when your brain kicks in.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Tina Marie: You get something done that a person couldn't have accomplished in a year. I'll give you case in point. What's his face, Ben? Ben.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Tina Marie: Sorry Ben didn't mean to be disrespectful with the what's his face? It's just my brain.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Esther: All good.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Tina Marie: Um. But.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Tina Marie: So. These things that some of them just don't inspire you, and sometimes you have to tell yourself, just get it done.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Tina Marie: Because your brain chose it, and said, This is a value. It. It does have value. It's important. It sucks.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Tina Marie: But I choose it so I'll get it done. But other people don't get to put things on your task list and tell you it's important. You have to decide. It's important. So. Oh, have you ever seen the Eisenhower Decision matrix.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Tina Marie: Box.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Esther: No, I haven't. What is that?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I'm gonna go find that real quick.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Esther: Okay, I can.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. Have you ever read the book? 7 habits of highly effective people.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Esther: Oh, I've heard of that book, and I think I might have. Read a summary, or of it once.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Tina Marie: I would recommend actually. Reading the whole thing unless you find it to be uninspiring for you. Which um, because then you you won't really get anything out of it, and I don't want you to.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Tina Marie: Feel like I want you to do something that. That is not the thing. Hold on! Let me find the example.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Esther: 7 habits. Oh, yes, I've definitely.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Esther: See this.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Tina Marie: Click on this open. Come back here!

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, we're going to look at different version. Let me share screen. This is actually one of the lessons in my book that I've been writing.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Tina Marie: Whoops, wrong thing. It takes me forever. But it's okay. It'll happen. Um.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Tina Marie: Share, Tina, you know how this works. Jeez.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Esther: Uh begin with the end in mind. Okay.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay, we're gonna. For sure. But so this is the thing. So you've got the quadrant right? Um! There's urgent, so important versus urgent.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Tina Marie: And in the book they'll define what, how you, how you qualify. Important versus urgent.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Tina Marie: Wow! And so then there's.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Esther: Oh, I've seen this! Yes.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Tina Marie: Yes. So what I love is like looking at it different ways, right? So people have broken it out in different ways. You could literally just go through. All of this. One other thing I would look at is, how do you? Oh, here, here's the one that describes urgent versus not important.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: How do I? Want to make this.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: Bigger.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Esther: Okay.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: That's. Let's see. Ah, Nope! Go away!

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tina Marie: One. Sec. This weekend. Open a new tab. Hmm, hmm.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Tina Marie: All right. Cool. Firefighting crisis. Okay, urgent and important firefighting crisis management, high impact work. Do it now.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Tina Marie: So let's get down to. It's not urgent, and it's not important. For off the top of your head. Think of something that maybe has been on your to do list ever that you just thought of.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Tina Marie: And you're like it's not urgent or important, but yet it showed up. Can you think of anything like that.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Esther: Um. Yes, I actually um.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Esther: I actually took them off of my to-do list.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Tina Marie: Perfect.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Esther: So they're not there anymore. Yeah.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Tina Marie: Perfect, so.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Tina Marie: What I love is just. You probably have to look at this a few times, and you can use the.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Esther: No.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Tina Marie: Language, that. Works for you.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Tina Marie: But it is internalizing, basically a system of deciding. Does it even belong. Here on my awareness doesn't get any of my mental space.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tina Marie: Does he get any of my my energy? And if so, why.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Tina Marie: Like, how. How do I create a value for it?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Tina Marie: So Stephen Covey also has um. Um.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Tina Marie: A. What do you call it?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Tina Marie: This a demonstration called Big Rocks, and you've probably seen a version of this before. Let me just do this.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Tina Marie: In the jar. Okay. So he's got go away.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Tina Marie: Big rocks, Little Rocks, sand and Water.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Tina Marie: Ultimately the issue is that the only way to get everything to fit in here. Is, if you put the big rocks in first, st if you put the sand and the pebbles in first.st

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Tina Marie: The big rocks won't fit. But then what he did was labeled.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Tina Marie: The big rocks. And one could be, you know. Um.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Tina Marie: Spending time with the children. And one of the little rocks could have been something like.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. Attend! Attend a meeting, whatever. But but the point was a visualization that.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Tina Marie: We cannot do all things in life. But.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Tina Marie: The things that matter and need to be in life. There's there's a way to get them in. If we do what matters first.st And there's there's some other reasoning and logic for it. So like, if you.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Tina Marie: There's another book called Eat that Frog. I didn't read it. But the the synapse of it basically is like, do the hard thing first, st and that goes back to the psychology of finite willpower.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Tina Marie: If you use your willpower in the morning, when you have it for the hardest thing.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Tina Marie: And the rest of the things in the day that have to get done don't really require much willpower. It won't be hard to get them done.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Tina Marie: And you didn't need to use willpower for it.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tina Marie: And then I'll go back one more time to. We don't get the lessons from one source per se. It's stitching all of these different ideas and concepts and going. Oh.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Tina Marie: Now I understand how that's relative to my life and to my tasks.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Tina Marie: And things like that. So. Um.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, just just the way that you're. Looking at that. I like the tools.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Tina Marie: So I will say, though in the book the 7 habits of highly effective people is, there's a lot. There's a lot of different stories and. Those stories have family involved. They have work involved.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Tina Marie: So there's different types of anecdotes because we are not just professionals. We're not just parents, you know. We're not just children of parents. And so he does a really great job of of kind of taking the holistic approach to.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Esther: Okay.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Tina Marie: How do you be effective? Um.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Tina Marie: When you're driven to want to be effective. I think you're driven to want to be effective.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Tina Marie: Uh, but your weight. And and that book is one of the things that kind of shows you. How to do it your way. Most books teach you how to do it. Their way.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Esther: And.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Tina Marie: That one. I feel like. Can be translated to your own really easily. So.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: Maybe maybe check it out if you want to, but.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Esther: Yeah, I think I'll take another look at it.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Tina Marie: Isn't our matrix.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Esther: Because I have read summaries of it. Um over the years.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Esther: But I think what didn't work for me was, I was still thinking. That. Oh, there's oh, I have to do it this way.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Esther: You know, I look at that matrix now. And I can think of ways that I can.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Esther: Make it, you know. Have it work for me. And have it fit into like, yeah, you showed me this like 5 years ago, or you know, even.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Tina Marie: Yours.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Esther: Um 3 months ago, and I would have been like, Oh, I've seen this before, but now that I'm looking at it again through a new lens I'm like, Oh.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Yes.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Esther: I think that I can actually do something different with this this time.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Esther: Yeah. Um. No, this is really great. I will check it out. Yeah.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Esther: Okay. Perfect.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Esther: Um, yeah. And I think you know again, it's. You know things that you know, for example, like Tina, I hate exercise.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Esther: The only reason I ever exercised, you know, when I was during in the best shape of my life. I actually had a goal at the time I wanted to. You know, I'd been.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Esther: Single, for like. 6 months, 7, 8 months, 9 months, I guess.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Esther: And I was like, Okay, well. You know, I need a like, you know, I'm not in a hurry to date again. And I was like at some point, I I'm gonna get there. I was like, Okay, well, I need to look hot again. So I need to like and.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Esther: You know, and find my hot Asian husband, and it worked. I was singularly focused. I was literally at the gym like 5 days a week, in an hour, every single day.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Tina Marie: Roof.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Esther: And. I don't have that motivation that I need to look hot anymore.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Esther: And so now I'm just kind of like, okay, well, if I leave it up to myself, I don't even feel like going to the gym. But again, it's just more. I'm the kind of person who.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Esther: Needs to feel like I'm doing something and then find a way to work these important things in, because. Let's be real like, I can't not be exercising anymore, because it's just.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Esther: I'm I'm almost 40 now. It's gonna have a true impact on my health.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Tina Marie: You want to hack.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Esther: What! What is the hack? Tell me.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Tina Marie: Ah! It is.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Tina Marie: You only have to go to the gym, probably maybe twice a month. And what you do is you lift.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Tina Marie: Um! There's 2 moves that I do, and I'm I'm 3 times stronger than I was a year ago. Because I had really.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Tina Marie: Lost my muscle mass. I can't think of the word that I want. But anyway.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Tina Marie: Um atrophied. During.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Tina Marie: And I didn't know it, because I've always been strong. Um. But I learned especially for women 40 and over that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Tina Marie: Strength, training. To failure. So you don't do a lot of reps. You do few reps of super heavy weight, not hurt yourself.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Tina Marie: But if you, you know 3 or 6, 3 to 6 reps. Um, and I found that in order to prevent injury, I kind of warm up to that heavyweight. So I don't do a lot of reps of the lightweight. But as soon as my muscles are warm up and I'm not going to hurt myself, I go.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Tina Marie: Heavy. Slow controlled.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Tina Marie: You know, all the way through, because then you're you're working every part of the muscle when you go really fast up and.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Tina Marie: Really fast down. You don't really. You don't really get the effect of it.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Tina Marie: But um. But 2 times a month.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tina Marie: And I had read that, but I didn't believe it. If I go more than 2 times a month, I actually.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Tina Marie: Overtrain, and I get weaker, and I'm not able to do the same things. Ah!

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tina Marie: I can go more often if I want to, if I don't do full body. But I do full body, because I don't want to spend a lot of time at the gym, but I do want to be strong.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Esther: Okay.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Tina Marie: You combine that with good eating. Muscle is actually especially leg muscle. The biggest indicator of longevity.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Tina Marie: And the reason is, 1st of all. How many times you hear about older people breaking their hip, breaking bones? The hip gets broken. They have. I don't remember what it is like, it's a year or 2, basically that they'll the average person will live after that.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Esther: Back, in. Right here.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Tina Marie: When we don't have muscle. 1st of all, when you get sick, your body burns muscle, it preserves fat. It burns muscle. So if you don't have muscle for it to burn.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tina Marie: I mean it's going to do it. But you end up very, very weak afterwards.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Tina Marie: And diminished. The other thing is so. Muscle is protective against break.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Um. Also, when you lift really heavy, you release oxytocin.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Tina Marie: I. There's only a few.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Esther: That's why I like lifting.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh. That's only if you.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Esther: I hate Cardio, and I'm.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Tina Marie: By the way, your traps a few times I was looking at those traps. I was like, what? Look at that girl you got that. Uh.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Esther: I don't know if that's more from like a stress.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Tina Marie: Holding babies.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Esther: Yes.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Tina Marie: Uh, but yeah, so you could do some research on it. But but really it's heavy lifting. So the 2 moves that I like is a leg press, and I just go really, really slow, really heavy. So I work every single one of those, and then it's an overhead extension pull. So I pull the weight all the way from back over my head and full over.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Esther: Good.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Tina Marie: But it works my core more than any other core exercise that I do.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Esther: Go ahead!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tina Marie: Uh like. I'm squishy on top, and I'm rock hard underneath. So. Uh, but I've been doing that for over a year and a half, and my body changed like the shape is.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Tina Marie: The shape I had when I was younger, and playing sports and working out all the time. So if you want to, you know, hot mom, body.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Esther: Um. Okay.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Tina Marie: It's strength training, and if you don't want to do it a lot. Just lift really, really heavy. Careful, also prepare for the fatigue. For the next 2 or 3 days.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Tina Marie: Eat. You need your protein. If you're going to be lifting and maintaining your muscle, you need those healthy fats. If you want good mood and energy.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Yeah.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Tina Marie: So. Anyway, that's my tip. Go do some research and and find out your version.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Esther: Okay.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Tina Marie: Um, but you do not have to go. Do it a lot.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Tina Marie: In terms of like time.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Esther: Okay.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Tina Marie: To get what you want. There is a leveraged that's 1 of my favorite words in business and in life a leveraged way. To get what you want without spending a lot of time on it. I am always looking for that, I used to tell myself I was lazy, because I always look for the shortcut.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Tina Marie: But as soon as I found the shortcut I added something new, I was always working and doing things. I just didn't want to spend forever on one thing. I wanted the variety, the spice of life. You know. I wanted lots of things. So I learned how to do lots of things. Well.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Tina Marie: In a shorter amount of time, so I could experience all those different things.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Esther: Oh, my God, okay, thank you. That thing you just said there again.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Esther: Ramit talked about invisible scripts. Like.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Esther: Don't!

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Tina Marie: Oh yes!

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Esther: Call yourself lazy.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Esther: Because you're going to start believing that you're lazy. Um. And there's times where I'm like, am I? Just lazy? I mean.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Esther: I know I wasn't lazy, I mean I think it's. The world has so many different ways of.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Esther: Judging and measuring. What?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Esther: It deems as hard work right. And.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Esther: There's so much. I had so much guilt.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Esther: About. Not wanting to cook for my family.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Tina Marie: I know.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Esther: And. I just have to admit it. I'm not like my sister, who loves baking and loves cooking like Fuji, and I literally have no interest.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Esther: In cooking at all, and we are not fussy about our meals at home.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Esther: And I think I just have to accept it like. I'm not doing a bad job taking care of my kids.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Esther: If I don't want to cook for them, and I would rather just outsource it.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Esther: And I just realized these last few months since I've had my Nanny, and she. Does a lot of the food prep for us, or you know, the she cooks food for our kids. But there's a lot of that food mean food. She just eat it, too.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Esther: You know, and. Wow! There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with me not doing the laundry and.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Esther: If I can afford to have her do it, and I could focus my energy. On being a better mom. Then that is, gonna do so much more for my kids.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Esther: Than if I spent an hour or 2 cooking and cleaning every single day.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Tina Marie: Amen!

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Esther: Okay.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Tina Marie: And you have that amazing, beautiful minds like if you are doing monotonous, tedious tasks, that's hours of the day. You don't get to use it. Even if you're just sitting down, your brain is working.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Tina Marie: Your brain is working and planning, and solving, and observing and learning, and then you distill all of that. Into something action that takes that.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tina Marie: Other people can't do. Let them. We, we all of the roles are equally important. They're just different.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Tina Marie: Where would we be if we didn't have somebody who could help us with the cooking and the cleaning, or whatever? But where would they be if we couldn't use our brains to create better systems, to create the jobs to whatever like, we all need each other in those roles, and none of us can do it all, but somehow we've gotten to this point where we're all supposed to do it all. That's not right. It was never like that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Tina Marie: Until now. And or, more probably, industrial revolution, type, age.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Esther: Go ahead!

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Tina Marie: And women started going to work. Women women have always worked back in the day. The cobblers were cobblers. The man wasn't the only cobbler the woman helped with things.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Tina Marie: It was a family. We all did the things together. The blacksmiths were the Smiths. They did all the smithing together. It was. It was a family thing.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Tina Marie: The woman probably took the orders, organized the books things like that, and the man would do the hard labor. But. They did it as a family. Everybody was together. They probably sent out their laundry to the laundry family.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Tina Marie: Like we were a village that that did things together until modern technology. And I'll tell you. I learned something fascinating a few years ago, which was what was the 1st invention that really started to split up the family.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Tina Marie: And create these kind of issues. Could you? Could you guess? I, for sure did not guess.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Esther: No idea.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Tina Marie: Central heating. Central heating.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Tina Marie: Because before that. Everybody had to be together all the time we had to work together. We had to get up at the same time and go to bed. At the same time we slept together because body heat was what kept us alive.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Tina Marie: We had to eat together. We had to be together and work together and cooperate and collaborate. All the time, because if we didn't we would literally die. There was no source of heat.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Tina Marie: You know, everything had to be coordinated, not just between the family, but the village. Or people would die.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Tina Marie: Central heating started to change all of that, because now we could be separate and have our own rooms. And exist outside of the space with each other.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Tina Marie: That's a very modern development.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Esther: That makes complete sense. Because you know the way that my.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Esther: Family grew up. The way that you know anyone who I know who grew up in a 3rd World environment.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Esther: My family. They all slept in the same room together in the same bed. Like.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Esther: Here in America. We're probably one of the only places that sleep train. Our children.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Esther: In separate rooms.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh. And how lonely are those poor babies.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Esther: That's so interesting and. You know, and I.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Esther: Oh! It makes sense, and I and I and I get it like there are some families where you know they wanted that bonding, and they, you know they choose not to sleep, train their kids.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Esther: Me and Fuji. The way that our lifestyle is like we need to work at night. We need to do certain things we need to, you know. Worry going. And so our kids need to be able to sleep independently.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Esther: And they do, and that works for us. So you know I don't judge people who don't sleep train. I was like that, you know. You do. You.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Esther: Um, but we're we're.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Tina Marie: I wanted. My babies posted me because I needed them, but also I was tired all the time. So it's not that it actually worked. You know what I mean. It's like.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Esther: Good. I mean, it's it's got its pros and cons right definitely.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and and learning lessons.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Esther: Where did you? Where did you read that, or where did you? Where did you hear or read of that idea about central heating? Because I feel like I need to seek out that book now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Tina Marie: It. I I would just look at it. I don't think it was a book. I feel like it was probably actually a church talk, because we have this thing called General Conference, and.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Tina Marie: We get these um amazing, basically, Ted Talks. But a lot of times they're. They're like that right? They tell stories about people and families and.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Tina Marie: How we evolved. And anyway, so it's 1 of those sources I don't know. But also, you know to the point, like some kids can do that. Some kids are independent. They're all wired differently. And I also think that you give your children.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Tina Marie: So much confidence. You didn't.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Tina Marie: Break them of that that. They can probably feel safe in a space.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Tina Marie: Alone, like. They're they're just all different. There is no right or wrong for the world. There's right or wrong, or.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Tina Marie: One of my favorites, good, better or best for each person, for each family, for each season, for each day. You know what I mean, like. There's constant change in flux and.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Tina Marie: But labeling something wrong. Unless it's something that.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Tina Marie: Hurts. A person.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Tina Marie: Spiritually or physically.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Tina Marie: It, and. I don't think it does any good.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Esther: Yeah, no, I I get it. Um. You know, and every time my sister and I.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Esther: You know. Sh! My sister and I like get together. We get to have these like heart to heart, talks a little bit, and. You know. Just kind of um.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Esther: You know um! Connecting each other with each other about. You know, things that we were taught were wrong.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Esther: And they really aren't.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Esther: And you know um, and just kind of every again, funnily enough, every time I spend time with my mom, I'm reminded of why I I keep that distance. You know, unfortunately. But you know it's it's it needs to be that way.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Esther: And um, I don't feel guilty about it anymore. Um. I was feeling really guilty about it, like several months ago, but I don't.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Esther: Anymore, um. You know, and it's 1 of those things. I realized that my my children.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Esther: Are, actually. All the better for it.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Esther: That they don't spend huge amounts of time with them.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Esther: Um. You know, as you know, my sister and I was just like you know what like.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Esther: If they weren't the way they were like. We wouldn't feel the need to keep such a distance.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Esther: Them just. She said this. You know, she she said. Oh, I found my sweet spot. I stay with Mom and dad and my aunties who. Live with them. Oh, yeah, I can't spend 4 days, 3 to 4 days seems to be the sweet spot before it becomes too long, or I'm like guilty that it's too short.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Esther: And she was telling me, Oh, yeah, like. It was just so.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Esther: Like my aunt, just spews casual racism. Like.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, love those people.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Esther: All the time. You know, and she says stuff like that to me before. Where.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Esther: Yeah, I think this one time she said, Oh, yeah, it was. You know. She was. Talking about how it was good that Africa got colonized, and you know then.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Esther: You know. They introduced, you know, like the missionaries, introduced them to Jesus, and I'm like.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, deep. Breath.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Esther: Oh, my goodness! You know.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Esther: Yeah, or you know, just just terrible things. And. You know. But anyway.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Esther: Um. Yeah, my sister and I just agreed that look people, they they choose how to live their own life like my mom has made her own bed, and by deciding to stay with my dad. Um.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Esther: A repercussion of that is that you know we're not going to want to. Let our children near them as much.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Esther: You know, that's just kind of how it is, and if she doesn't, I don't. You know I'm not going to specifically say that to her. I don't think I need to, but.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Esther: You know I'm fine with her. Just be like, oh, they're kind of living their own life. And if she can't figure it out.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Esther: That. You know we keep that distance then I don't know what else to tell her.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Esther: Yeah, so.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Tina Marie: You can only do the best thing you can with your life. I love this. I would love to know. Um.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Tina Marie: How this implementation works for you. If you feel like. It helps you.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Tina Marie: Do like I basically organize. So that you feel like you've got.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Tina Marie: Momentum, and you have a plan when you wake up in the day like. Here's my plan. My overarching plan is, you know, whatever your priorities, so like the big rocks.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Tina Marie: Maybe even. Just look that up and look at the the 4 things. If you have a visual, and then reframe it to something that works for you.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Esther: Hmm.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Tina Marie: What what the language is. Always look at these systems and go okay, like, if it works for you verbatim great. Nothing works for me verbatim. I have to change everything.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Tina Marie: Um so. What does that look like? So what is your top priority of the day? And if your top priority is peace and happiness.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Tina Marie: That's okay. Like for me, it is so. I have tasks, and I have goals that I want to accomplish.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Tina Marie: But they cannot be at the cost of. Peace.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. Joy and happiness. You know it. It depends. It can't be.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. Create, conflict.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Tina Marie: Um between me or the people that I love that type of thing. So, figuring out what your priorities are, and just.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Tina Marie: Um feeling like. In the morning.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Tina Marie: You feel good about what's going to happen, and at night you feel good about what did happen.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Tina Marie: No matter what those things are.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Tina Marie: So, being able to count the good. Because.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Tina Marie: You chose the path. And then like in the morning and and at night, and just.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Tina Marie: Being happy with it. Part of it is just the choice to be happy and to look at the good. And if there are things you go like. I didn't do this. I wanted to do this, but I'm very happy with the choice that I made not to do that because I prioritize this, and I'm at peace with that.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Tina Marie: You. You can get there, and I don't know that you know what that feels like, but you can have that every day.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you. I will keep working on that. I think we talked a lot about.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Esther: Just different. Things that I yes.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Esther: No, it's fantastic. I am not lazy.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Esther: I'm going to.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Tina Marie: No.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Esther: I am going to adjust the things in my life to. Work with how my brain is wired.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Esther: That's just. That's just how. Yeah.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Tina Marie: And your hearts.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Esther: So, yeah.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Tina Marie: Because that's not wrong either. Your brain and your heart are perfect. And you do amazing things all right. We are way over, but.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Esther: Yeah, everything. Yes.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Tina Marie: It was good, so I will go get the notes for you.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Esther: Awesome. Thank you. Okay.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Tina Marie: And I'll drop this them in here before I get up from my desk. And then just keep me posted how things go.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Esther: Amazing. Thank you so much, Tina.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Tina Marie: Welcome. You're wonderful, Esther.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Esther: Okay.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Tina Marie: But honey.
