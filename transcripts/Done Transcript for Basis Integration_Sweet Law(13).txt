00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're so quiet, but yeah, definitely. Are you there?
00:00:11 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - mark sweet
We're good.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sure? Why are you so quiet?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I'm always quiet. Most annoying thing. the way up.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not always the same kind of quiet, though. You have nuance to your dynamics.
00:00:38 - mark sweet
Yeah. Interesting New York Times article. Well. Uber is trying to put on the ballot in Nevada. It's easy to have that happening. To cap attorneys fees at 20%.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:00:58 - mark sweet
Because they're getting sued left, right in the center for. having their drivers aggressive or people. so their solution, instead of, you know, doing better, is let's make it harder for people to bring lawsuits. Because originally they were forcing everyone to arbitration, but then there was so much backlash they stopped that. Yeah.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the odds, do you think, of that passing?
00:01:26 - mark sweet
Um, not small. It's a short answer. Because they have people telling others that during, I think, 80% of the fee, and so this will stop them from taking more. And yeah, I don't think it's very hard to put together a campaign ad saying, stop pretty attorneys from taking all your money.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so two things, and only one of them really matters, I guess, for you. Well, okay, so these are the two questions that pop in my mind. One, how can a law firm stay in business with that and two, then how do people get any help from attorneys if there are no law firms who can afford to do business with them?
00:02:19 - mark sweet
Well, first, this would only be for work. What it means is there's by going to be excess costs. like, okay, this fee is just for the attorney's time, not for the paralegals or whatever, and they charge separately to try to make us a difference. Yeah. It's just going to get, I don't want to say shadier, but more complicated.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:48 - mark sweet
So, I mean, there's always a workaround. The question is going to be what is it? Uh, institutional arguments, I think as well. know, how can you actually cap this? But federal law does have a cap on the attorney's fees, so it's not like it doesn't happen.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's precedent, but what is the federal cap?
00:03:09 - mark sweet
I think it's 25%.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then how do you get 40% attorney fees? If there's a federal cap.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
That's only on federal cases.
00:03:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, only on federal cases.
00:03:29 - mark sweet
So the only other states that have a cap. Really or equal one has it at like 50% one has it at a third. But yeah, we can go up from that. So we'll see what happens.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how let's see. We don't even have any Nevada cases this month yet. Okay. Off the top of my head can't think about how many cases we get in Nevada.
00:03:58 - mark sweet
We don't really have any Nevada cases.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, that's new. It was one of the newer ones. Okay.
00:04:05 - mark sweet
Um, Will it immediately have a direct impact on our business? The answer is no. Just, you know, future proof. The Nevada firms will then continue to look to expand other states like Arizona and Washington and potentially California. So there's kind of the back and forth. So that's just what it means. Um, so move the Midwest is still better for us to try to build out.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, and probably in a lot of different industries because the Midwest just, I mean, the Midwest is like the Old West. It's just, it's like, or the Wild West, it's still, I don't know, it's like it's America 100 years ago, almost in some ways.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
Yeah. So, I mean, this is at least two years off. Okay.
00:05:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:03 - mark sweet
And then I, I guess.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, the, the thing was that Nevada is trying to pass some law that caps attorney fees at 20%.
00:05:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Time to start Arizona firm. Let's go.
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Well, why are everybody just came up because the Arizona was serious about it, but there's an even more out of state firms coming in, which they're already pretty pissed off about.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean. Well, and that's why, I mean, whatever the industry is, it doesn't matter what it is. The, the way to, it's not, I don't believe in future proofing, but, but trying to, but is, is to have the leanest business and the most optimized business possible. Whatever those systems are, whatever those. processes are, and I mean, the attorneys need to be thinking about that for themselves. You need to be thinking about that. Nobody knows what the timeline is, but whatever the most optimal process is, if you're not thinking about that constantly, which you are, but that's the thing. There will be some other companies that will be doing that and other ones will die, but the pace of change, first of all, is fast, second of all, it's getting faster. So continuing to look at what we can optimize, what we can systematize, how we can better use our resources is just going to be the thing. And then how we can duplicate across locations like we're already working on. So what is the, I have to go back. I know I have notes, but Utah, what's the situation with Utah update?
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Brad left the law firm that he was with and joined some new law firm so we're still signing cases I just got to make sure we have the new routine of the new law firm but in the cases he had with the previous law firm it still is so what Dan we haven't talked about litify reports what's his name is like on vacation for a while what are the latest updates on reports do you know yeah now he did this calls thing for me based off of what I brought up like two weeks ago about like I'm trying to figure out like I don't know what I'm trying to figure out trying to figure out if there's some sort of really
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
relationship between call volume, can we look at call volume over time? that opposite time? Does it say the same? And then how does call volume, if any way relate to retainers matters, right? So he busted out this report, I think he sent it over on Thursday on Friday. So Stacey, well Stacey has been, so must have been Friday. So she's like, Hey, you got to look at that, get back to Josh, but I've not looked at him. And I don't, I don't know what I'm looking for. It's more like the date is there. Is there are there gaps? I don't know. And or that it could be nothing, right? Just because the way that intake works. I think there'll be some relationship between call volume probably, but I don't know. But all the other reports that you wanted, all those are done. So all are they right?
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Yeah, that was the thing about that.
00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and last time and um no he picks those so it's like now we have to review the updates okay so what's your new report called uh i don't even know if it's a report it's um some call thing it's probably not it might be a dashboard but i don't know how he did it or it didn't lit up by so it's probably it's either a reporter a but i don't i'm medical ubering right now i'm going to pick up my patient it's another lovely money of me driving average call to convert source to state type there we go that's it um so what's funny is he did i was like i want to know this and then he was like oh you want to you should look at it like this i was like yeah sure you do that we'll see if that i wouldn't even know
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Automobile.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there might be nothing. That's the whole thing. I don't know that there's going to be a damn thing.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will let you look at that then. Can you look at that before I call next week?
00:10:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm stuck on this 20% thing now.
00:10:20 - mark sweet
So, it's like, yeah.
00:10:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
no one will adapt, right? Is what I think. Most will not adapt. So, they will, they will die. So, they're not even going to, they may not even know it's happening. But I'm sitting here thinking, okay, if you run the math on 20%, like you're out of business right now, pretty much.
00:10:51 - mark sweet
Right. Like, that would be lower or gross by about 60%.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, like, do you plan to try to game out an inevitable future? Or do you try to like, what would it look like to exist in that world? And I legitimately keep thinking about an Arizona firm. isn't that the real future? And yeah, those, because I met with they were floored that I know you guys are going to find this hard to believe. So a lot of these law firms don't know their numbers. Like, you're kidding.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So like, they don't have an average retainer value. So he's like, where did you guys get that from? I'm like, a calculator? Uh, not that hard. Hey, but, and they were, they were cool about it. So they just have cli plans over and over and over again that don't get the value of what they're bringing because they don't have any internal math whatsoever. So they're in the same sort of hamster be alive was on. When I had that business, it was like, you'd go back to them six months, theirs is short of period of time, ours was literally six months. And six months down the road, they'd be like, oh, didn't work. And I'd be like, uh, so you didn't sign or I would have the leads. I would start reading the leads to the, I go, so we say to this guy in a motorcycle, oh, yeah, signed that guy, yep, but it didn't work. No, I signed him. Okay. So it did work. Yeah. guess so. Oh, boy. And they're all just lawyers that I'm a lawyer. Yeah. I know. I'm well aware of what you are. So they, you know, they've got some pretty big firms like doing a lot of leads. And they get good conversion rates, but my argument to them is like they might not be making money because as we pointed out several weeks ago, they're signing everything. So they don't know what's what at the end of the day. And then if they don't track it through the end, they don't. So at the end of the call, the guy goes, all right, so if I ask you a question, go, yeah, if you were us and you had a legal agenda business, what would you do? And I said, I wouldn't have a legal agenda business. And he's like, what do you mean? And I said, I would go, I would start in Arizona from I would get involved with someone that could start in Arizona. And they knew what that was, but they were like, how, how do you do that? I said, well, I'll tell you how you don't do it. You don't go get a bunch of private equity and think you just put money in one end and money comes up the other. Because that's, you need to know all these things that we just talked about. And as you. No, that's hard to come by, right? There aren't firms like that. But to me, the model's real. It's just no one's done it, right? No one's actually, they don't know the math of, hey, this is the acceptable cost per retainer and this is the whatever. It's, you know, it's my my whole idea of money execution thing, right? those guys, the idea is right. They, you can't execute it, but and you, you do need money. But if you have money in the idea, which is all these people you guys have, it failed miserably because they didn't know how to execute. Now, whether and they probably didn't know how to execute from an intake perspective and they probably didn't know how to execute from knowing the math of what works, what's not, they thought they could just throw a bunch of money at it, get retainers, and ooh, money. Anybody thinks that at first? but it's like, Part of me is like maybe that maybe that is the play is to work or maybe you And I'm thinking of this right now. like maybe you go start an Arizona firm. That's not sweet love And you go hey, gonna go build I'm gonna go build this other thing on the side that doesn't that's the optimized right genius word the optimized version of this so There are no loic. There's a lawyer Right, there's no there's a parent. There's a parent. There's a pot and you go can I can I get you know How many Arizona leads are there right now? It's like if I could get Four or five Arizona retainers a month you can gain that out you can map that out into the future And see what that looks like and what does that? I mean, I guess you could just do that right now You don't need to do the thing because you know you have all the math and say hey this is what that would look like this is what the profit margin on that would be and then how do you throw that so it's almost like you build this parallel track if it makes sense mathematically and then that's probably a pretty future proof model in a world where every state goes to 20 percent or whatever like you don't even care so i'm like that and then just use that spurtly can you have more than one law firm for an attorney that's what i thought there was some kind of limitation technically no technically right well litigiously
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, would it be even a conversation risk wise to have?
00:17:12 - mark sweet
So it's not as simple as just open up a firm in Arizona.
00:17:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah.
00:17:27 - mark sweet
There's more that goes on.
00:17:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you know, I'm like, let's just gain that out. What does that even look like? What is the profitable is that for. Right. Or that, that idea. nothing great. needs to be a firm.
00:17:42 - mark sweet
Why would it be more or less profitable than what we're currently doing.
00:17:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because you have close to no overhead.
00:17:54 - mark sweet
What?
00:17:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You knew it's better being in the case. I know, but it's just a spreadsheet, like what does that spreadsheet look like and if you can like build a model around the thing, what and it's real, so I'm just curious like what does that actually look like it's it's just like when it came up here in the that we're wrong, it's eventually going to come fight us in the because the model of literally selling a single or, you know, two products, whatever, like we average two products per person, you know, per car or whatever. And we were selling 20 a day and I was like, okay, the problem with that model was, well, if one day, 10 people show up. But I just made half the revenue and that happened. I would have it all the time. So then when I modeled it out as a subscription, I was like, OK, if I get the same amount of customers a day, the business triples is what I figured out. And I was able to create that spreadsheet because I had all the other data, I just had to map it to a different model. And when I did that, and literally I struggled for years, I just couldn't see how to do it. I was like, I don't know how we do it. I thought I was trying to build it in parallel, and I couldn't because I couldn't get enough data, and it just, it wasn't real. And then I stumbled upon how to do it when we were these jerks were trying to require us, and I had to do a bunch of math, and then all of a sudden I was like, oh wait, there it is. And then when I mapped it out, I saw, OK, I could do this for 90 days, we're in the exact same cash position we were trying to do. higher, except tomorrow, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed. And the day after that, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed because now I'm on a subscription. So that's what led me down that path. And then consequently, I didn't really see how much it would increase the overall gross business, but it did, like I said, it tripled. So here, it's like, Oh, wait, we have all the math. So let's build the spreadsheet. What does it, what does it actually look like? And then you can say, Oh, maybe that's maybe that's something that should be pursued. And then you then you get into the, well, you'd have to do this, you'd have to do that. But the it's real, the spreadsheet would be real. The math is real. It's what it's what the PE guys were missing. They probably didn't even have the other, but we have both pieces. It's just we have all the data. It's just not in a model. And it's like, whether or not you do it is a different story. But to know what it looks like, I think it could be would be interesting.
00:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I just had a thought that I've never had before because of what you just said, which is, and I don't know if this is possible or probable, but probably worth at least the conversation, rather than, or at least, okay, anyway, all these different thoughts at the same time. But what is the possibility and or even just ability to create a separate entity, and a separate business model that is not sweet law, but that you own mark that is almost like a science experiment of the most optimized level so that you could, without disrupting and having to move all of this to modify and alter this giant organization compared to something very small with maybe just one attorney so that it's not you, not because you actually need an attorney, but one attorney that out to scale with multiple assistance and case managers across multiple states where we figure out the thing that we've been talking about which is basically an attorney less type model with much less expensive people working for you, one attorney so that it's not you, one that you're and it could be one that's already existing and I haven't thought all of this through but basically what if we build the model that we're talking about, aside from sweet law, very very small and see if it can be optimized and then scaled like we are talking about and take it out of theory and into practice and see what what could be done.
00:23:08 - mark sweet
So walk me through this a little bit more. Obviously, I'm certainly whatever else. They're now going to be court owners of a law firm.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's- No, no, no, no. Not that one. No. No, I was just, they just were like, what would you do? I was like, I would do this. This is more about taking the the vendor model to give this vendor model and you're plugging it into, let's call it a traditional pre-lit firm. And now you're like, well, what if I plug that into a different model? Same concept. I'm going to go take vendors, but I'm going to run them into this Arizona firm that's using a model that is, like Tina said, this attorney list or this optimized firm. This idealized thing that, what is that? I look like, right? So it's like, how do you do it? And part of it is there are on staff. There is no Sam Tyler, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? So there's a pod maybe, or there's an optimized pod. And then you go, OK, this thing is getting this thing is signing five cases a month. And then you game it out, all right? Well, then in nine months based on the average on the average retainer amount, blah, blah, falling in $40,000 a month or whatever in month nine. And then it's kind of recurring, right? If all the numbers stay the same. So then it's like 40, 40, 40, But what is the actual profit margin on that? And I mean, we can literally do this in a spreadsheet.
00:24:51 - mark sweet
It could. So we're just making a parallel firm has its own intake, its own accounting, its own legal team.
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're not actually doing that. We're mapping it out so that you could so that we can look at that and go Hey this things Got 40% profit mark like whatever. I don't know what it's gonna say exactly, but And maybe and maybe like maybe you don't do it. Maybe you go Maybe you invest in it or we get you know what mean? It's like it's not necessarily I don't know what the outcome of it is but to know the model It's definitely what the PE guys were missing and it's like maybe that's the right like okay So if it's a law firm that can have non-lawyer partners you have that But what if one of the partners was a lawyer but wasn't a lawyer at the firm right? Can you be mark sweet that owns a piece of another law firm and not be a lawyer in that law firm? don't know Baby to it, but you're still gonna have all the liability and everything else.
00:25:57 - mark sweet
I'm sure right But why is this any different than say taking a case building out a pod that is in Corona or whatever else they're giving 50 plus fees back two-thirds of you back whatever it is.
00:26:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well because you could get other people's money right so you don't have to fund it so then you can go get I'll just say Omar you go to Omar and go hey I got this thing do you want to invest in it and then and you're not coming out of pocket at all and then it becomes like this sort of a revenue thing I mean it could be bigger than that right once it's mapped out then you're like you're building this asset you could start a new brand yada yada yada but really it should be way more profitable but it's almost like I was on this call this morning and it's we're going through this idea of buying catalogs of the music catalogs of these independent artists that are dormant and And part of the math, like the example, when we were using the catalog makes $8,000 a month right now. Well, that's with no promotion. So I can buy the, we could buy the catalog and then it's $4,000 a month to basically pay the financing. And then, and then, so I was like, all right, so you get four grand a month. And then the other four grand, I'm like, well, what if we just pump that into promotion to grow the asset of the catalog. So it doesn't make any money. And it just becomes this recurring thing of we're going to just invest in the asset over time. Because in year five, the assets going to start paying out more. And then we don't have to promote it anymore. So you could do something like that where you're building this machine that's like a self perpetuating machine. Like, I don't know exactly what it would look like, but I would like to know, I mean, dude, I can. do the spreadsheet. have all the data.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I might just make it. And you do that by next week?
00:28:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. I would like to see, I would like see what it looks like. Because then it could just, it could be an investment vehicle. It could be this like annuity that you build around using the knowledge and basically the knowledge that you've acquired.
00:28:23 - mark sweet
But how is it any different than me just doing our intakes? I know what's coming through, you're placing a certain firms in the field is bad.
00:28:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you expand on that? Because you said that before in the 50 like. So first of all, I don't think it has to be a separate entity. But the biggest thing is that your model of what you're paying your attorneys is what's choking you the most. And that you probably don't have to like you could, I don't know if you could use assistance for or paralegals for most of the work, but that's part of the conversation that's been had. So if it was somebody else, they would not be, it would be almost like they don't even have any connection to the rest of the sweet law. They don't operate the same. They don't have the same kind of commission structure. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a separate entity. basically, some very different type of operation is what needs to happen because it's the model that you have right now that is not optimized. Nice. Hello.
00:29:42 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You did.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was my I'm always like, you're sick. there was a female voice that it was definitely not damn hard.
00:30:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. No. Soft and twist.
00:30:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So I love it. I love it.
00:30:08 - mark sweet
love it. Getting outside money. Well, I don't want see is like not a problem, but that's generally not the main issue. Plus, again, new partners, expectations, dynamics become a lot harder, right? Yes. Getting loans or lines of credit are easier, although obviously more stressful.
00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't even think that's necessary. we're going to go minimum viable option, the simplest thing is create the model instead of, okay, so we've been talking about working towards building a more simplified model because we already have this big entity that exists the way it is. And there are multiple iterations and modifications in order to get that and vision. What I'm saying is, let's just create a new entity. It's not necessarily separate physical from sweetball. thought as a company. But it is in terms of the way that it operates, like it's an entity within an entity, with a completely different, you know, what do you call it? My brain at the moment is not working.
00:31:20 - mark sweet
No, we're saying just having intake the intake and referring out for the highest fees back possible from these other lawsuits, so you don't deal with the headache of actually running cases. And you just cherry pick the absolute best of the best, the best slam dunk.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not saying don't do that, but I'm saying that wasn't what I was talking about. I was talking about almost the same thing that you're doing now. But first of all, an attorney that is not getting the same payment structure, because that is part of what's hurting you. And then in a sorry, like I'm in an extreme amount of pain right now, my brain is not working really well, so I need both of you to help pull it back to conversations that we've had before. But to the point of like Salko has talked about what you could do, I don't think it's not having cases and I but more of who's working the cases and working them up and how it's getting done because I think the bigger issue is your compensation plan that you're paying attorneys that mostly don't have to do anything like understanding that also part of their function is being a liability buffer because paralegals in case assistance don't have any liability. Therefore, they're not incentivized to be extra cautious to make sure that they're not doing anything that's going to get you sued whereas an attorney is because they have liability. So anyway, but I'm looking at what is the most optimal or a two, maybe two variations of the most optimal type of model that we could build, that we're not able to build in sweet-law because we've got existing expectations and compensation models. Anyway, do you guys get what I'm saying?
00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do, but now I'm thinking, wait a second, we can actually, like, Lorenz is the only person that works in Arizona, right?
00:33:29 - mark sweet
Hey.
00:33:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, there's some other.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so.
00:33:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so now I'm thinking, thanks the new guy. You can, you could have, we can build two models, right? You basically have an Arizona firm right now for lack of a better price, right? You take all the money and that's going into Arizona now, that's operating as a current pre-lit firm, and then you con trust that against what if what if those things didn't exist and you would strip away Hank and Lorenz and yeah then you look at the marketing expense that's going there so yeah we can actually do this right now I'm super curious to see what that looks like because it should be a way higher profit margin entity or idea whatever you want to call so you're technically correct as it looks right now because like all of intake was under California payroll in California right yeah but we peel them out and say we know intake 600 bucks a retainer we already did that map so you just yeah but we did your map and it came out to a yours was slightly higher it was like six six forty or six twenty or something and then you we have the leak cost we have the average retainer we have all the things it's just and then we can put in It's like a left verse of this versus that. So it's like traditional pre-lit versus this other idea. And right, like you said, it's not that it needs money. That's just part of the formula, idea, money, execution, right? Sometimes it doesn't need any money at all. And it's more about like, you're talking about, it's really an exercise in what happens if this was executed differently. With the idea of like, hey, there's a future where fees could go down to 20%, right? And you could factor that and go, okay, now let's switch, let's switch, we know right now, if you switch the formula, you'd lose 16%, whatever you just said. You could then switch that formula in the thing ago. This is what it would look like. went to, it all went to 20%.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One more thing to think about that, in light of that. And again, I'm gonna tell you right now. mentally diminished capacity. But is there an opportunity? So going down to 20% fees in Nevada, if that happened, and obviously it would take some time, and by the time that we get there, it may be a moot point if we already have a more optimized model where we don't want to think about this. But you may be in the position of investing and being able to do this by the time that rolls around. Let's say small firms just die off, but they are maybe operating in some of the smaller communities, and they've got word of mouth, and they've got, you know, all these lead sources coming in, but they just can't operate like that anymore. Somebody's going to try to buy them out. Could you do that preemptively? Could you, and rather than actually buy them out, can you, I don't know, like just buy their leads, be like, look, this is coming. When we get there, anyway, this is this is a very premature conversation to have.
00:36:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But because it's happening with Salka right now. I literally just thought that the same thing. the thing that I was talking about earlier with the catalog, when I talked to those guys, so right now there's a catalog for sale. It's 250 grand. I did the math. It's worth way more than that. It came up with this formula based on the streaming, just the streaming revenue. They want 250 grand, so I was like, we should go back to them with an owner finance deal, and they were like, what's that? So this 50 grand down, 6%, you get paid off in three years, we have the ability to balloon payment whenever we want with no penalty. So yes, you could then, part of this could be looking at these older guy firms, and you go in and you own or finance the acquisition of their firms, but really what you're buying is their referrals, right? That's kind of what Steve is doing. It's Salka's weirdly, sort of inheriting these firms. I don't quite understand how it's happening, but you could do something like that. And again, then you're just getting retainers into this optimized entity. you have no money going up for those retainers other than the acquisition, which is a fixed monthly cost of whatever it is. And then you can go value that firm with your data and go, because they're not going to have it. What's your average retainer value? I don't know exactly. But here's the average retainer value in Arizona because I've already had hundreds of cases here. So this is the value of your firm.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why I always laugh at that. Because it's a sad truth, yeah. Every time. Hi. What are you thinking, Mark?
00:38:58 - mark sweet
It makes sense. It's complicated, but makes sense. months.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's definitely different.
00:39:05 - mark sweet
You're just going to be with the cost pre-acquisition, you know, at the end of period, no matter what, whether it's a 20 percent fee, a 30 percent fee, a 5 percent fee, right? Yeah. It has to make some sense. The smaller firms may actually end up better off because a lot of their stuff is just bored of mouth referrals. So they don't have a marketing cost.
00:39:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:39:27 - mark sweet
So they may actually be the one that better off and say, you know, Ronnie, Sweet James, whatever else the board does, because they're marketing machines.
00:39:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Their margins are susceptible.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. sure.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I think that's the next so are yours, right? like you are that to a degree.
00:39:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the best way to have this conversation is with a map, with we can plug something. thing in of this is what we know, right? And this is, and then do some projections if the margins were this, if the costs were that, you know, this is what the output would be. And then talk about logistics of what would it cost to operate this? What is that, you know, the range high low in terms of expenses, margins, things like that. So that we, what's that? I'm talking to my Anyway, just to visualize and kind of wrap our heads around it, but also to figuratively and literally actually be on the same page, having the same kind of vision as to what it could be. Because I think that that is back to minimum buyable product options, whatever. And knowing that the longevity of being in this business requires. being optimized, and also knowing that if you were to modify your compensation plan, you're going to upset people, but they may not have anywhere else better to go, so there's that. But regardless, it will affect morale, it will affect productivity, so that's not really a super viable option. Then what is viable though is building a parallel business that was born optimized based off of your pre-existing information knowledge experience, all of that, and then build that out, and then you can either maintain them both parallel because we've optimized enough that it doesn't take a lot of your personal bandwidth mark, or eventually the existing model of sweet-law kind of fizzles out, dies out while the optimized model grows, gets legs and becomes what you wanted the original thing to be. I think that so much much of their, there is the, you know, I built this house, I have to live in this house. Not a, this house can be a rental property, I'm buying another house kind of thing, which is where I go.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
Can we talk about something completely separate and different? you. You know, we're in a small break, but any dance help with this?
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:42:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go.
00:42:26 - mark sweet
So yeah, Chona took a job with Dr. E, so she's going to be doing kind of regular hospital stuff and clinic work, but she's also going be doing personal injury stuff.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
So this is where it gets interested. I can't send her into my cases because there's a conflict. So when she goes with other doctors and lawyers, lawyers, lawyers are really bad on the tech front. The only industry I think that may be worse is medical. By far, so government or government. Now, this may be a really cool chance to try that money dot com CRM that I know Dan's been talking about a lot because they do have a HIPAA compliant CRM. The only issue with everything is going to be HIPAA compliance. There's no zapier that's HIPAA compliant, but there's a like knockoff that is. So what I need to figure out how we can build is like a Monday dot com. can do scheduling with VAs that can take the basics of a patient, know, age, height, all that stuff. Sets up a telemed appointment. Telemed is probably going to be zoomed hip up. 15 minute console notes get pulled together mostly from a tent with the information the VA has gathered. They put all the other doctor reviews it before sending it over to the attorney with the appropriate bill. If we can actually make this work, it would be something very easy to sell to multiple practices that do personal injury because there's not lot out there that is very good. Okay, but I feel like there's some you might put something about that.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A bunch of high level is HIPAA. Okay, there's a bunch of people that do use it for HIPAA related businesses. So scheduling, I'll be done there, right? So they integrate with Google Workspace, which I think I'm not sure if that's HIPAA, you could definitely do the scheduling. Yes, you could use Zoom.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We'd have to find out if Zoom is HIPAA, probably is. There is a Zoom HIPAA that is charged more for it.
00:44:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then what else, what else do you have to, so you schedule the appointment.
00:45:07 - mark sweet
So they also need to do some sort of reports and bills and traffic of all this.
00:45:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can definitely do invoicing from within it. That's no problem. Then, you know, if there's. It would depend on what the reports are, right? So I just recently started creating my own apps that you like you basically I frame inside of high level. So as an example, for the thing that I'm working on with the music studio guys, we built this Spotify app that. It creates this sort of magic link that if a user clicks on the link, it launches Spotify and it's like, hey, follow me on Spotify. But then it also. kicks in their Spotify account, the album you choose, the singles you choose, the playlist that you choose, no, no other app does that. But it looks like it's just part of, it's called fan flowy. It just looks like it's built into fan flowy, but fan flowy is really just a white label of high level, like leave. So, yeah, if I understand, if we map out all the requirements, then I can go down a list and go check, check, check, check, check, and then you can determine if there's a custom app that needs to be made or not. And, yeah, it definitely sounds possible.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's, so needs is relative, needs because the function doesn't exist or needs because, because there's another opportunity where you are right now mark in building that. So there's something called SkyFlow, which uses OpenAI and different LMSs, LLMs, learning language models. Anyway, to make that data HIPAA compliant, and then there's one called Bastion GPT that is HIPAA compliant GPT service. But if there is, like so Dan's got Norio, if you have somebody who understands the code, if you understand what would make an API call to OpenAI HIPAA compliant, there's got to be some things, right, that it basically maybe has to reside on certain servers, has to have certain security protocols. And also, in terms of the communication being bidirectionals, so, omnid, what's the one direction? Anyway, so that data doesn't get fed back into. So open AI, so you can pull information from open AI, but it doesn't process outside of the secure server, so it stays compliant. Anyway, if you built that, then you would own the software service, that would be another revenue stream that you could have. we're on the precipice now, where even if somebody has it, nobody owns the market. That market is, it's a blue ocean right now. But in terms of having the assets to create something really well for that, just our understanding of it, Dan has a great coder that could do it.
00:48:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's a lot of people. Who is the end user? not a doctor.
00:48:42 - mark sweet
Like what is the end user's mix, right? So like a certain type of doc, like that part, I'm not sure. Yeah, let's go through stuff by step, because it's the problem. So, lawyer is usually sending over a patient.
00:48:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do a lawyer or another doctor?
00:49:00 - mark sweet
Yeah. we're patient to, which is you've Dr. E for lack of better term.
00:49:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
Before that patient sees Dr. E, someone's got to call and get some basic information. Right. Uh, name, height, weight, date of birth, all that kind of stuff.
00:49:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:17 - mark sweet
From there, if there's a personal injury component of it, the doctor's office is going to confirm, generally speaking, with the law firm that one, there's a sign lead, meaning the doctor's going to get paid, uh, to probably making sure the case is good. If you were a higher level doctor, not a chiropractor and scheduling that patient for a certain time. From there, you need to get the lean sign by both the patient and the doctor. Then you schedule the time to come in. Generally, if it's pain management, the first appointment, you can do a telehealth. You don't have to actually physically see them, or you can see them physically. doesn't really matter. If want scheduling, you want reminders, if it's to a location, you know, hey, here's where the address is, right, they can just click it and put it into their map really simply. Before the patient actually sees the doctor, it would be better that someone or a system, either a VA or a system, has those basics, this is what the person's complained about, this is their demographics, then they see the doctor, doctor takes all their complaints, reviews the records, and makes a recommendation, physical therapy, MRI, injections, whatever it may be, that's a report, that report and those bills would then be sent to the lawyer's office. All right, then you obviously have to keep some track of your AR, right, because that's what you're doing, so it would be cool to be able to see all the, let's see, cases you have with, so you're large, whoever it is, that gets paid, you're good on it. side. That way you can track how much you're getting paid by each lawyer's way, frankly. How much are they dropping? How much is making sense? Does this work?
00:51:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's, and so you're, yeah, and you're, what do they use nothing now? Or it's just some non-system paper and this and that or whatever.
00:51:21 - mark sweet
You use the electric, I definitely dealt with some paper. There's electrical medical record, but you know, the amount of personal injury they do right now is like less than 5% of their total business. The vast majority of what they do is health insurance. Yeah. know, you know, health insurance and what we do are not aligned in any way, shape or form.
00:51:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, right.
00:51:46 - mark sweet
So that's why I almost don't care what they currently have because I can almost guarantee whatever we're gonna put together is going to be a thousand times better.
00:51:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they would use it just for these. They would be like, oh, this is just for our PI work.
00:52:02 - mark sweet
But of course, as in everything, once we're gets out that, Hey, this is good. Everyone's gonna want it. Because it needs to work with the back end stuff. the biggest pain in the .
00:52:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And then we're talking how many different it's pain management and chiropractors or it's just pain management. Is it multiple types of doctors?
00:52:25 - mark sweet
So for what we're talking or just a handful, he's just a pain management doctor that you some procedures as well.
00:52:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's just a pain management.
00:52:33 - mark sweet
But if this works, could it go down streaming to chiropractors? Yes, chiropractors are usually kind of the last month of the cheapest people. Like they don't have a lot of money, pain docs, neurology surgeons will want this because they don't like dealing with the back end and right now they're just hiring people or hiring VAs to handle it, which comes with those issues.
00:52:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then it would be like Dr. E or whatever, it is working with sweet law and and and or it's like not not 20 firms but probably more than one or one to five or whatever I would guess where do we have far more real yeah wow okay just think of the you I can't sit on my volume to one doctor because it looks funky it looks bad sure sure where the client lives that may not actually be an option yeah three from the doctor you're not going to asking with one more firm and Chona is now inside one of these places she will be starting September 1st okay I mean that's where it's super helpful is to from me specifically to like get someone that's like in the thing and then show me the saying but I mean I'm listening to you right now and I'm literally building it going oh okay yeah all right yeah I can think I don't think it would do it like this complicated but you're gonna be no it's literally just knowing what needs to be known, right? you rattled off these things. I was like, okay. And in my head, I'm like, okay, I know that's built in. We were just the thing about high level is like, it's, it's like a sort of, there's, it's sort of like an erector set. And you, you, there's all these things you got to use them, but you have to understand what you're building, right? You have to sort of have the blueprint and then go, oh, yeah, yeah, all these, all these pieces are in the box. I just got to do it like this. And then eventually it could be a, that piece doesn't exist. Now I'm going to go build it outside and bring it in. So far, nothing, I mean, and obviously we're not too deep in it, but so far, I'm like, yeah, this is all in the box. I don't see.
00:54:47 - mark sweet
All stuff that's off the shelf.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
really. Yeah. And then you've just build, you build these custom automations and custom, whatever, you just, you just, we just have to put together the blueprint and then go, okay, now let's build that. And then the like SMS you don't we don't build that that's there But you write the SMS this and you write the automations and you set the schedules on that so right? Okay, yeah, I mean it definitely sounds plausible And then Yeah, you'd go after pain meds first so because then you'd have that you have the idea of you would build They called it snap, but basically it's like you build this whole File we'll call it that it's the pain management file. So you go. Okay. got a new pain management firm loop launch the file boom the whole thing's built and then they just they just fill in their name their address stuff like that and then you you Assasify it and you're charging whatever right you I mean We have pretty good idea of the value of it. So it's probably a high dollar sass.
00:56:01 - mark sweet
And you could also theoretically buy their paper.
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:07 - mark sweet
So you've got two different avenues where you can make a lot of money off of them.
00:56:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm building it in somebody else's house, and you don't own the software. So that's you know, no, yeah, did. So do you.
00:56:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, that that's the beautify level. There apparently there have been people that have exited their high level businesses for very large sums of money.
00:56:35 - mark sweet
mean, look at point.
00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's built in sales force. Yeah.
00:56:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's they're using the same model like there's they make money selling white labels. And then it's up to the white labeler. I think the problem with high level. I actually just went over this with someone the other day. The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill. of you could build an agency. In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real, are the people that build things like this, the litifies of high level, where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real. doesn't matter. Yeah, if you built a couple of custom things, that's going to make it look better. But really, if you want to sell that business, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. the cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for pay management doctors. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at $9.97 a month, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. that's eight acts in your own.
00:57:58 - mark sweet
And look, we know doctors, they're Not innovative whatever they have they rest it with no They are not innovative at all so It seems to line up very well kind of what we've talked about and again I don't know what we're gonna learn from doing it for a doctor or some good things.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're gonna learn for our own stuff But right yeah, I can see Dan taking an hour to build this first me taking two weeks It's not that fast, but here's here's the other benefit of doing that I think that you're all see if we if we were to build that The way that you could optimize sweet lot even more because I think that you would have a perspective shift That would be It's just one of those experiential things like when we first really saw the data like you thought you had a concept of what the data Looked like and what your numbers were and then we extracted and actually had that and that was like wow I didn't realize things were that whatever. I think it would be the same type of experience where your perspective would shift so much about what you think is possible versus what you know is possible because you saw something like that in action.
00:59:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well that's like I was just thinking how you know we're looking at this 20% fee thing or whatever but and it's like oh thinking three years out well if you think about the call two weeks ago we arrived at this place that was three years out from hey man you need more vendors or this could go sideways and now three years out you set a record and that vendor went sideways and it didn't matter yeah I was like that's that is great I was like I love that I was like that is so awesome so now it's like hey is it crazy to look three years out is it crazy to consider this 20% thing no no crazy not to no yeah it is you do the exercise it's like okay and maybe maybe it means nothing and maybe you learn something and but I'm Other people aren't going to do it at all, and then that's their folly.
01:00:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Look, in the worst, the worst case, we just built something else to make money. It's not a terrible situation.
01:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and there's not a maybe you'll learn something.
01:00:15 - mark sweet
You're guaranteed to learn something.
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. haven't done a single exercise. You haven't gone. Wow. Yeah.
01:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you always learn something even from the failures.
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And you're just paying money for that knowledge.
01:00:28 - mark sweet
But this is the right doctor to do it because he's he's a good doctor. I don't think he's the best doctor in the world. He's a good doctor, but he's a very, very, very smart business. So someone will get it and then, you know, it's on the people.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, that's super important.
01:00:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, yeah, because most doctors are going to say no, or I like my paper files.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet
Yes, but OK, cool. But I want to bring that up before I forgot about it because it's going to take a little bit. it's together, but like Tina said, I think it's going to actually take dividends over what we do and could help us with some of our own, you know, climb follow up and whatever else we're going learn from.
01:01:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, speaking of that, I mean, I've built some crazy, the stuff we're doing for the bands and the, like, I've built some crazy stuff on high level now. And it's like, Oh, okay, I get it. So I'm like, Oh, yeah, I can see how to build.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my last note is speaking of doctors and technology. I just showed Fuji how he could like save a huge pin in his butt with chat TBT and he's super excited about something that he hated. So it's good. Evolution and technology is our friends.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is he a chiropractor?
01:01:44 - mark sweet
No, he's pain doctor. So, Oh, he is. Well, right.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's the, he's the other guinea pig.
01:01:53 - mark sweet
By the way, you know, he does not know about each one of those new jobs. So not that you would ever let anything prop.
01:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Nope. Yep. Okay.
01:02:04 - mark sweet
Yeah. So again, if we can make this work, I'm very sure who would you be someone who would be extremely interested in using it?
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
01:02:14 - mark sweet
It just makes sense. Um, although I know they're more sales force based.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. level of crossing would be to the extent of what just happened is, hey, there's something good, but that was very generic and I didn't talk about what it was. So if that's okay, if that's not, I'll just never say Mark or Fuji to either one of you. No, you can say more. been trying to build out systems that help doctors be less stupid. Um, and this is what we've done. And I think you would very much understand that.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. I'm very, um, very shallow in any references to other people always.
01:02:53 - mark sweet
But yeah, wait for Dan to make more money and need to have less of it.
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm all for it. Everybody. Yeah. And also to have fun though, that's what's important, we get excited like our brains light up with this type of stuff, that's something to pay attention to, it's not just about making more money, it is about how we're doing it, it's the fun, it's the down loves puzzles, I love puzzles and cool people, so all of that, I think we're all in alignment with that type of thing, but we can't ever lose sight of that.
01:03:22 - mark sweet
