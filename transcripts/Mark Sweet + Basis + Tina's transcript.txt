Tina Marie: You just have to, because you can join something from multiple devices. You just have to click. Don't transfer to this device.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000

Tina Marie: Do you see anything here you like. As a starting point.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Westside Pain: Um, not entirely sure why, we're doing both.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Westside Pain: She, and she did ask for it. Like Denise, the main person at. At Sweet James, she said. Flyers and business cards. I'm not.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Tina Marie: Let's go ahead and start with the um. Flyer, first.st

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Tina Marie: I really need to get my nails done this week because they're so long. And my typing is hard.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Westside Pain: Maria. Everything. Okay with you. On your end. Okay.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Westside Pain: Yep. We have the 1030. Huh? I have a 1010, 30.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, I just sent out the message. Hope they show up.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Westside Pain: I think we could just do like, can we just do like a 1 page.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I was trying to get it to. Search on anything, Dr. Brochure.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Tina Marie: Are, one, page. But it's just not searching. Well.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Tina Marie: Let me just.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Westside Pain: Hi! We! I think we could just do the trifle and then just print the one. How can I do that?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Tina Marie: Golly! Yeah, we can do that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Tina Marie: I'm sure.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Westside Pain: I don't know. I really I'm still I still don't know how. What's the name? The name would be Dr. Arash Esma Incorporated. But it's just too long. And Mark thinks it's fast pane dog, so I I don't know, and.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Westside Pain: It's kind of like Maria will have to answer the phone. So does he say, Hey, this is fast paced. Dog or doctor arrive.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Westside Pain: Is too long. Huh!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Westside Pain: A what. I said, his last name is too long.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Westside Pain: I know, and we can't say Dr. East Pain clinic like.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Tina Marie: Um? Does he have any color things, or do you.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Westside Pain: On his website.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Tina Marie: Uh, well, you have a website, too. Right?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Westside Pain: The fast pain. Doc.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: The fast pain. Doc.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Westside Pain: fastpaindoc.com. It's it's that's the logo, the one that you have, the one on top left. That's the logo.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yeah, okay.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Tina Marie: So wait. I was oh.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Westside Pain: But on Fast Pain dog, it's West Side pain management. So we have to repeat, to change all of this.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, these are all business cards I want when they're not all. And he said, half page, but I don't know like are we talking about like half left, half top, half.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Westside Pain: He wants it horizontal, but I think a brochure should be. Long do you do like vertical.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So, and he was sick.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Westside Pain: And he doesn't. I agree with him that we should not do back to back. We should just do one. Not the full page like that, but just half.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Westside Pain: The.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Tina Marie: So let me see what the size is. What even is the size?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Tina Marie: File.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Westside Pain: They're not gonna do westside pay management anymore. Maria. I don't know. He he, Dr. E. Wants it to just be for Sweet James. But we can't. We don't know who's gonna and call the phone.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'm uploading a couple of samples right now to your drive. Um! I pulled the best one I had as well, but I'll upload them all.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay, upload files. That's really annoying.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Tina Marie: Let's see. Um. What do you call it? Downloads.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Tina Marie: It's done. Hang on a second. Oh.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000

Tina Marie: The wrong.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Westside Pain: Wow! That's very nice.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Tina Marie: Where is that?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
mark sweet: Sorry they're doing construction, so it's super hard to hear anything. One more time.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Tina Marie: Uh? Where did you put it?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
mark sweet: I just uploaded them all uh. And uploading. Some of this.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000

Westside Pain: Yes. Mhm.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
mark sweet: Make sure to.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Westside Pain: But that's like seemed like a very thick paper. Yeah.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
mark sweet: It's shiny. It looks nice, but, you know, spend a couple of bucks to make it decent. I guess.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Tina Marie: I don't know where you guys are looking.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Westside Pain: On this camera.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
mark sweet: Look at. It was at my camera. But it's okay. I'm trying to upload it to the folder itself. But.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Okay.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
mark sweet: Sorry I need a minute because I gotta do my own work stuff for a second, so I apologize. Just give me like 5 min. Something.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Tina Marie: No problem, you guys, I'm not in a rush. I don't have anything right after this. So whatever works for you.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Westside Pain: I'm I'm in a rush.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay. You are.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Westside Pain: But yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Westside Pain: I have like patients back to back, and I have to go to the clinic because there is an early patient. Um.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. What the heck.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Westside Pain: I just feel like I cannot do it like that. Maybe later down the road. I feel like we just have to do something. Nice and acceptable at this time.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Tina Marie: The easiest way to do it is something like canva where we get a template, because those things just don't come together that quick. But.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Westside Pain: Right. Right. I I think that that one that Mark has is.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Westside Pain: You know, will take a while.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I see I didn't uh see Dr. E. Um. Trying to upload this. Do you see what I'm working on?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Westside Pain: No.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Westside Pain: Your camera is off, and I think just showing like the addresses right like.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Westside Pain: We don't even have to write the entire address.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
mark sweet: No, I think if you just put just the cities, you're fine.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Tina Marie: Where did it go? Can't find the doctor.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Westside Pain: West Side, pain, management. I'm pulling their.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Let me uh.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
mark sweet: Alright! Are you in the drive?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'm just uploading to that specific folder right now. So. I just uploaded generally, but it's just going at this moment.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Tina Marie: What do we want to say here? Dr. E. Or. Or his whole name, or what.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Westside Pain: Well. The the company name now is Dr. Arash Esmalzadegan, Incorporated. So.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
mark sweet: I don't think you should do fast pain, Doc.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
mark sweet: Cause. That's what they're going on the website. That's the email they're using. That's everything they're using.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
mark sweet: I don't think.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Tina Marie: That is a whole page. Ha! When you say half page, that's what you mean.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
mark sweet: So this is like a flyer that we got. I think theirs is pretty good. This is one of their biggest competitors. Can you see it on my.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
mark sweet: Okay? And then this is what the back looks like.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Tina Marie: Can you take pictures of those and send them to me.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
mark sweet: I already did. They're getting uploaded right now onto the.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
mark sweet: It's just go ahead.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Tina Marie: How about? We agree on the content and maybe colors and a few things, and then I can just work on this when you're not here and send you some stuff.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Westside Pain: Okay, that's amazing. Yes.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: Okay, um, what's his could spell? Okay, we're going with West West. Pain management.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Westside Pain: Thank you.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
mark sweet: No.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Westside Pain: No.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Westside Pain: Fast pain, Doc. That's what.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Tina Marie: What? Okay. Fast. Paint. Doc.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Westside Pain: Okay, don't get mad, honey, but does it sound like too. And.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
mark sweet: This is your business, I mean you. You choose whatever you want.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Westside Pain: No, but you, you already started this the email. It just sounds like. Tacky, is it? Just me?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Tina Marie: Let's do this. I'm just gonna go. I'm not gonna format it right now. I'm just gonna get the content that we need.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Westside Pain: And I know that.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000
mark sweet: So I apologize because I'm super East Coast today. But like I don't give a shit, it's how can you remember it? How is it? Top of mind.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000
mark sweet: Because they're emailing and calling it. They're not calling Dr. Rash as mostarian. They're gonna then call and Google it and then find the main line that's gonna go to who the fuck knows where in Mexico.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Tina Marie: Hey!

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
mark sweet: Rather than directly to you.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Tina Marie: Hotty mouth. But yeah, you're right. He's right.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
mark sweet: Do not. I am not in timeout. Hudson's not putting me in timeout.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Tina Marie: I can mute you from here. So let's go.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
mark sweet: I know you can.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Um. Chona. He's right. The the top of mind, the easy to remember all of that stuff.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Tina Marie: Is incredibly important. Otherwise you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Westside Pain: Okay, so then. We'll just stick with fast pain, Doc.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Westside Pain: All throughout. But then the name of the company is not fast. Pain dog. The name of the company is Dr. Arasha smells it again.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so. What do your wait, wait, wait! What do your vendors need to know to get people to you? That's that's all. That's not gonna cause any issues. When their patients get a call from you.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
mark sweet: We don't care.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Tina Marie: When? Yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Westside Pain: I'm sorry. Like what? Um, what? Services we're offering.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Tina Marie: No. Okay. So the the continuity that needs to be there meaning the connection between the names right. Is so that the case managers.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Tina Marie: Know who they're calling when they call you. And the patients understand why somebody, from identifying themselves from.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Tina Marie: Let's say West pain management is calling them, or fast pain. Doc. Whatever. So that all needs to be on the brochure mark, I get the top of mind and speed. But if there's not continuity, then when the case manager say, I'm calling, you know. So so and so is going to call you. If it's from a different place, they might get confused.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Tina Marie: Does that make sense.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
mark sweet: It does except the phone number and everything else that they're using is fast pain. Doc.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so what should what should the flyer say? Who is? Who is it from? If you just walk it through, I'll type it and format it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
mark sweet: Why don't I have a really good middle ground? Why don't we do fast pain, Doc? By Dr. Arash Osmozad, or whatever his last name is? Dr. E.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Westside Pain: August.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Tina Marie: Can we spell it?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
mark sweet: No, I really can't.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Westside Pain: Yes, it's on that um! Uh! What do you call that, Tina? It's on fasting, doc.com.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
mark sweet: Here. I'm gonna add it in the chat to just from his website. So you can just see it quickly.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I will copy and paste there. Oh.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, it's right there.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Tina Marie: Okay, we're just gonna.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Westside Pain: But but he's incorporated now.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Tina Marie: Shopping.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
mark sweet: Look at this pretty website. Is a beautiful website.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
mark sweet: I would pick this doctor.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Westside Pain: Honey, do we. I'm sorry. I I just don't know how specific do we need to be for the names to not get confused? We're gonna eliminate West Side.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
mark sweet: Not very.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Westside Pain: Pain, right.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:49.000
mark sweet: So the issue? I don't know, Tina. This will explain to you. Um, so like image uses something called the foundation.ai uh everything that comes in gets scanned and goes through their AI system. There's another pain, doctor, Dr. Jim Nasiri, who also has West Side pain.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
mark sweet: Management, and so in their system, it's getting very confused.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Tina Marie: Right, right, right.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
mark sweet: And so uh Gymnastiri is related by blood to the guy who runs Sweet James. So we're never gonna win this argument.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:15.000
mark sweet: Uh, which is why we rebranded to fast pain, Doc. Also, it's easy to type. Um the issue and part of what we've been trying to get Dr. E. To change is within his Tebra system. Right? The ehr. To show Dr. Rosh as Mazadeg. I'm just Gonna say Dr. E.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
mark sweet: Um on the top of all the reports and the bills.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Westside Pain: Incorporated.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:28.000
mark sweet: That way when things get scanned, and it goes properly because the. Case managers love working with Maria and Chona. Um, they're very happy with everything, but it's just a little bit of a technical issue.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:39.000
mark sweet: Um, and I I can promise you the case. Managers are not looking at the name of the reports, because everything's getting. Automatically uploaded into their system. It goes to a completely different department in their case.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
mark sweet: To write the demands.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Westside Pain: So then maybe we can talk to Dr. E. And say on the top, Maria, like on our notes and bills. It says West Side right now, right. Yeah.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Westside Pain: We can probably do fast paint, Doc, and then Dr. Arash, a small Zitagon incorporated.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
mark sweet: You don't even no, I would not put fast paint on.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay, let me let me tell you why we don't need to spend all this time doing this. When we create it. 1st of all, replacing names in A in A in a template is super fast, and the fastest way to know the right thing is to give it to somebody, and who thinks that's wrong, and they'll tell you what it should be.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: So then we just change the name. Instead of trying to figure out what he would want now.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Westside Pain: No, because the name on Tebra we cannot change it. We have to. That's what we're trying to.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Tina Marie: But but all we're doing right now is just creating this brochure. So I'm saying, it's a 1st draft. Will we make it? And then you show it to him. Say, do you want to change anything or whatever? And you? My point is, you can take time, not on this call.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Westside Pain: Mhm.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Tina Marie: To figure out the name because it's a 2 second fix. Does that make sense.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, I'm just thinking about the continuity. Like on the bill.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Tina Marie: Right. But you can think about that offline while we figure out the rest of the stuff of how you want it to look. Now, if that makes sense.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Westside Pain: Right? Okay.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tina Marie: Um cause. I don't have to know that to help start creating something for you.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Westside Pain: Good.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Tina Marie: Does that make sense? Because I'm trying to make it easier for you right now.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Westside Pain: Right.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Tina Marie: I know it's overwhelming. Um, so this is like. The generic information we could workshop. What.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Tina Marie: It says, and then I could go find a few different templates. Send it to you, say. What do you like about these? And then I'll I'll put things together. Would that work for you guys.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Westside Pain: Yes.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so what's the? Let's see, I can probably get information from here. Huh? Maybe.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Westside Pain: So the one that mark. Mm-hmm.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Tina Marie: This number.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Westside Pain: Mark. So we hm.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tina Marie: This number.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, that's the number. And that's not the email. So I don't know why Mark had that email. There.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
mark sweet: What email are you complaining about.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Westside Pain: Info at fast paint dog, that is, that the leans.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000
mark sweet: Oh, uh. No? Well, that's just the general info email. So again, if you did, it leans. That means everything would go there which isn't.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
mark sweet: Proper. But if they send an email to info, I believe it's also gonna go to liens. Let me just triple check.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Westside Pain: That's the main address, Tina, but should we cause we have 4 locations.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tina Marie: Do you want? I'll put them all.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Westside Pain: I I think we could just do. Like 100.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
mark sweet: I would just use cities.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Tina Marie: You don't want to do Huntington Beach right.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Westside Pain: Huh!

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000

Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

mark sweet: That's where all the procedures are done and everything else.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Westside Pain: Huntington Beach and Long Beach are the main office.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so. Um. I'll go here.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Tina Marie: Somebody made this really easy for me to grab.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that would be it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Tina Marie: Nope, that was your huh!

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
mark sweet: That'd be Isaac. But I would just put the cities. I wouldn't put the. Whatever's um, although we can make a quick QR code as well.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Westside Pain: Feel like. I don't know if you can see this, Tina, but on the bottom of the card. Cheryl did this for the leans. It just says the location. Like Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Long Beach, and Lake forest.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay, got it?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Westside Pain: I think that should be. We don't need to put the entire.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Westside Pain: Unless we can put it at the back of the brochure. I guess.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Tina Marie: I don't know what's the other one. Forest, something.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Westside Pain: Ah, lake, forest.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: Um, do you? Do? We want it in all caps for easy like. That's the locations, or just that's how it was on the site.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Tina Marie: Yep, okay, Anna.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000

Tina Marie: Trigger point injections. What.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000

Westside Pain: It's the last. Yeah, mhm.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Westside Pain: It's like prp injection. PRP, yeah.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Westside Pain: And then and then the next.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Westside Pain: Um. Not under. W. Yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Westside Pain: Uh medication management is what we wrote.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. I gotta figure out the formatting. No, that's not it. Um!

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Tina Marie: Let me go out. One. Yeah. There we go. Vacation.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Westside Pain: Management maybe. It's important to write on top, or wherever um.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Westside Pain: Like. We can schedule.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Westside Pain: Visits within 0 to 3 days, you know something like that. And that's true, like right, Maria, where we can do it that same day.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Westside Pain: Yes. Or 3 days.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Westside Pain: Kind of like fast scheduling. I know we're trying to do. Like catchy fast scheduling. Maybe that's a term I don't know.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Tina Marie: Let's see um.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Westside Pain: Same day is offered, but not guaranteed. So it's like.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Westside Pain: The fast days, or whatever fast scheduling 0 to 3 within 0 to 3 days.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Tina Marie: Let's say, what if we? What if we say as fast. As same day.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't like the wording just like it could be as same day. Um.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, but that that's you saw, you know, the.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Tina Marie: Or from same day to.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Westside Pain: What we're trying to say, and then.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Westside Pain: And then reports within one to 3 days. It's like part of that one actually on the bottom, like.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Westside Pain: That's part of the service. Yeah.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I'll I'll figure out how to workshop it. And then, whatever you guys do.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Westside Pain: Okay. And then.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Tina Marie: Like you can tell me to fix.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Westside Pain: And then in-house. What's that term? Um, honey? What's that term? Dr. E. Use like n suite.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
mark sweet: They don't care about that, I promise you. But if you want to say um surgery center in house, you can. But I promise you they don't care about that.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Westside Pain: En suite fluoroscopy, I don't know like.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
mark sweet: Yeah, you're getting really detailed.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
mark sweet: I promise you that those case managers.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Westside Pain: Some. Some people don't like to work with other surgery center.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
mark sweet: Right.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Tina Marie: But you'll find that out when they call when you call them.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Westside Pain: Don't!

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Tina Marie: And you can sell that right. I think. The, the.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
mark sweet: The bigger thing is that you have all liens in house.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, we have to write in there in house uh leans in house something like that.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:34:01.000
mark sweet: They don't sell their paper. So the issue with this is, some uh doctor offices will sell their uh. Accounts receivable to 3rd party companies, because they don't want to hold the the lien.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000
mark sweet: This doesn't happen in this case, because. When you sell to a 3rd party company they gotta make money. So obviously it tends to cost more and can be a lot more of a pain in the ass.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Tina Marie: That's probably one we wanna like highlight in here. Um, I'll.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
mark sweet: That was a very big deal that Sweet James had made, that they would, didn't want to work with anyone who did that.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Tina Marie: We'll figure out, you know, how to make this look good on a brochure and make the right things pop. And again, anything you don't like, we'll just edit. But once you see it all together, it'll make it so much easier to go. Okay.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Tina Marie: Yes, this know this change, that that type of thing.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Westside Pain: I think the main thing is those 3 things on top that you wrote this. Fast scheduling, and reports within.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, those 3 and all links in house. Those are the ones that are. What we're trying to let.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
mark sweet: Can I add a couple of things.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Westside Pain: Huh!

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
mark sweet: Can I add a few things.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Westside Pain: Sure. Maybe you're nice.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mark sweet: Uh! You might. Sorry, what.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Westside Pain: Nothing.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
mark sweet: No go ahead!

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Westside Pain: No just kidding.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
mark sweet: No, I didn't hear what you guys said. I'm so sorry.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Westside Pain: What is your time?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
mark sweet: Uh, do you? Wanna add that transportation could be set up for procedures.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Westside Pain: Oh yes, yes.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Westside Pain: It's uber.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
mark sweet: You don't want to say uber, you just say transportation.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Westside Pain: Do we need another legal paperwork for Uber transportation.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
mark sweet: Probably.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Westside Pain: Hmm.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Tina Marie: Is that a major selling point? Or come, put it down here.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
mark sweet: That is a pretty large selling point, because most.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:44.000
mark sweet: Companies won't do it, because it's a hard cost that they have to absorb by paying for someone. To uber back and forth, and while law firms should be the ones absorb it, not all of them do.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
mark sweet: Um just provided for procedures, because we don't want it for the consults. There's just not enough money.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Westside Pain: On calls, yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay, it won't look like this. But.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
mark sweet: Understood. The other thing you may want to add is.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Tina Marie: Just so I know what's important.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
mark sweet: That you also have neurosurgery.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Westside Pain: Or to pivot.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
mark sweet: And orthopedic, because you want to show that you kind of have everything. So you're the one stop.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. So we'll probably want that in here. Like in this. These bullet points.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Tina Marie: Yes, no.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
mark sweet: I I would do something like that, but I don't. Can you guys see this? I don't know if this is readable.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Westside Pain: You can't see services accepted.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Tina Marie: Hold on. I'm not even looking, cause I'm on my screen.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
mark sweet: Token.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: Services accepted on lien basis. Oh, yeah.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Westside Pain: I can't see. Yeah, that one is.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay, you took a picture of that for me, though. Right?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
mark sweet: I did, but I'm just trying to do you see how simple this is, instead of. All details.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
mark sweet: I would urge you to mimic something more like this.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Westside Pain: That's.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Westside Pain: So this flyers are for the attorneys. The case managers so.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
mark sweet: Correct. This is like I got this from Diego's office.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Westside Pain: You know. Yeah. So the email would be the leans at fast pain. Doc.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Westside Pain: Dot com.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay, thank you. Uh, email.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Westside Pain: I'll type it lanes at. Has paindoc.com.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:21.000
mark sweet: And just as a question, because I can make it as an alias. Do you want a scheduling at fast pain, Doc? Instead of leans or no.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
mark sweet: Just as you're growing and getting bigger. I'm just thinking out loud.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Tina Marie: What? What will mean the most to the attorneys.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Westside Pain: This is for attorneys.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
mark sweet: This is for case managers. This is not for attorneys.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Westside Pain: Thanks, ma'am.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
mark sweet: It's 1 in the same. But the case manager is the one calling and doing this. The attorney.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Westside Pain: Same thing.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
mark sweet: Is not getting involved generally at this level.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Tina Marie: The the question's still the same. What matters most for them.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:51.000
mark sweet: I was just thinking, separating out between liens and scheduling because liens is when they're trying to negotiate more towards the end and scheduling when you're getting someone set up, and that way as you grow, you could.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Westside Pain: Annie, we're changing again. This is like multiple changes.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
mark sweet: Thank you. Okay. It's fine, then never mind.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Westside Pain: I. I'm just cause right now we're do. We're we have it all in one email, which I.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Westside Pain: I actually, I think I prefer so I can see we can see everything, even the the ones who accepted the zoom right, Maria, like when they accept they we can see it. Yes, we got a notification.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Tina Marie: It also helps the case. Managers, probably as well to only have one email address.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'm just thinking as you guys grow and get busier. But that's perfectly fine.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Westside Pain: As we grow we get busier. We need another person.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Tina Marie: Well as you grow and get busier also, as as we just get a little bit further ahead and don't have to be building things. We can use AI to sort and look at the text predictively and say. We think this is scheduling email. And whatever that type of thing.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Westside Pain: Mhm.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. Locations. So what other content needs to be on there? If anything.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Westside Pain: That's really it.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay? And do we have um images besides? So are we using Dr. E's picture.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Westside Pain: No, I thought that we're using that um. That logo on the website. That is fine.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay, just the logo. No, no picture of a person.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Westside Pain: No, I I don't know. I don't think so. What do you think, Han?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
mark sweet: This is your thing. It's up to you.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Westside Pain: I mean that that brochure you have doesn't have a picture of a person. It's a picture of their office.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
mark sweet: Right. Some have pictures of me, and some don't of their people, but I.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Tina Marie: That, and that was.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Westside Pain: Here's the thing.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Tina Marie: Do we wanna have pictures of the offices? Do you guys.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
mark sweet: To me.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Westside Pain: What I'm concerned of is because they're seeing me 90% of the time, not Dr. E.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Westside Pain: So I just don't want like this case matter like, Oh, Dr. Arash, it's a male doctor that you will talk to.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Tina Marie: So. Or photo session for Chona.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Tina Marie: Just saying no.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Westside Pain: No, I don't. I.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
mark sweet: We can get you with your arms crossed. It's okay.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Westside Pain: I my ego? Is not that big.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
mark sweet: Mhm. Alright.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Westside Pain: I don't care.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Tina Marie: But you're so cute, though I would go see you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
mark sweet: I would beg to argue um. It's fine.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Tina Marie: You're lucky you're not reachable. I just.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Westside Pain: And do you have any suggestion, Maria? Like anything that I'm not seeing that you're seeing.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Westside Pain: And. No, I I think.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Westside Pain: That's important. For like. I guess our clients.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Westside Pain: By scheduling. Hmm.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Westside Pain: I think that's it. They can text and call this number. Yeah.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Westside Pain: But I don't think we should put that on there. Is that important?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Tina Marie: Oh, um!

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Westside Pain: I know we shouldn't, but.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Westside Pain: But anything that's just simple. Like with a.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Westside Pain: Basic. The the background of this could just be the spine, right? The logo. Mhm.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Westside Pain: Like the whole back.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
mark sweet: Uh, I uploaded the logo that we did for your website onto the Google drive. So it'll be easy to bring in.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Westside Pain: That's what I'm saying, like the background of this could just be the spine.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, that's what you mean. The logo. Okay?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Westside Pain: Yeah. That logo on top. Left. Yeah.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:18.000
mark sweet: Um. If this is primarily for sweet James, and given also that your last name uh is now sweet, since you stole it from me. Um, do you wanna add in like something like the sweetest pain management or something else, I'm onto it again. We're kind of leaning into the cheesy thing, but trying to keep it memorable on top of mind.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Westside Pain: Okay. Okay.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000
mark sweet: And that way when you give them candy, or whatever else, to again underline the suite theme. Uh, it's a little easier for you.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Tina Marie: But Tona's name is not. On here.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
mark sweet: China's last name is Sweet.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Westside Pain: In there, I know, but it's not there.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Tina Marie: I know that. Oh, my gosh! I think, mister, I don't confuse them with too much information. Let's add more information.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Westside Pain: I know.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Tina Marie: Make up your mind.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Westside Pain: I would think we should add your name in Tona. Huh!

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Westside Pain: I, I said I would think we should add your name in somewhere.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Tina Marie: I do, too, because this this is your business, and.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Westside Pain: Cause, cause you're right, cause I'm I'm dealing with the Ca, we're dealing with a case manager all the time. Yeah. And then again, with the name at the top, saying, Fast Pain dog, by Dr. Rosh, like, I feel like they're gonna think more it's like with him than with you.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Westside Pain: Hmm.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Tina Marie: I'm just gonna. Be, Chona! What's your.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Westside Pain: And you can put Dnp.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Tina Marie: BNP.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Tina Marie: Are there periods in between.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Westside Pain: No.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
mark sweet: Don't. You have like 20 different things after your name.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Westside Pain: No, I I don't need that. We don't need that here.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
mark sweet: I counter argument.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Tina Marie: You, you.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Westside Pain: It's it's d as in David, not me.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Tina Marie: Oh, sorry!

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Westside Pain: It's okay.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000
mark sweet: My counter is, I might put it all in because it does help establish credibility, because you do have a lot of other letters that go after your name.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Tina Marie: Yes, he's he's right, Tona. It isn't about ego. It's about. Um trust and um. Well, it's just. It's just. It's just trust social proof.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Tina Marie: Accreditation, accreditation.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, I just here's my concern, because right now, and Maria and I talk about this yesterday. Uh, is it Marie? Who do I talk to yesterday. I think, Mark. That we're not telling. When Maria make a schedule, we're not saying you're gonna see a nurse practitioner. So I think the patient automatically assume.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Westside Pain: That I'm a doctor, which I do have my doctorate. But I'm not a medical doctor. Mhm.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Tina Marie: Right so. But but this is for sweet James, and we're we're working on branding.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Westside Pain: And. Mhm.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Tina Marie: Which, with the branding, all of that is important. So um, they have a doctor, so that the patients, whatever they share with their patients. Um, they can decide what their patients need to hear most. You can like we can get to that conversation separately. But if we think about this as just a snapshot of everything they need to know, to send you business.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Westside Pain: Okay.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Tina Marie: We want the power version. Does that make sense.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, so I I it's I will just type it in here. Then.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Thank you. That's a lot of letters, lady. Look at you.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I'm gonna. Paste. What now?

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh, wait! Zoom does not let me copy and paste. I don't know why, but it's okay. Fnp.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Westside Pain: Well, we can just text, okay.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Tina Marie: That's BC.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Westside Pain: I think, okay, maybe the the fast paint dog would be just. We will just do it like bigger. That's like our main name of the company.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Tina Marie: FM, E, dash, BCOB, C.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Westside Pain: I just don't know how. Specific Steve wants in terms of the name cause. Our the company name is not.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Westside Pain: Fast Pain Dog. The company name is Dr. Arash Smazidigan, Incorporated. That's why I'm confused, you know. I don't know.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Tina Marie: So we can put billing information lower, like, if that's separate. So they know who to bill.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: Or send money to. Cause. That's really the only reason we need that.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Westside Pain: You mean? Yeah. Is there a way should we put Incorporated below the fast pane, Doc? I I don't know. It's a question.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Westside Pain: Because I don't know.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Tina Marie: So my! My thought is, here's what they need to get a person to you and send you business.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Westside Pain: Right.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Tina Marie: Once you've established business, then you have a relationship with them and their case managers. And you can send them a separate file or.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Tina Marie: Something that says, here's what you do to pay us, or it can be down at the bottom. But looking at the at the other brochure mark? Does it have what is needed to pay them.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
mark sweet: No, this is just how you get someone in, because the most important part is getting a person in.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Tina Marie: Right. Right. So they have to pay you. They have to send the money where it needs to go. They have to make sure that they do that right.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Tina Marie: They're kind of obligated at this point. They don't have to send you patients.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Westside Pain: Right.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Tina Marie: So let's get them everything they need to know to send you patients.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Westside Pain: So we can. We can put the building.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
mark sweet: Sorry. Hold on, really, really, really quick. One thing I am noticing that we did not discuss on any of this is the hours.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, it's on the site. Um.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
mark sweet: Well, I just put basic hours. Um.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Westside Pain: So we we are flexible, right, Maria. We have like weekends. And after hours we can, you have to write that down? That's actually.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:32.000
mark sweet: I would. I would definitely write that down, because I think that's another good selling point.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Westside Pain: Oh, we didn't put telemedicine, though. No.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Tina Marie: I did. Yeah, it's here. I just don't know where to put it.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000
mark sweet: You too. I will put that with locations so telemedicine available, statewide.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Tina Marie: Um. I can type man.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Westside Pain: We can even say that the telemedicine available for faster scheduling. I don't know.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
mark sweet: Or same day telemed may be available.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tina Marie: Or faster for expedited.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000
mark sweet: For vip. Everyone wants to be vip.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay, what's this?

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Tina Marie: Say that to me again.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
mark sweet: Thomas, and available statewide, I think, makes. Sense I don't know, for faster scheduling. It's up to you on that regard. But.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Westside Pain: Okay.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:35.000
mark sweet: Um telemed uh same day for vip patients. Or clients whatever you want to say, because trying to for a Vip client will schedule someone the same day. I know she will.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Westside Pain: Even not vip. Well. Remember that email yesterday, Maria, they put.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Westside Pain: What's that? That.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Westside Pain: They email it at 1140. I'm like, let's see them now. 1145, something like that. And we saw the patient 12 o'clock.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Tina Marie: Well, then, that just makes them all feel vip. But that's okay, because that's still. It's that makes them happy.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. Any other information that needs to be on here or corrected.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Tina Marie: So far.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Westside Pain: I think we are on the good, you know. We're on base on just saying the word fast, fast. Those are like keywords which we did. You put multiple times, fast reports, fast scheduling.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Westside Pain: Like, those are.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. Well, um.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Tina Marie: If there's nothing else that you want to add to it, then I will spend time working on putting. Uh. Well, the 1st thing I'll do is just send a couple of um brochure templates, or like.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Tina Marie: Page templates for this to make sure that the imagery is like, do do you have pictures of the offices that we could use or.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Westside Pain: We don't.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
mark sweet: You don't want to do that.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, it's not the best.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay, okay, got it.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Westside Pain: It's not the best, and and also um. Do you mind just sending on the um, Tina on the Lien's email that way, Maria and I can see it.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Westside Pain: Both of us that email.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Tina Marie: Well. Oh, when I when I tell you, when I send you the um.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Westside Pain: Yeah. The sample. Thank you.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Tina Marie: Yes, this one leans at fast pain. Doc.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, got it?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
mark sweet: Also go, do some business cards.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Westside Pain: And.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Tina Marie: Well, if we once we get this going, then you could say, Take this and this and this, or something I feel like that will go a lot faster.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Tina Marie: But um! You could tell me. What. What did this.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Westside Pain: I think it should be the same on the business card, like the background, is just fine and just very simple. Me and Dr. E's name and fast pain, Doc, and even just the location, the phone number email location. That's it.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Westside Pain: Like the one.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's just a slim down version.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Westside Pain: I forgot. Yeah, the one that I showed you. Yeah.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay, hold on. Biz, card. Biz, card, name.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Tina Marie: Phone email.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Westside Pain: And then the 4 locations in the bottom.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Tina Marie: Then how about fast, fast? And none of the others.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Westside Pain: Sure, whatever it is, that's.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Westside Pain: You know the fast pane dog. Yeah.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And again, edits are pretty quick. Once we get something created. So if it's not right, we'll just tweak it.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Westside Pain: Mhm, that way. I can probably just drop drop it, print it hopefully by the end of the week. Before the end of the week I'll drop it off in their office, and with something.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
mark sweet: Staples is super easy. As long as we get it in by noon it'll be ready same day.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, like by Friday, and I'll give them. Uh they. They don't wanna meet yet, because I don't know.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: Drop it off with donuts or candy, or something else.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, I will have to like grab something and give it to Denise.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Tina Marie: Mark. What were the dimensions of that full like? Is that really just half a page.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
mark sweet: If that um.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Westside Pain: We can just do the long. No cause I feel like if they have. If they're they're like cubicles. Tina like their table desk.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. What you say, long, like long and narrow like. What really, what I need is number dimensions.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Westside Pain: Like the trifolds.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
mark sweet: This one I'm looking at is a half page. One that was used as the example with Haven.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay, somebody tell me, dimensions.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
mark sweet: This is up to Jonah.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Westside Pain: I don't know to trifold. Pamphlet, Dimension.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000
mark sweet: Again. They're small cubicles. So room is at a little bit of a premium.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Tina Marie: And if it's folded, then they have to, you know.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Westside Pain: We're not. Gonna yeah. We're not gonna do the full. We're just gonna do the back to back.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Tina Marie: And it's. So, but then a trifold is a full page, and it costs more for printing. I don't know if that matters.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Westside Pain: Oh!

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
mark sweet: It also takes up more space.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Westside Pain: Okay, by fault. Oh, I didn't mean. I'm sorry I'm not articulating. Well, that just size that. How the trifle this size that's what I'm saying with the.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Westside Pain: The dimension. Not the entire 3, you know.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
mark sweet: So you want to be a 3rd of a page.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Westside Pain: Yes, that's what I'm saying. Just a 3rd of the page.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
mark sweet: It's pretty small.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Westside Pain: Is it.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tina Marie: It is to fit a lot of information on to make it readable. It is.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Westside Pain: Okay, then just the bifold. Then.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so half page, but long ways.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Westside Pain: Like that size of the microphone. Right? So it's 5.5 by 8.5. It's a by fold. If it's the entire sheet, so you cut it in half. It's by 5.5 inches by 8.5.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay, got it? Yeah, got it?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
mark sweet: So, Han, you want it to be long, not wide.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, I don't like it. Why? Cause there's. The one that you've said you you gave is.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Westside Pain: Odd. It's noticeable, but it's kinda odd shape. I don't know, because especially if they have small cubicles they want. You want something long. No.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:00.000
mark sweet: Okay. Um.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Westside Pain: I saw it. It's like they have small cubicles.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
mark sweet: And admitted. My personal opinions wide over along on that. But that's just my personal preference.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Westside Pain: So my worry is if it's white. Because it's it's UN. It's a normal. It's not normal shape. So then they will cover it up.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Westside Pain: That's just my opinion. If I have a cubicle like, and I have like this, I might cover this up.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000
mark sweet: Because people. So as people read left to right, not up and down.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Westside Pain: Is it.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000
mark sweet: Well, we could do 2 different ways and see which one looks better. But um.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I sent some different.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Westside Pain: Why do? Why do you think a bifold is not made horizontally.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.000
mark sweet: Okay, bifolds are just you. Cutting it in half. So I think we need to use proper terms. So we're on the same page.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
mark sweet: But this is your thing. Whatever works for you, or make.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Westside Pain: I'm not. I don't know. I just I just wanted to have someone something done.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Westside Pain: Whatever is, is easiest.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay, well, that helps. So as I lay information out whatever I need to get the content there.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Tina Marie: Then I'll pick the shade that makes the best, and if you want to modify it, we'll modify it.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Westside Pain: Yeah, no. Whatever is easiest that we can get out fast.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
mark sweet: The one thing I would say is.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Westside Pain: Does he already know us? Huh!

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.000
mark sweet: The only thing I would say is some brighter colors, because they are really depressing cubicles. And people turn on the bright colors.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Westside Pain: Well. Our logo is light blue. With the spine.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
mark sweet: And Jonah's a bright person, so we need it to be bright and colorful like her.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, the the logo is not bright and colorful, but I can make something compatible with it that does it, because color psychology is important. Um, and. All energy is important. So again, if we don't like what we have, we can change it.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Tina Marie: But um. Shona if we use. I don't know.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Tina Marie: Let me just create a version, and then. I will change it according to what you want, because getting a 1st version is the hardest part.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Westside Pain: Yeah. Correct. It's like whatever whatever we can do, the fastest, the easiest, because I think what they're just trying to do is send it out to more groups.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Westside Pain: That's really what it is.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
mark sweet: Do you know how many people this is going to by chance or no clue.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Westside Pain: With a new name. I have no clue. What's what's going on like? She she wants our name to be changed before she can.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Westside Pain: Move it. I spread it out.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah, you really got 3 on that one.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Westside Pain: To different departments. Well, you're the one who told me that they have 27 departments.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000
mark sweet: That's what I've been told. I don't know how much bullshit it is, but that's what I've been told.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
mark sweet: The reason I'm asking is uh. Tina and I talked about this super briefly, and some that I rolled out in my office because the cubicles are sad and depressing.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:12.000
mark sweet: Um like in our office we gave every ours is not sad and depressing, but we are making like little air plants for everyone with little like. Visas, and so.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:21.000
mark sweet: If you're giving like a little gift of, and says like fast pain. Doc has a little air plant, and it makes their area like slightly less depressing. Then I don't know. Just a thought.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Tina Marie: We have some candy because you're sweet. Some brownies and cookies.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
mark sweet: Right, or it's a jar of candy.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Westside Pain: Okay. So I guess this is gonna be not just doing the brochure, but.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Tina Marie: It's a little marketing campaign. The brochure was just the catalyst, for it.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Westside Pain: Right. Okay.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
mark sweet: You're just Trojan horsing this.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Westside Pain: Okay, so I have to.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
mark sweet: You know, like when you go to Hermes, and they give you a little like um.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Westside Pain: For example.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:59.000
mark sweet: Samplers. Yeah. And then they start getting hooked because it looks cute and the packaging is hooked, and then you start going there. And you know you. Yeah, same kind of idea.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Westside Pain: Okay, okay, I think that sounds good.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
mark sweet: Because you can't put things like refer 10 clients, and I take you to lunch like you can't put that on a on a flyer.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Westside Pain: So. What are you saying? I.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
mark sweet: No, no, I'm saying you cannot put something like, you know. Prefer X and get y like you. You can't.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Tina Marie: But you can insinuate it by packaging everything together really nice from the beginning.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Westside Pain: But I I can do Sugarfina.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Tina Marie: Like, with with the plant and the.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Westside Pain: Okay. So I don't. I don't. I don't know how to do this.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Westside Pain: Do? Do I do the plant, or do I do the candy.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Tina Marie: It's okay.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000
mark sweet: I know. That's why you have Tina and me. We'll figure it out with you.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Tina Marie: Yes, we we will just make sure that um, whatever we come up with. You. Say yes, no, and then we'll make these things happen for you.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Westside Pain: I I feel like I don't know how many these are going to. So I thought my plan was to pick up the printed flyer with business cards. Staple them together, and then.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
mark sweet: Sorry. How about that for another.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Westside Pain: Bring um. Like those cupcakes.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
mark sweet: Okay, can I show you guys something that we just do for our office? Because it's beautiful.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
mark sweet: So we make little Sweetlaw frogs.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, my! Gosh!

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.000
mark sweet: Because one of the things that we say is, eat the frog meaning get done the crappy thing. You don't want to do. So. Everyone on their desk gets a little frog.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
mark sweet: But if you could have a little cute animal that said. Fast pain, Doc or something.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Westside Pain: Okay, so do you.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Tina Marie: Tell me you read miracle morning without telling me you read miracle morning.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Westside Pain: Okay, so is that something I need to do now, or I can do that later.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Tina Marie: We will do it for you, Mark. You will do it for her.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
mark sweet: Maybe yeah, probably.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Yeah, you will.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah. For instance. Yes.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Westside Pain: Well, we don't have to do that this week is what I'm trying to say, because they need it now.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
mark sweet: Counter argument, we could probably get it done delivered this week.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Westside Pain: Okay, honey.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
mark sweet: But procrastinate.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Tina Marie: I do think that even if you just took a couple more days to do it that way, I think that you will be so much more memorable. I think the business will come fast.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Westside Pain: Right, but kind of integrity. I already told her. I'll get it to you this week.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Gotcha.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Westside Pain: So I'm just worried that if I don't, then I. Because she's waiting for that cause. I invited her for tea or something massage, and she said, Oh.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Westside Pain: Like verbatim. I'm just gonna tell you what, she said. How are you looking at at the updates around the flyers? Business cards for the remaining of the medical office question? Mark.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So Mark can either get it done this week or he can't. We'll get the brochures done this week, and then, if we can't.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Tina Marie: Get everything else together this week. Then we'll do business cards next. And here's a thought, right? So we get the brochures because that's what they need most. That has the most information. Everybody can have it, and then next week it could be business cards and all the other things.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Westside Pain: Okay.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Tina Marie: Does that work.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Tina Marie: It's okay. If it's not you, you can tell us. But I.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Westside Pain: No, no, I I just don't. I feel like it's already behind. Dr. E. Is not. Doing.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Westside Pain: I really, and I cannot control that. The the Ehr and he can't.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000
mark sweet: No, doctor, you're gonna lose sweet James. If he doesn't make the change he'll make it more quickly. Then. I'm not joking. That's how you have to do it.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Tina Marie: No. Seriously, Chona. Seriously. Sometimes people just really need to hear the perspective about what is costing, what they are costing with their lack of movement.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Westside Pain: Okay, I'll I'll go to the office soon, so I'll talk to him.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
mark sweet: I would just text it to. I wouldn't even say I would text it like, Hey, we're gonna lose the sweet James account unless we can make this change like now. It's been 2 weeks.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Westside Pain: Okay.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tina Marie: You. You have to go right? You're getting stressed. You got a lot to do. Okay.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Westside Pain: Yeah.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Tina Marie: We've got enough, I'll get started, and I'll send you something. But that's the other thing, though, because now I'm not just having a call. Today, I'm creating something and.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Tina Marie: Um. I've got a crap ton of things to do. It's finals week, and I have another assignment. So I'm going to work through this quickly.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Tina Marie: I'll see what I can help with.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
mark sweet: Do you want to send me like a quick sample? Then this afternoon I've got a little bit of time. I can try to screw around with it, too.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I'll I'll do that. I'll I'm gonna get off the phone now, so I can start that because I've got.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Westside Pain: Thank you so much. Everyone.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Tina Marie: Lots to do.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
mark sweet: And then those animals, they literally cost a dollar and 14 cents each. So you just have to pick which animal you want, Jonah, and then I can have America order them.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Westside Pain: Uh, okay, we can. We can steal your.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Westside Pain: A week. A bear is cute. Okay.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
mark sweet: There's a lot of animals I want you to pick which one speaks to you.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Tina Marie: Panda bear is cute.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Westside Pain: That's what I was thinking of, Panda.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Westside Pain: I know I just did a better.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
mark sweet: I mean, I'm not. I kind of agree.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Westside Pain: Okay.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Then that's done.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Westside Pain: Okay, bye. Thank you so much. Bye.
