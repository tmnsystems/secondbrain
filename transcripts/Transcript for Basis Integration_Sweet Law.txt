Mark's notes that we did in our guitar. Okay. Hello.
00:00:18 - Dan (3)
Y'all.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Guys, like, ever get up early, be on fire, ready to tackle today, literally everything that they just can come up and sabotage you does that?
00:00:29 - Dan (3)
I never do the first part. So no, I don't have that lead in.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you guys?
00:00:44 - Dan (3)
Missing a tooth.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What the hell?
00:00:47 - Dan (3)
Heck. Exactly. You might hear some lisping.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What happened to him?
00:00:53 - Dan (3)
I broke my tooth. It's not a crown. I broke my tooth. was, I don't know, a 10? And I've, you know, I've gotten it fixed. It's like the fifth time in my life that I've broken it off. I broke it off again. I was like eating something and I heard pop. was like, what the was that? And then I heard clink, clink, clink. And I looked down. So that was my great. Good times. I'm waiting for the dentist to ring a ding me.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All righty then. All you want for Christmas is your biggest one.
00:01:40 - Dan (3)
It's my one front tooth.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, happy Monday and New Year to you.
00:01:47 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how are you today?
00:01:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, still pretty pissed off, but you can do it.
00:01:55 - Dan (3)
Well, at you have your teeth.
00:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About breaking?
00:01:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, not getting real.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, about good and rough. Yeah. I'm still pretty pissed.
00:02:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, we'll be to track the car to the address. The license plate's not on it. And the VIN numbers partially blocked. Like you can't read it in a way that's very, very weird.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really suspicious.
00:02:23 - Dan (3)
Yeah, they got those plate, they got those things you put on your plate.
00:02:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So the cameras can't read them. No, the plate is not there.
00:02:31 - Dan (3)
Oh, well, that's even more help.
00:02:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The plate's coming into the community, leaving the community.
00:02:35 - Dan (3)
Oh, gotcha. Hi, how did they get in? Is yours like coded or do you?
00:02:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
car key to just kind of like tell you the car in and they didn't call the cops or do what they're supposed to do.
00:02:52 - Dan (3)
Oh, one separate lawsuit. There you go.
00:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. You had one job, Claude.
00:03:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
for real whatever his name is so we're making progress but also there's been like a bunch of good videos of the similar looking car robbing people in her life so oh yeah yeah dummy they probably got rid of him quickly though hopefully no no that's not helpful to shut up sorry so i have america calling to see that she's being approached in this car but something was off as it's been a report stolen license plate to see if it's been reported stolen and if it hasn't been then did we leave your mark it's gone got stolen no i'm so massively distracted with that sorry you cut out but it's okay we will move on i think you guys the number because I am not getting an accurate number.
00:04:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did give, you did send numbers.
00:04:09 - Dan (3)
Not for anywhere.
00:04:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, no. You changed me to the number that we've got like one, two, three, four, five, six or seven or ten years that are signed. But like somebody can get a hold of it and I couldn't get an answer of like which or which. Some of them from investigator stuff. So like we're anywhere between eight and like one, two, three. Like 14. So it's way too much of a variance to give you guys an accurate number. I'll have it figured out by the end of today.
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's little.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Is Mark coming out for you down or just me?
00:04:47 - Dan (3)
Oh, no. He's dropping out completely.
00:04:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Cool.
00:04:51 - Dan (3)
Mm-hmm.
00:04:52 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But I'm enjoying it for my film.
00:04:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:04:59 - Dan (3)
Bye, man. Who?
00:05:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can you guys wait like two minutes, have to talk this freaking crazy as mine.
00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you happen to look at the form I sent you, Sam, send it to both of you. All right, I'm going to pull that up. Oops, I know I'm on that call right now. It's a touch bot. also have it working on. Ooh, that's pretty. Let me send that to you. Copy. Dan Ryan. Are you on your computer or phone?
00:06:26 - Dan (3)
Well, I mean, I'm in front of my computer, but I'm on my phone.
00:06:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the link I just sent you, check that out on your phone and computer. I texted it. And then where's the touch bot one? Oh, that's actually a Google Doc. Okay, Emma, I will share screen for this. Share screen, share. Alright, so this is what I tried to extract from our calls and about what you would need to know to flesh this out so that Mark can fill it out and then from there we'll have to go back to I would use Claude probably, but maybe even try to teach what it does to make the variations of the messages that you could then plug in but these are the questions and I did email and text you the link so that you can go through it all and see what you need but I can go top to bottom so you can just look at it basically I need to know if Mark answers all these questions will you have what you need to build this out that's the goal of this
00:08:00 - Dan (3)
Oh, it's not opening. Come on, Google. You got it.
00:08:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you are. Are they the hand is? Tell me.
00:08:10 - Dan (3)
Sorry.
00:08:10 - mark sweet (3)
I'm back. that's some of handles or whatever.
00:08:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Anyway.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what we're looking at is the question are that I put together. Um, you said that like, down, but anyway, um, I'm trying to create the form that will extract everything that Dan needs from you to be able to flush this out and make it a usable application. He's looking at it.
00:08:52 - mark sweet (3)
Because this is mighty was a little more informal formal on some of these things. because I'm going to call all the doctors in my mind. So I don't be like, doctor came from signature chiropractic. How are you? But I understand if we're going to unleash this into the wild that might be better.
00:09:16 - Dan (3)
could see Fuji wanting to make sure it's case to Well, yeah, but you can have like a complete record and then name.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And address like so, doctor, whatever.
00:09:44 - Dan (3)
Got it. Yeah.
00:09:47 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know the names. I mean, I definitely need the names.
00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:09:51 - Dan (3)
Yeah, the only weird one is I don't know what referral history is.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so maybe like, Like, in reference to our conversation, because I had lot help me build this by reviewing our conversation, we had talked about what was the last time we talked to them. And what was the conversation the last time we talked to them? Was it they sent us a lead?
00:10:21 - Dan (3)
Was it we checked in with them? Yeah, that's the part that we can't do in version one. That's a whole other layer of complication.
00:10:46 - mark sweet (3)
I don't know if it's totally necessary or what we're trying to do, but I get what you're trying to track like, hey, this one is, let's say, like when you're top three people, or if we're throwing a bunch of cases, you want to touch them more than someone who sends you
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on every three years, or vice versa, essentially. So what we could do is just if there are things that are good, let's take that, extract it, we can redact the other things and strike it out.
00:11:15 - mark sweet (3)
OK.
00:11:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it. This is version one of the questionnaire. If there's anything to remove, just tell me what it is, I'll strike it out. And instead of removing it, in case there's a version where that's helpful, and whatever.
00:11:37 - Dan (3)
So then preferred contact times, it would not be at a contact level, it would have to be at the bot level. So the bot will only operate during certain hours.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so that, I think, will go under this. What times are acceptable for sending messages? So, I'll remove it from here.
00:12:03 - Dan (3)
Yeah, we just set like this hour over here.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know there's a way to do it here. Sorry, I'm blocking the screen. Well, you guys. Oh, good. You're both in it. Okay. So that's fine.
00:12:36 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, it's my phone. So it's really hard to read this on screen. But hopefully you guys can actually hear me now.
00:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Like full volume like you're.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. .
00:12:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's on now. Sorry. Text format options. you. So that's a lot of questions.
00:13:00 - Dan (3)
Okay. I get a structure in text.
00:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There it is. Right. Okay. I'm just reviewing this top department seeing is there something that you can want to remove add, you can fill it out later. just want to make sure that we're reviewing the form and then you go fill it out, then we'll get it to Dan.
00:15:08 - mark sweet (3)
Totally. So the grouping, I don't think there's any grouping needed quite frankly. Although I do get your one idea of like the pain doctors, we don't need to hit as often as the chiropractors.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
It's sort of one in this name. Um, in terms of scaling, you know, 45 days and it's fine. We can talk about it. mean, that's kind of what I actually think you guys might be able to do more information of how often should we do this and we can change it up every 15, 45. Um, my guess is early to like evening would be the best time to send the messages. In terms of special messages, yeah, we need to make sure that can get those ahead of time, um, set up and trying to put in birth. This makes sense. So, is it possible for me to have a good birthday?
00:16:04 - Dan (3)
I think that's in there, but it's not.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It can be added. So, you said 45 days and we're going to test the frequency early morning and early evening?
00:16:19 - mark sweet (3)
I think maybe like noon to like 9 p.m.
00:16:23 - Dan (3)
Basically.
00:16:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, in their time zone, what number? Yeah, they're all local.
00:16:34 - mark sweet (3)
Uh, no, they're not.
00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Because we've got Arizona, we have Missouri.
00:16:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:16:41 - mark sweet (3)
So, in their time zone, right? Yeah. I mean, most people work all the time anyways. even if I submit 9 to some of these kills, they're just not going to respond, but yeah. Definitely go on the holidays in terms of messaging style. It's going to be pretty casual in person. I think that's going to the best way to build a relationship. Oh, I see. And then the doctor name is going to be what they go by to some go by like doctor first name someone like doctor last name. Something about nicknames custom personalization. So, yeah, so we have to put it into the beginning to like after he's one, but that's like his first name. That choice last day.
00:17:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Each one. And contact is created. Too far. So don't want, like if these work great, if not, we'll just want you to create a few types of messages, then we'll go run through AI to get variations of them. But one thing I did want you to do is give us an idea of how many variations you want. And basically we would do some math by frequency and contact number.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (3)
So, yes, but the message that you have, I want kind of different because these are, like, AI I'm checking in with you. Those are fun, think, but the bigger idea of this was like, hey, I'll talk to you XYZ, just seeing what's going on.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought it was building that personal relationship. So that's what this is. I get used to getting crack at it.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (3)
I'd kind of write it.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it really is more like a placeholder than anything. So, Mark, with your messages here, we will make variations based off of them. And then Dan, can we, I'm writing this down for you, make a code requirement that says do not ever use the same variation of a message for the same person more than works.
00:19:50 - Dan (3)
Probably not.
00:19:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:19:55 - Dan (3)
You'd have to store every message in order to book. where? A table? Where? That doesn't exist in high level.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't use databases?
00:20:09 - Dan (3)
Not that a user can manipulate.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, where would we send, save these messages then?
00:20:21 - Dan (3)
You wouldn't.
00:20:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And variations of them.
00:20:24 - Dan (3)
They're written on the fly.
00:20:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, AI?
00:20:31 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:20:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can it review the messages it sent before and just say write a message you've never sent before that looks like this. So how we ensure that we're not sending out? the same message to a person.
00:21:04 - Dan (3)
If the core message is not similar than the odds of it writing the exact same message or probably slim, right? As long as you're not feeding it, hey, send what's up? More than once, right? won't. It'll, it's going to generate a new version every time per person, but if the input is different, then the output will probably be different. So you just want to make sure the example, the example message is not too similar to a prior example message.
00:21:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:21:38 - Dan (3)
I mean, that's my best guess. We can start that. You could mess with it too. You could then test it and go give me 50 responses and see what it does.
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. All right. This was a question we had.
00:22:04 - mark sweet (3)
Mm-hmm. The response management part.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:22:10 - mark sweet (3)
So, I think there's got to be immediate notification and then daily summary. To start.
00:22:18 - Dan (3)
I mean, the goal would be.
00:22:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll go to the response on its own. No, no, no. Yeah. So I will have to respond.
00:22:25 - Dan (3)
You don't have to respond, but you're going to get the response.
00:22:30 - mark sweet (3)
For the field message, I think it should try at least like once an hour or two later, and then if it doesn't then flag for manual follow up. It just means I have an office number or something else that just doesn't text here. of retry on its own?
00:23:02 - Dan (3)
No, I'm wondering if it if it signals that it's a landline, it will never try again.
00:23:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, that should be fine.
00:23:11 - Dan (3)
Yeah, and then I mean, I think do we do retries on that stuff? I mean, you definitely retry an SMS. Trying to think, I don't know that we've ever set anything up. We must have, it's got to be somewhere, we've got so many implementations. Yeah, landline, will just, at the D&D, because it knows that it's a landline. And then I don't think a D&D failed mobile number on the first one. I'm not sure it ever does, it's D&D a failed mobile. So, and let's get some message from William. which could be the case. And if it gets D&D, it just gets D&D. It won't send it again.
00:24:09 - mark sweet (3)
Can we get an email that has been D&D?
00:24:11 - Dan (3)
So I don't know what I'm to manually look for it. I think, yeah, I think there's a D&D triggers.
00:24:20 - mark sweet (3)
OK, or there could be like D&D reports.
00:24:25 - Dan (3)
OK.
00:24:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we saying D&D, like Dan's company or D&D, like, do not disturb?
00:24:33 - mark sweet (3)
Like, what is it?
00:24:33 - Dan (3)
not disturb.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do not disturb. Just clarifying, because I've had two right here.
00:24:40 - mark sweet (3)
Understood.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know how to notate that right now, if I should or not.
00:24:50 - Dan (3)
Well, it would be like, what are we going to do? It's more of a question like, what are we going to do with D&D's? Or what to do in the event of D&D? or some sort of D&D handler. I know in one account, have like a D&D thing, like it's a separate automation I built.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what do you mean is like if it detects that somebody has a duplication silence or what do you mean D&D?
00:25:16 - Dan (3)
If it's a landline, it knows and it will D&D it. It will be like automatically like, so then you don't know it unless you do something to let yourself know, right? There's no like default D, there's no default anything in high level, right? You can't go in and say, oh, let me look at my D&D report, doesn't exist. Just like the D&D thing exists as part of the core software, but I have to go build an automation to them and do something when it happens. So the D&D is happening, but that's it. And you only know, if you don't do anything, you only know if you drill into a record and see it. So we'd want to know if it's happening and then deal with it.
00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then.
00:26:16 - Dan (3)
So it would be, I feel like if if a number D indeed, you'd send an internal notification be like this number D indeed. It'd be great if you could get D and D landline specific, but I'm not sure that exists.
00:26:29 - mark sweet (3)
Even if it's D and D that I just know it's the wrong number and I got to figure out the right numbers. So this will start.
00:26:37 - Dan (3)
Yeah, exactly. As long as you're catching it, then you can figure out what to do with it.
00:26:45 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, that makes sense.
00:26:48 - Dan (3)
You don't know until we know.
00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We to roll it out be like our numbers for testing.
00:26:58 - Dan (3)
Well, no, I mean, we can't.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D&D. No, not that. That whole touchpot.
00:27:08 - Dan (3)
What do you mean? How do you want to test it?
00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Test touchpot works when we have a first version.
00:27:16 - Dan (3)
No, know, but what do you want to test? Do you want to run? You want to just create a fake schedule of events and run it for a week or like what are you talking about?
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whatever we can do to test every function and find any flaws before it goes live to real people.
00:27:31 - Dan (3)
Yeah, we just took to sort of map out the test. Because I don't test , Tina. I just put it live and then deal with it.
00:27:43 - mark sweet (3)
So do we want to have like 10 or 15 doctors that I know really well and know with their cell phones?
00:27:50 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:27:51 - mark sweet (3)
No.
00:27:52 - Dan (3)
Okay. You just need, we have to figure out what you want to see and then you can just,
00:29:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It works if we get, let's just go ahead and answer that. What would you consider a successful pilot period? says, select all that apply. 90% message delivery rate,% response rate, no complaints from doctors. How do we measure this, basically? What's the minimum it needs to do and get back for us?
00:29:52 - Dan (3)
What's the goal?
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly, that's part of the question.
00:29:56 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:30:02 - mark sweet (3)
to try more referrals, but I don't know if that's necessarily the best majoring of success, because we can message everyone and be great, but if they don't have referrals or they don't like me for some reason, it doesn't matter.
00:30:21 - Dan (3)
Right. Yeah, I don't know that there's. You need to say.
00:30:25 - mark sweet (3)
50% response rate are people actually engaging with us as well. They're probably isn't, but, you know, the more that we communicate, the better chance we have.
00:31:00 - Dan (3)
Again, it's all just being top of mind.
00:31:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When I lose, I heard a drop off.
00:31:16 - Dan (3)
I mean.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just leave the mark.
00:31:21 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah. We're going to crop right now.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I've got the nuts.
00:31:32 - mark sweet (5)
Anyway, I just went down. Cool.
00:31:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything that we didn't talk about that we should about what this needs to accomplish or how to do it, what it should do, what it shouldn't do.
00:31:57 - mark sweet (5)
If you heard before, it's out like if we get it.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
50 percent. Yeah.
00:32:02 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah, response. Okay, cool. Um, I think that's the only two ways we can really look at this stuff. Uh, obviously the goal is to try and get more referrals, but if we can do those two things, then we're making some progress.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, any other comments that need to be given for this?
00:32:23 - mark sweet (5)
Yes. I think so for right now. mean. So I'm going to get started. think the portrait thing is big, but we definitely got to figure out. What's the risk? So we got to do a little bit of a more first. But I like the so far idea. think it'll be good. Okay, it's back.
00:33:23 - Dan (3)
Okay. We're back.
00:33:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Back again.
00:33:29 - mark sweet (5)
Oh, down we have to remove Hank from our website.
00:33:31 - Dan (3)
So I'll send something to Hank.
00:33:34 - mark sweet (5)
He quit without notice.
00:33:36 - Dan (3)
Oh, Hank.
00:33:37 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah. So super, super thrilled.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right before he gets to be a TV star.
00:33:43 - mark sweet (5)
And he was excited to be on TV.
00:33:44 - Dan (3)
So now I'm like next your best.
00:33:46 - mark sweet (5)
Screws that up.
00:33:48 - Dan (3)
He just up and quit.
00:33:51 - mark sweet (5)
Immediately tender to his resignation.
00:33:53 - Dan (3)
Yes. Wow.
00:33:54 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To work less and get paid more.
00:33:59 - Dan (3)
Oh. How do you pull that off? What's the trick?
00:34:04 - mark sweet (5)
I mean, we're going to smaller firms, so.
00:34:07 - Dan (3)
Oh, so you're still in the law?
00:34:09 - mark sweet (5)
Is it? They're basically doing the same thing.
00:34:11 - Dan (3)
P.I.
00:34:11 - mark sweet (5)
firm? Yeah. So tell a little lie.
00:34:20 - Dan (3)
It's like two people. So.
00:34:25 - mark sweet (5)
I don't know.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You never didn't talk to me like a ton.
00:34:30 - mark sweet (5)
And, you know, he had found us through a recruiter. So, you know, if that was one of the other firms, he'd talk to you back in the day.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because my first thought was head-hunted, but also like just knowing somebody.
00:34:44 - mark sweet (5)
Let's punch him in the face.
00:34:47 - Dan (3)
There's a head for you.
00:34:50 - mark sweet (5)
Oh, and it's on the punching one in the face, so it's okay.
00:34:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, initial check-in messages. is good. and for using the system like to start with.
00:35:04 - mark sweet (5)
Oh, that's a, yeah, I know what you're saying. Um, where it's a, um, bubble blower has been tricking on my cell phone. Oh, isn't it? if you need me kind of situation.
00:35:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, exactly.
00:35:18 - mark sweet (5)
So here's our intake number, whatever else.
00:35:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yes. So if you can just pop in some things in here, and basically just when you're done shooting a message to us. So that dad knows and then he can take it and we can make the first like reversion of it.
00:35:39 - Dan (3)
So we've got all these different. Yeah. So that. Pucked me more about that. So what, what is initial, like literally, I just started working with them. Or is it more? Or is it one more?
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
starting the whole program or is it both like start the program and then we're starting the program and so what we could do and should do although this will take you know more set up work but it's important is if there's a column that okay so I don't even know where the database of these people are that's established that is this going to be a spreadsheet like how are we feeding the contacts to touchpot it's in high level already okay so they're not they're going to be yeah yeah well where okay so it's going to go into high level mark currently has a database full of people I don't know I guess it's just let if I whatever we do if it's an export or there's a middle step where we put things into a spreadsheet just to look at it kind of linear there should be a column that is specifically for touchpot status right so Um, which is where, what, what type of initial message does touch bots and it is a, um, standard touch you. What?
00:37:12 - mark sweet (5)
Oh my God.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
first touch you. Do you want to be more? I will hang up.
00:37:16 - Dan (3)
Stop.
00:37:17 - mark sweet (5)
Okay.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will. touch.
00:37:21 - mark sweet (5)
Like a more formal touch. One for here.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, no. Meaning oriented to where you're at in the relationship.
00:37:34 - mark sweet (5)
know, so if it's a standard, which is, Hey, you know, like these are not your closest people, right? Just this mark. want to show you how to do anything.
00:37:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hear what you're saying.
00:37:45 - mark sweet (5)
Grouping into like close friends, new acquaintances.
00:37:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause I like the new queen thing to have its own like drip campaign, I guess, for lack of better term. Yes. So what can we move people between groups? Yeah, you can. And you. you would, you or your people, right? So that would be your, I mean, you're the only person that can qualify well what type of relationship you have with it. so let me iterate this. Um, create a category on type types first. Um, most friends, new contacts, referral, never did business, yet, et cetera. Then create initial message or a layer, or a layer three to the contact type, yes? Okay, and this is okay, we've established the initial connection, and then these are, which seems kind of repetitive from here. So I'll let you review that. And, oh, yeah, okay, so holiday seasonal messages. This might be, maybe Mark sends the initial version over to go to get spun, basically, by AI to go out to everyone. I was going to say, like, as long as they're not never done business with them, like, because you don't really want to send your personal holiday. they update message if we've never really been properly introduced, as long as they've completed the first like warm-up phase or something or aren't categories as new acquaintance. But maybe you do. I don't know.
00:40:23 - mark sweet (5)
Thoughts? I think so. I think it'd be better to just keep it how I am because even if it's not when it's this number running into. And so keep it how I am because other people ask, oh, hey, have you, you know, talked to Mark, whatever? It's like, yeah, I got this weird message.
00:40:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's gonna be a problem. Oh, oh, oh, oh. What if, though, and Dan, don't know if this can happen, but if, so we've categorized them right as close friends, and we have these different categories, so the categories will be really important. But if, A category then informs the language type, right? So this is how casual you be for this category. This is how casual professional you be for this category, so that the language is slightly altered to be more familiar with those that are categorized as close friends.
00:41:25 - Dan (3)
So yes, but then you'd have to provide it a not close friends version of the language. Yeah. So you're like, hey, I want it to be casual. I want to say a casual how you been, right? You'd have to give it for cat. Like, I don't know how many different ways you can say how you've been, right? So it's like, a lot of this is like, now it's getting complicated for no good reason.
00:41:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, okay. no good reason because the whole point of this is to take over the personal touch of mark messaging everybody one-on-one and the people that would be hiring or purchasing touchpot Let's say if we went out and do it. It's not for no good reason. It's replicating real life conversation I'm not going to talk to you the way I would talk to somebody. I Seemed once right I'm gonna be way more casual with you So even if there's only two barriers Two variations and one is cash casual professional and one is just strictly professional Slightly casual whatever there should at least be two versions because mark is super friendly And that might just be like left field for somebody be like who the hell is this guy telling me about a ski trip, you know, I Don't know So more that's not what you're gonna do is it no, how are you going to make I mean the one
00:43:00 - Dan (3)
We're in right now. How many different ways can you say Merry Christmas?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (5)
But he would say he would say way more than right. Daniel totally is happy holidays because we say, keep this part the same for everyone. So we can say happy holidays to everyone, right? But I mean, like, I just got back from Japan. So this thing, that thing, this was really cool. And then we do that. But I got to give it at least like two or three sentences. I can't just give it three words.
00:43:26 - Dan (3)
No. And you. And it's also like, how far out in advance is this being built, right?
00:43:34 - mark sweet (5)
Like order, maybe, like you can only do so far. The birthday message is, yeah, we can build those out pretty far ahead of time. But the other stuff, you know, you sit down every month or so and you just do two or three times at a time.
00:43:49 - Dan (3)
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, that's the whole thing. I mean, I don't know. It's like, you guys have a way better idea. So I'm like, OK, well, again, that just complicated it. So I'm like, OK, so now you need a way to. update the messages every three months, update what goes into, gets fed to the AI, which would mean you need a form to fill out that's going to fill in these custom values, then the custom values are going to get populated into the AI automation. Like, I see it, but I'm like, okay, well, that's another layer. It's doable, definitely doable.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but the value of the layer is nobody else has this, and it would be an amazing time saver for anybody that has a large network that they want to follow up with and have personal things to, to be able to create these variations, to be able to qualify the difference between a close friend and especially when Mark has all these friends, right? That's a lot of time, but a lot of connections, and it's probably not happening, which would allow them to have those kind of connections to stay top of mind. The power is there, the value is there, there are people that would... for this. So even though it's complicated, the logic should definitely be codable. Whether it can be done at high level or we had to do a different thing or hire a different developer, it still shouldn't be so complicated that we can't do it or that it would be very expensive.
00:45:17 - mark sweet (5)
I mean, Dan, imagine if you didn't actually have to talk to people, but they felt connected to you.
00:45:21 - Dan (3)
I don't talk to people.
00:45:23 - mark sweet (5)
But imagine if they felt connected and liked you.
00:45:26 - Dan (3)
But you didn't even have to pick up the phone. Yeah, I don't answer it anyway.
00:45:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not the custom target audience for this ad.
00:45:35 - Dan (3)
So how often I answer the phone?
00:45:38 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah, I know. He's seen me like three times in 10 years.
00:45:40 - Dan (3)
I know.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no, I get it.
00:45:45 - Dan (3)
I'm just like listening and I go, oh, well, I mean, a perfect example is like the whole idea of having like a warm up sequence, right? That needs to be, it has to be original idea that we talked about with this one string. And now it's like, oh, no, we can't do that, which is fine.
00:46:03 - mark sweet (5)
It doesn't make to be.
00:46:05 - Dan (3)
It would be better, but it doesn't have to be because these things are still very vanilla, programmatically, it when you guys are talking, I'm only imagining how it's built and I'm going, how do I build? How's that going to have to be built? That's all I'm saying. It's like, oh, that becomes so is more complicated than that. Once you start introducing custom values and then being able to update that stuff, I'm like, okay, so now we're moving outside of like just an automation and we're moving into like an automation that's up to sort of like an app.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I, the reason I think it's an app is because if it have a user interface where the, you know, the, the person who touch Bob is representing can go in and say, okay, here's January's messages to go out on this date and here's the, you know, close friends version and here's the what do you call it? You know, the acquaintance version. So now you have an interface that can connect with the app or the automations, right? And gives it all of its data. But front facing to client, it's just a really simple form where they input the data.
00:47:17 - Dan (3)
Right. Yeah. I mean, now, like, whatever. I'm oh, maybe 10. Maybe this should be its own standalone sub account that only does this rather than so, like, we wouldn't upload anybody into sweet laws. It's flowy. create, you know, touchpot for just the dedicated accountants. Mark's touchpot.
00:47:51 - mark sweet (5)
This would probably need to be a super touchpot. No, touchpot needs to be its own thing because we need to keep brains on touchpot.
00:47:57 - Dan (3)
Yeah. Well, yeah, and it's that doesn't the data sets don't job with a legal client, right? But then it would be like, to teen his point, then if it were to become like a service where you flipped high level into doing this thing, like it's like, oh yeah, here you can have your own touchpot, and then they're basically using high level, but you have all these forms and apps and what have you in there. I don't know, I'll submit that, I don't know. That's where I'm at now. Yeah, but I'm following. Yeah.
00:48:37 - mark sweet (5)
So, I mean, look, applications for this are far beyond just what I'm going to use this for. think this makes a lot of sense for lot of people, because again, it's trying to have a personalized touch without having to manually type in different things or system to it whatever else. It's just done.
00:48:52 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's, it's, I can't think of it, but it's, it's just a multiplier, like it's a massive.
00:49:00 - mark sweet (5)
Okay.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can have that quality of conversation with a few people, but this allows you to have that quality of conversation with many people staying in top of mind, actually establishing relationship. And it's not like it's automated, but you still have the ability to take a look at it, you still see the messages, but you're not having to mentally keep track of everything all the time. You can check the messages when you're ready and you can mass check them all at once, right? Instead of all throughout the day constantly being interrupted, like email or you know, anything else that just happens and creates these mental breaks throughout the day. So it allows you to maintain momentum, allow people to respond at their convenience to the thing that you've already planned ahead and set in motion.
00:49:49 - Dan (3)
It is going to interrupt you though. Their responses are going to go to you.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but you can, you can, the line that that's coming from and just, you know, silence those specific notifications, check it when you want to check it.
00:50:04 - mark sweet (5)
And look, this works so now amazingly well and transforms the business one, I'm not going to care or two, it can change your phone number, like it can change my personal number and just have as now as a work number, whatever.
00:50:16 - Dan (3)
You can be touch from your touch platform.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's touch you reach out and touch someone.
00:50:29 - Dan (3)
Mark would be too young for that one, but yeah, another one.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wasn't it E.T. in the commercial at one point?
00:50:43 - Dan (3)
Probably.
00:50:44 - mark sweet (5)
That would make sense.
00:50:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I saw that on top of a station wagon at a drive-in theater in Reno.
00:50:53 - mark sweet (5)
E.T.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark wasn't born yet, probably. less those heroes born male ones one that year yeah um okay so anyway this will make some progress so mark go back into this and check on you know yeah and then and then go from so i just i had a had a moment yesterday when i was driving i took why my children's friends don't live nearby is beyond me but anyway i had one of the friends lives like 30 minutes away i was like okay so the ride back i was like all right what is it like i don't know so i just bought a dummy in this morning it's car accident report finder i'm like okay that's good so i'm gonna set up that site it's no longer a longer Yeah.
00:52:01 - Dan (3)
No, but I'm so don't. I mean, I'm like, all right, like, valiant. Yeah, they're getting results. But like, they didn't come up with this, right? I'm trying to identify, I think I've identified the two main players. What's interesting is Walker buys leads from one of them. I was like, Oh, that's interesting. So I'm going to send them to Mark. And it's like, well, I mean, you can beat him and you can join him in between. Yes. you know, those lead types work good. Therefore, why not go get them from somebody else? So I was doing a rep before we jumped on the call. I think I'm running some scans on the sites to try to figure out. But I think it's I think I got the main two. And they all sell to lawyers, of course.
00:52:57 - mark sweet (5)
Yeah, they're done.
00:52:59 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:53:01 - mark sweet (5)
Now the question is, I'll quote, unquote, exclusive or are they selling six times over?
00:53:07 - Dan (3)
One looked like it was definitely exclusive in that they put the sponsor firm like on the state, the pages of the state that they're buying.
00:53:17 - mark sweet (5)
The other one sponsored by Wilshire, right?
00:53:20 - Dan (3)
No, it's a firm I've never heard of.
00:53:23 - mark sweet (5)
Do you remember the name?
00:53:25 - Dan (3)
Nope. Okay. But I'll say you'll see it when I send two. And then the other one, they list everyone they sell to.
00:53:32 - mark sweet (5)
So they're probably following from state law. So they just have this weird page. No, it's the new law. During this year, we got to say where you're sending leads to.
00:53:41 - Dan (3)
Okay. they have that and it just, that's where Walker and Morgan and Morgan and all these people are listed on the other one, but I don't know if they're exclusive or not. But I'll send those. And then I'm using both of them. I'm using them. Because then I was like, maybe the reason mine didn't work is because my site wasn't about reports, it was about settlements, so I like, okay, I'm gonna go, I need a site that's congruent or a domain that's congruent. So then I bought that this morning, I'll have those guys put up a landing page or whatever and then go turn my ads back on and change the domain. Because I got clicks, I didn't get leads, so I'm like, well, maybe that was why.
00:54:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you know that dot report is a TLD?
00:54:40 - Dan (3)
Yeah.
00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild.
00:54:44 - Dan (3)
Only because I was looking at domains today.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Find accident dot report is available.
00:54:54 - Dan (3)
Yeah, Google doesn't like those kind of domains. Well, Gary V's point, which I thought was interesting, is that there's not going to be any search engines in six years. Their model is just going to cease to exist, and the AI won't even reference websites. It'll just give the answer. Mm-hmm. thing is, and I've- Can you either even have the links to the websites like it does now, saying like, hey, this door is coming from? Nope. Dude, I won't click on it. I get the answer. I never look at the references. And if I don't like the answer, just ask more questions. But what he was saying, which I thought was interesting, was how the other shift that is happening, because of TikTok that is now feeding over into Facebook and Instagram and all the other socials, is that you don't need followers. just are not going to be a thing anymore. Like it doesn't matter how many followers you have. It's all matters. All that's going to matter is the piece of content and that anyone can go from zero to a million views overnight. It's happening all the time. And it's because of what the piece of content is. It's not because that person had a million followers. It's because the content resonated. A platform likes the content that gets engaged with. So he's like engagement is going to be the name of the game, putting things out to people engaged with. So his argument is that social media ads are going to stop working too. So become social media will, it's all going to be brand plays. So he's like, if you're, you should be posting on every platform for that platform, don't repurpose. Make sure that video works on TikTok and works on whatever. Maybe you focus on one platform and say, I'm going to. Master this one, but you're posting to all of them. And then he's like, post just consistently every day, figure out your plan and do that basically for the next six years. He's like, start building your brand. If you're not building, you're now start building it. I was like, dude, he's not wrong. I was like, that's a, so I've had this idea for a while that you can build, you know, legal, CPA exam, my , right? It's like the words and the things don't change. So you don't need a bazillion different messages. So if you, if you build in 90 day cycles, four quarters of the year, you just build a program around 90 days. And then on day 91, you start at one again, because A, you don't want it, especially you. mean, you could probably do it. like 30 day cycles. The accident's 30 days old. I don't want to hear from you, right? But and does it matter if someone in TikTok sees the same message twice within 60 days? I don't know. But you could you build out 60 90 day plan and then you're just recycling it over and over and over and over again forever. So I'm working on that for me as of this morning. I haven't picked the platform yet though.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it just gets my brain churning. Um, but you have.
00:59:37 - Dan (3)
Oh, yeah. I do. Good riddance. That's so you could hear my list.
00:59:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:59:49 - mark sweet (5)
You know, it help you some better on calls to people.
00:59:52 - Dan (3)
What's that mean that spot?
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, really?
00:59:56 - Dan (3)
Oh, if it could do my calls, I'm signing right up.
