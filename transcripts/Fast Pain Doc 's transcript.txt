00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Pain Management: Bye.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Tina Marie: Hi! How are you?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Pain Management: This is who it's been. Been crazy today specifically.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tina Marie: Is it? Is it ever? Not crazy? China?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Pain Management: I know. Well, it's less crazy on some days, but today was um. Dr. E. Was behind, and the patients are.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Pain Management: Are. You know he's not there. Their patients get been there since 1040.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Pain Management: And there are regular insurance patient, and our own. Procedures. I'm not there because it's procedures. So Kenya is there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Pain Management: So I made, it's just making decisions on. You know it's a no, no, it's not that, it's a no, no, but it's more like.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Pain Management: It doesn't look good if we put patient on one room. But.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Pain Management: Made that decision to put them on one room because they're all lean patients, and I don't want the other patients. Kind of affecting them? And is they upset.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Pain Management: Thing. You know things. There outside the waiting room. So and then I made decision like I told Kenya. Buy them lunch like now.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Tina Marie: Aw.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Pain Management: And then we'll let you know like. Nice.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Pain Management: I. And then I'm helping Dr. EI said, the patients. I told the staff the patients that just need adjustment and stuff just. Put it on my telemed, and then.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Pain Management: I'll call them, and. Yeah.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Pain Management: And then on top of our own patience, like, um. But yeah, it's. It happens. But again, this is the problem. When Dr. E. Is spread himself too thin.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Tina Marie: Um. I have so many questions, but I want to make the best use of the time for you.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Tina Marie: Uh cause. I feel like we have so much catching up to do, but I don't think you've got the time for all of it, so. Um.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Tina Marie: When it comes to making sure that Kenya. Knows what she needs to do to help you.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Tina Marie: One of the best things to do just is to start really small.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Tina Marie: Um. And and really.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Tina Marie: I don't know just kind of narrow guardrails. How did you get her started and.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Tina Marie: Let me kind of work through the question, and then we'll we'll try to refine it. So you know.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Tina Marie: We, we use it best, but. Um.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Tina Marie: Does she? So there's multiple questions. Does she have a written roles and responsibilities. Did she get any training like what is? How does getting Kenya going.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Tina Marie: How has that looked?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Pain Management: I think when she 1st started, I kinda like she's we're in the process of having that sweet James big event.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Pain Management: So at that time I um. Actually.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Pain Management: Make her in charge of that in terms of doing the helping, because she's very good on, like, as you see. He was very good on helping out with the canva, and like the pamphlet and the.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Pain Management: So, which she did very well. I think.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Pain Management: Um and. So.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Pain Management: To be honest it it's more of all over the place because of that. We started kind of asking her to help, and I kind of make that decision already that she will be in charge of procedures because I like today, I want her there. Someone needs to be there. I can't be there because I'm. It's my time of using the patient on.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Tina Marie: Well, and that's what you hired her for.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Pain Management: Yeah. So she that's really her role is to make sure the patient that are doing procedures are.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Pain Management: Com comms. Come on, time. Have a follow up appointment. Dr. E. Comes and make sure it happens.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Pain Management: Things like that, and anything that has to do with procedure. She will send the notes, send the bills to the attorney, and do the follow up appointments. That's her main role.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Pain Management: And. But because it's not a lot.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Pain Management: Um. I kinda. Tell her to help out with the emails and make sure that phone phone calls were answered.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Pain Management: But she's definitely showing um mistakes. And because she's new. And again I feel that that's me. So yesterday made that decision to pull back.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Pain Management: Um, the role, the responsibilities. And um, I'm basically going to.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Pain Management: Be guiding her. I told her. I want to see you every day. Even for a few hours a day, because yesterday she was here with me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Pain Management: And guiding her, and I told her that I will be telling you stuff that is probably in repetition. But I want you to feel that it's because I want you to succeed. I talked to her about it yesterday. And for now.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Pain Management: To make it short, for now Maria is in charge of. Basically almost every everything in terms of.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Pain Management: How it runs, and she will assign Kenya.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Pain Management: That's that's what's gonna happen now. So which. We're utilizing what's working for us right now is a task.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Pain Management: So on our task on our email. So um on the side, right? There's everyone task. There's Maria Task, Kenya task, tona task.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Mhm, Mhm.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Pain Management: So that's how we. Kind of delineated.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Pain Management: Um, but. On, the.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Pain Management: Days of procedures, meaning hours, like right today from 1030 till whatever I finish. She's not going to answer phone. She's not going to answer email. She's just gonna focus on that procedure.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Pain Management: That cause. That's where she makes the mistakes. Is because she's doing multiple things while she's on the procedure.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Pain Management: So so, which again she's. I'm.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Pain Management: Kind of getting out of her. She's communicative, and I told Maria Maria and I talk like I I just want to. She Maria opened up to me. She's like I'm getting behind. I feel I'm behind because I'm waiting for her to finish it. And you know Maria wants Chekhovs.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Pain Management: Like Maria said, I will just do it. For now and then see how? It goes so we all mhm.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Tina Marie: Cannot. Can I pause you for a minute.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Tina Marie: So. Uh um.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. I think.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Tina Marie: Gosh! I don't know why I'm struggling, because I have so many thoughts all at once. And I want to order them so.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Tina Marie: Because number one she's new, but also she's very young.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Pain Management: 100. Mhm.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Tina Marie: Right. So um. Work, experience.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Tina Marie: And and also this is. This is a very autonomous type of role, like she has to be able to lead herself, make decisions, be organized, and and.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: That kind of skill is developed with experience.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Tina Marie: So. Even though she may have the capability to do a lot of things. She's smart, and she's capable, if you want her, to be the most valuable person for you.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Tina Marie: You. You have to restrain yourself and her. For a little while, so she can get more experience without filling her brain.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Tina Marie: All kinds of things. So now. You've gone to medical school like you have filled your brain, and you've had lots of time in your life to be able to.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Mhm.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Tina Marie: Learn how to balance all of these things.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Tina Marie: And I want you to remember what this was like in the beginning. I remember we talked about the driving analogy where, in the beginning. You have to remember everything, and you can't like when you 1st learn how to drive, you just freeze. You're like.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Tina Marie: I don't know what to do, because your brain is trying to process all of these things. Well, if you add email, which email is simple. So it seems like it's not that much.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Tina Marie: But but really the best way to get her brain acclimated to this is quiet time. It is downtime. So.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Tina Marie: When we're running a business, we see somebody sitting there like you're busy, you you could be doing something. Right. I'm paying you. You could be doing something that is not actually going to help you right now is getting all of her time using her up. That's actually going to be counterproductive.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Tina Marie: What happens is our long term. Memory needs a break.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Tina Marie: So we fill it up with stuff. You, you understand how the brain works right?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Pain Management: Right. And I think like. I mean.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Pain Management: Like last. There's the a week that Dr. E. Doesn't have procedures so. Um. I'm just gonna tell my stuff I'm in a meeting. I'm in a meeting.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Pain Management: Looking at the moment. Okay.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Pain Management: Um and. What am I saying.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Pain Management: Um. There are times like Maria, said Maria, kinda express her frustration. I think Maria and I need to remember that she's new. She's young, she's new because.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Tina Marie: And yeah, yeah.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Pain Management: Yes, so Maria is like, I give her task, and it's not done so. I don't know what she's doing, but I understand, and I told Maria. I remind Maria, too, like. I know Maria is also young, but she has more experience on medical side, and she's very smart, so.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Pain Management: You know, reminding Maria to. That we just have to take it easy for her, and I have to remind myself to just.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Pain Management: Um guide her. And I think what I'm doing today or starting yesterday is we're gonna have a morning huddle, evening huddle, just so we can look at the emails that we miss anything. The task. It's not done.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Pain Management: Um. Obviously, I think Kenya is doing a good job right now. There's supposed to be 4 procedures, but. One didn't show up, which is one.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Pain Management: Cancel, which is fine. Um. She follows everything that I said, and I'm not there. And I said, Bring them to this room. Just bring them together and apologize. Make sure to tell them that you don't want them to wait outside.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Pain Management: Order, the food. As for their order, like.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Pain Management: And then she did, and she's like he just. I saw her message. It works. Dr. E. Is still not there. So again things happen, and you know we can't.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Pain Management: We? We just have to just go go through with it. There's a couple of things. Yeah, go ahead.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Tina Marie: I can add. Sorry I can add one more thing that will help you, and it's kind of a little bit of a timeline.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Tina Marie: So roughly 60 to 90 days. She should have a rhythm.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Tina Marie: Now, so it that understanding that repetition. Of doing the experience again and again, and not having to have her brain filled with all the other tasks.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Tina Marie: That she will be able to do so. Remember, the whole thing about the driving analogy is that after we do it for a while things become reflexive. And you don't have to process the thought so much. So. It's not as mentally exhausting, and you're less likely to make mistakes because of the repetition, but also because so like when we're learning how to drive, we're not allowed to have any distractions right.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tina Marie: You're not allowed to be on your phone. You're not allowed to do anything. You have to focus only on the task. So if Kenya can have, you know, 2 to 3 months to just focus on setting the lean appointment and taking care of the lean, patient patient, the thing that primarily she was hired for if she can do that and be allowed to have the downtime in between, and just reflect on her work.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tina Marie: Was there something she could have done better? What's coming up and just really really pay attention to just that. Okay.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Pain Management: Sorry. One patient wanted to leave.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Pain Management: So, because it's been a while. I said.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Pain Management: Make sure you reschedule before she leaves. Yeah, we tried.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Pain Management: We we're trying.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But you got to remember, too. You keep growing like you're trying works.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Tina Marie: It. It is your pattern, Tony. You got to remember that your pattern is. You grow, and you improve.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Tina Marie: And everything you do does make it better. You are not in the same place now that you were last month last month. You're not in the same place you were the month before, like. You keep evolving.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Tina Marie: So, no matter how stressful the day gets, and you feel like it's not working. You've got to remember 1st of all. Fast pain, Doc.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Tina Marie: You have grown here really quickly.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Pain Management: That's that's definitely um. I would just say, please schedule before she leaves.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Pain Management: Cause. She's like leaving. It's been a while I don't blame them. It's.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Pain Management: We're gonna have to apologize on that email to the attorney, which is fine.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Tina Marie: Is this because of Dr. E. Again.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Pain Management: Yeah, if you guys, okay, yeah, I think I'm sure I think he's in the hospital doing surgery and. That's what happened.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Pain Management: Um so. There's a lot of nice things next week. I just wanted to say, I know you're you're going to, and.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Pain Management: Next week. Um! I set up um lunch in a la firm. Um, and then.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Pain Management: Okay. Okay. Fine. Okay. Um.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Pain Management: Which is great, I was able to find another firm that we can just stop by. So lunch at 12. So basically, I'm just doing this. I wanted to have 3 at least in la, because we're going there. So I'm gonna call today. So that's gonna be the marketing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Pain Management: It's definitely getting busier, but I feel like.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I have a lot.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Pain Management: I don't. Really need another person. Yet, for, like staff.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Pain Management: But I feel like um. I can feel.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Pain Management: How do I say this? I can feel. The strain on the hospital especially, and I feel bad like I'm behind on. I.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Pain Management: I just feel. I'm physically like tired. I'm feeling it, and.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Pain Management: And. You know, and I know it's my bread and butter. I know that it's normal to have the bread and butter while the other one is growing, and I feel like I can't let it go yet like yet. Last month.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Pain Management: I made 21,000 on the bread and butter.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Pain Management: So I it's like, I don't wanna let that go.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Tina Marie: And the truth is, Chona, while you're growing this, this is the hardest part you want to be bursting at the seams, which means you're going to be wiped out. This. This is a short period. It feels long. It is long, really, because it's day after day after day. But when you look at the whole length of your life and your career. It's a short period.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Tina Marie: And that's why those rest times are so important, and all of the things that you can do to like. Keep yourself going. Are you still going to get your injections and.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I've been. I've been getting it. And actually, because of. The a 1 c level, which is very high. That's diabetic. Um, I started the glp 12.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Pain Management: Just to help me with that and with weight loss. Because my, it's this is my heaviest, for sure. I know that I'm stressed out. Um my pimples like and everything. And there is that part of me that.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Pain Management: It's good that I kind of. I attended like some of my friends like I have some friends. Dinner again, coming like I'm being pulled away, which is good.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Pain Management: Because, like I told you last Saturday, I work. Okay.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Pain Management: Then I spent time with my mom and my dad's birthday yesterday. But I think just navigating through, and I know.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Pain Management: I know I procrastinate. It's still the consistency, is there? But.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Pain Management: The consistency of. Making sure the next day procedure notes are sent.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Pain Management: I'm doing it. Because that's.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Pain Management: That's what I said we would do, and that's what we would do, and um. So that's being done.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Pain Management: The marketing is happening. I'm on top of that as well. Um, we're already getting influx of. I think more.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Pain Management: Patience, since the Sj. Thing we're at.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Pain Management: 50, we had 39. But this is probably all the way, you know, scheduled.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Pain Management: See like. Look at the procedure. This one is 4, because Kenya is not putting it in. Um.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Pain Management: There is a lot of. Time we're in.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Pain Management: Kenya is also not there, and I think. She just really need. I need to talk to her. This has to be done.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Pain Management: Like she follows some, but I think. There are times that you know. Our schedule is like hybrid. I'm gonna have to talk to them again. That.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Pain Management: We're flexible, but it doesn't mean that we're not. And we're flexible.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Pain Management: But. I want to make sure the job is done, and I know Maria is doing that, and she has a child. But I think Kenya is not, and that is the truth.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Pain Management: So, and I can't. I don't want to make a.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Tina Marie: You think Kenya's not flexible? Is that what you're saying?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Pain Management: No like I think she's not like. When she's at home.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Pain Management: I don't think she's working as much like she doesn't. Sometimes she doesn't respond to us. On our signal conversation, and.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Pain Management: Um. I am. I'm just worried that.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Pain Management: Because he's not. You know.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Pain Management: In the office, not with us all the time that she's. Slacking off.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Pain Management: Maybe that's the term. Um.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Pain Management: But so I just have to make sure again to remind her that it. You know we're flexible, but it doesn't mean that you won't. Do the job like.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tina Marie: So. One of the one of the things that you can do. Shona is just ask the questions directly.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Tina Marie: Um so. Or set the expectation. It's a combination, right? So.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Tina Marie: If your expectation is that she's basically on call. So. And and I need you to understand this, because scope creep can happen.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Tina Marie: And sometimes people don't don't want that type of job. So if she's responsible to answer signal messages when she's not technically working.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Tina Marie: She's basically on call.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Pain Management: Mm-hmm.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Tina Marie: And for me. I learned. I will not do that with people. You don't get to access me. If if I'm hourly.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Tina Marie: You don't. You don't get to talk to me all the time mark is here. Is that cool.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Pain Management: Yeah, of course.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Tina Marie: You just uh. Um so. But you have to ask her, you know. Is that is that something you're willing to do because I need somebody who is.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Pain Management: She's actually very good. Sorry to cut you off. She's in terms of the hourly. I remember her like texting me nighttime.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Pain Management: Like she's awake. She's like texting. Oh, I was like, I'm gonna text, my doctor, about the procedure. Tomorrow. It's gonna send email. So I I know she is. She's probably just.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Pain Management: Doing other things, maybe.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Pain Management: That's kind of taking her away from doing what what I need her to do. But like I said, I'm just gonna see her every day, and then just do the process with her, and kind of reiterate the importance of. Procedures. This needs to be like scheduled asap.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Pain Management: Like these are like the the Asaps that we need to. To do.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Pain Management: And so far right now. It's more of the delegation of work that I'm having issues. I think we were able to do that for right now. But eventually.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Pain Management: I need to be more clear on. They need to be. I need to be more clear. So they will be more clear on what to do. For right now, we're just using one email right.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Pain Management: All of us are accessing, that. If, for example, Kenya answered to an email or call the patient what their system is.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Pain Management: They put it on draft, and they put K. On the bottom that way. The everyone knows that. Oh, she called the patient. And she's gonna email, the.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Pain Management: The attorney soon. That's the system right now, and also the task. I think the task is working so far.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Tina Marie: So. I know um just to reiterate.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Tina Marie: So we want to keep her. Scope.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Tina Marie: Narrow.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Pain Management: No.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Tina Marie: We want to keep it prioritized by the thing that has the biggest impact for you. And we want it written down, clearly defined. These are the expectations. The other thing you can do is in your daily huddle.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tina Marie: 1st just start with a win. Hey, Kenya, this is this thing you did, that you did this great yesterday. Um, that was really valuable. Here's what I need you to work on.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And then you just keep doing it and keep doing it. So.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Tina Marie: There's going to be some coaching things to happen, and you could just tell her and pre-frame it like, look. Your. This is trial by fire, and I realize that.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Tina Marie: It's the nature of the business. This is what you went through. This is what Maria is going through like. This is not. This is not, you know, a cushy kind of job. This is a we're building something, and you have to want to be part of that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Tina Marie: Um, but also acknowledge to her like. I probably threw you in with too many things at once.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Pain Management: Mhm I think I did told her that.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Tina Marie: And. Yeah. And just like, I realize that I'm filling up your brain with a lot of things. And really, I just want you to get practice at the thing that is most important at this moment.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Tina Marie: And then, as we evolve, we'll um, we'll add some things on. As you feel able, and then you give her a little bit, and you let her get used to that until that becomes a reflexive thing rather than a you know everything is a mental process.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: And then the other thing is just say, like, if there are certain hours of the day that I need you to be able to respond to signal messages within X amount of time. Then say, do you commit to that? You know? Are you going to do that? And if for some reason, you know, you're not going to be able to say, Hey, I'm I'm away for a couple of hours. I may not be responsive, so that you know.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Pain Management: Hmm. Yeah.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Pain Management: We do. We do talk about that like Maria Maria Kenya was like, oh, I have to bring my card is like just letting you know. But I'll bring my phone. My laptop. Maria is like I have to have my kids on soccer at 1130, but I'll bring my laptop like.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Pain Management: Everyone is aware of what's happening, Kenya. Maybe not as much as. Committee.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Pain Management: As I would want in terms of doing something, but. Um. I think she's getting better. I think she's getting better.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Tina Marie: Well, I was just responding to you, saying that she didn't respond to signal messages sometimes, so I was saying.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Pain Management: He's young sometimes, but she but. I guess I'm just so used to, Maria, all, both of us being very communicative, so.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Tina Marie: Mostly females.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Pain Management: And I keep on reiterating to Um! To um Kenya like. Tell us if you can't, I want you to over communicate like. It's better to do that than you know.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Pain Management: You know, like you're worried that we're gonna. We're saying you're not.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Tina Marie: I would ask her, too. How do you feel about this? Do you still like it? Do you think that you like.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Tina Marie: Doing this, and and also I would tell her. Please feel free to be honest, because it's really important that you know.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Tina Marie: Um. You know what she and and you can tell her, you know you might change your mind from week to week.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Tina Marie: And but because you depend on her so much.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: You really need to know and understand. Um, what her concerns are, what her fears are, what her worries are, what she likes, what she doesn't like.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Tina Marie: So, but. You know she's she's still young enough. Um!

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tina Marie: And. Being Latina also, you know.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Tina Marie: Being able to express that kind of thing is not necessarily something that's trained.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Pain Management: Right. Right. And she's actually very good on the phone, like I cause I kinda giving her empowering her to like.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Tina Marie: But it's important for you.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Pain Management: You know, Dr. East on here. Be assertive like I said on Saturday. Just real quickly. On Saturday we were there. Um! And she knocked on the door for me and says you have a 1230 patient, because the current patients, taking all my time.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Pain Management: And then she said, the there is a patient waiting, or something like that, and. And then, yeah, I like that, because that's that's what we need. That's what we need with Dr. E. It's like, you know, I can see her text. Dr. E. Like, I can see that which is great. It's just a matter of training, I think.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome. Yeah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Pain Management: Um. But yeah, I think he's he's getting there because we were able to mark kind of give me some idea to like, just have Maria give her task, which is what we're doing. Right now, and it's so far it's it's it's working so.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Pain Management: But yeah. And also I need to know later on, when for our next conversation, like. When do we bring in a 3rd one?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Pain Management: Cause, even though yes, we have 1, 33 new ones. We have follow ups and procedures that are like.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Pain Management: Not being counted.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Tina Marie: What I would like to do is. Your lien tracker.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Tina Marie: Um. There's not enough information here for me to be able to look at it easily and go. Okay, I understand.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Tina Marie: What your volume is, and I also need to understand your hospital. So what I'd like to do is have a time, and maybe it's an additional time, not just our Wednesday call.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Tina Marie: Where we get together. You, me mark hi! By the way, um! Hopefully together. So that I can have a better visual of what your workload is like and your finances so that we can go. Okay, this is what we have before we consider bringing a new person on. I want to understand the roles and responsibilities. I want to understand the gaps.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Tina Marie: So that when we bring somebody on 1st of all, you're not training 2 new people at the same time.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Tina Marie: Um. So probably, you know, if we can get at least another month or 2 with Kenya.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Pain Management: We'll wait. Yeah.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Tina Marie: Um. There, there's a lot of things I really want to wrap my head around to make sure that you've got the best infrastructure.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Tina Marie: So if you can kind of go through the growing pains right now of where you're at. Um. You did a lot to stoke the fire with sweet James, and now you're going to La, and going to work up some more stuff.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Tina Marie: Can you need to be trained. I think, switching with having Maria kind of delegate. So we've got almost this hierarchy that goes from Maria. I think that that works really great. It's a small situation, especially with Kenya. Um being younger, needing more experience. I think that she's going to be open to that. And also Maria Smart.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Pain Management: Yeah. Mhm.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Pain Management: Right. Yeah, she is, which is which is amazing.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I think I think it's working actually, after the conversation after I texted you. And then we have a meeting. It's so far it's working so and um for days that we're gonna go to. La, I'm gonna have to open up Sun Saturday. I know it's gonna be more for me, but it's just what we have to do, which I'm already doing, anyway, sporadically, not all the time.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Mhm.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Pain Management: Yeah, telemed, but. If there is um.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Pain Management: Saturday clinic, then. You know, Dr. E. Is like open to overtime, or whatever like. He's fine. He doesn't really.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Pain Management: Yeah. Yeah, I know you have to go, and Honey did. Did. Are you there.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Pain Management: Okay, did you hear? Do you have anything to say about that?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
mark sweet: I heard some of it, so I was getting called a piece of shit and a liar by a grandpa who's not my client, and then I sent him proof.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Pain Management: Then.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
mark sweet: And he said, I made it up so. Super fun day so far.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
mark sweet: That's okay.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Pain Management: Yeah. It was a crazy day today.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
mark sweet: Let me! It happens, it's life.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
mark sweet: Uh. Uh yeah. No go faster. Build more break things.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:29.000
mark sweet: Look, it's here's what happened you? You threw Kenya in kind of the deep end. She didn't swim quite as fast as you thought she would. Which is. Somewhat normal. Now you know what she can do. And you built like you, said the hierarchy of it, which makes sense.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Mhm.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
mark sweet: Um. I'm always a believer in. Get the person you need in sooner rather than later, because it's a lot harder to play. Catch up.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
mark sweet: And I doubt, Doctor, he really cares about the salary of it. But with that being said.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh, is he paying for that.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
mark sweet: What happened?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Pain Management: Yes.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Tina Marie: Because I take things. Okay.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Tina Marie: I'm switching to my phone, you guys, so I can go get my daughter.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Tina Marie: But I'm still here. Switch.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
mark sweet: Um. But the only caution with that is.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
mark sweet: More salary, more overhead, more expectations. So he will expect you.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
mark sweet: Being an increase. Um. I know the tracker just tracks new patients. It doesn't track, follow up, so we will need to pull away to do that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
mark sweet: I have a feeling that because you guys are using zoom so heavily, we could probably just look at the number of appointments you have via zoom.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
mark sweet: To give a number, and I. Sure there's a way to automate it I just don't know what, but.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Pain Management: Uh-huh.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
mark sweet: Um. There probably is. So that way you can back up your. Case for that.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Pain Management: Because I'm thinking.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Pain Management: In my head. I'm thinking, to wait till it's 200 monthly.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Pain Management: For new ones.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tina Marie: But.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Pain Management: But. That that's.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
mark sweet: I think you're already at 200 people.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Pain Management: Yeah, people, but not in.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
mark sweet: In all likelihood.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Tina Marie: I'm not.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Pain Management: I'm talking about the new cases, I guess, in my head I'm just looking at that, not at the. Others.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.000
mark sweet: Right. And then I think you really do have to talk to him about trying to figure out uh. What to do on these injections, because he can run late for insurance patients, but he really can't on.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Pain Management: That's.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
mark sweet: On these.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Pain Management: Kenya is like. Give you answer yet.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
mark sweet: So I I think.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Pain Management: Still not there. One patient already left, one out of 3.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh! That's not good.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Pain Management: So.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
mark sweet: It's been like 2 h.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Pain Management: Yeah. I know.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Pain Management: And um, yeah.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Tina Marie: And it's not the 1st time.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Pain Management: Sure the Chick-fil-a works, but it can only do go so long, you know, and.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
mark sweet: That's not a.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Pain Management: Again, the other one has another appointment. That's why. And I told Kenya to schedule it before she leaves. And she's like, I just don't know. I'm just busy. So that is a fail. So it's okay. It is what it is.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Pain Management: We'll take that loss. Um.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
mark sweet: It's not just that loss, though. It's also they're gonna go back and complain to the law firm.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I know.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.000
mark sweet: Double.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
mark sweet: So it. There's multiple things that happen from it. Not just.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Pain Management: Good.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Pain Management: Is it okay to write an email of. In the email. It's gonna be a phone call.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Pain Management: What do you think?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Tina Marie: To who.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Pain Management: To the participation that um. Less.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Pain Management: It's Vanessa, so I will just call Vanessa. Vanessa actually likes us. She just called me this morning and says, Oh, we have a patient that we I transferred to, because I like you guys better.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Pain Management: And and then now I'm gonna have to call her. And say.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
mark sweet: That he just got stuck in an emergency, but like there are repercussions to this that reverberate, and so.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Tina Marie: What's.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
mark sweet: This is a conversation you really gotta have with Dr. E.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Tina Marie: But. That's that's something I want to know like. So I have no idea.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Tina Marie: Like my personal experiences. I wait for doctors because they do this crap all the time. But in terms of like your business, your standards.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: The doctors that you deal with. Do you have this where you get calls, and you're like the doctor just didn't show up.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
mark sweet: Yes. We get clients calling us pissed.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Tina Marie: And and statistic.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
mark sweet: I waited an hour, or the room was dirty, or whatever else, or they canceled last minute.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, well, here's why I'm going with this.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Tina Marie: What? What is the average that you're. Or good doctors right. The ones you want to send business to all the time.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: Do that like there's got to be a certain amount of allowance that it just happens that doctors get stuck sometimes. Doing things.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Tina Marie: Um. What I guess what I'm trying to figure out is is, what is the the danger zone where we go? You know this is not acceptable. We might need to do business with other people, or you know what's our backup plan, or this is just how it is. It's the nature of the business. Do you know what I'm saying?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
mark sweet: You're in the danger zone.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But. What defines. That is what I'm trying to say.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
mark sweet: Oh! We do different volume, obviously, than than what.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
mark sweet: Shona is dealing with. But if I get more than like.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
mark sweet: 2 complaints. Or if this is a new doctor I'm working with, I'm already getting complaint. We're just going somewhere else, like there's.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
mark sweet: Plenty of options generally.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Tina Marie: So that's the conversation I would have with Dr. E. Is, do you want to do this lean business? Because if you do.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Tina Marie: This can't keep happening. And.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Tina Marie: And. I mean. But but then, Shona, your your reputation goes with it. So.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Tina Marie: You've got to figure out. What are your options? Because you obviously can't force him.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Pain Management: He really needs another he need. He needs another anesthesiologist. That's really what it is.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Pain Management: I I don't know what happened today. I think what happened was, she has a surgery. He, because when I called him he's in like a surgery center or something.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Pain Management: So I think he, one anesthesiologist, probably didn't show up, and he has to shop because those surgery it's scheduled. Can't, can't! The there's.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Pain Management: In his mind. He prioritized those as priority. Because if you cancel a surgery, that's bad that you. You know, there's surgeons. There's gonna get mad. There are surgery sets.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Pain Management: Thanks.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: So. So we know that Dr. E. If there's anything administrative. He's going to not do it until you literally hold his feet. Okay, not literally, but close enough.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Tina Marie: Feed to the fire right? So. Is there anything that you can do to.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Tina Marie: Improve that situation. Say, Hey, I've looked at these different anesthesiologists. I had conversations with them. We could hire this person right now, like. What can you do to remove the obstacle? And basically all he has to do is say yes or.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Pain Management: That the the problem is, he doesn't give me that option. Unfortunately, because the problem how do I say is. There's no contingency with him.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Pain Management: Like. That's the problem. Like he is. He thinks he's the only. Contingency Plan.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Pain Management: Like there's no.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Tina Marie: But but you have the power to allow that or not. Allow that technically. And I I know that you kind of don't, because there's no business without it. But as long as.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Tina Marie: You're subject to him, and he's subject to. I don't have time for it. This is a circle you're never going to get off. This is a hamster wheel. Somebody has to do something, even whether it's with permission or not permission and change it, or force it or compel it, and historically. Up till now you've been the one to do all the things, even if the conversation is. Fix it, or we're done, or something like that.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Tina Marie: But if if there's not a situation where you can do that. Then you're going to keep being frustrated, and eventually the reputation is going to.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Pain Management: And.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Tina Marie: Cause you issues, and then the decision will be made for you, because you won't have any business.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Pain Management: So I I think the only thing I can. Think of. That's probably a risk, not restriction. But uh.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Pain Management: A problem is, if I, if I get another anesthesiologist, if we've hired another anesthesiologist. Our plan.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Pain Management: Like how we set up the payment might not work. Will not work right, honey, because.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Pain Management: The the conversation about the percentage is. Technically.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Pain Management: How do I say it?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
mark sweet: That's not a. I wouldn't worry about that for this exact moment. I think today is a prime example of why he needs to have a backup plan.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Pain Management: Well, he cannot also have.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
mark sweet: Right? It's not theoretical anymore.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Pain Management: Okay. He cannot. How do I say this? Even as an Np. And Rn.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Pain Management: You cannot find someone within 2 h to request, especially an anesthesiologist. In right? So it's more of. I need to plan it on days. For example, on Wednesdays, maybe. Let's start with a Wednesday. Let's have another anesthesiologist that will just do this on a Wednesday.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Pain Management: And not. Like call within 2 h. Plan.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Pain Management: So, but that.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Tina Marie: I mean anything that you can think of.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Pain Management: That will change the pay.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Tina Marie: Well, so why don't you write it down and be like? This is what it looks like. This is what the pay. It would look like this is like, really. Again, it's hard to be on the same page if a page doesn't exist right.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Tina Marie: And start there. But somebody has to plan something. Then do something before anything can change. If you want something different, you have to do something different right?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Pain Management: Right. I understand it. It.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
mark sweet: The other part of this, too, Jonah, to tell them about pay wise is, how much are you getting paid for the client that left today?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Right, right.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
mark sweet: Not just what you lost in the future. That that's a.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Tina Marie: Exactly.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
mark sweet: Potentially huge thing. But today, how much did you get paid for this patient.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
mark sweet: 0. So if he needs to eat his part.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000
mark sweet: Or part of his part to pay whatever doctor he's doing. This. I would be willing to bet he'd do that. Just so. He at least gets something instead of nothing.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And cost of opportunity, loss also.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Pain Management: Yeah. That's yeah.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
mark sweet: But I'm relatively sure he knew he probably wasn't gonna be able to make it today. Last night.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Pain Management: I know.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
mark sweet: So, you know, I understand you can't get someone in 2 h.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Tina Marie: That's my stuff.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
mark sweet: I still think you probably could. Given how many doctors you have. But.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
mark sweet: Probably knew last night. And so, you know, maybe this is you gotta check in.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Pain Management: He does. This is well. How he is he knows he knows this. This is how he is so. Hey? I'm not.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
mark sweet: So when you gave him the list last night of the patients getting lean. Procedures Today.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
mark sweet: Did he say anything, or did that list not go out? What happened.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Pain Management: Yeah, no. The list was there. He said. Uh Doc. Uh Kenya send it at 8, 35.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Pain Management: All the patient's name with the time, and he said, Tank, thanks. As.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Pain Management: Yeah. He knows.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
mark sweet: Then that's worse.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Pain Management: But the problem is, he probably doesn't know. Like I said, there are things that happen. We're in the surgery center. The anesthesiologists are not able to make it so. He have to fill that up.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
mark sweet: I I'm very sure there was a legitimate reason like I'm not saying that there isn't.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Pain Management: Does that make sense. Mhm.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Tina Marie: You're just saying, though he knew in enough time that this could have been managed and handled, and not.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
mark sweet: Problem.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Tina Marie: Um affect the patient.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000
mark sweet: Or he would have known it early enough that you could have tried to reschedule the patients, or something, because. Reschedule them is bad.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Pain Management: No, he texted us. No, he texted us this morning at.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Pain Management: Let's see 8 0 9. Hi! Can you put my patience back. Uh today. It's like, you mean, you want to push it to 11? Yes, do that. I'm running a little behind this morning. This is at 8 20. Okay? So we call. We call the patient. Say, come at 11.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Pain Management: And then he. He texted at 1110, 59 Am. To be exact, I'm running behind. Please tell the patient to come at 12.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Tina Marie: So he's also probably unrealistic about his ability to catch up.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Pain Management: Oh! Yeah.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Pain Management: He's yeah, he definitely like I said, overextending himself. But. You know.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Tina Marie: So if you do have, you know, whatever the backup plan is, I I don't know the parameters, you know that, but. Let's say you get a message at 8 o'clock in the morning, and he says.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Tina Marie: 2 h late. You can probably go. Yeah, he's not showing up today. Plan, b.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Pain Management: Yes.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Tina Marie: Um? Is there something that you could create, that. Does that, and and when it comes down to you, know him saying, No, I don't want to do this. Guess what Dr. E.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't want to lose the business that I've worked really hard to go get. So you don't really get to make this choice. You can either show up all the time, be reliable.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Tina Marie: Or agree to have a backup plan, because. You've exceeded the amount of not showing up.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
mark sweet: So what's happening with everyone else who's sitting in that office right now? Cause there's.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Pain Management: That. I know there are insurance patients. So what happened is I made the call. I didn't ask anyone, didn't ask Cheryl. I didn't ask, because in my head I just want to help Dr. E.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Pain Management: So I told the staff that are there. To.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Pain Management: Set up a telemedicine appointment for me that are follow ups for medication increase, and I will call them and help them.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
mark sweet: No, no! What I'm talking about is the people who are supposed to be getting injections today that are.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Pain Management: I don't. I don't know. I don't know how they're rescheduled for sure.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.000
mark sweet: Insurance.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Pain Management: For the insurance region, their schedule.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
mark sweet: Got it. Okay.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
mark sweet: So no one's doing it there today.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Pain Management: But for. No one. It's only him, because uh, they're supposed. Uh, there was Dr. Williams. That was there. That's why he's behind, because.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Pain Management: One anesthesiology. Pain, doctor that was working. There is not working there anymore, I guess so. He needs.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Pain Management: To hire someone to cover that Long Beach location. That's what happened.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
mark sweet: Got it.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Pain Management: So there's there's no one there.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
mark sweet: Cool.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Pain Management: Yeah. That's that. This is how he.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Pain Management: He runs his. Practice. He needs more people.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Pain Management: But. Because he doesn't really pay them. Well.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Pain Management: No one really. Wants to work.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
mark sweet: Right. They leave quickly!

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Tina Marie: So just a reminder of the way to look at it is. He, you know.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Tina Marie: He doesn't change unless he's compelled. He will make the minimal amount of change even when he is compelled.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Tina Marie: Um. You.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Tina Marie: Have to. You know, kind of do the math like. How how many times can this happen before you lose the.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: The entire company. Right? All of sweet James, because of your reputation. Or maybe it's just case managers. I don't know how that happens, but. There's a lot riding on this, because you only have a few law office that you're dealing with, and you've got one primary one.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Tina Marie: If it happens to be that. These are their patients the most of the time. Right then.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Tina Marie: Then that is an issue. So. You, and I'll go back to being the architect.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Tina Marie: Have to be the one to. Be strategic to make the plan to determine the parameters, and remember that.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Tina Marie: You can't rely on Dr. E. To do any of that. Basically, you presented an offer to him. He said, Yes. Um in the beginning it felt like this was all.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Tina Marie: His stuff, and you're coming into his house. But the reality is that. You are the the mastermind of the business. You, too.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't exist without you. It doesn't exist without him. But.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: Only because he's the doctor that you're using. It could be another doctor. That's a lot of work. That's a lot of whole starting over that kind of thing. I'm not saying that that's the place to go, but.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: You have more options than he does. Nobody else is going to come in and give him this business. So um.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Tina Marie: Ultimately tona. If you wait.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Tina Marie: Until he finally figures it out. What is it going to cost you.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Tina Marie: So what kind of decision do you feel like you have to make? And I'm not asking you to make it now. But these are the questions to ask yourself. And to come to a conclusion, knowing that 100% he will not fix the issue unless you force it well. And that's strong language. I assume that you know how to like, you know.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Tina Marie: Be diplomatic and do all of that. I don't have to. Correct my words so much with you. You'll do it.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: But you know what I'm saying right? It.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Tina Marie: It's only gonna come from you.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Pain Management: I think um. I definitely think that.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Pain Management: We'll need another doctor at least trial for one day, where we can say, for example, Thursday, all Thursday. I haven't talked to Dr. Nima. I'm gonna ask talk to him. But obviously I'm gonna wait for Dr. E. Dr. E. Wants the um.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Pain Management: The um. What they call it. Dr. E. Wants the.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Pain Management: Lean cases, because obviously. Mhm.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Pain Management: It's just for him, right?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Pain Management: So you definitely will want. You know that patient so.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
mark sweet: I mean again. That's great, but.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Tina Marie: You gotta show up for it.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:01.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Like it's 1 or the other. And if he's there right, this is a backup in case something like this happens which.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
mark sweet: Seems to happen every 2 to 3 weeks.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Tina Marie: Also he may want them, but he's not doing anything to earn them other than opening his doors to work with you. You're the one going out and beating the bushes, getting the business. So.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Tina Marie: He needs to remember that.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
mark sweet: I mean. Look, the the big thing is the ripple of this. It's not the one patient, it's the ripple effect. It has.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Tina Marie: Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. So it's not undoing a little bit of work. Think about the weeks.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Tina Marie: And going into all the preparation for creating the visuals.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Pain Management: So what do you think? Right. What do you think I should do right now?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Tina Marie: Go ahead!

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Pain Management: I mean, I'm thinking we need another doctor. I mean not. I'm not replacing him. I'm just saying we need. He needs another doctor.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so start with your plan. Start small. At least you'll know you're doing something. One day a week, if you want to do that like if go back and look at all the days he didn't show up. Is there a trend? Are there certain days? Was there a trend in the certain types of procedures that he had the day before, or that day, or whatever like. What can you go and look at and predict.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: If this happens, I need a backup plan. More likely than not. This. Pick something, start small, but do something. You'll still.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Pain Management: My question is.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: Go ahead!

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Pain Management: Oh, sorry go ahead!

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Tina Marie: Bye. You'll feel more empowered and you'll learn something from it. This works. This doesn't work.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Tina Marie: So just doing something will help you.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Pain Management: Okay. I guess my question is this.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Pain Management: I know you said I should not think about this, but I'm thinking more of a permanent. Like. He cannot do this.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Pain Management: He, he can't do it on lean patients, so. Get this new um.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Pain Management: Uh! What do you call that? Get this new um anesthesiologist? We can choose 2 days.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Pain Management: We can. We can fill up the entire Thursday. On on one location in Huntington Beach or another time, like Tuesday, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, one.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Pain Management: Location, or whatever.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Tina Marie: But think about what else that offers up to you. So let's say you're talking to Sweet James, and you're like, Hey, if you guys need anybody with anesthesiologists. I've got Dr. E. And this guy, right? So.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Pain Management: Okay. Oh, yeah, that's already. The kind of expectation is that it's not just Dr. E. Dr. E. Is the medical director, but he's not the only injector. That's how he kinda.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Tina Marie: Right. But what I'm saying is this actually increases your capacity, because now you have, you would have an actual doctor name relationship established. That you could be using.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Tina Marie: Like this to me should be the goal, anyway, is that you're expanding. And creating options for yourself, where you can facilitate.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Pain Management: Well, I kinda like. We shot myself in the foot when I built well, we built the Fast Pain Dock under Dr. E.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Pain Management: I mean around.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Tina Marie: But you didn't really.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Pain Management: Well.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
mark sweet: We can swap out his name in 2 seconds.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Pain Management: But I mean um.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Tina Marie: Yes. But they all know they're dealing with you, Tona. It's not as much. He's not as embedded as you think. He is.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Pain Management: You mean? Swap the name on the pamphlet. Swap, everything.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
mark sweet: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what we're talking about right now.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000
mark sweet: What we're saying is, if you've got a. Let's just call it a backup, for right now that allows you to take on additional capacity.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
mark sweet: Right, because you're trying to grow to 400 new people a month.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000
mark sweet: There's no way he's gonna be able to do that many injections unless he's just gonna dedicate his entire practice. To just this, which he's not.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Tina Marie: What you want.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
mark sweet: So. How can you even go beyond the 400? You have to have another doctor.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Like it's going to have to happen anyway.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Pain Management: Okay, but we don't need to put another doctor on. The pamphlet is what I'm saying.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
mark sweet: No.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Tina Marie: No, that's the whole point of fast pain, Doc. It isn't about the doctor that's on the website or the name fast pain. Doc is is the brand. It's got a number. It's got an email.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Tina Marie: It like it really isn't about him. I know his name is on there, and you saw they saw the picture. It's not the point. His name is not the point.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Pain Management: He's and he it, says medical director. And when we're selling we're the way when we're marketing.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Tina Marie: People get replaced in companies all the time. Chona.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is, he's the medical director. Yes, he owns it. But uh, the way we tell the law firm is that we have multiple. Anesthesiologist. We have multiple Mps, we're just managing it. That's kind of like the way.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Pain Management: Okay. I'm gonna.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
mark sweet: Believe me, they don't care unless it's a doctor that has some like criminal issue in their background, or has been suspended other than that they don't care.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Also, that's actually the benefit of it being medical director, because you're not saying he's the sole provider, a director. Yeah.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Pain Management: Oh! Yeah. No.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Pain Management: Exactly. Yeah, we we put medical directories and and it shouldn't be. Uh, I'm thinking, I know we don't want to talk about the the.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Pain Management: The pay. How is that gonna work? If it's an address, you should just.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Pain Management: And it's you know what I'm saying like, how.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
mark sweet: Doctor. He has to figure out how he's gonna split his money. Yours doesn't change. You're still bringing the patients. You have the value that he doesn't have.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Tina Marie: Also, I would remind him, when he's doing that math. Nothing divided by nothing, equals nothing.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Tina Marie: If he. Keeps doing what he's doing. There's nothing you will find somebody else. You'll go do business with somebody else because you're not going to let him take you down because he's not showing up.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Pain Management: Yeah, okay, let's it's gonna be, I feel like a sensitive. Conversation, because he wants everything.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Pain Management: To himself.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
mark sweet: Look, that's fine. If he wants to have someone who does all the other insurance stuff.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Tina Marie: But also you can want all you want to. If you don't work for it, you don't get it.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Pain Management: Yeah, that.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Tina Marie: If you don't show up for it, you don't get it.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Pain Management: Yeah, and we need.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
mark sweet: And this is not a what if situation. This is literally happening, happening like at the moment.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: Isn't like, oh, this could happen. This might happen. We need a plan just in case like. We're here.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I will talk to him about it, because also kind of like have more stability in terms of schedule, like, if we put Tuesdays and Thursday whole day schedule. It's gonna be better. And then the rest he can. Are you guys there.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Pain Management: Okay, like Tuesdays and Thursdays. We can just say procedure days.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Pain Management: That one doctor that we, and then the rest he can do. Dr. E.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Tina Marie: There you go, and this is why this call is called tone of the architect.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Pain Management: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna just starting doing that. We'll we'll our priorities start filling up Thursday in.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Pain Management: And um.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
mark sweet: You'll make sure that's the days that like. Work, I mean before you just pick a day. But.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Pain Management: No, no, I know that. It's the one the days that will work, because Thursdays uh Huntington Beach, you know, we need. If there's no office.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Pain Management: Thing on Thursdays. So we're gonna use that up as. You know.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Pain Management: Yeah, we're gonna use that up. I think that's the best. At least we can start on a Thursday.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Pain Management: It's all procedure days for this particular doctor. I'm gonna talk to him about it because this can't.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Tina Marie: I'll I just want to remind you of one thing before we leave. When you get to this point where you make a decision, and then you act on it.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: Things get better every single time that has been your pattern. So keep that in mind as you do this, because. A lot of times you'll work up to a decision, and then kind of go back and forth on it, and not necessarily trust yourself or not want to have the wrestle.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Tina Marie: But every time you've done that, and you know this is what needs to happen. Things get better, so trust it, and.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: Obviously be smart. Take your time to do things the right way. But.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Tina Marie: That's been your pattern, Shona. You do great.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tina Marie: Especially when you guys brainstorm together.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Pain Management: Thank you. I think that's no because of you guys help. I think this will. This will work. I'll start with one day that which is Thursday, and we'll fill it up.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
mark sweet: But right now you need to figure out damage, control.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
mark sweet: Is he there yet? Is he still not there?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Pain Management: And. Let me call Kenya real quick, and I I don't know.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
mark sweet: Cause if he's still not there, I don't know. Do you go and give like trigger points like I I literally don't know.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Pain Management: No, this is.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
mark sweet: You gotta do something, though.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Pain Management: I know.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: And then, after that, you probably want to reach out to the case manager and.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Pain Management: Is he there? Not yet.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Pain Management: Are you kidding me.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Pain Management: So uh, is it.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tina Marie: It's 1 o'clock.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Pain Management: Can you call him. Please. Yes, I'll call him again right now.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Pain Management: Oh, my God! Bad.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Tina Marie: So damage control with the patient, but also the case manager and let them know. Look, we're we're I'm working on getting another doctor. So. That we can handle whatever happens.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Tina Marie: Even if Dr. E. Is not ready, so that they know. This is not okay with you either, and you are managing it.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Pain Management: It to be fair. This is the 1st time that it happened like this. How do I say it like we're in? He's 2 h late.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Pain Management: It never.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but an hour. But you've had people leave and be really upset. And not get what they need like. They waited over an hour.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Tina Marie: And. You know.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Tina Marie: That's too much, too.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Pain Management: Yeah, understandable. Well um.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Pain Management: And.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
mark sweet: I mean, I would get ahead of it after today, regardless.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Pain Management: Sorry sweetie is calling me sorry.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Pain Management: Hello! Hi.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Pain Management: Hello!

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Tina Marie: I feel like we need the jeopardy theme song right now.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
mark sweet: A little bit. No, I mean I I.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000
mark sweet: I feel for, because it's just. It's so frustrating when there's. Literally, not very much that she can do.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Our hands are tied.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:55.000
mark sweet: It's and it's not like she can call like. Hey, Dr. Moon, can you come? Do these like 4 injections for me like that?

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
mark sweet: Can't really do that.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
mark sweet: And it's not the machine here.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Tina Marie: No, but but. We did know that eventually the the plan was, and not because of this, that she'd be working with other doctors. So it's like.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah. No. No. Yeah.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Tina Marie: And it's just probably synergy like this is the time, anyway.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
mark sweet: I'm not surprised. This is happening. It's just. Annoying.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Tina Marie: Well, and he's probably behind and stressed out all the things that has gone on in his personal life.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
mark sweet: Well, no, look, you get stuck in surgery and like it's not going well, he can't just.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. For sure, for sure.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
mark sweet: Um. You know, and I'm more than sure it's a.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah, legitimate? Reason like I'm not taking away from that.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Tina Marie: Right. But he doesn't manage his expectations properly, like he's too optimistic or just.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Tina Marie: Unrealistic period about what. In his own mind. He can do.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
mark sweet: But now we gotta figure out, how does she get ahead of this. Because the the patients are.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
mark sweet: More than likely we complain.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Tina Marie: It. Yes, and but there's only so much that you can do right. And, you guys, you'll do all of that like she was already.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
mark sweet: No, I know, but it's a call like.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Tina Marie: She bought them lunch. I don't know if you know that.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know. I know that because I paid for it.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, the. Yeah, if you have a plan for what she can do. But the worrying about it isn't.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:34.000
mark sweet: No, I mean, best thing she can do is call each case manager. Say we had a huge emergency. So sorry we bought lunch for the patients. I just want to let you know what happened, because I don't want them to call and complain to you.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Tina Marie: Gonna make it better.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
mark sweet: This won't happen again, and she has to make sure it won't happen again. Um.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
mark sweet: Because I've just, I found reaching out, asking for forgiveness and letting me know what happened. Will.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Tina Marie: For sure.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000
mark sweet: Wash more of it than. Waiting for it to hit the fan.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Tina Marie: Right. You you wanna be like, let me know ahead of time before my clients call that.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Tina Marie: Something went wrong. Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Tina Marie: Well, she's probably going to be busy. She's already been here, you know. She got here at 12, and.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Tina Marie: Usually only has this time, so we can probably just end the call, and then. Um touch bases together later.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
mark sweet: Sounds, fun. In terms of our numbers. I'm digging into it, and um.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Tina Marie: All right.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah, these reports are. Interesting. So uh, I'll email you more about it. But.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
mark sweet: I get to get everything manually.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Tina Marie: Good. Well. When well, okay, whenever you have what you have, or you want to just dig into it together.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Tina Marie: Let's just have an additional call. And just really. Go through it.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Tina Marie: Kind of. Forensically and figure out.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Tina Marie: What we can interpret from it, but also, maybe, how we still need to improve the reporting. But that's the linchpin.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Tina Marie: That data.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Pain Management: Okay. Sorry guys. Okay. So I, that was the case manager of one that left. And I apologized to her, and I talked to her, and she's like, is the patient upset? No, she's just.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Pain Management: She's she cannot reschedule cause she's apparently busy, and she's like that patient is actually weird. So.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Pain Management: But yeah, just Fyi, I just wanna share that to you guys. So.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Tina Marie: Good. Well, Mark was saying, the best thing you can do right now is just go call any case, manager, and let them know ahead of time. What's happening that it won't happen again, and. That you're taking care of it.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Pain Management: Yeah. And there's another one that's he's actually still there. They waited so.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Tina Marie: Well, I think we should end now, so that you can go put out fires, and then we'll reconvene.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Tina Marie: Later.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Pain Management: Okay. Thank you guys.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Pain Management: He's he's 15 min away. Oh, my God!

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Tina Marie: Hi Jonah.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Pain Management: Bye. Thank you.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome. Bye.
