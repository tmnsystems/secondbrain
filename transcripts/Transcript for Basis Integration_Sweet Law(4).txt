Well, I can tell you because I have a sciatic issues with four giant girls that just sat on it for months and months each. I've had different tens machines, but I've got this one that's really great now, and I also I can't take pain medicine at all so but within It depends on how bad the pain is and I also have a set of stretches that I do That are excruciating, but then solve it But anyway, it would nothing else will help me that unit will and I can send you link on Amazon if you're interested It's like 35 bucks. It's so it's nothing and you get it.

00:02:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Starting last week when I got back.
00:02:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was going to say I thought you were like we're hurting then.
00:02:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's been driving on for like a week.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pain and like that is so exhausting. Yep. I dealt with chronic pain and actually almost don't have it.
00:02:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Are they anymore? Yeah.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anyway, I could just go on about pain stuff. won't. Um, let me open. This. And. Say. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. Then wild for a lot of people Fuji other reschedule. Oh, I don't know how to reschedule. You've got this pain. I've got insanity. Let's see. I don't know. me move here. What's today, the ninth and we've read 22 with not out.
00:03:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, hey, we got to get some of those in. It's not bad. It's just not quite where I want to be.
00:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. I was thinking one thing, because you used to tell us how many we had from each source, don't have that, but I'm like wondering if, what is your process? Huh? You have from each source. Yeah, but it's not tabulated. Like, so walk or after manually go count to five, six, seven, twelve.
00:03:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
because yeah, we broke it up. Yeah, sorry.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so, I like seeing I want like I want both. want total and then by state. So if that's not a problem, that would be great. If it is, then I'll just get an habit.
00:04:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
manually add it.
00:04:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Where do you just get that retainers by source by state report? That's the name of the report. No, that's what I'm asking you.
00:04:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Is that the one you use every Monday? No. I look at our case sign this month and then I look at the investigator out because some of those are signed, but just not in yet.
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's right. That's right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let go into this. Oh, yeah. it to a different tab. Hold on. Oh, tell me I did not lose it. Right, hold on, sweet. It's my mark alarm. There go. Okay, so this is probably not a great time to talk about it. But I'll just ask you in case you've been thinking about it. We were talking about defining where sweet log going, like what do you want to turn it into. And the answer was something that can take care of everybody when you're not here. And so I asked you to define what does that look like? Who is everyone? And what does taking care of each one of those specific ones look like? Thank you. Is that anything you feel like you could talk about today?
00:06:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's a step-by-step process for the naming, and the first move that we have to do is get stabilized.
00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree, but the path to stabiliz well, okay, we are as stable as you're going to be with the volatility of the way that you get leads, and the volatility of getting new talent. So, our plan moving forward will be the best plan if it's based off of where you want to go when you move forward. So, that should be a priority to figure out. And I, talking from the point of, in the beginning it was, I just want to sell this in five years, you know. make X amount of money and That vision has changed over time How much time you want to spend in the office has changed and so All of that matters into as to like what type of business you build and What type of people you need to hire There are some things we can't control like how much it costs to get we can't control But we can influence and I mean but we can really do more than we're doing everything that counts it comes to vendors and Optimizing getting the business and optimizing how we handle the business. We're already working on that Can't really go faster than it can go Because everything that we're doing is trying to optimize that that that is as fast as it can go without anything breaking or Just being ring. So where you want to go and why you want to go there really is the next conversation half.
00:08:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is, but we still don't have a brand. And what I mean is externally, not internally. Internally, we do have a brand externally.
00:08:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's still backwards, Mark. What do you want? And your brand should be based around where you're going and where you're going is undefined right now.
00:08:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I know the number I want us to get up to, which is a quarter billion dollars of settlements.
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are we out right now?
00:09:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Probably in the year around 40.
00:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 40 million and you want to get to 250 million. Yeah. And why did you choose that number?
00:09:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's a nice big fun number.
00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how strategic do you think picking a number that's a nice big fun number is.
00:09:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. It's worked so far. The other thing is that breaks down to about 20 million a month. I know that's 240.250, but when you factor in the size it would be with referrals and everything else, you get there really quickly. And at that level, you are not as worried about being squeezed out.
00:10:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how fast do you want to get there?
00:10:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is a fantastic question. Because that is going to take some time.
00:10:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to take a lot more than time. It's going to change. It's going to take specific types of people who are going to spend a lot of time doing it. Who are going to be. strategic in managing it. People don't just make $250 million because they decide to. There's very specific types of organization that has to happen and time and investment. I don't know that that's compatible with the kind of like that you want to live, but let's surface level map it out. Because telling you doesn't really work very well, showing you does. Okay. So ballpark what you think that is possible. You're talking about you think you have 30 years left. How much of it do you want to spend trying to do this?
00:11:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good percentage.
00:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need a number. Roughly.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
90%.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't even know what that is. Let's say 27 years, 25 years. Let's just say 25. You want to spend 25 years in this business? Yeah. You do?
00:12:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, it.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're okay with it. What makes you happy, Mark?
00:12:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Thank you, think it just has no circumstances. I like being busy. like working. Building stuff is way more exciting than just watching it. It just, yeah.
00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really makes you happy.
00:12:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Building is far more entertaining and fun than operating.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What else makes you happy?
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm other people have me.
00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you think that one's bigger than creating and building?
00:13:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Different.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:13:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So I want to say yes and I want to say no all at the same time because they're just very different.
00:13:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think if you had to pick one or the other, I feel like creating helps you satisfy the first one, but I don't think you could be happy with just creating if you couldn't make people happy. I do think you could be happy just making other people happy if you had that ability. I think it would end up you'd be creating in order to do that. But if let's say you had all the resources in the world. you didn't have to create anymore again. And all you did was find ways to make people happy every day. think you'd probably still be happy. Because creating that happiness would be creating.
00:14:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay, I can work with these. I have to think about it a little bit though. Um, So inside of this though, you're Have you ever visualized recently what it looks like when you get there? Like who's working with you? offices do you have? How many people do you have? Who's running things? How are they running things? Have you? fully like, if you could have just waved a magic wand and those people existed, who would be there, who would not be there?
00:15:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really want you to do that. Okay. Um. Yeah. Yeah. The more specific you are and what you visualize, the easier it is to bring it to you. But when you have ambiguity in your dreams and in your visions, you get ambiguous results. It just happens that way. Um, so. It's easier to build working backwards. So let's say, for example, don't. You don't need to argue with this example because it's just an example. But let's say, for example, that there is somebody who really is. running the show not not Mary not a I call you right hand because you do you think I don't see you what let's call a professional CEO Well a professional CEO and a professional COO and a professional CMO That's what I think you need to have is like at that level you've got those 30 um and they I Like I don't even know I'd have to do some some research to see What a structure is what them what the minimum successful structure is For that size of a company Uh, I know who to go ask about this and look at some Different structure ideas. Do you know any examples? Like what is the smallest company?
00:16:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That does that and does it well Those are two different questions. Um, because there are only multiple firms that basically have a figurehead for their marketing. And then they've got people who are actually running the farm. Does it make any sense or no?
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not enough information. Okay.
00:17:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, let's take larger firms, the ones that you generally will see on billboards. There's one person who they're still involved or not involved. Most of the ones that I'm thinking of are not involved really anymore. They've got a person managing their entire office. have a supervising attorney and they've departmentalized out. So the person that is running their office because there's not a lot more. Ingenuity, for lack of a better term, they're just continuing on what they're doing. They're not changing anything, they're not looking to 10x, and I'm just picking a number out of dinner. They're looking for someone to maintain while they can see to move forward as best as they possibly can.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making how much?
00:18:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
lot of those scrums have made a lot of money.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a zero number.
00:18:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
because everyone's full of crap, unfortunately. That's true. really don't know.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know anything about how happy their people are?
00:18:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Most of the people are not very happy.
00:18:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is the thing that we've talked about several times in terms of your goals. The financial goals that you want. Aren't as compatible with the making people happy goals that you want for sweet off So which one matters most I'll give you an example This is not My ideal per se it's just an example with The way that Salko does his stuff minimal people Um, probably not happy people probably higher profit margins Generally speaking the higher profit margins are coming from um, uh, know optimized staff Optimized meaning you're getting the most out of them for the least amount of money And I don't know what the attrition rate is there's me a balance there Um There's a And then there's also, you know, the Google, like the conglomerate type companies that are huge and who knows what their profit margin somebody does. They're probably probably, I don't, I haven't looked at them. But my point is that the bigger they are, it doesn't matter how small the margin's on, like many super, you know, high net worth companies have really tiny margins. And that's just how they live. It's big revenue, big profit, but tiny margins, anything could happen and break that. And it has happened to companies historically. There's all kinds of different ways to go about this. Now, the way that I go about things is optimized, leveraged, so that you don't have any cuties, heel, you can't get flicked in a tiny area and just fall apart. That leverage happens at a systems level. It happens at a team. level, it happens at a marketing level, it happens at just the foundational level. It's all across the board. Everything is optimized, which is what helps protect it. So the primary goal can be either optimization or it can be dollars, but it can't be both. You can only have one primary goal by definition. So now if you want to say I want to 6x because that's what that is from where you're at in 25 years, prioritizing optimization with a secondary goal of maximum revenue, then that helps put some parameters on it that helps us to make decisions moving forward how we do the growing. Does that make sense? So is the prioritization, the money at whatever cost or optimization, keeping in mind that without focusing on optimization 25 years down the road, sweet law could be out of business like many other firms and companies. Also knowing that with AI, law is changing a lot. So finding other ways to create that revenue for yourself might be prudent. Any thoughts about that?
00:22:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, you're right. Obviously, I think you know, not going to prioritize just power.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do, but I still need to hear it because people do change, you know?
00:22:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. No, so it doesn't make any sense to only focus on the profits for me.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because it's just not, not like that.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, that's what, that's right, it won't, it won't, but I need you to remember that when you speak, when you, when you're talking to me, when you're talking to your team, when you're, when you're talking to yourself, you need to, you need to remember that don't speak conflicting goals, because you will create conflicting processes and outcomes. Does that make sense?
00:23:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Totally.
00:23:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that happens and one of the things that you'll do sometimes is just kind of brush it off and be like, well, know me, like I do, but the bigger that you get the specificity in your words has more power. So I just really want you to get in the house. a bit of saying what it is that you're creating, like I want to have a $250 million a year business that is optimized, leveraged, and future-proof because that's an ambiguous term, but it implies that you're focused on it and that you're doing all the things that could help create that as a reality. Leveraging and first of all understanding and of the current market, whatever the current market is because it keeps changing, right? Understanding everything about that business, understanding the technology, leveraging it all, future-proofing is you're constantly a student of your own business, of the market, of the psychology, of the market, of the technical... technology in the market, all of those things. So, that'd be like bicentennial. That'd be 25 years from now. That'd be the middle of the century. Yeah. Bicentennial.
00:25:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or else we will look very different, imagine by then.
00:25:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just the parties of law period.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, for sure. Law itself may look very different. Yeah. Let's see. Optimized, fully leveraged, on future growth. Which, I mean, that's a huge burden, but you don't obtain huge success without paying a huge price. And no one with actually any sense of reality sets out to create something that big, with that being willing to pay the price. yes, it's a huge burden, but that's the price that greatness is willing to pay. So, you know, there's that. All right. So, in order to make that happen, things that you would have with the SEO, C-O-O, and C-O. Now, I think the CMO is the last thing that you get because you also enjoy marketing. Still? Yeah? Okay. I don't imagine that will go away for a while because marketing is a huge level. marketing is psychology, and marketing is tied to the making people happy, right? Because people buy from emotions. People, well, yeah, buy, made their purchasing decisions, even if it's hiring an attorney. Either way, they buy from emotions. And generally, the emotion is what's going to stop me from hurting, rather than what's going to make me happy. the other one, the next one down is what one is going to make me happy or feel good. so it kind of aligns with the thoughts you already have, which is how do I make people happy? How do I give them what they want? How do I take care of them? And marketing is very much integrated with that. Okay, so when we start And weren't you around 12 million annually? Yeah, that's what I thought. And do you happen to know what the profit margins have been?
00:28:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're over your son?
00:28:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:28:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, it's not my heaven. They're probably around 10%.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they don't have to change a lot, right?
00:28:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
For better or worse. Generally speaking, I mean, we go negative sometimes because we go full growth. But generally speaking, it stays around there.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Let's see. I'm going down my list of things we have. Let me just share my screen to see. Should we do not anyway? Oh, so. thing I would like to do is kind of move these around, dragging them up into like priority, looking at the M progress. We've also got, like I said, this is a work in progress. I'm so kind of trying to organize it and structure it, but starting with, what do we want to be working on on a priority now? already know vendors and lead sources, but that's mostly a you thing.
00:29:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yep, that's not going to change too much. But frankly, the next big hurdle for us to tackle was a French slate. Is that winner? It's free branding, website, SEO, all of it.
00:29:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I have that here, so branding.
00:29:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because if we launch a hundred billboards tomorrow and the web doesn't show up for anything, what does it matter? Because really all these things are driving people to a website more than anything else. Yeah, some will call directly from seeing an ad or a radio or whatever, but most who are going to go online.
00:30:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were talking about, I don't know if I have it in here, I think I have it, TV stuff. I did that comments and 20 grand for set up 11, unfortunately. Oh, I thought you said 11.
00:31:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I thought it was 11, apparently it's 22.
00:31:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And?
00:31:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We're still trying to find dates next year. I still think it's worth the risk.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You too. Oh, so this was a question I had that we got short on time last week. Do they have any stats or like, like, is there anybody they could say, hey, they've been running this for years. then we know obviously something is working and people are still putting money into it.
00:31:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there was a couple of firms that they've been working with, mostly out of East and Texas area. They've traditionally done a lot of mass tourist stuff as well, which we all know how that goes.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um. That's not right. Okay. Okay. Why does that keep going on? I guess I keeps using it instead of stopping it. Um. Thing that you can observe with us yet about walk or changing their ads to flat rate.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We're sorry.
00:32:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just because I'm going to be gone next two weeks and the last time we listened kind of auto bill. The results were not great. So really want to kind of keep my thing around the post and have almost like weekly calls with them while we get started. and just to make sure that everything is working as it should. And we're not just getting done like a ton of crappy Washington leads. We're going always go back to what we're doing, but if this works, it's kind of a win-win for both sides quite frankly, assuming it works, and that allows us to scale decently.
00:33:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you said you're not going to be around the next couple of weeks, are you going to be here for this meeting?
00:33:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I should be able to be, yeah.
00:33:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we've got the 16th, the 23rd, and the 30th, none of those are actual holiday days. Yeah. I'm good for all of those too, I don't know if Dan.
00:33:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
one o'clock is like 6 a.m. there and I'm usually up anyway, so this should be fine.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I thought we had figured that out, but I just wanted to make me sure.
00:33:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if someone comes over something different, I'll let you know what I'm not expecting it to be.
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Let's see. Let's go back through this.
00:34:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think about John and I are expecting to work on the points.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I thought you said Joe is like, who the hell is John? Okay.
00:34:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I replaced her.
00:34:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I'll do that. I know you're kidding. Anyway. Um, we're working on that. Okay, keeping me to reviews. I saw a really bad review.
00:34:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Come through a one-star review. What are you doing about that? It's already gone.
00:34:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's one of Sam's clients. Huh?
00:34:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What are Sam's clients? already gone.
00:34:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's done. How did that happen?
00:34:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That one service that got their distribution sheet?
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but how did you get rid of it?
00:34:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Was it that one service that you hired? No, we got the plan to take it down.
00:34:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How?
00:34:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We basically told them if you don't, either going back to what they should have been rather than what we were down to.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so we reduced our fee down a little bit, gave him a little bit more money.
00:35:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that's fine.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hope the bear.
00:35:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we told him like we're going to go spend $200. We'll get it removed or we can give you $200 more. What do you want to do?
00:35:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got to. That's good. 200. It's crazy how much $200 means to some people that that will just they still feel like they want in some way, should reform. Yeah. Yeah. All right, so let's talk about the leverage points that you're wanting to be and able to work on. So especially for like basically the next few weeks where there's stuff happening. Okay, actually, I want to go over these call control places you sent. All right. Go control. why send that to you legal conversion summer? Uh, that's a name isn't it? Yeah, contract services for the moment. Wait a minute. Is this outsourcing?
00:36:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So they do that partially, but it looks like they also do some training.
00:36:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's a very, I was like, I don't know if this applies. It does sound, but I don't, I don't.
00:37:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's not a lot. I don't get any more like go to number one choice.
00:37:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they clearly see more than a few. Yeah, I mean, I would definitely reach out to them and tell them, you know, what you're doing that the biggest issue that I know of, right? I don't listen to everybody is you have a dynamic where you've got, I don't remember who it was if it was Jessica or Elsie, but I think it was Jessica. That's Lorentz, who is, does Lorentz have any other women? It's another woman, but I think there's case in which they're, hold on. Ah, crap. Oh my gosh, that was not what was happening here. Oh, I'm free. Sometimes. Zoom will not move and then I'm clicking on things. Where's the Viri? Yeah, it's not Viri.
00:38:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, crap. know it is.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're right. No, I know, but she's not the one that I was thinking about when I was talking about needing something. So, want to just open these back up. So, it's Jessica. So, Jessica has an issue because she's talking to Hispanic clients. And they're basically Lorenz is like, well, they treat her like, I'm the elder, be quiet, listen. And he said they'll say stuff like, well, if you're not going to listen to me, if I'm not important to you, then I'll go call somebody else. Because one of the things Lorenz told them to do when people talk and talk and talk and say, hey, I've got a meeting, um, you know, I'll call you back something like that. And he said, well, they'll say, well, fine, I'm not important enough I. Maybe I should go. hire somebody else. like, I don't even know why you would say that. That's not that because you're making it about you, not about them, whereas what you could be saying is, okay, so I want to get straight to work on this. I need to go make some phone calls for you. Here's what I heard this, this, this, and this. Is that correct? Okay, great. I'm going to go ahead and go and get to work on this right now for you. Bye. And anyway, so I told him that, but the other thing is people see him differently because he's male and older, especially there are some cultures, Hispanic being one of them, where they're going to treat females different than males and somebody who sounds younger, even, even differently. so we need somebody who can train, not just give somebody the tactics, but also give them the mindset that they need to be able to get into, to handle that. But they great. The thing about it, if you can get somebody who trains this really well, it won't just change the outcome of the phone calls, it will change your person completely. They will completely change. They will be more confident in all their conversations. They will be better negotiators and standing up for themselves, advocates for anything that matters to them, period. So also, a natural consequence of this is people become less tolerant of when they understand how to handle people who are giving it to them, if that makes sense. It's a good thing. It's just, it can change dynamics, working dynamics, and sometimes people just really like people to be the way that they are, and it does change people, so I just wanted to tell you that part. All right, let me go look at this one more thing. Let's see, one legal. What an intake pros.
00:41:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So did anything stand out to you about any of these that you remember or you're just found out one was kind of cool because it's real time, like feedback.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that's just getting better and better and better as time goes on.
00:41:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I want to go through a couple demos with them to see how great it does. But that I can see like continually getting better or just building out our own version of it at some point. I like both of the constant feedback because I think that's the hardest part in the feedback loop.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, so here's what I like that also is because this isn't just about intake. This is your legal team as well. They need call control. So. It's it's probably part of the intake process in it. I say intake. I don't mean your intake. I mean, just getting a new client because they have the introduction call, which to me is kind of an extension of intake. So, but I just want to make sure that we know we're not talking just about intake. We're talking about the legal team also. Yeah. Okay. Well, why don't we make it a goal then?
00:42:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It looks like that one. It can pick up tonage.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And, you know, hey, do we just have angry people on the phone? I don't want us to case, but like, what are they doing when they do detect an angry client? Like, what's happening?
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's the way that we can keep getting better. You do get angry people on the call and some people like Mike don't do well with them and or maybe it's the other way around.
00:42:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's one.
00:42:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. I was going to wait a minute. No, Mike was the one that like makes people happy, but There are some people, though, that he doesn't like, so they all have their Kryptonite, basically, where they just are like, they kind of punt. And that's a, you know, that's a natural thing. can't all deal with the things that just stress us out constantly.
00:43:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I agree, black clients do not like me.
00:43:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't just, they don't like me. You, white man.
00:43:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They just don't like me.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they don't even mean me. But, yeah. Yeah, there, there is definitely, um, so, uh, yeah, I mean, yeah, strong, strong females don't like me unless I already have gotten into my be humble. I have to specifically handle them very differently and, and downplay and behave, yeah, just be differently. But that's the thing that's what I trying to teach Lorenz is that it's, um, it's diplomacy and it's finessing a conversation. based off of the personality that you're dealing with. And so you can't handle all people the same way. And one of the things that I keep trying to drill into him, Patrick, is that the number one thing you need to understand is that there's a purpose for the phone call and that the overall purpose is despite what they think it is or what they feel it is, like I'm lonely, I want to talk to somebody is sometimes what they think the purpose is. But the purpose is they have a case and they want the case handled and they need their money, they want their money. And also, and this is kind of secondary because it's not top of mind for everybody, but the attorneys know and the doctors know that these people could potentially have some long lasting issues. And if it doesn't get handled properly, then they might not be able to have any financial support for it. And so making sure that that's taken care of also needs to be there, even if that's not necessarily what the client is focusing on. And they're just focusing on, I want my money now. So it's on the legal teams that's their responsibilities to make sure that the client is always thinking about what the purpose of that conversation is and that they're on purpose and that they're taking care of it and that they're always, you know, driving towards that. There has to be some listening but like another tactic I told them and I said I use this all the time but it's not really a tactic, it's true. It's just also a method that I use because of the truth which is my brain will get full. If somebody is trying to tell me like all the things and those details aren't relevant, I may not be able to focus on what is relevant because they just data dumped into my brain. So you need to tell people like okay in order for me to help you to the best of my ability right? I need blah blah blah blah and I need you to focus on this. And then the other thing is Lorenz is like well sometimes they just don't listen. Okay, so if somebody's doing that with you, then you need to say, okay, do you want me to X or do you want me to help you to the best of my ability, right? Because if you want me to listen to the next 30 minutes of ramble, obviously you can't say it like that. But if you want to tell me all of these things, I can tell you right now that that's not going to help me be able to serve your case best. And that's really what I want to do. So then you get quiet, you ask the question, okay, do you want me to do this, right? listen to this or hear this or whatever they'll say, there's some kind of thing that people will be asking for specifically and it's not, it's counterproductive to the case. And they go, or do you want me to handle this case to the best of my ability and get the best outcome? And then you be quiet until they answer. Because they're not going to tell you they don't want you to answer best. What they may try to do is dodge the question. I told them that if they try to dodge the question then you just have to ask it again Like I really need to know do you want me to do this or this because if I'm gonna do it best I can't do what you're asking me to And if you don't want me to do my best job, then you know, maybe I can do this but nobody can say I don't want you to do the best job So anyway, just trying to show them some things, but I'm only talking to Lorenz and Patrick I'm not talking to the rest of your team somebody's got to be watching them. So this this This observai sounds amazing if it can even Because no, you're not gonna pay attention to everybody nearly as much so even if it's not Excellent, but it's consistently observing and improving and giving feedback. That would be great What I would like to see you do is get this started But also just call these and find out what you can find out Maybe you learn something about what their process is and that's something that we just can do on our own or Or maybe it's like future. Okay, so we add this to this, that type of thing. But talking about maximum leverage, right? getting the most out of the resources you have, this is, we haven't talked about this for a long time, but we were talking about what level players you have. You're like maybe B minus, maybe a C plus, I don't know, not eight plus across the board. And it's hard to hire a plus across the board. So we need to get them there. If you're doing that on top of giving them a place to work, where they feel safe, where they feel respected, and they're getting paid fairly competitively, they're not going anywhere except for improving, which is going to mean that your margins should improve also, even if they're getting a incentive program. long as that incentive program doesn't, isn't counterintuitive to your profit options.
00:48:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's yes, so that's a conversation we need to return to too. But for right now, what is the likelihood that you'll be able to contact these this month and get some good notes for what each can do?
00:49:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It should be pretty decent. mean a good part when I'm going out of town is I've got more time to work on this stuff.
00:49:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so do you want to have that be an end of the month thing? Can we do this sooner? What's the pace?
00:49:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely not this week, but I'm hoping the next week or two, like the goal is to get emails out this week to them just to start sending up times to talk to them. And then hopefully next week it'll be captured off to them. Christmas, I know it's been messed up a little bit of stuff, but terribly.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't try to move this Zoom like menu and I guess it's in the way I won't do it. So the automating following up with the doctor's office is this is something that I think is super leveraged. I don't know what it entails.
00:50:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think one of the- The sort of what we figured out was the monthly subscriptions or quarterly subscriptions make sense, but we need to go doctor by doctor because every office is so different. So once we do the initial setup, we're fine. Just the initial setup is going to take some time to like doctor came in Arizona, they're healthy people. They will appreciate Harry and David free.
00:50:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:51:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Toxelike, Washington, Cara, he'd rather get a bottle of wine every quarter. So we just have to kind of go through it and then level of default if we just don't know them all enough. But considering we bought lunch for most of these people multiple times, we have a pretty good idea of what they like.
00:51:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how many offices are we talking about? 5060. Who's going to be in charge of this?
00:51:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just the honest spreadsheet. So if we don't see much from a doctor or whatever may be, we'll look at every quarter and we just cut them off.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like that. So, um, this, the, these two were related, right? That automating the follow-up with the doctor's offices was about just making sure that we're top of mind and they're sending us referrals. Okay. So, um, it's all together.
00:52:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
mean, part of what we also thought was like just texting some of the doctors just to be a little more personal, I guess.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that's what I was thinking about was, um, how, what's the frequency? Yeah. Um, and can we automate something that goes and checks? Okay, what was the last date of contact with that office? Either one because they referred us a case and so it can check for that data. Or two, because we sent them a text message and what was the content of the text message. So it's like decision matrix, and if it can be automated, if this the not, which if it's custom programmed, and it really shouldn't be that much to do, I think Dan's guy, Norio could do that. I don't know if Eric could do that, but I think Norio could do it. Build something like that and high level for you. Would you want to do that? Yes. Okay. So. Okay. So. Oh, he'll get the email. You You Let's get that conversation going with some specificity. I'm almost positive. Everything exists to be able to do that. It's just who's going to program it and then what do we need to change? And, um, how do you, so right now, I'm not even sure any of this happened. So I know that you have the spreadsheet with Jessica or Jessica, America, of them has of the chiropractors and, um, like, I know you're tracking some doctor staff. don't know. Do you track any doctor communications? No. Okay. So this, we could be building this from scratch. So that helps because we're not like, have to integrate an already working process. Um, so we can build it to be optimized from the beginning by rather than trying to round peg square hole and make things work together. So that's good. Um, all right, man, time goes fast. Probably not for you, but so for me. Okay. So that's, that's things that we can work on now. I do. I'm still Trying to help with the guys I yelled at them last week, and I don't really yell at them, but I kind of, it wasn't yelling, but I was definitely angry. Yeah, anyway, so, and I have not seen any report. It's this week, and it's Monday, and I told them, I don't know if they can do it no later than morning. But, yeah, I'm going go Sunday. What's today? 12-9. Oh, good. He did. Good job. It's Monday. Patrick has been updated. So, Patrick's going to get an email from me. This is calling as many times as possible. Oh, wow. Okay, so this feels like this is a second call response, a second.
01:00:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
again voice response it's going I know but but what he's saying is the adjuster says last time I gave you my top offer you sense of it yeah so this is this is a little bit training issue okay when big push and say you know look I need your absolute top top and then the adjuster says this is my top there's not a more and then they have someone else call it tends to piss them off okay so long-term strategy is it better for you to do that or it's generally better for us to do a second voice because the second voice makes more sense telling generally get more so they have to not the final push should not be as hard it's a case-by-case basis obviously too I mean it's not like this is the end all be all yes I get that okay so a couple of things first of all
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea with the attrition rate and the like the turnover rate is for adjusters?
01:01:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty high.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I imagine. Okay. So it really doesn't matter that you burn some of them. No. In this process.
01:01:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. But you don't want to get a reputation of, you know, not honoring things either. So, you know, they had to be little on how they work stuff.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, have you trained them? did you do that?
01:01:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
do people know how to be careful? We're working on that part. Yeah. Because they've had me call on some and then because she's like, I almost was my very top. There's not a penny more. So don't know why you're calling me. And so like I try to overcome it a little bit, but it definitely puts me not in the best position.
01:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So this goes back to we need to be tracking how much this is making us. And then you need to be tracking that over time because if it's shooting you in the foot over time.
01:01:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, it's definitely working.
01:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you please quantify that to sound like that?
01:01:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
mean, like, Tyler, I won't wear his top was 30 grand and she got 50 grand on two different cases. So, wow, $3,000 for the son of a man.
01:02:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we need at the very least a very simple case number date of the first negotiation, the first offer, and then the second voice date and the second offer. Can you put somebody on that to create it and have your team start filling it out? I mean, do you not want to know what that number is?
01:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You should. But I just I don't want to make it any more work than I already is for them.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. Oh, you cannot tell me you want to make $250 million a year and then tell me you don't want to do any more work.
01:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, for them, not for me.
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't care. Mark, you need people who are willing to do the work in order to get to $250 million a year.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
you understand that? Yeah, that's part of the fun growing area now.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so But you do have people, especially if they're getting incentive for it, and I Patrick, I'm read by the second voice.
01:03:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So that's what we're not incentivizing. The person who gets more on second voice.
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're doing it. doesn't matter. It doesn't matter here. Why? Because they're incentivized to do their best so that their their counterparts do their best because everybody gets on their own cases, right? So if somebody second voices for them, they get the benefit of it, but they need to do the same thing for other people. Otherwise, they're going to start sabotaging each other. So either way, it probably would make sense to incentivize that. But regardless, and maybe it's like a hidden, like maybe the team doesn't see it. They report it to America and America or they report it to you or they report it to me. don't care if you don't want to have certain people see it.
01:04:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
from Slack.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there's automations. There's, uh, there's, uh, the brick, if this or not, but, um, what the hell, Xavier? Xavier can do it, huh?
01:04:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me do that one out, but it's in Slack.
01:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Well, I'm like, I need to go, but I want to make these things happen. So, um, uh, second voice tracking. It's all. I don't suppose there's a, uh, Slack information that I can see and go get it for you.
01:04:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Whoever, whoever can do that, um, you should get that number because I think, number one, I just think you'd be excited about it, but you can report it to the team when you're ready to, especially if you want to wait until you have an internet program for it and maybe roll that out, but say, um, here's the, the deal if you want to make agreement. I don't know, because the intent of program needs to change and I don't know if we can do that. Whole different conversation way too late through the data field. All right, well, we've got our work cut out for us because it's huge. You know, 25 years. Okay, go get that tens machine. You would put it like all around that area. There's four pads you can put on. So, you can, it's really, really subtle. I don't have to like turn it up high or anything. Play around with the settings and you can just snap it on your belt and your pants and walk around with it and still go about your business. It will probably help within an hour and stay helping. Okay, yeah. I want you to feel better.
01:05:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Do it in your way. So, you're something like how it goes.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you. need to damage your kidneys because I can tell you how fun that knot is, is not whatever I can't think.
01:06:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, China wants to do trigger points, so yay.
01:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well do that and the tense. Okay. And then tell me that you feel better because I don't want you to feel better. Alright, have a good day, Mark.
01:06:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Enjoy.
01:06:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bye. Buppy. Yay, I don't want to think about it. When is she coming? He, um, the week of the 16th, they said sometime between that Wednesday, so the 18th and the 22nd. Okay. I'm gonna send pictures for it's good.
01:06:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would be offended if you did.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, pictures that it's coming, but also I'll still need running because he's a big flipper. You can't have too many dogs. They're all the therapy.
01:06:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's the best time.
01:06:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yes. Okay, bye. Okay, bye.
