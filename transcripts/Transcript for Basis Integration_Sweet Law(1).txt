Sorry, I just got off another call that took a way more time than I thought I was.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No soup for you. Okay.
00:01:09 - mark sweet (3)
That's one thing. Also our phone systems completely were out this morning and so that was fun. Something they can get paid I think at one point and that's why we know phones for a little while.
00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let me how that works.
00:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
That's bad. But, but we'll be lucky if we had 80 months of incidents.
00:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:34 - mark sweet (3)
The server is generally pretty low.
00:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it lower than normal?
00:01:41 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, we're at like 70.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:46 - mark sweet (3)
We have today, tomorrow. Six or two years out.
00:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was December of last year.
00:01:55 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, yeah, almost there for December.
00:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I know that I was just wondering like what the. Well, the number was anyway. Wait, did the password change again?
00:02:06 - Dan Ryan
It changes on its own.
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, all right.
00:02:11 - Dan Ryan
And then we never update it.
00:02:15 - mark sweet (3)
So whoever is the new Isaac.
00:02:18 - Dan Ryan
Probably, but I'm not sure who that is.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They've got well, since I only have Isaac's info. Can you help us with that?
00:02:30 - Dan Ryan
I can't.
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, not you, Mark.
00:02:33 - Dan Ryan
I've got no idea.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lisa.
00:02:51 - mark sweet (3)
The thing when we're to, we're just all staying here.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was waiting for an answer.
00:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
I can ask Paul.
00:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I get the new password, that's it for I for Norne.
00:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:03:30 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe?
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:03:34 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe? Ocebele? 23rd, 2024, yes.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we see. Actually, if it didn't change that much, I can just manually.
00:05:04 - mark sweet (3)
It's just an exclamation mark in there or something. You know, hopefully the right people this time.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, it looks the same.
00:05:15 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we'll sit as.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's okay. No, that's the same as what I have. It's just not working. So. Okay, well now it's letting me in. It literally didn't change anything. Last pass auto fill. That's the same thing. Okay, whatever. Whatever. All right, what was I doing dashboards. reports. I want retainers, wait, hold on, not recent, our reports. I don't know, Um, which report would I want just to get it for a specific month? All matters by, because I can change the time on it, right? By principle of turn now, I don't care about their turn. And they don't care if it's active. Let me show my screen because it's very quiet on your guys' side, how to you share a little puppy eating. is requesting a by-passes to my screen. Do you see my screen? Okay. if I wanted to see all the retainers we have for last December, it's a matter of report, right?
00:07:23 - Dan Ryan
No, because they're closed.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aren't they still called matters, though?
00:07:30 - Dan Ryan
just not. I don't know. Wouldn't they be close? Yeah, I guess. But they'd be closed. So you'd have to probably change the filter. Some might still be up and down.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then so it doesn't. So this is all matters by owner and status. It doesn't say open, right?
00:07:47 - Dan Ryan
These are active. We want it. Let's see what it's.
00:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:07:52 - Dan Ryan
All right. I am not a solidified person.
00:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't listen to Mark. I just want to see how many retainers we have last December.
00:08:10 - mark sweet (3)
So, that would be if you go into all reports and you look up, just type in month up on top. Month what step toward month.
00:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:25 - mark sweet (3)
And then go down to cases signed by month and source your month in state to want to get.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He says signed by month. Oh, that's older. My bad.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (3)
Sorry. Let me lower than that.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Case is signed by month and store source. Sure.
00:08:47 - mark sweet (3)
And then if you just want to get rid of the source, just to see like the total.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just hit edit.
00:08:56 - mark sweet (3)
And then just X out source. And then sit around. Don't hit save and run, just hit run, only. And scroll down.
00:09:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But okay, perfect. It's December.
00:09:12 - mark sweet (3)
Then if you want to see it in a chart up on top, you just change the chart type.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
72, okay. I just wanted to see the total number. Oh, this is really helpful. Where's the chart type? it's not on top, right? Almost there. There you go. Okay. Nope. Where?
00:09:33 - mark sweet (3)
Down, a little bit, here.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Okay. What the heck?
00:09:47 - mark sweet (3)
That's only turned everything over.
00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. So if you go on to edit again, and go on to filters.
00:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
And then change open data from all time to, is it only due January?
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. okay. Oh, there we go. So anyway, December last year was 72. But let's see, like, okay. So November of 2024 was 97, 2023 was 86 October or 69. So, yeah, so December is low for December.
00:10:58 - mark sweet (3)
So start December. or 2020. Go back into edit and just do starting after December 2020.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, open date. No filters. Oh, yeah. Okay.
00:11:11 - mark sweet (3)
just go for it says, yeah, then just do 12-1-1-1-1. No, because November 2020 is always shifted everything.
00:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. 12 got it. All right. then run, right? So, oh, here's what I want to do. So that was the first one. December 2020 was 20. 2021 was 44. 2022 was 58. And last year was 72. And then I just want to do October to October. October was 30, 30, 59, and then 69. And then November was 47, 59, and 97. Yeah, so this December is just so far. How many are out?
00:12:18 - mark sweet (3)
So there's 70 signed and six left out.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Well, still better than last year if they're actually signed. And well, if they got signed by tomorrow, otherwise, they wouldn't count for this month, right?
00:12:41 - mark sweet (3)
Well, it's not great. I'm trying to guess to at least 80. So it's not such a.
00:12:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's interesting looking at these numbers this way. And then go look through, let's see. Just. So we can just kind of see the whole year at a glance right there. Now those numbers have definitely changed a lot. I mean, I already knew that, but still just kind of seeing them like that. Okay, so let's talk about. Get on my way screen. Okay. Um, leads, Dan, are you still running out? So we talked about changing the budget, but also it's December. I think you said you weren't going to do it until the beginning of the year. I'm not sure if I remember that right, but.
00:13:37 - Dan Ryan
I've spent many, many hours doing some research. I can play that. Nothing to report, but I don't come. Uh, yeah, so I did a bunch and now I got a, I'm going to go back. I looked at Valiant. I looked at some other people and now I'm going to go dig into the tier 11. data for a little bit, and then dig into the data from the ads that I ran, and then I'm probably going to have Abhishek and BJA change the landing page so it's more in line sort with what they did just to sort of remove that variable. Yep, that's it.
00:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remove the variable of what?
00:14:30 - Dan Ryan
Uh, just the variable that like, oh, it's a different landing page.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the landing page.
00:14:34 - Dan Ryan
Okay. Yep. Like this morning, I was talking to my partner, Jeff, he's like, we're going to do this on the bottom landing page. I'm like, no, not. Like, no, we're not doing that. We're going to add one thing to the landing page that's sold three million dollars worth of . not changing it. Slow down. Yeah, but we can. go, yeah, we could. We're not.
00:15:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's crazy.
00:15:03 - Dan Ryan
I'm like, I'm going to try to, you know, mirror what they're doing. That man's like, there's someone else doing it. can't remember the name of the site. But I did. I did say, dude, the amount of money potentially that Wilshire spends on ads is ridiculous. And then your boy, Steve is buying the dumbest keywords. I'm like, it's unreal. But whatever for example, lawyer, uh, Steve's by well, Steve's not buying lawyer that Wilshire is buying lawyer. I'm like, Oh my God. Um, and then, but you have like a wide area like our accident lawyer, like, is not a good keyword.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is Wilshire only a PI or does he have more areas of practice?
00:15:56 - Dan Ryan
They're all really more areas.
00:15:58 - mark sweet (3)
They do some for the employment stuff, but not everything. They don't do divorce, they don't do things that would make this make sense.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would we go though if it's negative, if he negative matches? So like let's say he has lawyer, but he negative match civil attorney or child custody, that type of thing.
00:16:26 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, but you're just, it's just such a horrible idea because you're just opening up, you'd have to negative match forever.
00:16:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It would never end.
00:16:39 - Dan Ryan
It would just never end, but that's someone probably getting paid a percentage of ads binned.
00:16:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, the Google helps them.
00:16:52 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, it's not someone that cares because don't care how much money it ends. And no one's doing the out. There's no way. Well, I mean, that's what happened with Steve and Mark sort of in the beginning. Steve thought he could go around Google ads like he did before. like, um, I don't think it's going to go the way you think it's going to go. And it didn't.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So from your research, I mean there, what's that? Well, after having done your research now, is there a like a specific course that you've plotted out to take?
00:17:33 - Dan Ryan
mean, they look it looks like they're doing. It's it's like accident report slash police report. More so action report with what's really interesting is like, I subscribe to like five spy tools and then use them for free trials. Oops. Um, valiant. and somebody else does such, even though it's not low volume, we know they're spending 30 grand a month. tools came back zero. They had zero data. They couldn't tell me that they were running in the ads. I was like, well, I know they're running ads. So that's the whole thing. you can't necessarily trust these spy tools, because when they're telling me zero, and I know for a fact it's 30 grand, I'm like, okay, so how about how much can I trust what I'm seeing? That's the problem is like, that you can't trust the data. can only trust the data that you create, sadly, but I'm just trying to get like in the neighborhood. they seem to be in the, I can't imagine. I mean, maybe it is police reports. I don't know. mean, like, I don't know why someone would search, a police report. Oh, definitely.
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Like, they want to know going on. want to happen to one of the other people that wants information.
00:18:58 - Dan Ryan
Right. But where are they getting? for accident report not knowing what that is really because maybe yeah I don't know I don't know I mean if I wonder how many of their leads the police were at the scene because I was in an accident no cops I'm gonna have to go look at that but anyway so it's around those sort of two keywords but I ran accident report and it was like getting flooded with help so much help and I was like oh this is too much help and but in doing that I bought bunch of data to slow down the help and I think if I just isolate the keywords to like just a metro area then I can sort of quell it a little more because yeah I mean that would be the way to do it.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I didn't even know that, like, when you get in an accident, you're supposed to file a police report.
00:21:05 - mark sweet (3)
I'm hearing a bad one. The cops come to you.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:21:10 - mark sweet (3)
You get in a bad collision. cops come to be supposed to be towed and everything else.
00:21:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that makes sense. So, like, I was in one and I didn't even know and I didn't file it. then I found out later when my daughter was in one and she was the one to blame. So, like, for me, I'm like, well, didn't feel like whatever. It just didn't occur to me, also because I hadn't been on a wreck, that if somebody hit me and it was everybody was fine, that I still needed to make a police report. But anyway, I'm just saying, like, for the search term, for anybody that knows, maybe the question is, do I have to follow police report, but they just type in, I don't know, like, just trying to speculate. Well, I they type in.
00:21:53 - Dan Ryan
That's the beauty, right? can tell you what they type in and I can tell you which ones they're clicking on. Like, I'll give you a perfect example. Well, lots of people search for accident report, blah, blah, accident report today. I'm willing to bet that that person was not in a car accident.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. That's an attorney or a bot or something.
00:22:16 - Dan Ryan
It's somebody news. I don't know who somebody is looking. They want accident report information for the day, but then multiply that by every city in the state of Arizona, because they're doing it too. Phoenix accident reports today and you're like, Oh, boy, this get right. So that's the sort of help that you get. Yeah, it's in the neighborhood, but at, you know, four bucks a click. No, thanks.
00:22:44 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, My firm is literally just PPC insurance company names. So like, I go planes. Progressive claims and gang people call in.
00:24:00 - Dan Ryan
Well, the good thing is that when you're operating at like a value level, what else I'm telling right now, they can't figure it out. There's none of these spy tools show value at all, not one.
00:24:15 - mark sweet (3)
But don't forget, 25 of us are listening to where the leads are going.
00:24:21 - Dan Ryan
No, that's happening right now, but it doesn't show you the keywords. Right. Yeah, so it will show you the ads and you can kind of, I use that for value too. I've read their ads and I'm like, all right, can kind of guess what keyword they're going after by looking at their title. But even that, you know, lot of the ads were similar. I was like, well, we'll see. I could look at those like, how often do they add mention police? If they don't mention police there, like, they're probably not targeting that keyword. You're going to take another one. with myself.
00:25:01 - mark sweet (3)
Did Kurt ever back to you on Bing?
00:25:05 - Dan Ryan
He did. He said, he knew about it.
00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I knew about one specifically.
00:25:19 - Dan Ryan
Bing using GPD results or do you think he did it the other way around? Yeah, he said, it relied Bing relied. Well, Chagibati relies on Bing results. We started checking rankings on Bing and our look in our hook in Bing's Webmaster Tools for further optimizations. In the next weeks, we should have it in they have their own rank tracker software that we're plugged into. So they're going to have that baked into their software through, they call it, AcuRinker. So yeah, they're on top of Okay. This is interesting because they didn't have any tools and now they're like, oh, we better go build some big tools.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, what's good though is that we've got people paying attention to the changes that are happening in the area of expertise that we're hiring them for. Oh, yeah. That's always important when we're looking at just working with anyone, period.
00:26:34 - Dan Ryan
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good. So you currently have ads running, are you in a building phase first in prep?
00:26:49 - Dan Ryan
No, I don't have any other running. I haven't totally decided my strategy yet.
00:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:56 - Dan Ryan
And I'm going to get those guys to do the different landing page.
00:26:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go. Guys, no, I wish I can be there. Oh, I wish I can. Okay. Okay.
00:27:10 - mark sweet (3)
We talk about when or it's free dot com.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When or it's free dot com. What do you want to put there? Have we like we haven't specified anything yet, right?
00:27:33 - mark sweet (3)
I don't know if we just want to just make our website. What we want to do to it, but I would like to. Get that going. So next year, when we do more traditional advertising on that name, we have a website and we'll search for that. They find us, et cetera, et cetera.
00:27:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I bet we can find a site. Okay, so first of all, we got the idea because Josh had at the bottom something very similar, and then anyway, we had this whole conversation going back, but I got it from something he has in there, and it was like, win or don't pay, something like that. And anyway, somebody probably has a site that we could get some data on and see how it's doing and if it's doing well, kind of takes some of the winning elements that we might think. We don't know, but we guess, maybe like, I see what you're talking about. Okay. What's Josh's last name? What was it?
00:28:38 - Dan Ryan
Walter.
00:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Walter.
00:28:42 - Dan Ryan
Like, this was for one of the meetings I wasn't there for.
00:28:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I was an email thread when...
00:28:48 - mark sweet (3)
About Josh's thing or?
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like... It came from Josh's thing. I don't see the... That's what I'm trying to do.
00:28:56 - mark sweet (3)
It did.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It did. Because you were sending there was a whole e-mort that thread and you were doing that it was in the it started with the Sweet Caroline sweet loss something like that, but sweet Caroline right We were going back and forth about that and then you had some other ideas and then I said something or whatever and anyway When are you jumping you you had something anyway Josh also had it in there? So maybe it didn't come from that, but there's a correlation that I noticed They have it too, and that's my point is that other people have something similar Maybe we can do some research and see if there's a Um a site that we can model after that's doing well when or you don't pay the attorney Hold on not now go away What the heck is Josh's email? Then I can find it That's where I saw it. Josh.
00:30:06 - Dan Ryan
Oh, first. K. W. A. R. T. L.
00:30:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Love you.
00:30:14 - Dan Ryan
Just came from com.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, quote. welcome. Okay. We fight. We went. That's what is different. Okay. And that's not even.
00:30:36 - Dan Ryan
I don't remember that.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's at the bottom of his thing. We fight. We win. And that's what I thought of when Mark said, when are it's free? Something like that. Whatever. When are it's free? When are you don't pay?
00:30:53 - Dan Ryan
Oh, yeah.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like their vanity domain that they're redirecting to their site. Yeah. Well, anyway, what I was wondering is like do are there any sites using something like that that We can model after but I don't know You have an SDM Russia count No But a a heriffs Can we find any like high-performing landing pages for PI attorneys I mean you wouldn't know if they were What they were well, so like if we did what one's where I thought that turned into SDM rush But I don't know but basically some of the tools that we can find the ads that run on repeat and assume that Any law firm running it had that's what I did.
00:31:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I did that with what I was just saying well the like Morgan and Morgan and But there's not right. That's the problem with these guys. They spend a shitload of money. It doesn't mean it's working. That damn I mean issue is this.
00:32:10 - mark sweet (3)
I feel like it's almost missing the point. We're going to run TV radio with this name, right?
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what my point, Marco, is there anything that we can think that we might model after rather than starting from scratch? Um, that is very specific to that type of phrasing winner. It's free. that's a specific specific value. Right. Can we have a specific call to action? Like are there specific elements that we can use to put on that landing page to build the brand around to have the best odds of success from the jump?
00:33:00 - Dan Ryan
You I mean, in legal. mean, don't know anyone that's, I mean, that's the thing. No one's necessarily nailed it. But I guess that's what it comes down to. It's like, what, what, you just want to tie it to the advertisement, right? So what's, or you'd want to go, you years and years ago, I had this concept I used to call it clicks to bricks. And it was like, you know, your website to your, to your physical store. And it's like, okay, so here you're going, you're advertising to your website, but do you figure out your call to action or your brand, whatever you want to call it. And then you're pushing that message towards the television so that when the television, so you have this coherence between the add that's on television to them where they go after that, right? So the after the click, just like you would a landing page, right? If you run an ad on Facebook and blah, blah, you want there to be a throughput from the click to the landing page. Here, you would want throughput from the commercial to essentially type in traffic where they go, we went and where we're in. So I guess it's really like, what is the messaging of the ad going to be? And then you say, okay, great, because that's kind of where we're starting. The messaging of the ad is going to be this, therefore the site should be that. And it's just an extension of whatever that is. So it's figuring out, is that the domain name? Yes, okay, What is the call to action? And then what are you going to be saying in the commercial? And then you're just going to be echoing that on the landing page, and you're not going to be sending them to a law firm site unless That's what you're doing in the commercial.
00:35:03 - mark sweet (3)
So what is what's going to happen in the commercial? When are three is going to be the call to action to it has to listen to a law firm because it has be on TV and every state's getting weird. Some of these get more weird about advertising sites versus for sites. And when you're just doing digital, it's a different thing than what you're doing TV TV. We're painting a, you know, carried on our back. So it's going to list us. We're going to be on it. It's not going be different than who we are. But my issue is that people see the name. They may remember the name, but they're more than likely going to Google it instead of kind of call it fun.
00:35:42 - Dan Ryan
I'm a big seer here. That's going to be taken care of.
00:35:45 - mark sweet (3)
they Google this, we're as high up as awesome.
00:35:52 - Dan Ryan
When they Google winner at spring, correct. Yeah, you're going to get two types of traffic. You're going to get type in traffic, which is they. literally we'll type in winneritsfree.com and then that shows up in Google Analytics is like a slash it's like yeah they just went directly to the home page and that's the only way that can happen and then you'll have in like Google search console people typing in winneritsfree. So to SEO for that term yeah you'd have to get a side up now but then it's like what do you want that to look like what's the brand what's the like you got to start working on that okay we can do it that's what I would like to spend some on because yeah the domains I know what we're going to do next year I'd like to build around it but I know we need to have the digital stuff done first before spending a bunch of money on the traditional yeah and then you can but then you also have to think about like okay what is the I get what you're saying about like it It doesn't have to be a lawyer commercial right in your in your traditional way I think what lawyers tend to do or have tended to do is They just go it's it's they just copy what the other guy's doing and they assume it works and then We know they don't do the math so they don't actually know if it works and it they so they see I mean I'm telling right now the originator is Jim Suckaloff that dude started the whole god damn thing in the 70s in Boston and he would run the commercials with the Angelines lights were the beginning of the commercial if you've been in an accident and everybody's been doing that since and It yeah, it does work sometimes But no one really knows the math. Do you have to do it that way? I mean you can And maybe you do maybe you do a version of it. That's that and then you just go well that didn't work So great now I'm gonna switch up the website and switch up the messaging. And you just just keep a congruence between those two things. So the question would be, what are you gonna what do you want to do as far as the the branding and imaging of this if it went or it's free the first go around like version 1.0. And if you pull together like some ideas on that, then we'll have Greg design some and go from there.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I started building a brand board. Yes, that's good. So chat GBT and quad both had different questions and approaches. I really like using the two at the same time because just sometimes the the clarity, the simplicity and the focus different between the two, there's one always add something that the other forgot and So combining them is helpful. So like can you both see my screen? Yes, but I have an ambulance going by Thinking of lawyers So what I first said was this is what we're building when arts free We're personal injury law firm when arts free we need to be compliant with ethics and laws But want to make the site compelling using powerful psychology and advertising techniques in order to attract clients What questions should we be asking ourselves and what you do this and what approach should we take so? These are some of the things that you already go through your head mark, but it helps us to Just all kind of add to it and make sure that we're thinking about it and the language that we use Who's the ideal client demographics pain points? That's something that we could be building that advertor avatar like we talked about it before but AI has evolved so much since we started working together that we can kind of create a project in both chat UBT and cloud to kind of be an accelerant to the conversations that we have weekly anyway where just kind of as we start having the conversations I'll add them to the project folders to make it more I don't just get like I said an accelerant to the conversations. This is something that's important what's like in marketing we call it a USP right what's your unique selling point what's different about sweet law it's not going to be different from everybody all the time but there are the caring right client care there's different things that we could point out and highlight and it's on the client to go do the research and whether they believe it or not but we're going to assume that It's gonna work the way most things do is some people just read it and it will resonate and they will Believe it and feel like they can trust it and they'll call you So but then there's other things and this is kind of Dan's domain. That's automatically taken care of is it easy to navigate mobile friendly? Optimized that is there The call to action is not winner. It's free. That's that's the benefit And that's like that's a value the call to action would be call us now, right? And just just to be clear that when or it's free is not a call to action Contact forms usual. Okay, so social proof. don't know what you're able to do here and Have testimonials you can do that right or can you not? Your testimonials, okay, I wasn't sure just with the like what claims you can have and say Clear expectations, so then they say some things the same, but different. So, Claude was just lead with empathy. This is something I think that your team is really good at. It would be great too, if some of the testimonials that we have really speak to this. There's always testimonials with turning at credentials. They will talk about old cards and credentials. So, clear path to action, make it extremely easy to schedule a free consultation, get immediate answers which we have through lead flowing, right? And understand, and I think this is probably a clear thing, the win or it's free promise in detail. I don't know if that's standard with everybody. How standard is that?
00:42:48 - mark sweet (3)
I feel like it is standard. What's that? It's real differentiator.
00:42:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what?
00:42:55 - mark sweet (3)
It's not a different. Everyone who does contingency fee work, that's literally what that means.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what I thought, but but I don't know how many people know that. So it's still right.
00:43:07 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, right.
00:43:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's still very compelling. So we want to make sure that we use the language that just is focusing on what it is not saying, you know, where the only ones that can do it, but that, but this is what's on the table and yeah. So what we could create out of this is kind of a form basically that you fill out that then we give Dan that answers these questions. some of these Dan might already know who's Dan, you end up writing copy, don't you?
00:43:48 - Dan Ryan
Yep.
00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I could do is kind of combine the two of these and turn it into a form. I could fill out know what versions I know, and then, uh, or just give it to you, Mark, you fill out things, then we hand it to Dan, Dan, you say, okay, I actually still need some other things, and then put it together with, with this, but some of the questions will be around, like, I think your language, Mark, for, um, what, what makes Sweet Loss stand out, and then providing some specific testimonials to the points that we're making would be the best benefit, and then we can ask both of these four ideas on visualization that, um, the points home that we're making, but how does that sound for our initial strategy?
00:44:46 - mark sweet (3)
Also, we're just over the website structure and what not to make technical SEO perspective.
00:44:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like, Dan, to just handle that, what, what do we need to talk about to have that, um,
00:45:00 - mark sweet (3)
just need an info back then.
00:45:05 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, we need to, I mean, the we just need to build the site and then probably get links around that keyword. So get good to go out and just buy a link thing off him and go. Hey, go get linking with this phrase. So it's going to be a low competition phrase. So to know competition.
00:45:25 - mark sweet (3)
So until we start doing it and I know we have higher competition.
00:45:29 - Dan Ryan
But yeah, but having the exact match domains, huge benefit.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:45:36 - mark sweet (3)
And then you don't have any bad links, we don't have bad strategy. We have a chance to start from scratch, which is good and bad.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:45:43 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I mean, I think it's more important. It's it's getting people to the site from the ads, right? That's like the SEO comes after no matter what, but you could start seeding it now, but that's your. presuming that that that TV part is going to work and which is fine and then with enough money and time it will I mean yeah and then I think you use probably like a story brand set up so you know instead of leading with the lawyers it's like you're leading with the benefits for them so it's I and and maybe you you hit them with I don't know if you want to go this explicit but it would essentially work car accident only right because you we know from the current website from the current phone calls my landlord is threatening to blah blah blah so it's like you're gonna get that so you just you try to eliminate them in the commercial and in the thing that would be a matter of what's allowable right so like you probably can't say I'm assuming you can't say we're car accident experts cuz I'm states going to be like, you can't say expert. But so figure out what the language is around making that declarative statement so that it's in the commercial, so that you're repelling the people, repelling the look you lose. And then it's just repeated on the website. And then the website follows more of a story brand thing where it's like, hey, here's what we're about. And then it's like, here's what I can do for you. And then at the bottom, it's like, here's your lawyer. You just sort of make the presumptive thing or your claim guide, and it's Mark. And then maybe below Mark, you put the other lawyers. But it's like lawyer last, but everyone's always lawyer first. And it's like, yeah, we get it. Sweet look, OK, got it. We got it. And then story brand is like, that's easy to talk to GPT about. And if you don't, if you give it the book ahead of time, which I can, or I can give it to anybody. right? You feed it the book and make sure it knows the book and then you tell what you're trying to do and then say, what do you need for me? then it'll ask you like 10 questions and you just answer them all. And then you, I mean, I've done this a bunch of times that I tell the layout of the page and say, okay, the later the later the page is called to action stats, pop, pop, pop, and then it'll spit out around the content. You're like, all right, let's go.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's basically what I'm starting to create. And I could even have it post a form that we could just give tomorrow. Either way, it'll be questioned. so that's what I'll do to start with and just kind of see if it can help facilitate it so that you're not the one having to spend all your time on it down since you're already going to be.
00:48:45 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, definitely like talking to you about like, hey, this is what we're trying to avoid. We get a lot of people that a lot of inquiries from people in areas of the law that are outside of what we do and it would be interesting to see. Like, I need a tagline to dissuade them, or I need something that, so that I'm explicit about what we do that would act as a, you know, repellent for lack of a better term.
00:49:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's clutch, sorry, it's just that, so if you, we need the things that cause us to not win the case, right? So if you got in an accident three months ago and haven't seen a doctor, we're not going to win, probably, right? Those types of things.
00:49:35 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, you do that in the form though. I would just use the form for that.
00:49:40 - mark sweet (3)
No, the biggest issue is, you know, the guarantee is only if we accept your case. We don't need to get in the specifics.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:49:49 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. only win or three is if you hire us, we want you, right?
00:49:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you want to talk to everybody just in case, right?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
And you have to have a disclaimer. Yes, absolutely that our guarantee is only if we accept your case Just because we don't accept your case is we don't have a valid case But our guarantee is only if we win your case if we accept it don't accept it.
00:50:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can't for you I would assume that that's a no-brainer, but like I thought yeah other goal issues stupid people I hate It's free cuz you didn't win my kid.
00:50:32 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:50:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't do on your case. I don't use only anything All right, so I I will send over some things for you to fill out, but I'll include you Dan so you can tell me if I've missed something that you want to have But I'll do my best to be thorough to minimize with what you've got to do since you already kind of have a lot to do on it I
00:51:00 - Dan Ryan
There used to be, I'm like, I'm, I'm, the more I sit here and stew on this idea. like, Oh, this is it.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like building like a sellable brand. Um, I wonder to know, I know, because I don't have teams on either one of these AI things that would be cool to work together, but we can just do it through calls and emails. Um, let me go to, let's see. Just I'm looking at the topics of stuff that we're working on and talking about. Um, the leads and review system, is there anything there that we should be talking about?
00:51:41 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, I'm noticing my team more to your view, more than sure down the scene.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pretty massive increase in the number of change.
00:52:00 - Dan Ryan
in Google reviews?
00:52:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:02 - Dan Ryan
I don't track that.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who tracks it?
00:52:09 - Dan Ryan
No idea.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, it was kind of a questionable review.
00:52:16 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, Michelle can tell you how much we paid out for Google reviews.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we don't currently have a system or accountability, whatever, owner for tracking Google reviews?
00:52:31 - Dan Ryan
No, no, it's I wonder if there's a tool that would be interesting to see if they're going up over time. Looking for one right now. There's got to be someone that does this.
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So for the task of making a more compassionate death blog, that's being worked on. We're not finished though, right?
00:53:09 - Dan Ryan
No, that's done.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is done. Um, Missouri office situation, Mark.
00:53:18 - mark sweet (3)
I dropped the wall on that one. I definitely got to try it by way to make things.
00:53:22 - Dan Ryan
Did you leave it in Japan or did you bring the ball with you to make it back to the States?
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it's somewhere in the skies.
00:53:29 - Dan Ryan
Nice.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to pick that ball back up again and when?
00:53:35 - mark sweet (3)
I apologize. That is my fault.
00:53:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that doesn't answer my question.
00:53:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. I will pick up the ball and I will make sure it's When is your target?
00:53:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:53:55 - mark sweet (3)
Only because I'm gone the ninth to the 17th.
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, did we get Josh all the financial data that he needs yet?
00:54:10 - mark sweet (3)
The last note, have the degree when we switched everything.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then talking about the automations to following up with doctor's offices, cloning your number, that type of thing that conversation we've been working on. Touchpot?
00:54:34 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, it's ready to go. So we just need to start plotting out the events and probably give them tests and what not. But I mean, the core function is there. So it's like Mark said last week, oh, maybe it'd be over 45 days, but it's like, is it gonna be over 45 days? gonna throw in all the holidays, like whatever. We just have to sort of plot out a timeline, if you will. and say it's these these events on this time, you know, and this is the timeline.
00:55:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you have a set of questions or should we I don't know, just give that to Mark and say, hey, how would you like this to go? Or I can run the scenario also through AI and just say this is the goal, can you make some suggestions and then it help us to create the, you know, conversation from there rather than blank page.
00:55:32 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, no, I got nothing. I just we just need to like, I don't even really know what the goal is, right? wasn't, I sort of do, but I mean, that was a conversation I wasn't around for. So it's like, okay, you want to stay up a mind and all I know is top of mind every 45 days and it's like, okay, great. then it would be, if you want to run holiday, so yeah, you could throw it into AI and then it would be The idea of, you know, not repeating the same message over and over, so it's like, then you, let's say you come up with 60 events that would be like, okay, we need to feed it 60 sort of feed or phrases for the AI to say, hey, you're going to send a variation of this. Yes, right, we can't give it. Hey, it's Mark. Hope everything's going well. 60 times because it's going to probably start to sound repetitive.
00:56:34 - mark sweet (3)
No, it needs to be a little heavy.
00:56:37 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, so we have to give it 60. Obviously, if it's a holiday, I'm just going to keep going to that one. Right? Happy Valentine's Day, not that you're sending that one. But, you know, it's like, okay, great. But if it's these other, these 45-day touches, we need 60 variation, again, if it's 60. We need 60, which AI can also do.
00:58:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird, because it says I'm not signed in the Zoom, but then I'm clearly am because I'm using it and the account is just being glitchy. So wait, let me go back to my thingy, that's the right one, oh it's one o'clock. Are you having your other meetings, Dan?
00:58:32 - Dan Ryan
I don't know, I'm really not on the ball today, so. Okay, I'm wearing a Missouri office, talked about that, we talked about about this, it'll be very short. I'm going to go see if they're having it.
00:58:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks everyone.
00:58:48 - Dan Ryan
Bye.
00:58:49 - mark sweet (3)
Bye. Bye bye.
00:58:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just about to to you next year.
00:58:55 - mark sweet (3)
Um, second boys tracking.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it's like, oh, yeah, we need to set that up. Who's going to own second voice tracking? Or do you need help sending something up?
00:59:13 - mark sweet (3)
I need help setting something up. I'm trying to make up a way that's simple.
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I didn't, I wasn't successful at it because Slack was being glitchy. found out that it was slacked on my programming last week because anyway, I did, went to their support. But what I was working on setting up is a local AI Slack box. I don't know if there's one that's already built in, but then there probably is. Anyway, we could build, we could probably do some sort of like AI extraction that can integrate with your Slack that will help. view with this task without it having to be manual. If you could send um maybe and they can be redacted if you need to have certain information take out but screenshots of the kind of information where this is happening in Slack so that I could try to create some sort of assistant to help you with it if you like okay so will you get that to me and if so when okay yeah we got the channel on second voice so i think that's probably the easiest way to do it. it's a channel on second voice i'm going to email you real quick and tell you to send that to me a second voice channel on those. Okay, I think, whoa, how did that change the whole foods market? don't even, that's just really, sweet, turn in the whole foods market. That's weird. All right, send that to you. All right, so I've got two other AI programming things to work on for you. It wears the other one, hold on. Oh, it's winner, it's free. All right, that's everything I have for today. Is there anything else you want to discuss or put on the docket for next week? No. Okay. I've already been checking in on Chona today and super overwhelmed. Huh?
01:02:41 - mark sweet (3)
Super overwhelmed.
01:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna keep encouraging her to push through because right now that's really the only thing that's going to fix it. And if vacation wasn't rejuvenating or relaxing enough, the one thing I did tell her, and this is good. and be a really important strategy through any kind of sprints, first of all, always remember how differently you're wired, so what works for you isn't what works for her for the most part, but in terms of managing energy frequency of resets are going to be important, so they can't be big, right? Because that just takes up too much time, but little one, so little instead of like whole spa days, just a really good massage, even if she gets it like every other day. Any type of thing that is a specific chona kind of energy help and aid, not just the shopping stuff, but like the other kind of luxury things that she likes to do, you can only do nails so often, and petties so often, and hair so often, but massages, maybe light therapy. sessions, things like that, frequency should help with the energy. As long as it's one of the things that she really thoroughly enjoys. Like I said, it has to be manageable, has to be a one to two-hour type of thing, maybe two or three times a week. This is hypothetical, don't know for sure. But my theory is that that would help her not quite feel as overwhelmed, give her something to look forward to. So she's drawing energy from the looking forward to it, and then something to release the stress out of her body so that she's reset for going back to it. And then if she's doing that with also hopefully not doing sabotaging things like eating too much ice cream or something that just really drained energy. So the biggest ways that you can support her is redirecting her to the things that she loves and that generates energy and helping her without shame or judgment lean away from the things that take away her energy. So like just a reminder of like, you know, that thing that you're about to do might actually make you more tired might actually set you back more if we did X instead. But I think this will get through it. I think the emotional aspect is she prone to I didn't I didn't ask her, I need to ask her, seasonally affected depression.
01:05:40 - mark sweet (3)
Where you guys are not a big deal, but more she looks, how do you go on fast? Like long term fast and she believes that they really can help her. The issue is which plus is the minus is the fastest of course. Energy is a huge issue and you just don't have as much energy. So you'll say you're more clear headed some don't and that's, you know, we can have separately. I have a lot of communities on it, but I think everyone agree that your amount of energy that you have is going to be significant less.
01:06:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it depends on who you are. Like some people will get more energy. There's nothing to support, but if you're pre-diabetic, right? So if you have glucose issues, it could backfire. It can also backfire if you're a peri-vanopausal and that can start as early as early 30s. So if she's going to- I'm just saying it as a fact. No, I believe it because that used to happen to me. So fasting support. So if you do that, then can you find her like an amazing nutritionist that she could talk to? who can help her figure out her own chemistry and say maybe that's not the best thing for you or if it is here are the things that you need to take while you're fasting.
01:07:14 - mark sweet (3)
I could try whether she's gonna listen to me or not as a older story.
01:07:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay well I can talk to her about it I just have to figure out how to get to so we'll just start having conversations about how she spends her time. I'll I'll her about nutrition and things like that.
01:07:31 - mark sweet (3)
She's exhausted and miserable when she does it. She's trying to lose weight doing it and it doesn't work. She's tried it and it just doesn't work and it's very frustrating for me to see it. It's like you do some six times and each time you end up getting more weight and you're miserable to deal with. Maybe we don't do that. We eat more protein and less sugar and go that route.
01:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Strength training actually was the thing for me. I used to overdo it at the gym all the time.
01:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
Recommendations weren't going out and the building's not going out, which is bad. problematic. So I'll just take it over. do it. like, again, while you're saying it, understand why I try to do right now. That's not going to work long term.
01:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so it's ridiculous and processes.
01:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
She keeps saying she understands, but then I end up writing up a checklist for her. That is definitely some of your very, very good at and would immediately make her life easier because you've got some new and they have a checklist to follow the chance that success is much, much higher.
01:09:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I don't know if she could move her call up from Wednesday till tomorrow. So if not, then I'll do it through text support. We'll see text, not text support, but I can help work on that. So we'll focus on and checklists and just making sure and I'll teach her. know she knows the 80 20 rule, but sometimes we can use a perspective about how to apply it to certain types of things like delegation. and it's not actually faster if you do it yourself, not in the long run, right? But also what we really need to know is Bella the person for the job just because Cheryl hired her, hired her doesn't mean she is, and just because she does things wrong doesn't mean she's not, we actually have to have everything set up correctly in order to find out what's true, and that's not a Bella issue yet.
01:10:28 - mark sweet (3)
This is either Dr. E or Cheryl didn't end it out. Bella's not even in charge of that stuff yet. Oh, okay. Bella hasn't done as far as I'm concerned like they haven't had her start with anything.
01:10:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:10:41 - mark sweet (3)
It's definitely not an issue. It's a they just don't have great structure issue and they're used to insurance companies move more slowly and so it's just different and it's hard when you have two ships going very different speeds I guess for like a better term or one port with two different kind of boats. I don't know the best metaphor, but I think you get what I'm saying. Yeah. And I think that's what she's struggling. so I know she's going to get very, very, very frustrated because I think everyone gets very frustrated at that point. Or it's like, just do what I'm trying to get done, know, of thing, like we all get there. And so I think that's going to be for a big struggle and really she's going to need your help on the checklist and stuff, more than anything.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. All right. I will message her. I just gave myself hours worth of what?
01:11:42 - mark sweet (3)
And like her taxes and doing some of the basic stuff she needs to do. So that's a simple issue.
01:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, let me, I'm going to, I got to go back and extract these notes so I can have a checklist for myself with a thing.
01:11:56 - mark sweet (3)
Her accounting person today. I got some clarity on some of the things that she wants and needs.
01:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's, that's the whole part of like the holistic approach and, you know, you and I don't have a whole lot of those conversations because you have very clear what you will and won't talk about. It's definitely going to be open, more open to some of those things.
01:13:16 - mark sweet (3)
think there are better care I saw across two or three years I did before that play, margin.
01:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm glad.
01:13:24 - mark sweet (3)
Like peptides, like anything and everything else, it's in the doctor's room, it's regularly, it's in weight, eating healthier, the chef exactly what to make.
01:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't share those things with me, so I don't know. So I'm really, really glad to hear that because those things are amazing because I need the energy.
01:13:43 - mark sweet (3)
need, you know, not feel like crap, but talked to my IT then, you know, it's just been painful for the last three weeks.
01:13:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'll tell you why that's good for me because like I can tell that your energy shifted, but I couldn't tell what it was.
01:13:58 - mark sweet (3)
I didn't know if it was you talking. to the guy that you were talking to, and just. I don't know, too, though.
01:14:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm sure it's a whole bunch of things. That is the whole reason in what I do is a holistic approach. It doesn't mean that I'm the catalyst or the part of all of it, but just knowing that all of those things make an impact, you did it, which is a testament to your approach to things, too. But it's just good to know. Also, because, let's say, you're doing those things, and I don't know, and you fall off the wagon, and you stop doing those things. then I'm like, what the hell is up with Mark's energy? totally reverted, and I have no idea why. Now, it's up to you, what you want to share or not share, but even just touching those points, like, I've been investing in myself doing these types of things. I didn't know you were taking the peptides, and both those have massive impact on energy, cellular regeneration, health, long-term. longevity, all of these things, mental function. So that makes a lot of sense. And then combined with the therapy, you know, and the person you were talking to, that's powerful, but it's foundational because everything that we do is running through Mark Sweet, right? Everything that you are made up of. And when you improve that makeup, which is what you were doing with those things and whatever else that you're doing, that has so much more of a bigger impact. so just knowing that number one, not just that you're open to doing them, but you're doing them is huge because then I know that I don't know, it helps me understand how much work you're willing to do. And it would change maybe how I feel about some of the goals. questions that you have. Because in the beginning, you deflected so many things. And now you are so much more open to just knowing that to get to where you want to go, you have to do work. But also knowing that you understand that that work isn't just systems and teams and people, but it's your, your person physically and mentally and all of that changes what I think that I'm working with, if that makes sense.
01:16:32 - mark sweet (3)
It does. And it looked to keep up with the schedule that I've decided that this is what I need to do, which has been excessive to be frank with you, especially last couple of months. Just like everybody could traveling with something else, like I have to have a fairly high level of energy and we're able to do those things.
01:16:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
And I have to have routine at that process. And if I want Chona to change, and then be better, I have to always let the example right?
01:17:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yep, that's how I have to be for my family. I'm the one that can and will so I have to because nothing's happening if I don't do it and model it. I got 10 minutes before I have to meet with Fuji and I have a question, it's been kind of avoiding asking it because it's my fault that I wasn't clear enough because I I'm going to do the you know long type what do you call it invoice but but there was so much back and forth me trying to figure out how to even ask for it the beginning I'm like well you can do it to my time and whatever so I will make this too crazy for you whatever you want to do well what I wanted to ask was it can any of that be like a years worth of working for chona instead of just a loan and I'm earning it or does that feel like it renegs on what I was asking to get you to say yes in the first place because they don't want to be out of integrity.
01:18:13 - mark sweet (3)
So the money that I paid usually you're worth the china or the interest that you were thinking about however can what I'm saying can any of it be? Oh yeah no look if you want to I think it's the best, fairest thing because the china things can't work on little more time than I thought it would be whatever you were going to pay is like the return or interest or whatever you want to call it whatever you're doing with china call that even so it doesn't look like might like principle back I think it's fine.
01:18:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay yes yes I don't want to take advantage at the same time. Yes my brain is so bad right now I'm like I don't even know what's going on I feel like maybe it's like a hot flash I don't know so Let me, let me go look at it and do a comparison because also, I don't think I'm going to ask you for all of it. I'm getting close to where I want it to be. I'm not quite that so that that's a component of it too. So let me go do that come back to you and then you tell me, but I just need you to make sure that like whatever you say yes to you got to feel good about it because that's the most important thing to me, is that I also don't want you to feel taken advantage of.
01:19:34 - mark sweet (3)
Understood. I'm money and like I'm going to earn plenty of it. So it's not always about like the bottom bottom line for me on these things and I'm sure you know that about me. It's how can I make everything better, easier, everyone's life happier, my life happier. That's a bigger issue than, you know, did I make an issue?
01:19:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
20 grand, well, and that's a likewise thing for me and not only that though is like I just I myself for several more hours setting up this AI stuff and I want to do that because and like I've been trying to talk you into more time so instead of selling you on it, I'm just going to give more time because it's needed. If we're going to go where we're supposed to go, it needs more time on it. So that was part of it too is just I just, I'm going to earn it one way or the other. So how it happens is it's not a moot point, it has to be figured out and it has to be agreed upon but that's that's where I was kind of going with it but whatever it is we'll figure it out.
01:20:39 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not worth stressing out ever.
01:20:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know but integrity is worth it so.
01:20:45 - mark sweet (3)
But again, you provide a ton of value, Lorenz loves you. Oh Patrick, thank you for seeing improvement with it or else I'll be sure he is because he'd say something otherwise.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish you would ask him explicitly.
