00:00:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good morning.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning, Fuji.
00:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you? Good.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I noticed the last second acceptance of the invitations, the calendar invitations.
00:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. don't usually accept them. Yeah, didn't. I when I was looking, I was like, I guess I should do this one, but yeah, I don't usually accept them. Is that something that you use to keep track?
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes. And also, I don't expect people to remember things if it's not on their calendars, because, generally, that doesn't happen.
00:00:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so you're good about remembering things without them on your calendar. It shows up on my calendar because I have it as auto-populating, but I don't generally accept my invites. But I'll start doing that for us today.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you do. Yeah, that would be great. And that way I know that we're on the same page. And I have disabled the auto accepts because Mark critters and spammers know how to circumvent that on your calendar, like webinars and things like that.
00:01:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see. Yeah, I haven't. Oh, that's really interesting.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:01:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
makes sense.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, first question usually at the beginning of the call is just kind of have you contemplated. Now, mostly we just did a download last week, kind of your origin story and things like that. There wasn't really a lot that I would have imparted, but did you have any thoughts, contemplations after we spoke?
00:01:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I, you know, you did, you did ask me kind of to shore up a little bit more of my goals. And I really think after just being mindful, like the sleeping goal would be amazing. And I, I had kind of a thing that I, I was trying to figure out how you would hold me accountable. Um, you have really mentioned it, but I was thinking of ways that I could start wearing my, you know, haven't worn it out.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
watch like ever but I have one.
00:02:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was thinking I could wear that or I have like this four-plus sleep ring which I stopped using.
00:02:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did actually ask you about that last week.
00:02:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah okay yeah yeah so I was thinking maybe I could start wearing those to sleep and then that would provide pretty much clear data when I'm winding down because I noticed like this whole week I was winding down at like 11 and I you know my goal is to get to bed by 10. So I need to start my wind down about 9.30 shower and everything and yeah that maybe that's the way that you know I could provide data to that you have the same alarm I give.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes yes so first of all it always starts with mindfulness and then knowing your period so like I'm roughly a 90-minute wind down one hour is not an unless I'm exhausted if I'm exhausted I don't need it so knowing what your window is Being mindful of what your window is as the day has gone by, so for example, if I'm out in the sun half an hour to an hour or more, I'm going to need way less. If I've exercised a lot, but it was earlier in the day, because my adrenaline kicks in like that, and so it takes a while for my body to process it and I won't wind down fast enough, then then I'll sleep good. If I've had caffeine later in the day or I have asthma, so if I've had to take my inhaler later in the day, it's going to take more of a wind down period and I may need something like saffron or melatonin, which I hate melatonin, but saffron I have found is really, really helpful. I take a two version of it, one has high levels of saffronol in it and another one does not, but it's like a somo. And I noticed it's still pretty potent, so which has been really great for me. And when I've combined that with ashwagandha, it helps my ADD brain where I don't feel as jumpy from topic to topic throughout the day. So anyway, but that helps with the wind down because the issue is my brain. So now that everybody else's thoughts is not in my brain, my brain can now do the things it wants to do. And I like to kind of meditate and ponder things I'll problem solve or I find myself observing myself from throughout the day, kind of reflecting on what happened, how I showed up, I want to show up, kinds of different things. my brain will do that too. So just recognizing what your window looks like. And I would recommend journaling, do you journal at all?
00:04:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I used to up till college, I'd from age six through. who. Yeah, I college I used to, but I stopped after college.
00:05:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm super resistant to it. I've had to really train myself. Because I tell myself, I'll remember the important things if I just like, Oh, Tina, take a mental note, you've got a good brain. My brain is like, do you know how much you packed into me? So I started writing down, I use an app called day one journal. And you can create multiple types of journals.
00:05:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
like I have one for food. I have one for specific relationships.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have one for sleep. I have one for book ideas that I want to write. I have all kinds of them. I have one for genealogy and family history, one for spiritual thought things like that. And because it's an app and it's cross well, it is actually cross platform. But I have it on all my devices so I can access it from anywhere. So if something pops into my head and I really want to remember or reflect on, I can. And so keeping track of really specific things. So just as something popped out to you today, whoa, a man, I went to sleep really good last night. slept a long time. My sleep rhythm was good. What was I doing? You'll get that feedback from your watch to some degree. I like to check my heart rate kind of throughout the day and notice that. I use an app called Sleep Cycle. And Sleep Cycle does a good job. And I also use an app called Sleep Watch. So the two of them have different things. But what they combine, Sleep Watch for the Apple Watch.
00:06:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep Cycle. They do record different data and they have different types of reports. OK. When you share your Apple Health data, it combines different things like how many steps you took that day.
00:06:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you combine it with a leg of food. Good luck because I log all of my food. Is it sleep cycle, the orange color one? Yes. Oh, I have that.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just stopped using it of this.
00:07:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
go. OK. Yes, this is great. Thank you, We're going to get back on this sleep tracking thing.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so important.
00:07:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I mean, like, it's really. I know.
00:07:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know. I Yeah. I know you know.
00:07:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're a doctor. You know. but yeah, this is, this is what I need. This is great. I'm just so happy. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want, I actually don't want to give you my sleep data because I'm going to be embarrassed. But I think that's what it takes for me to change is I need to, I crave like I was talking about the external feedback from other people and, you know, I think you're going to be like, I don't want to talk to Tina. She's going to tell me. No, I know.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want to impress you.
00:07:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
know, like that's just my most operandi. So I think if I am forced to show you my sleep data, it'll do something. So I'm going to, after this call, I'm going to find my Apple Watch or my War Ring because I don't know where it either is. Yeah, we'll start we'll start tonight.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, can I them down?
00:08:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I love that idea. used to journal like I was a weird kid, man. I used to journal. I did and but yeah, I stopped in college and yeah, so I'll get back to doing journaling.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that. Well, there's no reason you can't do that today. So I'm expecting a full week of sleep data and sleep journal. So obviously, you know, make a Tina version so that's that you feel safe with sharing. But the important things like exercise sunshine, I'm telling you at least 15 minutes of sun is really potent in your rhythm in your in the circadian rhythm, but also in your mood, in your hormone levels. And where you're located, you should be okay. like up here, the Pacific Northwest, the we don't get as much and by the And do you like those rays are different for us? So yeah, but I think you should be.
00:09:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I've also been taking a cold shower every last two, three weeks. I've been trying to do that. It's painful, but I'm going to keep that. I think I noticed like in the morning, the first 30 minutes, I'm just it's not wasted anymore. Like I am a little sharper. I feel better about the day. So I think there is a little something to the cold showers. So I'll keep doing that. Like you said, I'll try to emphasize exercise early in the day. Try to get sunlight and then journal and then sleep tracker. So I think if I could do it, you know what I would say about trying, right?
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, there's going to try to do a do not. There's no try. He doesn't like the word try either. All right. Do you want to take your sleeper?
00:09:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you not? OK, wait. So there are.
00:09:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the other thing is then if you're doing the cold shower, please journal and I like split testing. So pick a day where you don't. Or actually probably maybe a series of days two or three days where you don't cold shower and then just really pay attention To those days and then two or three days where you do and and just really note the difference in your own thoughts in your own words Because once you have your own observation, then it's your own truth and now you have buy-in to the action And once you're bought into it, it doesn't matter what somebody suggests you do You know it either does work for you, or it does not work for you. Okay, that's a lot of that amount of time is good But I would imagine The extremity of it and and the shock to the system. It should be you know, noticeable. Okay, sleep. So that's good I was looking at Okay, so you you told me about all the businesses. So this part is going to take a little while to kind of Wrap head around and figure out where, okay, so what I'm always looking for is the biggest levers in your life and in your business. I'm also looking for the biggest levers inside of the biggest values. So looking inside of the things and the biggest impact and alignment there. So the thing that takes the most time is obviously going to be something that has a big impact on your day. The thing that makes the most money is going to have a big impact. So we'll go through it with that type of priority system in terms of like what we discussed and dig into first because there's a lot of different things and if we tried to touch them all we wouldn't do a really great job at it. I'd rather be thorough on the most impactful things first. So let me go ahead and review this again, okay, so actually let's just look at weakness is a little bit more so that we set some goals. So again, this is I really believe in just a line-upon line kind of effort and I think that if we overwhelm ourselves by trying to go too hard too fast and anything, it's not sustainable. You can only really be conscious of so many types of things throughout the day and the kind of effort that we're looking for is lifetime changes, lifetime behavior or habit changes, not because you want to impress me and because you want to look like a good boy on your pulse, right? You actually want to have these qualities in your life adopted throughout the life because of your own value system and because of what you believe that they will do for you. So we're going so obviously sleep and those sleep behaviors. We talked about several things already that you now have to add into. So journaling tracking, sun sound exercise. That's four things and those are significant. Granted, they don't take up the majority of your day. So are you familiar with the concept of finite willpower?
00:13:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, like as in, all start with the cut of energy or life or vitality and then each time we do an activity, it gets dumped out kind of thing.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it's really, it's really relative to that, but it would be about willpower specifically. Okay. imagine that. think it was Harvard that did a study. You could look it up if you wanted to, but there's also a book that I would really love you to read.
00:13:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's called, wait, do you like to read books? would imagine. I listened to the Spotify version.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could find the audio recording of it. Yeah. Okay. And this audio book might be one that you even like to listen to because they do a really good job at not being boring, but it's It's called The Switch by Chip and Dan Heath, and it says how to make change when change is hard, and I would actually recommend reading the entire book because there are a lot of different stories in it, and the way that they make the correlations of the stories, like how you can apply it, there's nothing wasted. A lot of books are fluff, lot of them are repeat, this book wasn't that, those annoy me, I'm done after the first chapter or two. This one, I would actually really love you to read the whole book, and so one of the studies that they did was, I don't remember what school it was, I feel like it was Harvard, compensator, I don't know, so they put everybody in, they put a large group of people, are you guys going down stairs? Sorry, okay, you, yes, you can spend on $20 for the arcade, but you can spend my money for the rest of the day, too, bye, yeah. We're on vacation. This is the only call I didn't read. schedule. But I just want to mess up our system. So anyway, so they, they put a huge group of people, a huge group, a group of people into a room, and they lined it with wall-of-wall fresh pastries stacked as high as you could see. Just imagine what that smells like, okay? Yeah. The first group of people, I'm gonna get these out of order, doesn't matter, the point will be the same. The first group of people were told to be there for 30 minutes and they couldn't touch anything. And then they were given an impossible math test. Literally impossible. couldn't solve it. Nothing was solvable. And I think after like 30 seconds, most of them gave up. Some of them held out to like two and a half minutes. And then there's another group of people, same thing, but they were allowed to have anything that they wanted to. And they tried for like, it was like, 30 minutes. It was something crazy.
00:16:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They tried so much harder and so much longer.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's another story of, like, talk about a rat, like, drowning. After few minutes, it'll give up. But if you save the rat once, the rat will try to stay alive for like a day and a half. Interesting. that one was hope.
00:16:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The other one was, well, okay.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here's the thing with the willpower. The is that you have a finite amount of willpower. So we use willpower for everything that we have to wrestle ourselves with. So if you have to wrestle yourself to get out of bed, if you have to wrestle yourself to exercise, to not snap at your spouse or person that you're working with or whatever, to eat something you don't want to eat because you know you should, to do something that you don't want to do to make you have to make somebody happy. All of that. That takes finite willpower. So empty cut by the end of the day, right? Here's the situation. And this is how it applied for me. So I was dealing with clients I really didn't like. I literally was making people millions of dollars while going bankrupt as a single mom because I was an employee and it was whatever. And they just thought she doesn't know what she's doing. I did. And I gave them an opportunity. didn't matter. So what I realized is that and they were rude, they were disrespectful out of my boundaries, called me on Sundays, want to be in a work like things I don't deal and how to establish. And so I was using all of my willpower to be polite. Oh, I see. I had nothing left for my children. And the other thing that I learned at around the same time was what you allow continues. the two collided in my brain. And I said, and I realized. is that as long as I kept doing these things, what I wanted, there would never be space for it. Because what we want to do is say, I will change when everything else changes for me to be able to be conducive to it. So when my environment changes, when my financial situation changes, when the babies get bigger, when I have more energy, when I've changed my mind to all these things, right? That's not how it works. So what you have to do is craft your environment as much as you can right now to not be something that causes you to struggle and invokes your willpower. So you don't bring the tempting food into the house. Don't schedule anything past nine o'clock because it will affect your wind down period. Don't schedule anything past seven o'clock so that you have seven to nine to be with family and you don't feel guilty when you get to nine o'clock because you didn't use it for family. And now you need 10 o'clock. to wind down because you don't want to fit in the glevel as a father or a spouse. So you craft and engineer everything to be as systematic as possible knowing that many things will show up and they won't be, and you will have to wrestle them. Which means that you have less rustle for the other things. And the other thing that reduces the rustle, a.k.a. evoking, invoking, I keep saying evoking, invoking willpower and the need for it is making it habitual. If it now becomes a reflexive response, then it is no longer I have to make this decision. If you let the thing be a question mark rather than a period, will I rather than I will, then mentally you still have to struggle a.k.a. needing willpower because you still have to make a decision. If you get in the habit of decision is made, there is not a question of will I do this thing, right? So, it used to be like that for me with church when I have little kids. Will I go to church? And so every Sunday morning when I'm waking up and I'm going through all the things like, am I going? Am I going? And then I realized I just need to say I am going because then I don't have the struggle of the question anymore. And that took me 15 to 20 minutes and it was anxiety. I removed the anxiety completely by simply saying, Tim, there is no question about it.
00:20:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're going. You made the decision that your value. You are going. Yeah. That's what I did about the cold showers is like three, two, three weeks ago I never started and like, nope, I'm just going to do it even that way when I stay over it someplace else I've been doing it.
00:20:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. So you just applied it now. This is who I am. This is what I do.
00:20:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So then you immediately get to apply the effort to everything else, but you reduced all the effort you had to apply to making the decision. That cupcake one was interesting. Yeah, it's not just about willpower as I spend it, but it's also about, you know, concurring
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
activities, right?
00:21:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have, if I'm having to have willpower exerted for like not eating a donut or whatever that example was, then I have actually less effort or willpower where we want to call it that I'm putting into like a difficult task or my ability to keep trying and a difficult task and failing, like that'll be less. Yes.
00:21:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in hearing your cognitive ability, like when you think about like that, and you love having a strong brain and be able to use it for things and realize that your brain is actually engaged in a wrestling conversation about something that doesn't even matter. Like does the donut really matter that much to your life? Yeah. But it could consume you so much that your ability to solve another problem is diminished by hundreds of percent because it's actively engaged in something else that means nothing. So that was a really great concept. Again, I really would love it for you to read the book. I'm going to put it in my notes episode, but you either agree or disagree. Great. I'm not going to tell you have to do it. Will you read that book?
00:22:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How long is it?
00:22:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go check my audible account.
00:22:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Actually, it's okay. No, I'll do it. I'll commit to that. I just finished another book. So this is perfect timing. I'll put that on. Yeah, I'll find it. I'll commit to that.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will we read or listen to? Yes, listen to switch by chipping down heat. I I don't make a ton of book recommendations. I read, I've read a lot. What I find is that most of them, I'll just tell you what the concepts are because that's usually all they have is like one or two nuggets. But this one, there were several different stories that for you throughout your life as a dad, but also in the realm of leadership and business that you're in. I feel like all of the stories will, you'll have something to glean from each of them that you'll be able to store away. It's one of one the few books that I go to mentally frequently.
00:23:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. That's that's why I'm here is to let's let's try something I wouldn't usually read and yeah let's do it.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do it. Awesome.
00:23:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I got my I want to exercise get some sunshine cold shower journal sleep tracker and a wind down routine and then switch got it.
00:23:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We won't add probably a whole lot of other things but just let's talk about this.
00:23:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So let me get back to well I was gonna give you example too like Friday Saturday was my day off right and Friday night I went to I actually did get in bed at about 10 30 my wife fell asleep and then I could not sleep till like 12 30 and then you know by the time I got to sleep we got up at 7 30 and that was you know Saturday was my day at work. Unererupted and I was you know, I was tired delirious, you know, so it was wasted day unfortunately So now I mean, this is this is how big of an impact like if I can get the sleep thing, right? Like Like today, I'm a little bit better rusted, but not great But yeah, I do to see on the days that I feel good and I'm well rested like I get a lot of stuff done and The days like I'm just dragging. I'm just slow. It's just it's willpower to almost stay awake, right? I mean, there's a lot of problems with lack of sleep But in our example this morning, it's like yeah, I just my cup my cup starts half empty And I just don't have the I don't have a life force or will power to Do anything so yeah, I think if I get this right the sleepy thing a lot of other things will fall into place It will and so One of the things that I've learned too and I hate sleeping in the middle of the day I've got too much to do it drives me nuts
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like it's wasteful, but I have learned the power of napping and Depending on how many hours left in the day I want to have of being productive will affect how much of a nap I take so 20 minutes even though it feels frustrating and I don't like the way I wake up. I wake up groggy cuz it's the middle of a sleep cycle I find that After I passed the grogginess and I usually will need some help so it's either going to be sugar can be a natural sugar doesn't need to be a You know table sugar or whatever Or caffeine or both or theanine. I like theanine actually I had to take a while to adjust to it But it's really great for me cognitively without feeling like I'm stimulated And The combination of little theanine with a little capping like starting with like 50 milligrams of each But the pairing them fairly evenly works really well But if I so but then I can't just lay down so I have to lay down. I have to cocoon Listen to binaural beats. I have to make sure that I'm not hungry. don't need to be full But I just need to not be where my body is feeling anything other than comfort and relax I Close my eyes as quickly as possible and I'm not allowed to look at anything even if I don't sleep Yes, that that is the thing Because my brain will be engaged and binaural beats with So I like I have a bose headset. So it's got it blocks out the sound I'm it also puts the pressure on on the head. So like it's a physical stimulation of the skin the body Weighted blanket or just wrapped up in something so you get that whole kind of on your side if you're in a cocoon with the headphones I I propped my head up on on pillows or like I I'll use like six pillows to get the perfect position So that every joint in my body is perfect Perfectly just I like I feel wrapped up in everything. So I've got I've got a pillow between my knees I've got a pillow under my arm.
00:27:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So my shoulder isn't stretching like I'm just oh so I can see by my back It's comfortable. You mean you use the cocoon.
00:27:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see so yeah, so like I don't like Feeling prone and vulnerable.
00:27:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I need it.
00:27:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need that in me My PTSD so fun fact about Tina She watched her dad murder her brother in front of her at a year and a half old Abused from infancy got at 14 has gone through a bunch of stuff like lived in gang violence for a few years as a teenager And then we come a more minute 19 But I've gone through a lot of stuff and My feeling is that it was something I probably would have signed up or spiritually and said Give it all to me. I can handle it. me walk through the fire and then I'll take my brothers and sisters through it So it's not a sob story. It's hard. It's it's it's try traumatizing. I find the physical and mortal experience fascinating, but not debilitating. Although I can, it's very easily that I've almost died of pneumonia four times I've been in the hospital on maximum levels of oxygen lungs about to collapse. Do you because I lived in a humid area? That's all it was. And the doctors are like, we can't do anything. And she's gonna die. was suffocating in the hospital.
00:28:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I remembered feeling good in Arizona. So I said, can you, can you let me go somewhere else?
00:28:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was off all medications. I was on 14 medications four times daily. And then and only when I lived in Texas. So sorry. I'm currently in Reno in a casino so that the smoke is getting to me. But after being on 14 medications four times daily and then moving to Arizona, I was off all the two and playing sports again. So because I wasn't going to be sports. Yeah, yeah. point is is that Being like that I could feel the fragility of mortality very good. Yeah. Yeah. so the like needing to be cocooned and everything needing to feel that yep yep yep.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The point is I think like yeah I can lay back and just you know for 20 minutes not open my eyes and look at my phone and think that via what time do you do that before 12?
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No it's not about the time it's about the energy and the mental load and what's about to happen and and how exhausted so I have to be really exhausted to get to sleep quickly. So but on those days where you're spent and you're basically a struggle bus all day long. Yeah. Those are easy you already know.
00:29:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see.
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got Saturday I get it. Okay. Yeah. And you want to cover your eyes too because daylight will be enough so you want a bit of a sleep mask. Yeah. got my sleep mask yep. And then you want to journal and find out what works for you. Is there nap? So I like Barnall. because if I hear music, the patterns change too frequently, and my brain will follow the pattern. So it still keeps me awake. I can't listen to classical music.
00:30:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
can't listen to you. it has to be that because my brain will go, I see a pattern.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it? What's it doing?
00:30:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I actually have my, you know, he's making your hair. I use my phone to do. Yeah, actually on Friday, I did take a nap, but it was at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It was for an hour. And then that's probably why I couldn't sleep till one o'clock.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So on days like that, I would love you to see if Safran does anything for you, you know, my girls don't like melatonin. makes me groggy afterwards, but there are things that you can do. So basically the thing is the system is not going to work perfectly without you doing something and put out But right. So you have to find the things that and then you also have to make decisions. So like caffeine borrows energy from the future, right? You basically have to pay that. There's you have to get the amount of sleep that you have to get. There's no way around it. However, it isn't based on time. It's based on quality. So if we can improve your how deep you sleep, we might be able to shave off an hour of time that you need. Like my sister gets about 20% deep sleep, I get about 81% deep sleep. So our quality of sleep is extremely different. And how rested and energized we feel is, you know, very obvious. So your sleep data will give us that information as well. And we can find out what things affect it. Like maybe if you eat avocado and salmon, maybe you have better sleep, know, higher saturated fats, more certain types of things, less of certain things. I would imagine you eat fairly healthy. Is that right? right? It's no.
00:32:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, no. I do try to get my my greens and fruits and vegetables. I'm pretty really, I'm pretty systematic about how much fruits and vegetables I get every day, but everything else I don't. I'm not really monitoring.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we'll want to pay attention to your macros. I'm like, you want to be if you sleep, sleep needs everything. Yeah. This is the whole machine. And this is the foundation of the machine. If it's not rested, like I like thinking about my health at a cellular level, my supplements are based on cellular health primarily. And all of that has made a big difference. I am always working on microbiome health and things. I don't look like it. my body type and my DNA is not working for me, which is why I have to work so hard for it. But There's just so many different things, and you know, I mean, think about just the, the, the, myelin sheath, I don't know, the cells at the health, like when you look at the, the smoothness of the cell body, how, how its ability to absorb or not, everything about it, that's every organ, every tissue, every, everything. So we want to think about what's going in, what's going out, the sleep, all that. It's all going to work together. So we'll talk about everything. It all takes time. There's so much to download, but then we also need to talk about your operations and what you're doing. So, um, let's, let me go back up here. Um, or follow through leaving money on the table. We'll definitely get to that. Sleep, exhausted, external praise, all of that. Just working together should probably help you with the external phrase to an extent, because I will tell you what's good, but also get in the habit of telling you what you should work on and hold you accountable. But the thing is, and my experience is people that normally get stressed out by being told or confronted with something they're not doing right, that normally have felt guilt and shame with that. Don't feel that with me, and they feel like they can tolerate that feedback and that they actually now want it more because they're getting where they want to go faster, and they enjoy that more than the praise, and then they start to see that the praise is actually getting in their way, distracting them with something superficial that isn't actually serving them.
00:34:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I've never been a guilt or a stress. person when people give me feedback and that's not who I am and yeah external praise is yeah I agree it's short term yeah I mean ultimately what I want is you know I I like I just I like the game of business and I like the game of building and that's what brings me a lot of joys to build things and ultimately like yeah that's always what's I think you know motivating me but yeah definitely in the in the short term it's about I like the external praise and well maybe the way that you look at it is because you like that I think because you like to win and you're competitive is that right I used to be really competitive now I just yeah I guess I'm still I think it's the same side of the same coin like it's a different words maybe but but let's play with this for a second and just think about it let's say that that's what it is yeah but it's winning socially people are happy with you so you're winning socially sure
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you did you cheat when you used to play? No, okay, so integrity and winning matter to you.
00:36:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you went in the right way, right?
00:36:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so if you get praise from your partner because you reported a false report on a goal Did you cheat? Yeah?
00:36:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so is the praise real?
00:36:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, is the victory real? No, did you actually win? Okay So if we say the praise is only good if I earned it because otherwise I'm actually a loser. I lost I lost Then it's not a it's a halo victory. I don't want that. I want the real victory So it's okay to want the praise but do it because like I want the win For the real praise like I want the win I want the cheering audience and that's okay. mean, where would we be without athletes who want to win? Where would we be without singers who want to perform and want to hear the crowd? like, I don't think it's a bad thing. I think sometimes we tell ourselves that these things are bad because we've got voids of the world telling us really disgusting things, actually, if you think about it, dude was pretty twisted, right?
00:37:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Himself? The way that he labeled everything is that?
00:37:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he was twisted, really, but and the thing is that most psychologists and psychiatrists, in everybody in the psychology community agree with that and yet he's referenced still frequently. So you have to have your own internal value system, that's the biggest thing is.
00:37:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think like the biggest I like in the last maybe five years, I realized like what I always wanted was like a hot like of all my goals, I think having a high net worth is like my primary goal of like in terms of like professionalism. And it was funny because I used to try to hide that that was my, like I used to try to not admit that that was my goal, that my goal was to do good to be very good socially, right? But I realized that even when I attained like my highest social external praise or whatever you call it, like when I was at Stanford, I was the chief, like everyone looked up to me, I had zero network, literally zero network that was actually negative, right? And it was really difficult because all my life, I thought I told myself that, no, I'm not a money hungry person like that. But when I got to that point, and I was 33, and I was like over half a million in debt, I was like, you know, I have all everything I want socially. But what I don't have is a net. worth and I've been trying to hide for so long and delude myself literally that that wasn't my goal that now I'm here and I have all the social love and I was a chief at Stanford and this isn't what I this isn't what absolutely not what I want. I would rather be a nobody and have a ton of net worth than have any like social fame or social like my colleagues looking up to me like I really don't care about that like what I care about is like having a high net worth and it felt so dirty at the time but now I realize that that all along it's still what I want is like yeah high net worth like not I mean I'm not like yeah and that's yeah it felt really bad but now over the last years I'm really like this that's what I want yes it makes me happy to like good and I finally got my first million like I actually a million dollars on paper and I'm good about that and that's what I've always wanted and I don't care about like I realized I just don't care that much about everyone at Stanford being like oh you're the new young guy and you're like you're the best we've seen like that felt good and but when I had that I didn't care about that.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that validated exactly what I said before is that praise actually gets in your way.
00:40:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah and it was just in Hollywood.
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was getting in your way yeah.
00:40:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Literally I think you hit the nail on the head there and I'm just laughing because yeah it was it's just so like I'm so frustrated. Well anyway I'm happy I'm acid but it took me like 35 years. It literally took me 35 years to realize like I wanted something different and I shouldn't I don't feel like I should be ashamed of wanting to have that goal behind it or whenever. Because what does it mean? I'm like a for that. Like I used to say that like in college and I remember like when I used to go to church I used to say this and people were like you're not a good person and they. Yeah. tell me like go watch Scrooge Buck Duck, go read like what is that other truck me like that book about Scrooge, Ebenezer Scrooge and they used to tell me those things like and I'm like has a really goal and so my goal changed you know I think somewhere in high school and college and that's what drove me through my 20s is to get to the top of like the pinnacle of my field which I got to and then I was like yeah so anyway I'm just laughing that yeah it took 35 years to but some people never get out of the crab pop because that's what it is it's crabs pulling each other down like oh don't get too big for your britches don't do like you know don't be a sell out don't do this don't make too much money I got hold of it for every culture every single one and it is the poor keep the poor poor and they think it's the rich that keep them poor but it's not the rich are the ones that offer their jobs giving away the training the information of course there's people who want to keep them poor but it's not
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not everybody with money. It is their own mentality, making themselves feel better about being poor by telling everybody else that should be poor, that that's what makes them good is that they're poor and that being, yeah, I went through the same thing. And most people that go from not having money to having it do and being inside of that world, or they have this cognitive dissonance constantly where they tell themselves they're good, but they still feel bad, you know, and so you at least came to terms with that at 35 and that's not bad. It really isn't actually, it was around that age when I did it too and figured it out. So and the older that I get, the more I'm learning that there's almost a, there's definitely not a steady pace for all people, but there is a fairly predictable pace of evolution in life for people who are doing the work. You can watch there is 10 to 15 years of like being in the wilderness and the wilderness is like just I don't know who I am. I don't know what I want. I don't know where I'm going. I don't know how to do it. And then you come out of it and you're like, oh, I know who I am. I know what I want. I don't want you. I don't want this. I'm not going back into the wilderness. You can't convince me whatever. So, you know, basically it is the dues that have to be paid to live a life in alignment and to know who you are, to be okay with who you are, love and embrace it. Yeah, we just, when we're kids, we think everybody else has it figured out. So we, we assume that all adults have all power, have all knowing are smarter than us, have it all together, do no wrong, because that's the way that, you know, kind of adults represent themselves, at least for most of the generations up till now. think it's a little bit more of open now and kids have a different chance. But then you get there and you realize nobody has it together. Like there's a whole spectrum of adulting, you know? So yeah. Okay. So now I do want to know, so net worth is a goal, but there's a reason behind it. Like it's not the thing. It's not net worth for the sake of net worth. So what does that money and first of all, you say high net worth, like do you have a number in mind of where you want to never be below and what you want to keep working forward?
00:44:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, well, I never want to be. I never want to be less than I'm less than where I am now. Like it took me how long to get to 10 million net worth right now. Because I, that's kind of always just the last like maybe 10 years, I've always known that that was like my goal is to get to like 10 million net worth because I could live off the interest comfortably for the rest of my life. And I think that's the thing that excites me is to have like a net worth that allows me to have time through passive income.
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's freedom because then then you can, if you don't have to earn money, you can do whatever work you want to do for the sake of the work. I don't imagine you're the kind of person that could sit around and just watch TV all day and do nothing and be happy, maybe for a tiny.
00:45:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's why I started July, which is the kind of the second company down. That I work with Mark in like last year at this time I was doing the QME work, which is my primary source. You know, I work 10 days a month and I make 100,000 roughly 100,000 a month and so it gave me. me that time. And yeah, during that time, I was like, well, I don't want to just sit here. I want to do something. And that's when I started July last year. And I love that. But yeah, yeah, I can't. I am never going to, I don't think I'm ever going to stop wanting to build. I like, I like what I like building things. But I, but that is, but my goal is to have a high net worth of like 10 million.
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's so we're not going to say high net worth. We're going to say a net worth of 10 million. We're going to make consistently. And when you say that you're going to know that it's because you're able to live off of investments and can choose to spend your time, however you want to, and always be able to take care of your family because I know that that's important to you.
00:46:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, I want to build provide for them.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So whenever you talk about that goal, I really want you to tell the whole story.
00:46:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Don't don't shortcut it.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't don't abbreviate it. There's a lot of time. times, I really get on people for abbreviations. Um, word top power, and when you cut the words off, you cut the power off, okay? So we want to be very specific about what we say, um, and we want to be very intentional about what we say. Also, it's a great filter. So if you tell somebody I'm working for a net worth of $10 million and their face says something, whatever, then, you know, you stand with that person about whether you can tell them the truth, whether you can be yourself, whether they're judging, whatever, and you, you want those signals, you really want those signals. You don't want them to be like, Oh, want to know exactly how people feel about exactly who you are.
00:47:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that make sense? I like that.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, you, you want to know the people who are loop warm around you. You, you want to know the people who are cold around you and you want to know the people who cannot get enough. of exactly who you are. Right?
00:48:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm pretty sure you could count Mark Sweet in that he's gonna love you exactly who you are, period, whatever. The wife, but they're only gonna be a handful of people who can take all of you that you'll never have to be filtered, and they'll be like, hell yeah, but they'll also be the one that would like, dude, what are you doing? and call you out, but you need those people too, but there's never going to be lucky if you get five, you're amazingly blessed if you have 10 in your life that you could really show all of your sides to. I wouldn't expect that you'll even five 10 that you can show all of your everything to unfiltered, and they're all in no matter what. So keep that in mind though, because if you filter if you alter and adjust or whatever your community communications to people, then number one, that signal is you feel like you have to, is it because you don't trust them enough or is because they're not worthy? It'll be one or the other or both.
00:49:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's really interesting. What were the two if I don't feel comfortable? If I have to filter, I should see if I'm doing it because what was it?
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
either don't trust them to accept you as you are.
00:49:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, okay.
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or they're not worthy and you already know that they're not worthy or they're both. So meaning they could be untested. You might not have tested them and you don't trust them and it's not fair because you didn't give them a chance to see you as you are.
00:49:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see. Oh my god, so my ex-girlfriend, I was with her for a year and a half and it was right around the Stanford time when I was the chief and I had succeeded socially. And when I was with her, she wanted to put me down. Like she would downplay my successes. And she was one of the people that would, yeah, yeah, it's funny. Like, exactly. Like, I didn't trust her. I stopped, I stopped telling her my goals and like, my ambitions, because exactly what you said, I didn't trust her to accept me as I am. She's my girlfriend. And then finally, I realized what was happening in that relationship for this exactly. I don't think I, I didn't consciously understand what you just said so clearly, which I didn't trust and accept me. But I realized that she, that the only way she was going to get, make herself better was to put me down. But yeah, but in effect, I played into that. And I didn't want to put, I didn't want to show her my goals, because I was afraid that it was going to make her feel like she wasn't high enough. And that could be because maybe they, I didn't think of like, they're not worthy of, you know, them or me. yeah, very, yeah, I mean, part of it, probably that is like she just wasn't a good cheerleader. She wasn't a good friend to begin with.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And here she was as my girlfriend.
00:51:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And when I finally met up with her, it was for that reason.
00:51:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Well, good. Good that you did that though because you chose yourself.
00:51:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh my god. Yeah. She kept pushing me to get married and God.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
now you have Esther and Esther's amazing.
00:51:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, she's amazing.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
00:51:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm so happy. I'm so lucky. I could talk to her about anything and she knows she knows she knows my goals. So that's awesome.
00:51:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love this. Okay, we're going to have so much fun.
00:51:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's going to have so much fun. I love this.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:51:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good. Yes. Okay. don't usually get to talk about. Yeah, I don't get to talk about myself or yeah, really, I don't I don't talk about myself.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
about you. This is all about you.
00:52:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because look, you were born with gifts.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, humility is wonderful, and it's great. But there's a difference between humility and playing small. To me, humility is being teachable. It's knowing your worth, but not thinking as a human being that we're better than other people, like more deserving of happiness or safety or peace, not believing that other people deserve bad things to happen to them just because they are bad people. Because honestly, you have no idea what's inside their brain. You don't know what they're capable of. Like, we have to be able to be discerning who we're going to keep us around, keep around us, who we're going to do business with, who we're going to let inside our sanctum, things like that. feeling like another person isn't worthy of any kind of basic human rights or happiness or joy or peace. East to you know that kind of thing right but other than that um to to think that we don't deserve everything that we feel like inside of us when we're kids we feel all powerful at the not all kids do unfortunately some kids got beat downs at such yearly age and that they don't know it but we feel like we could be superheroes like I was gonna be the next Supreme Court justice and um but I still feel powerful I could be next to a president and I'm not gonna shrink I don't there's nobody in the world that I'm gonna feel less than um because I know who I am now and I know that I have value with any human being that I speak to but I also know that if you put me in front of a homeless lady and she's filthy and crusty and dirty I'm going to look into her eyes and see a little baby and see a daughter of God and I'm going to feel love for her and I may be taught something by her I could be taught by a two-year-old to me that's humility it's not perfect I'm working on it, but that is the goal, is to value everyone around me, but also to value them so much that I want to show up 100% in my fullest strength, in my fullest power, and bring everything to the world that I have inside of me to bring, and not be ashamed of it and not hold back, and realize that I have recognized that even at five foot two, some people can't stand straight in front of me because they shrink. They feel intimidated by me, and they used to say, you're intimidating. I'm like, no, you're intimidated, but I'm not, because I'm not trying to. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to power over you. I don't want to control you. I don't want to rule you. I don't anything. But I am strong, and I'm powerful, and it's palpable.
00:54:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's funny to turn around that thing, like women that are powerful, get said, oh, you are intimidating.
00:54:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's a problem with like... Men dating are like women dating like my friends that are women that are powerful the woman like it's what they went through in dating Right, it's the men that are like you are intimidating. It's like no, it's not me. That's intimidating you.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That isn't strong, right?
00:55:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
yeah, it's very interesting. I never put that together, but yeah, that's what they'd say to you. But you would have people.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you they won't use the same words because you're trying to please everybody, right? But they're they could be intimidated by your I'm gonna make so many dollars and well, I'm gonna have a 10 million network, which is not the same, right? Obviously. But, um, you know, and they'll be intimidated by that. And they'll be like, you know, Fuji, come on, you know, money, evil, blah, blah, blah, all these things. It's it's the same type of thing. It might have a different flavor might have a different spin. It might be wearing a different coat and tie.
00:55:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
know what I'm saying?
00:55:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's dressed differently, but it's the same. thing. So know that that you serve the world best by being all of your full power. So the thing about having my fiance calls it FU money. Well, he doesn't filter it. He says the word but I don't. But he's like, you want to have enough money that nobody can have any kind of power over you influence over you that you can live where you want to work where you want to take care of who you want to all of those things. But by doing that back to finite will power and this is a huge correlation. You don't have to make decisions because of your finances that cause you to have to choose between one value and another. Yeah, incredibly important. That's what that power is. It isn't about necessary. I mean, it doesn't matter if you want to have a nice car. first thing Mark told me, I want $10 million in a jet. You know, I'm like, why I like what what does that mean to you? And it's like close to change since then, but yeah, they have, they have. And we I had a little bit to do with that. Um, you know, but, but he's he's the value changed in. I don't want to have a jet just to impress everybody and I want to do what everybody's doing because everybody's doing it. It's still a lot of that, but it's more because I want to have the freedom to fly where I want to fly when I want to fly. I to comfortably take my people with me and give them a good experience.
00:57:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Mark is very much about giving everyone else. He did. He took me and my wife on our first jet last year as a talk about it. mean, it's just, it was just a once in a lifetime thing I got to do because of him. And man, we're never going to forget that.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, right? that's a reason to want a private jet, but not because everybody else had it, which would, and again, words matter, right? And I don't know that he was vulnerable enough. to say in the beginning that it's because I like making people happy. I think he really loves bringing joy to people and it's not the thing that he really just says. So again, I'm not, I don't feel like I'm saying anything to you. Like I just need you to know that both of your privacy is very safe. I'm confident you already know that about Mark, so I know that I'm not building any beans or anything like that. But but my point in like setting the goals and having having the money, it's not having it for the sake of having it. And the thing that you do want to watch out for internally is that the want for more for the sake of more for the sake of more for the sake of more. That is a very common pattern that happens when people acquire wealth is that it's not enough because they don't manage it well. I don't think that's going to be an issue for you. I think that your family. will help you stay grounded. I already think that you are grounded. Your reason for wanting it is to live off of the interest. You didn't say let's start with a net worth of 10 million. You just said I always knew that that was the goal. But you do want to be mindful of the scope creep of wanting more and more and more and that it's never enough. You know, that's the Scrooge kind of thing sitting there counting money. And I've met those people who literally counted their money every day and it destroyed them. And then they had to have a breaking period, a refinement period of, I'll take everything away from you and let's see if you do this again. And a couple of them repeated the pattern again and then lost everything again. of millions gone, got it back, obsessed again, gone again. Growing it back and realizing, okay, now I'm in my 50s and maybe there's something else.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I need to be paying attention to a money. , that's a lot of money.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot of money.
01:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think I hope we get to 10 million while we work together. And I think when I get there, what's going to motivate me is the fun that I get from building. It's a lot of fun. I'm having the most fun of my life right now building this new company. So I can imagine, hopefully, when I get to 10 million, my want to create and to build is going to be what drives me for my next goal, but using the number as kind of like, well, did I do in this venture? Rather than the end point, it's just money is like a tracking system that I could see. Yeah, did my business idea work. And right now, like for July, I'm really proud of Yeah, my idea of what I had for July is working so far, and that's what I think is beautiful is seeing my business work. So yeah, hopefully when we get to 110 million, and I want to go further, it's for that reason rather than to increase the zeros on it.
01:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, because it will let you do more, because there's more work that you want to do requires more resources, more power, more freedom, whatever. Yeah, so okay, I want to go ahead and start wrapping up, and what we have not talked about what's not in your list is family goals, and that's really, really important because family is going to take the majority of your time. I want to know what that looks like for you, and I'd really like you to do one year, five year, 15 year goals, and the reason is, and they're going to change. That's okay. So, but I want you to be as specific as you can for the one-year goals and relatively specific for you can do three slash five just wherever your mind takes you to and then 15 because I want you to think about where you're out when your girls are teenagers. Do you plan on having more children? Yeah, we're having one next week on Tuesday. No, no, I know that. I always say girls. No, do you plan on having more after those two?
01:02:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I would like to, but it's going to be a talk with Esther.
01:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's this pregnancy was harder for her.
01:02:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's 37. So, we think she thinks maybe there's one more go, but we'll see how hard the birth is and everything. Yeah. We'll see.
01:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay.
01:02:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, I would like, I would like four, but I wanted a whole soccer team that pregnancy was very.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. Yeah, we both wanted that. Yeah, yep, yep.
01:02:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, would love to have three, but I'm, you know, grew up.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But too, my sister and I, so that was fine. Yeah. Well, so I wanted to now just kind of roughly to look at the timeline of what we want to think about. But having an idea ahead of time helps us kind of put things into the compartments that they could be thinking about how much time there is, how much freedom you want, and also just kind of off-ramp. Not necessarily an off-ramp, but just there's going to be a period during the teenage years where life is different. And then there's planning for empty nesting and what life is like, can you give me five more minutes? Thank you. So I can focus. So I'm wrapping up. Anyway, we're in a hotel right now, and the girl's just like, oh, where did it go? So the seasons of life, they change a lot. And what you're doing for work. I mean, But at that point, you should, well, honestly, a few years, max, but probably sooner. You could be at the 10,000 where you're just 10,000, 10 million where you're just living off the interest. I imagine that the goals and the things that you want to do are that competitive inside of you, that doesn't go away. The need to build and create and nurture isn't going to go away. So, we need to make sure that it has a container that doesn't leach into the family container, and you need to be very clearly, because the thing is you didn't put any family goals on here, that that family container I need to know is it the first thing. I assume it is, but I don't know, and I'm not going to judge you if it's not, but I do need to know where it falls on your priorities. Is that the thing that you're building first now, or is it the thing that you're building building equally and the other thing is, but there's no such thing as equal, one will rule.
01:05:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely, I don't think family is my top priority. You know, yeah, it's not. I think my mentality hasn't really been to think about like family like a goal. It's always been just to show as much love as I can to Emmy and Esther. But beyond that, I don't really have a goal for family. Yeah, it's not, it's not one of my priorities that I think about. It's really, I think if there was anything close, let's just show Emmy love and support that'll always be there for her and show the same to Esther and give her the, you know, words of affirmation that she needs and which is her love language. I've realized and but yeah, there's no formal. Goals for that so I can't even say it's a priority now Okay, and how do you feel about having a conversation with Esther to come up with some family goals? I love this never never in cross my mind it to think about it like this. Okay. Yeah, literally like the extent is I just want to show love and Yeah, just support If you're doing that for five minutes a day, they're gonna feel different than if you're doing it for an hour day so, you know what I mean and True and whether and and some days they might need five hours and some days they might need five minutes.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Having a conversation about how do you even recognize what is needed and what is wanted? and You know What do you have date nights things like that with Esther and and the things are going to change as the girls get to school age As they get into preteens long before their teenagers their teenagers. Nobody tells you this, but I promise you, they are. Like my oldest started at age six. It was insane. didn't know it was even possible. And the rest of them were around age eight, age nine, where they started getting very strong, well, hormonal, everything. So it's important if you have some family goals to know, like, are the things that we want to have like nighttime routines, morning routines, weekends, things like that. where does your time? Where is it wanted? Because you don't want to find out after the fact that they actually had things in their mind that they wanted from you that wasn't communicated. And then you're thinking or taking care of everything because nobody said anything. And now you're not, but nobody knows how to say anything because their people pleasers like, we just want to make sure that where everything's open on the table, you know, what I love them. And that there's a very specific container for it and that nothing. gets inside of that because I don't think I don't think as much as you said, like family isn't your priority. I'm almost positive that if your business was hurting your family, you would not be okay with it.
01:08:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's true.
01:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So it is a priority. It's just so naturally new that you automatically protect it and you won't let anything hurt it, that you just didn't make it a conscious goal, but it was subconscious.
01:08:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's a reason I stopped doing anesthesia because when you take care of people that are under for surgery, it's very stressful and I run out of the willpower cup when I get home and that's not how I wanted to be. My dad was never like that for me and I love you like that for me. So I want to be happy and present.
01:08:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you do have the goals, they're just ingrained in you. You want to make sure that we document them and that you and and Esther on the same page, and that that way, everything that we build in the business, because the bigger it gets and grows, the more you're going to love it, probably, the more it's going to be something like this, this will be your calling, this will be the thing that you do, this will be another baby, know, probably is another baby for you. And so it's really important that we know how to take care of all the babies and the wife, the one that's going to be there forever when the girls are grown, they're still Esther. So I would like you to work on that. That's your assignment for this week, along with everything else. You got it. Be as thorough as possible. You can't do too much. We can always bring it back, but talk about all the things there. And then we'll keep working on this, and then we'll get into the business stuff more by next week.
01:09:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But all of this foundation work is really important. Oh, the sweet.
01:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, huge. Now I get it. Take notes. Great. Yes. Take notes on the things that pop up and we We'll start our call again with just kind of a reflection period of how the week went. Um, over your sleep stuff and then we'll start and then we'll, we'll cover the family goals because I need to understand, um, where the container is, you know, because you have 24 hours in a day, you can't buy more no matter how much money you have, even if you have a hundred million dollars net worth, um, but the good news is that even if you don't have two pennies to rub together, you still get the same 24 hours.
01:10:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So it's a great equalizer. All right. You need to get to your kids.
01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you so much.
01:10:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you so much.
01:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I really appreciate how you, you, uh, you still talk to me this week.
01:10:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It means a lot and, but I want you with your kids. So thank you so much. Have a great vacation. Thank you.
