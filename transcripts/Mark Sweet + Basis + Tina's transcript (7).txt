00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Tina Marie: Daniel, Song

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Dan Ryan: Yup!

Tina Marie: How are you?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, God! It's Monday!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Tina Marie: Is it? Monday?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Dan Ryan: I feel like I've already been run through the ringer Already cancel the meeting.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Dan Ryan: After this I'm like I can't. I can't do it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Tina Marie: Do you want me to go destroy the ringer so it can't run you through anymore.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Dan Ryan: Think I'm done What's that?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Tina Marie: I said, do you want me to destroy the ringer so you can't go through it anymore?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. My only.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Dan Ryan: Saving grace was. I had a spammer texting me And oh, they're back

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
mark sweet: Oh!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Tina Marie: And you're With them

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I'm telling them that I'm I work on only fans. So we're gonna see how this goes.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I tried that one, too.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, this is a joy. This is a small pleasure in my life.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Tina Marie: Um Okay.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Tina Marie: Well, the month isn't shaping up. Too bad to start with.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's okay.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Tina Marie: It's okay. Alright! Let me

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tina Marie: Paste these in here, real, quick. Wrong thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tina Marie: So have we made any progress with. So you finally got the valiant data, Dan, right

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Dan Ryan: Ah, yeah. So I'm gonna talk to. I'm sending it to Isaac

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Dan Ryan: I sent it to Isaac, and was like, Hey. Can't we just import this? And

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Dan Ryan: Update like, we want to update, lidify. We don't want to update um. Lead plug it's in. Well, we could update lead flow, but we only wanna

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Dan Ryan: We probably update them separately, not try to like, get one to update and then have it update the other. We would just go do 2 separate updates I don't know how to do that in a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Dan Ryan: Lidify. So Isaac is gonna tell me

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Ah! Where's mine?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Tina Marie: Got it um Update

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Tina Marie: Today is the April 7, th

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Tina Marie: Man. Time freaking flies. I'll tell you what

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Tina Marie: Um And I've got valiant

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: Info And

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Tina Marie: You're uploading it to lidify. For what? Like, what data is there? So I can wrap my head around it

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, so none of their leads ever had a State associated with them. So if you wanted to say, Hey, show me the valiant leads in Arizona. You can't

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.000
mark sweet: No.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Dan Ryan: Or California or Washington, or anywhere they have, anywhere they've ever been So Josh's reports would never show you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Dan Ryan: Vent leads by vendor, by state. Can't do by state, because they don't have any state data. They do have it. We don't have it

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Dan Ryan: So. However, that originally got set up back in the day. It just wasn't passing that one parameter, even though they were

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Dan Ryan: They! Yeah, they were passing it, but it was never getting parsed

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Dan Ryan: Therefore it was never Entered into the intake

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Dan Ryan: And then, yeah, so you just can never. Report. You can never report on that right? So if

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Dan Ryan: If you wanted to do like they spent, you know they're spending money Or whatever

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Dan Ryan: It's like their what's their cost? Per, what's their conversion rate like? None of that shit Can be done at a state level

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Tina Marie: So. Is it like? Are you cross referencing between existing cases? You said, upload it to lidify

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So their identifier is gonna be their email address. And it will just say, Hey. Update this record

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Dan Ryan: Update the one element Or let's put it this way. That's how it would work in lead, flowy

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Dan Ryan: Like. I don't know

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Dan Ryan: How it would work at, litify. I assume it would work like that. But Isaac is gonna let us know

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay, got it? Yeah.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Tina Marie: I mean, you could have done that in a Weber like 10 years ago. So 15 years ago.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
mark sweet: It's gonna be somewhere But yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, just sometimes it's right. I don't know if it's gonna we don't really

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Dan Ryan: Well, here's here's here's Here's where I see it going awry.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Dan Ryan: Intake, so in Ostensibly

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Dan Ryan: It appears You come in as an intake. You have a state associated with you

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Dan Ryan: That intake becomes a matter. It carries over the state If I go update the intake

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Dan Ryan: A year later. It's probably not going to update the state in the matter.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Dan Ryan: Unless There's some sort of automation like

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Dan Ryan: It's 2 different records, I believe. Which is bizarre to me, but

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Dan Ryan: So it Litify is not appending records. It's creating new records from

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Dan Ryan: Us. From the original intake source

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Dan Ryan: I believe that's how it's actually working

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Tina Marie: Dumb.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Dan Ryan: So when you convert it to a matter, a matter is a different record. It's not like a matter is a tag or a

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Tina Marie: That just makes the system so much more bloated

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Dan Ryan: Well have you been in litify. Have you? Have you abandoned salesforce? It's bloatware

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Dan Ryan: I mean it was built in the Late nineties. So of course.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Dan Ryan: I'm sure they've got some architecture that they can never get off of

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Tina Marie: Probably

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Dan Ryan: But he's made his gazillions so so be it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Tina Marie: Wow! That's just um.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Tina Marie: I mean, it's such a basic thing to be able to append data But whatever

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Tina Marie: I mean, but but also they target target corporations and corporations are bloatwares themselves. This, like Policies and procedures for the sake of policies and procedures, not for the sake of efficiency

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Dan Ryan: Right. Exactly.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay? So well, that answers that question. And And ongoing and ongoing and ongoing

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Tina Marie: Um In the meantime, are you running any ads

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, they're not working

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Tina Marie: You are.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Dan Ryan: They are not working.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Tina Marie: The hell.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Dan Ryan: I was just sitting. I'm like, I gotta turn them off I gotta. I gotta think it through. I gotta go for a drive. I'm like, I don't know why these are not work like they're not

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Dan Ryan: Getting impressions, even So.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Dan Ryan: I mean this keyword data that I paid for Seemed like it would be valid

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Dan Ryan: But It's not turning out that way

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, some are getting impressions, but And getting clicks, but not

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, not. Ain't no leads.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah, the end of the day Not working.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tina Marie: So. But do you feel like once you like? If you could find out what cases actually came through from valiant If this data can

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Tina Marie: Um we Used.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Do you think that that Is your plan still that you could get some insight from that? That would change the way that the ads work or

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, if I can figure out

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Dan Ryan: Something from their leads. Right? He won't give me what I want I asked for it, and he didn't respond

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Dan Ryan: I even tried to say Mark wanted it didn't work I don't even think he understands what he's doing to be honest, based on his emails of like, what are you talking about?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Dan Ryan: This dude's got like He sounds like he sounds like an agency. Basically um.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Dan Ryan: So I was like, Hey. I tried to point out to him that his leverage is adwords

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Dan Ryan: He! Is.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Dan Ryan: Was focused on this referral traffic Idea.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Dan Ryan: I don't know if you saw these emails. They were borderline ridiculous But

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Dan Ryan: I'm like, Bro. You're sending like

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Dan Ryan: He's showing like, ah, we sent all these refers. I go. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Great It was 7 leads, and none of them converted. Yeah, but look at all the refers

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, really. Okay. When's the last time Mark took you up to

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Tina Marie: And you got to check from them

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Dan Ryan: When's the last time Mark took you out to dinner on that referral revenue Pretty sure it was never

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Dan Ryan: Um So I'm like.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, yeah. And he's talking brand. We're branding. I'm like, Okay, I'm sure. Uh-huh. Um

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Dan Ryan: And I was like, Hey, the leverage is Google ads, do this. And I told them exactly how to run the report and where to get it. And he promptly did not respond

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Tina Marie: Promptly did not respond

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So I was thinking about hitting them up again. Be like, Hey, you got that report from Mark

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Dan Ryan: Mark really wants that report

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Tina Marie: Send that? And then Mark needs a reply. Devin, can we get that by Monday?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Dan Ryan: That he paid $400,000 for Yeah, right.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tina Marie: Mark, Sir

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Dan Ryan: Now

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
mark sweet: Yeah, you can do that.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Dan Ryan: You have to realize there might not be any data in there. If he's tracking the leads wrong which I have every belief to believe

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Dan Ryan: He is because his His um.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Dan Ryan: Event counts were like through the roof, and he's like, look at all the 30,000 I'm like Bro. Those are not people I hate to. I don't know what you've set up, but

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Dan Ryan: You've set it up wrong So I could see him like

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Dan Ryan: Having conversion, events that are Click link. And then the conversion column is gonna have, like

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Dan Ryan: 200 conversions he's like, look at our cost per conversion. So great be like, yeah. But are those leads That's

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Dan Ryan: That's all that matters

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Dan, Vanity metrics. There's big numbers

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Dan Ryan: I? Yeah. He was just showering me with them He. He needs a complete. He need me to go in and pull data from Google analytics. I'm like, Mm, yeah, no.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Dan Ryan: I was like you don't, Doug

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Tina Marie: I'm So, but he gets

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Tina Marie: Leads. Sometimes.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Dan Ryan: No, he does get leads. I just don't

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Tina Marie: And Sometimes more than other people.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Dan Ryan: I just don't think he knows how

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
mark sweet: That's definitely a possibility. Although our website traffic generally has been up

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Dan Ryan: He didn't He didn't realize that that was his leverage.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Tina Marie: What mark.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
mark sweet: Our our like website, signups have been up So something is contributing to that. What that something is I have no goddamn clue, but something is

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Dan Ryan: That's probably SEO

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, because it's UN. It's unattributed. Right? So his shit's all attributed actually set up a secondary

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
mark sweet: Oh, nice!

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Dan Ryan: Thing. Based on that conversation. I was like, oh, well, I guess I could go do this. So there's an another way. So

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Dan Ryan: I could get a better count, but it's Pretty right on. I mean. What he didn't understand is that

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Dan Ryan: The gravity forms thing right? So I have a custom. Plugin So if he sends a click today

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Dan Ryan: And they turn into a lead in 3 months Which would never happen. But it could

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Dan Ryan: I will know as long as they are in the same browser on the same device. That cookie is going to be in their thing, and it's gonna say.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Dan Ryan: Nationwide, report. So I don't think he really realized that

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Dan Ryan: I'm not looking at Google analytics. I'm looking at the actual leads like, I can go into gravity Gravity forms and run the

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Dan Ryan: Search and say, Show me any lead that has a referrer of Nationwide report, and it goes bloop.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Dan Ryan: There you go! But there's a secondary way

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Dan Ryan: Well, actually, I do need to email him Because he was talking Utms. He didn't answer that either.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Dan Ryan: The secondary way is for him to tell me the Utms he's using, because If he's using a Utm

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Dan Ryan: Which he said he was Then that then he will not show up as a referrer. He will show up as a that

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Dan Ryan: Show me any lead with this Source whatever. He just defined the sources, but

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Dan Ryan: I don't. What do you define the source as so

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Tina Marie: How, how would it work out if mark anytime what? The next time Dan says an email, if you say, please get Dan everything he asked for Or anything he asked for

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I can definitely do that. I know we had also talked about potentially just having them Jump on part of a call with us

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
mark sweet: I don't know if that would make things go smoothly

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. I don't think there's a Any real reason to do that

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Dan Ryan: Based on those emails

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.000
mark sweet: Up.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Dan Ryan: Like.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
mark sweet: Fair enough. I'm just trying to think of how we get to them.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Totally.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.000
mark sweet: Interesting.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Dan Ryan: But I am gonna hit him up because I do need that. I'm gonna do it right now. I need those utms

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Dan Ryan: So I can Know for sure

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So then mark, just

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Tina Marie: Strong arm reply that yeah. Get down whatever he asked for. Please

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
mark sweet: Lunch.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I had a question Oh, oh, so for the website ones, can we look at Google analytics for those? Because they're directly on the website to see

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Tina Marie: If they're like, are people just typing in suite law or Are they coming from something that we've created?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Tina Marie: And can we tell if it's an SEO thing

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Dan Ryan: You cannot. Get a keyword from a

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Dan Ryan: They don't do that anymore

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Dan Ryan: Um Yeah, they got rid of that years ago

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
mark sweet: Can we figure out what channel they came through? At least

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Dan Ryan: That

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Tina Marie: You can't. You can't like, go look at behavior anymore and see the path To the website

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Dan Ryan: No, I'm just saying that you can't get Keywords.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Dan Ryan: Right? So there are no keywords in Google analytics. They got rid of that years ago. You can get keywords in

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Dan Ryan: Google, search, console. Right? So that's where it shows you a bunch of keywords. But there's no

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Tina Marie: But but you can tell if somebody typed

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Dan Ryan: Conversion.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Tina Marie: It like typed in sweetlaw.com, or something like that.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Dan Ryan: No. Yeah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
mark sweet: Like, can we just For shits and giggles. Um

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Tina Marie: You don't look at Google. Google analytics right now.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Dan Ryan: Uh we can. But I don't know who knows? Google analytics For enough to how good are you at Google? Analytics for

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Tina Marie: Not good, but we can see if it's any kind of like I've I've seen it a couple of times, and it would just Somebody needs to know it, anyway.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Dan Ryan: No, but I it's like, what are we looking for? What what is?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000

Dan Ryan: As well Done

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tina Marie: Think about a March You've been granted access

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Tina Marie: Analytics.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
mark sweet: In lead flow. There's no way to track it back in any way, shape or form, right

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Dan Ryan: To.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
mark sweet: Where it may have come from.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Dan Ryan: It depends. If if it has. Data that can be tracked. Yeah, like.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Dan Ryan: If it's got, if the So the

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
mark sweet: Let's go through. Yeah.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Dan Ryan: Form. The form on the website captures a bunch of different things. So like

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Dan Ryan: The last lead to come in is Lori Wilson. So Lori was referred from Google I have heard

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Dan Ryan: Google, Id. She has Phoenix, which means she came from the

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Dan Ryan: Gmb. I could see Her URL is Gmb. Her campaign is Phoenix also. Gmb

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Dan Ryan: So it depends On each record like they either have stuff or they don't

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Dan Ryan: The next one is unknown, which means Actually that one's fucked up

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Dan Ryan: Because that's gmb That one didn't

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
mark sweet: This is a Washington.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, so that that will get figured out in leap. Louis

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Dan Ryan: And then

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
mark sweet: Can we look up this phone number and see? Maybe if you can figure it out some level

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Dan Ryan: Sure.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
mark sweet: Okay, uh, it is 5 0, 9, 8, 5, 5, 6, 8, 0 2,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Dan Ryan: 858-55-6802, So it's not actually showing up

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Dan Ryan: In there at all But

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
mark sweet: Boom.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Dan Ryan: Well, it's I don't

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Dan Ryan: The problem is, there's multiple forms on the site. So it's like Sadly.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Dan Ryan: Gravity forms does not search all forms.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
mark sweet: I'm just wondering. Is it fine law, is it?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know I'm gonna try to look at it from A different angle

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Dan Ryan: He has. No.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Dan Ryan: Tracking at all Yeah. Um.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Dan Ryan: He's not It looks like that guy is not from a source

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Dan Ryan: At all. So it could be a call in

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
mark sweet: Right.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Dan Ryan: He's Yeah, he has no

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Dan Ryan: It's like he started as converted in lead. Flowy Which.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Dan Ryan: Makes me think he must have called in, or something He's not a lead. He's not a lead in a traditional

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Dan Ryan: Vendor, lead, form, sense.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
mark sweet: We are 0 for 2

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
mark sweet: Cool.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Dan Ryan: Yep. That's why you're tracking, though.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Dan Ryan: With chicken

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
mark sweet: You can sort of Uh

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Dan Ryan: You can

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
mark sweet: Yeah, sort of

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Dan Ryan: My God, I'm like so What does he in lidify

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Dan Ryan: Let's go. Look. Yeah, he has no email address.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Dan Ryan: So he was definitely not A lead.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Dan Ryan: So then that's like, why. So that means someone put them in lidify somehow. But then didn't

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Dan Ryan: Didn't uh Source them.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Tina Marie: That's really weird.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Dan Ryan: Or or so he could be like a Oh, well, wait! There's something weird.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
mark sweet: Well, there's only one other one that we can take a look at.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Tina Marie: Would this be Like a Ddos. Attack, attempt

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000

Tina Marie: Direct traffic of 16,000 664,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tina Marie: When your daily average Is more like under 2,000

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Dan Ryan: So he's blue steel. Somehow he has 2 records in lidify

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
mark sweet: Okay. Given the name. Are you

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
mark sweet: So whatever.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Dan Ryan: It's Antonio So the original intake

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Dan Ryan: It's the Antonio. So somehow or another. He has 2 intake records, and the one that converted is the one that has no attribution

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Dan Ryan: So I Yeah. His phone number's on the Non Marco. One

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
mark sweet: Uh

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Dan Ryan: It's weird. He has 2 different phone numbers, too. But the email address is the same on

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
mark sweet: I don't know

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Dan Ryan: There's Marco Antonio Fernandez, and then just Rodriguez, and then just Antonio Fernandez Rodriguez. Same email, address, different phone, numbers.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Dan Ryan: Um, but I Be willing to bet it's the same guy

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
mark sweet: Yep. Probably so

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
mark sweet: Um let me Go to this one

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
mark sweet: That's true. Also.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Dan Ryan: So. Yeah, maybe he.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Dan Ryan: Well, blue. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe he just called back. I don't know

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
mark sweet: Sue was Created for 2, 25, at 1, 47 Pm.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:12.000
mark sweet: What's created 4 to a 2 0, 2. Pm, so yeah, maybe

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:30.000
mark sweet: Really dummy Yeah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
mark sweet: Because 1, 47 Pm. And then 2 0. 2. On the same day So, yeah, they probably did just call back

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Dan Ryan: Yep.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Dan Ryan: There's no way They just answer and go

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Dan Ryan: Which is fine. They wouldn't think to look

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
mark sweet: That's not website one. That's another blue steel, cool

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! Now is there like a merge function? That's where I would merge them. But I don't know if there's a merge function

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
mark sweet: Well, no, I just don't want to keep calling a client. That's

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Dan Ryan: About 2,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
mark sweet: Not picking up. So I don't know. Okay, well, that was a fun. Well, goose, change of stupidity

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Dan Ryan: Well, we've found a problem

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
mark sweet: Yeah website's not doing anywhere near as well as it looked like it was

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Dan Ryan: Fixed it Boom.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
mark sweet: Maybe

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Tina Marie: What's not doing as well

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Dan Ryan: Well, there you go! Let's

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
mark sweet: Website. It was like, Hey, 3 of them cool. We're doing something. No

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, well, not only that. So if we look at this It's really weird. So active users

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tina Marie: I don't see where it's unique users, but I'm gonna assume I'm not, I shouldn't assume. But anyway.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Tina Marie: So what I wonder is if a lot of this traffic is Bot traffic like, if you're getting pinged because you create content

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Tina Marie: And it's getting hit by other things, because it's almost consistently the same number

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Tina Marie: For each of these pages And for the amount of hits for these things like this is not

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Tina Marie: People related to The search. Looking at these pages.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
mark sweet: No, we definitely get Bot attacks.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Tina Marie: Well, and then the one I was talking about

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
mark sweet: 16,000 in one day. Yeah, that's

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
mark sweet: Not normal.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that. But what's interesting is the organic search

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Tina Marie: And I don't know how and where we could drill into that more From here I should be able to

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Tina Marie: Like this used to would be a clickable link where we could click on that and drill into it more But I'm curious about

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Dan Ryan: They don't want you. They don't want you to have data

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah. You don't make good decisions. Come on.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Dan Ryan: Give me! Nope.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
mark sweet: Somewhere about

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Dan Ryan: No, you just listen to us.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Tina Marie: Landing. Let's see if we look at this Landing page not set.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that doesn't even make sense for Organic.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Tina Marie: Well, I guess Yeah.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Tina Marie: A direct referral, organic, social. Yeah.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Tina Marie: I mean Do we have

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: Is there better analytic analytics? We could get Dan

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, that goes back to the original question. What are we looking for? Right? So it's gonna

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Dan Ryan: They're Depending on what we're looking for

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, there's probably somebody that does that. But

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Tina Marie: So. Let's let's try to define that, because what we care about is real users

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Tina Marie: Who find us. How they get to us

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Tina Marie: And do they contact us when they find us? I think those are specific.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Tina Marie: Things to be looking for. So can we distinguish between bot traffic

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Tina Marie: As a person. Can we distinguish where they came from? And can we follow them to

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tina Marie: An action, page. Or something

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Tina Marie: Or even just compare um the time on the page. So What's interesting.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Tina Marie: Is that if this is all bot traffic, why would it spend that much time on sessions like there's got to be I would think

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Tina Marie: Some people in here, unless part of the Bought.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Tina Marie: Program is, stay on the page a while, so you don't look like a bot

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Right.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, the the thing is that It's all a matter of like learning how to use Google analytics. For, like, the data's in here.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Dan Ryan: It's just If this is just a total, another.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Dan Ryan: Level Like it's a bit of a mind. Fuck

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Dan Ryan: Um

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Dan Ryan: So like you would want to filter out Bots, which I'm pretty sure there's a way to do that

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Dan Ryan: But you go in and you just add you start layering events So you can layer the event like 1st source, right? And then it's like, Oh, okay.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Dan Ryan: This direct track. Right? All this traffic is coming from Google and direct So.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Dan Ryan: Direct is a little weird, because that's type in traffic So.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Dan Ryan: I don't even know if a bot would cause that Cause. That means that they're typing it into

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Dan Ryan: The browser I mean, I suppose that could be a bot. I suppose there's bots, I mean. I don't know why some bots even exist

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Dan Ryan: Um And then that would show you like

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Dan Ryan: All the referrers. So Google news? Yahoo, yeah, whatever it is. The bullshit pages

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Dan Ryan: But I mean these all would get attributed as

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Dan Ryan: Like, we're not gonna have lead. It depends So.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Dan Ryan: I get referral right? So I get Nationwide report, right as an example so valiant

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Dan Ryan: Their nationwide report. I get that So if someone comes from a URL, we get that at a lead level, so it would be like

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Dan Ryan: You could go analyze the leads and say, Show me every referrer that's ever Converted, but I don't know

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Dan Ryan: How, what we would do with that necessarily Like we can't

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Dan Ryan: Fact Someone sending us traffic

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
mark sweet: We block traffic from outside of

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Tina Marie: The Us.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
mark sweet: The Americas. Although we do have one person in Germany. But

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, but I don't know why you would like it doesn't

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
mark sweet: You're right. It's not a ton, but like there's no one from Hong Kong that's legit

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Tina Marie: That's today Right now

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Dan Ryan: Right, but it doesn't hurt help or hurt you. To have

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
mark sweet: That's true, I guess

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Dan Ryan: You know what I mean. It's like You could do it, but there's no

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Dan Ryan: Point in really doing it.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Tina Marie: It says Um to filter out bot traffic. You have to go to the Admin settings. I don't think I have admin access

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Dan Ryan: You do

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Tina Marie: Click on data streams and select your web data stream

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Dan Ryan: You have access.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, I'll look at that. I'll look at this and see if I can

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Tina Marie: Figure out a few things or not. But

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: Um I mean, we have. We have ex

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Tina Marie: Including data that we can use. We know website, traffic isn't a lot So.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Tina Marie: To what end are we going Through this process

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
mark sweet: We want you to grow our website traffic and hopefully, our conversions more than anything else.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Tina Marie: But Yeah. And then the other thing I was gonna say is, even if it's just uh, this is part of our process of getting the singles instead of the home runs right. Everything that we do, too

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Tina Marie: Increase those offsets the times when, because we have ebb and flow Even with our, you know our best providers.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes they just drop off. And it's been these singles, these these vendors, that just give one off or 2 off here That have helped us get through difficult months. So

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I'll start some

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
mark sweet: Up to the more we can do in house, the Far better off we're gonna be because

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
mark sweet: These new vendors gotta get paid somehow.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Tina Marie: There's definitely got to be a lot of Bot traffic, or even maybe I don't know if you'd call it bot. But if you're getting pinged

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Tina Marie: By content sites that are looking for. Basically, they're curating content from you Because you're putting it out there, but you're curating it

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Tina Marie: Also So.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Dan Ryan: Well, so I mean, I can't add you to Google, search, console, but

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Dan Ryan: Mark, in Add team to Google search, console. You're the owner

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Dan Ryan: Um If you go in there you get keywords right and

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Dan Ryan: Other than the brand. Sweetlaw Like.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Dan Ryan: Every keyword is Unsurprisingly

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Dan Ryan: A name. Because of the death blog posts right

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Dan Ryan: So you make a post on Jennifer Lopez, like

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Dan Ryan: Jennifer Lopez, not the Jennifer Lopez, but a Jennifer Lopez Well. Apparently the Jennifer Lopez was in a car accident.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Dan Ryan: So she's resulted in Hmm.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Dan Ryan: 5,000 impressions. So that stuff

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Dan Ryan: That pulls in. You have these medium and long tail things happening at a way greater scale Um

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Dan Ryan: That are going to pull in traffic, and it will, I mean, that could be the 16,000 The 16,000 could have been the coincidental

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Dan Ryan: Very popular name. With a blog post

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Dan Ryan: And then boom. It happens, it's over

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Dan Ryan: It's over in 2 weeks. Onto the next right, because they're

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Dan Ryan: You're looking at like I would say

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Dan Ryan: 6 to 8 posts per day. Those guys put up Maybe bore

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Ah!

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Dan Ryan: But that's the new strategy, right? It does work So.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Dan Ryan: Not! Stop.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
mark sweet: Not a charade, a charade.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Tina Marie: Ben used to be like this huge tipper when he'd play poker. He'd just tip all the dealers huge And she wouldn't let him tip more than $5 ever. So when they

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
mark sweet: Dan, do you want access to search, console, or no?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I haven't. Tina doesn't

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000

Dan Ryan: Uh, and there's peekaboo

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Tina Marie: Peekaboo

Tina Marie: Thank you. Okay, I will

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Dan Ryan: It's not only that like you must have been ranking for this At some point right? You're not now. Other people are ranking, but

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
mark sweet: Okay. Tenure added to like both domains.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Tina Marie: 4, Okay, I'll do some of that. After

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Tina Marie: After we go through this, because we've got other topics to go through today

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
mark sweet: But we have traffic. Yay.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
mark sweet: Okay? Uh, I have a couple of ideas on the name stuff. Since

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.000
mark sweet: notplayed.com is available and I get paid, not played.com. What's available

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Dan Ryan: And hope the I works

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Dan Ryan: Is is, you get paid.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Dan Ryan: Paid my plate.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Tina Marie: Or we.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
mark sweet: Uh you wanna do YOU, or just you

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Dan Ryan: YOU

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
mark sweet: Let me spell this all the right way. Ah!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
mark sweet: You get paid, not play.com is also available.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Dan Ryan: I mean that one works Right cause. It's

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Dan Ryan: Who.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
mark sweet: And you just With a U also works.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Dan Ryan: You might want to grab that just in

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Tina Marie: Or get paid, not played. now.com. I like to add now in there, because a lot of times those are there And you start with the main keyword that you want. Anyway.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Tina Marie: For today.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
mark sweet: Maybe not played now, oops available as well

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Tina Marie: Get paid, not played. Today.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
mark sweet: So the reason for us we can pick up one of those or all 3 of them quite frankly That sh.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
mark sweet: Should. Get us.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.000
mark sweet: The ability to hopefully get it trademarked And then we can try to actually take over the other website because they're violating our trademark

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
mark sweet: They aren't actually doing anything on that website

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um. You might also just

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
mark sweet: You know 6 figures. So F, you

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Tina Marie: Have it so that nobody else can get it get paid, not played law Pi, like all the very cause. It's like 12 bucks, or whatever for the domain, just to

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tina Marie: I like to get the adjacent domains Personally.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
mark sweet: I know what you're saying

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Tina Marie: Um, but also you can use those, and then just redirect them to your domain.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
mark sweet: Not clean.com is available for some reason which I feel is Kind, of good

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Tina Marie: It has no reference

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
mark sweet: Yeah, fair enough.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Tina Marie: Correlation. It's too ambiguous Get paid, not played means. I get my money

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Tina Marie: Nobody's keeping me from it. Now, it doesn't have any relationship to law

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Tina Marie: But that gets taken care of with everything else And somebody knows somebody who got hurt

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
mark sweet: They always do.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so The relativity is there

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
mark sweet: Okay. I'll pick up a couple of those. Then

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Tina Marie: And like, if you did get paid, not played today And like you, put that on a billboard

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Tina Marie: So you always want to have a call to action and a hook That's a call to action and a hook in one sentence

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
mark sweet: Whatever we saw the winner, it's free. This is just what's under it.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Tina Marie: I know. I'm just saying that's even a split test you could. You could do both of them. They're both powerful

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that's true, too. Oh, we'll pick them all up, I mean again. This is not expensive.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Tina Marie: And and there's different They're different demographics, right? So one's more

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: So one is more disarming for those who might be lawyer, resistant. Right like

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Tina Marie: I don't really trust a lawyer to help me. They don't care But then they're using my language right?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Tina Marie: I want to get played so Maybe they get me because they talk that way

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Tina Marie: Winner it's free is. I can't afford to pay a lawyer completely different mentality Ones. I don't trust one ones. I can't afford one

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Tina Marie: So you're coming at them from 2 separate angles 2. Separate.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Tina Marie: Sub demographics. Dem. Yeah, that's what I mean. You know what I mean. Subset.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Tina Marie: Whatever Just something to consider, because you came across something. Ordan did

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Tina Marie: One of you I think that was Dan, that

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
mark sweet: That was in

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: Um you had when art's free he's got. I think they're both very good, but I think that they're separate angles, that Resonate most powerfully with, you know. Imagine the Venn diagram right

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Tina Marie: People who got in a wreck, people who don't have a lawyer Um, people who don't trust lawyers and people who

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Tina Marie: Just can't afford them Don't even think it's affordable

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Tina Marie: So I'm not gonna hire one because I can't pay one. But wait whenever it's free, like, I don't have to pay unless I even get money Know what I mean. Like

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Tina Marie: Very very different. Mentalities.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Dan Ryan: Have you seen the new commercials with puppets? I'm just saying Very striking.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Dan Ryan: Very, very just sucks you in

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
mark sweet: I promise you we will do puppets at some point, Dan. I promise you we'll do puppets

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Tina Marie: I want to see a commercial with puppets. I haven't seen one

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Dan Ryan: Sucks you in Just you can't look away

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Tina Marie: Send me! Send me! Puppet commercials down because I don't

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Dan Ryan: And the puppets are great As as I drove down my street the other day, there's a new billboard from the new local dude

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Dan Ryan: Forget his name. But it's like

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Dan Ryan: You know, blah blah blah! And then him like, you know, a half body shot, and all I could see is, if that was a puppet

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Dan Ryan: I would You pay more attention.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Dan Ryan: But when it's Felipe, or whatever his name is, I'm not interested. It's like whatever

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Tina Marie: I, yeah, but you are not anybody's target demographic, because you're a weirdo, and you're an outlier, and we have to take that into

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Dan Ryan: Here's here's how you know. It's a good idea. Let me just I just brace yourself

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Tina Marie: Alright!

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Dan Ryan: I told Salco And Salka was like

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Dan Ryan: Screw, Mark Can we do that right now

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Dan Ryan: What would that cost And I was like what

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Dan Ryan: He goes. I like that

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Dan Ryan: We? Yeah, that would work. And I was like, Yeah, no, we're not doing that. I'm like, I'm not looking to do Another.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Dan Ryan: Legal project. I'm just saying, you know, it would be good for Mark He's like no man

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Dan Ryan: Well, yeah, that's a good idea. It's like.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Dan Ryan: So I don't know if that's a good feedback or not. Actually, as I ponder that

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Basically with Laura likes it. It maybe isn't the best thing

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Tina Marie: What did you say?

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
mark sweet: If another lawyer is all in favor of it, may not be a good thing

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Dan Ryan: Right.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Tina Marie: I mean Okay.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Dan Ryan: I did like the not another billboard lawyer. By the way, that was It's like that's

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, and if that was a puppet, you certainly not. You are certainly not another billboard lawyer, Mr. Puppet.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:39.000
mark sweet: When there are a lot of cartoon characters Like, literally, they're making them into cartoons, cause they're aging so badly like

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, it'll be AI England pretty soon. Yeah.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Tina Marie: I was just gonna say, like, that's what we should be doing anyway, because we've got all these leverage, and we can Create exactly what we want. Really.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Tina Marie: Very easily. Alright um

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Tina Marie: Second voice tracking. What can we just get an update on that total every week

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:16.000
mark sweet: Uh yeah. We're plus a hundred $20,435

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Tina Marie: From what time.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
mark sweet: 3, 5 to now

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Tina Marie: 3, 5, 2, 25, 2,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Tina Marie: Or 7,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Tina Marie: So in a month up, how much

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
mark sweet: 100 and 28,535, As gross settlements. But yeah.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so what do you get out of that?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
mark sweet: Let's say, 35%,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
mark sweet: So. 45, grand.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Tina Marie: And let's just I mean, we don't know for sure, but If we were to

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Tina Marie: Do that times 12 months, 540,000 like half a million dollars

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Tina Marie: Add to your bottom line just to have somebody else talk to them for a few minutes. Probably a little longer than that sometimes, but

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Tina Marie: Pretty good practice to put into place

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Dan Ryan: Well, yeah, I mean, that's the That's well, what

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Dan Ryan: What what was I saying? We need to tell Mark On Thursday

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Dan Ryan: It's like. I think it. I think it's he needs to

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Dan Ryan: Ah! What the hell did I say?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Tina Marie: I will find it I will!

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Tina Marie: Find that

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Dan Ryan: Because it's more relevant now. After my meeting this morning. Because I mean it was something around like how he needs to get a bobby, or whatever

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Dan Ryan: Um, or start working on that thing because it took me

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Where did I put those notes?

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Dan Ryan: You know. A solid

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Dan Ryan: 2 years, maybe to really like, have him on But now the fact of the matter is that Dude runs my company

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Dan Ryan: Just straight up like he runs it But I come in and say, this is what we're going to do.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Dan Ryan: What if we did this? What if we try that So.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Dan Ryan: An example of that is like I. So I just show up on Monday for

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Dan Ryan: A call like I did today And we talked for 45 min and

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Dan Ryan: We go over the dashboard right? We have the dashboard, the kpis he sends out a report every Monday. This is what's going. This is what happened last week This is how it compares to

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Dan Ryan: The year prior. This is how it compares to the week. Prior, right? Whatever it is. There's a bunch of data And

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Dan Ryan: The data goes all the way back. So I can like, look at The average amount of sales per day today

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Dan Ryan: And say, Oh, that Then right behind that is last month, and then right behind that is last quarter, and then right behind. That is

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Dan Ryan: The quarter from a year ago. And what have you So.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Dan Ryan: Getting him, and then working with him, and then coming up with Like that dashboard did not exist right? It was because of him that I was able to do get that right. So he helped execute it

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Dan Ryan: So on the call today. So we launched our new product on January first, st second, whatever And then I had looked at

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Dan Ryan: Hey? What's our customer growth? And Yadda yadda, Yada And I figured out that we are getting like a

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Dan Ryan: It was like a tool 11% increase in daily customers and

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Dan Ryan: Whatever, and that's interesting. And then I figured out that That can be extrapolated over the year, and

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Dan Ryan: Yada Yada Yada! And then yesterday It's so funny when you don't think a shit

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Dan Ryan: I get. I get an email every day from our credit card processor And it's like, here's the total amount of money that we process for you today.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Dan Ryan: And the number. It was like 14 grand or something, and I was like, that's high I was like

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Dan Ryan: That's really high Um

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Dan Ryan: So it was always like 10 And I was like, Oh, oh, I guess we should look at that right

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Dan Ryan: Because I can't tell you how long a new subscriber is going to stay Because I just don't. That data won't exist. I need to wait like, literally, like 18 months. But

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Dan Ryan: The amount of money I'm collecting every day is real And oh, the quarter just ended. So when I got on the phone with them today, I was like, Hey, I need you to pull these numbers

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Dan Ryan: Which we already had. So I was like, hey, just tell me what these are So we did the real dirty math

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Dan Ryan: Worst case scenario. If we don't change from just launching that new product We added $800,000 to the bottom line

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Dan Ryan: Period. We didn't hire anybody

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Dan Ryan: Didn't do anything And the only reason that was possible is because that Guy exists

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Dan Ryan: Because Jeff and I did this together for years And we were just

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Dan Ryan: A shit show. We would just show up on Monday And both be like visionarying on top of each other. I mean, I integrated some he didn't integrate at all.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Dan Ryan: So. I realized that like

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Dan Ryan: You mark Are at this place, where

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Dan Ryan: You. Maybe you need to start looking at that, or you need to start looking at

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Dan Ryan: Bringing in an outside person and start to just solve some of these things for you, and they They are beholden to no one. They're not beholden to the fellow employees. They're not beholden to

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Dan Ryan: I mean they're beholden to you. They're not beholden to a position, or whatever And it's like

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Dan Ryan: Where could you start to? Implement that idea.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Dan Ryan: Immediately they saw a 20% reduction in Output.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Dan Ryan: Um in revenue, because they lost that person And then he did an analysis now several months later, and

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Dan Ryan: Saw. That

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Dan Ryan: Every other salesperson has increased to the same level as that woman Was.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Dan Ryan: The lesson being She was suppressing other people's sales

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Dan Ryan: And they had no idea Right? So it's like one person

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Dan Ryan: Can muck up the gears, or whatever I'm not saying that that's the case here, but

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Dan Ryan: Um You might be at a position where you can start to like

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Dan Ryan: Extract yourself from the business, and that's whether or not you're going to sell it, or you're going to stay Right. You. Both paths are available. It's like I recently saw this concept of like

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Dan Ryan: You. You start to operate as if you're going to sell it. And then what you really did is you sold it to yourself

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Dan Ryan: Which I was like. That's Okay, I mean, so I've done that

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Dan Ryan: And like I was talking to Tina like I've set 2 This is so funny, Tina, I said. 2 goals

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Dan Ryan: For the year to get accomplished in the year. I just figured out this morning. Now they've both been achieved

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Dan Ryan: Long term goal. My long term goal was like, I think I can get this Business as is to 4.2 million a year

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Dan Ryan: I'm 95% sure that the number that he comes back with

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Dan Ryan: Today or tomorrow. Of

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Dan Ryan: Us extrapolating out the year. It's gonna be that number. We're not gonna actually At $800,000. We're going to add over a million like 25%

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Dan Ryan: Or we're going to add over a million dollars this year. From that one.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Dan Ryan: Change. Then I need

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Tina Marie: We. One of the goals was 1% market value increase, did you? Was that one you're including right now.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Dan Ryan: We're doing that one, too. Yep. So I think it's gonna be bigger than that

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Tina Marie: All right.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Dan Ryan: But that's all to say. None of this would have been possible without

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Tina Marie: Sorry I'm gonna interrupt

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Dan Ryan: Finding and implementing that guy, and it wasn't super easy, but It also wasn't super difficult

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Tina Marie: Um. One of the things that we did discuss, though, is whale tracking

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah. Oh, I should ask Isaac about that

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That would probably

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
mark sweet: It looks like one of 500. So every 500 cases one turns into a 7 figure case

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Dan Ryan: Well, so

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: And how many cases do you have a year And how do you know it's 1 in every 500

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
mark sweet: I know how many whales we have, and I know roughly how many cases we send a month

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Dan Ryan: It's really about like, what is the we just need to drill into monkey and be like

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:42.000
mark sweet: Monkey is the best and the worst Because outside of deaf blogs which

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
mark sweet: Obviously, that's a good way to get You know.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:52.000
mark sweet: Big cases. It was one referral, and the rest have pretty much all been monkey, with one exception.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Dan Ryan: Right. Which is super interesting

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
mark sweet: So monkey has consistently been our will producer

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Dan Ryan: Right, which goes back to So then I look at that and go well. Where do they get their

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Dan Ryan: Cases from Facebook So does that mean Facebook is a whale

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Dan Ryan: A whale Creator.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
mark sweet: I know.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Dan Ryan: So, then

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Tina Marie: It's uh

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Dan Ryan: Another vendor that uses Facebook.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Tina Marie: We have. I think they have

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Dan Ryan: What's that?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Tina Marie: Facebook is Ahab Captain Ahab

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, so. But then it's like, this is what I I think I was saying to you. Tina was like, then you look at like An underperforming vendor like absurdly

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Dan Ryan: It's like, okay, those guys were basically breaking even They were probably making money. If we had had

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Dan Ryan: The referred out data was correct. Which it wasn't, and it never. I tried to go back, and one day, and it

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Dan Ryan: Was not updated, so we can't even figure it out Unless they actually

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Dan Ryan: We had everyone go through and actually figure out if it was actually referred out, which we could do Um

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Dan Ryan: But the data, as it was said that they Were that they lost a little money

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Dan Ryan: But then it would be Okay. Well.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Dan Ryan: Did they generate? The enough leads like

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Dan Ryan: Monkey that they were approaching a whale And if they were, would that have happened

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Dan Ryan: So it's like, there's that factor of like, okay, the vendors kind of work in the lead source is similar Therefore

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Dan Ryan: Are they whale, worthy And maybe there wills 700 and and not 500. But you're like, I'm not actually Lou

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Dan Ryan: I'm not losing anything in the grand scheme of things. And yeah, it's a bit of a gamble, but you're not gambling

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Dan Ryan: A shit ton of money. You are getting cases. You are getting revenue And then it's like, is there a whale

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Dan Ryan: Waiting. I don't know

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Dan Ryan: Whereas, like a case, connect None of their shit worked.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Dan Ryan: So it's

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
mark sweet: No.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Dan Ryan: You'd spend 500 to God only knows what like you. Probably they probably are not well worthy

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
mark sweet: And accident.com. Seems like it's

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
mark sweet: Gonna be dead very shortly.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Dan Ryan: Exactly. Yeah. And then, like even valiant like his value, valiant's never generated a whale. So it's like, or yet

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Dan Ryan: Maybe their well math is totally different, because they're Traffic sources, Google

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Dan Ryan: So at this point in time. You can almost say that

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Dan Ryan: Whales don't exist on Google via Accident, report.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Dan Ryan: Strategery.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
mark sweet: Also, please don't forget. Monkey produces the most number of Leads.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Dan Ryan: No, I know that's why it's like, what is their lead to lead to whale ratio for real

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
mark sweet: Well, yeah, that is gonna be

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Dan Ryan: Like 300. They're like 300 leads a month

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
mark sweet: Correct.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Tina Marie: Can we Use this report, but

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tina Marie: Fix it because it's not actually doing descending. But it looks like you tried to create something I don't know how old this reported. I didn't look at that

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Tina Marie: But it has it by source and check received amount So you have these

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tina Marie: Columns there. Where we could get this to find

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Tina Marie: Could we? Edit it to be like above a certain amount

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah, we probably won. But yeah. Cause you're going to edit

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, shit! I gotta go

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
mark sweet: Oh, put it in

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Tina Marie: Bye.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
mark sweet: And then you went to filters And

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
mark sweet: Let's see, check received amount

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
mark sweet: We just had me equal to 0. But you just do greater or

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Right. So what would be an amount

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
mark sweet: Uh Time.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Tina Marie: A 1 million or

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
mark sweet: No. Just do like 400,000

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Tina Marie: Wow! Oops!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Tina Marie: Comma Apply.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
mark sweet: And then hit, run, see if that works

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Tina Marie: Um

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
mark sweet: No, it didn't work.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000
mark sweet: That didn't work, as you can see, received amounts are Uh, I mean, I think he's put in 400 0 0, because it's got like 4,000

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Filters.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Tina Marie: What for her? Okay. Oh, comma. Okay. So 4.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
mark sweet: Don't do a comma. I think, yeah, just And then do like dot 0 0. Maybe I don't know

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh! It did it

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay, and then run. That can't be right

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Tina Marie: It should have worked. It's right.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it. Looks like it. Just do like 90,000 or something, just to see

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Tina Marie: Right, that's it.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Tina Marie: On Tuesday. Fly!

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Tina Marie: Run. 4 records.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Someone's not right? It's only it's way way, old stuff

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But so we can do what we need to do

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
mark sweet: Um go back into real quick. I got another idea of how we could do it

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
mark sweet: Um Go into filters.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
mark sweet: And then Go to the bottom thing

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
mark sweet: And so the check received amount due Gross recovery.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Tina Marie: Want to try 400,000 again

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah. And then hit run, but it looks like it should be at least be a few of them.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Tina Marie: But there's no amount

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.000
mark sweet: You're just gonna have that as a field to display. But at least yeah. If you go back into edit

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
mark sweet: Um And then

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
mark sweet: To the columns Go down.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Tina Marie: Ah, sorry. Yeah.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
mark sweet: Columns, you'll just add gross recovery

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tina Marie: And then run. Oh, there. Nice

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay. This goes all time, and that's above 400,000

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Tina Marie: So, then, if I go to sending Why is that not

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
mark sweet: Problem, with his Based on um

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Tina Marie: Time.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
mark sweet: Created date. So let's say we want to get rid of that

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Tina Marie: Ah! In the edit field

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know it's dumb.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Tina Marie: And then run.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Tina Marie: Supposed to be. Oh, there's other thing now. It's source That's tripping us up

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Tina Marie: Um

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
mark sweet: Well, this! Generally shows you what's going on

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Tina Marie: We cannot.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
mark sweet: It's monkey news

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Tina Marie: So definitely month, 14

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Tina Marie: 2 million. But haven't

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Tina Marie: So your gross recovery, though you've had more than this, haven't you?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
mark sweet: This is just in house. So those things that we sent out it's not Into the system

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
mark sweet: So there's just things that we've done in our own office.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Um, could we do instead of create a date? Could we

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if we could do like year totals

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
mark sweet: Uh! I have no idea how to do that.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Tina Marie: Alright. Well, let's go ahead and put the dates back in, because now I have an idea It was here.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Tina Marie: It was Create a date, right?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Tina Marie: Date And then run.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Tina Marie: Look it up one more time. So let's just go Anyway, it's monkey

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tina Marie: Monkey. It's crazy You know. What would be interesting is to look at how much we've sent Monkey

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
mark sweet: The downside is monkey is mostly older

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Tina Marie: Older like the winds, were older. What do you mean? Older

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000
mark sweet: Uh. Other cases like created dates, most of them are like 2020, 21

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I see that

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
mark sweet: So they're slowing down in that regard

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Tina Marie: They're not really preferring

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
mark sweet: Sort of

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Tina Marie: I mean, but it doesn't seem like News.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Tina Marie: That's interesting. I mean, it's not really because it's death blog. But But that it's how

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Tina Marie: Well, okay, so.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
mark sweet: That gives us the highest Chance.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Tina Marie: I want subtotals. So let's do this real quick Monkey.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Tina Marie: So total 11 million news. 6 million.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Tina Marie: So it's a little bit more than half, but News.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Tina Marie: Cost us almost nothing right, but It's not nothing

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Tina Marie: But we can't

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
mark sweet: There's definitely a fee to it. Good.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
mark sweet: It definitely makes sense like, we're not gonna hurt a monkey. We're not gonna hurt a news

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Tina Marie: Can you Figure out any kind of quickly how much you paid monkey since 2,019

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
mark sweet: No, not quickly.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Tina Marie: You know, it would be really interesting. Really simple math right now is to figure out

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
mark sweet: Think about. I would say 50 grand a month. It's like 43, to be exact.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Tina Marie: Well. Yeah. So actually, though, I don't, I don't want this. I would want like all the settlement amount all across all time.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Tina Marie: Compared to their all time. Fees. Because then we'd have a much bigger average number

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Tina Marie: Obviously you wouldn't want to see what the trending is, but that across time Gives us a much better correlation because we used to talk about this. And you would say, the problem is, it takes so long for cases to resolve, so we couldn't get data

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Tina Marie: But now we're a few years in tracking it, and We have some data we can get

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
mark sweet: Yeah, we have a lot more data at this point

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Tina Marie: So would you. Would you get those numbers? How much you've paid? Walker, monkey News would be great, too

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Tina Marie: You agree?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
mark sweet: I will do my best accounting this next week and a half is like all hands on deck because of taxes

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
mark sweet: This isn't just something that I can pull from like quickbooks, because each one's in its own state. So it's I can tell you how much overall

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
mark sweet: From a source like that part, I can definitely pull The the money part is going to be a little bit tougher

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Tina Marie: Um

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
mark sweet: We we can get it. It's just I know, before the 15.th It's gonna be

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Tina Marie: What do you mean?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
mark sweet: Asking a little too much.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Tina Marie: That's fine!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
mark sweet: But at least I can get the front part of that

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Tina Marie: What did we pay Okay.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Tina Marie: Sources. All time.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Tina Marie: At least monkey Walker.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Tina Marie: And news Ah!

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Tina Marie: We'll we'll want more than that, cause I'm gonna

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
mark sweet: Because we made a settlement by source Before.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
mark sweet: Um, so definitely just exists But

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:48.000
mark sweet: If we want to run all time. Share, but

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Tina Marie: Um. Oh, I want all reports. Source Oh, you!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Tina Marie: Cool? Is that everything Cases signed by a source. I don't want them

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
mark sweet: Like monkey. It's 30 million.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Monkey.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Tina Marie: 8 M. Okay.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
mark sweet: Cause. This has everything from way beyond news has 10.8 8 million

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Tina Marie: Point 8 8 k

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
mark sweet: Walkers.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Tina Marie: I would

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
mark sweet: 14.4, but walkers can also split up walkers about 15 million altogether

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay, we'll do 15, What about Felipe

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
mark sweet: And Just a little bit under 10,000,009.7 4 9

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay. You got me.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
mark sweet: Doctor referrals are 11.4

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
mark sweet: And those are the the big ones valiance A little bit shy of 2 million

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Yeah, we know, that's a

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Tina Marie: Profitable source. Okay.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Tina Marie: Uh, I'm gonna look into these and the Google stuff Over the next week, and 2

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Tina Marie: Go through that But

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Tina Marie: Sir What's going on with you? Why are you so quiet

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:48.000
mark sweet: Right. So I guess sometimes Got a kind of crazy, stressful, chaotic week coming up so well this week, not coming up. It's already started

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Tina Marie: Well, is there anything that any work that I can do that can help With any stress like, can I help you in any way

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
mark sweet: Um Not really, maybe, can help China figure out how to do her deductions for her taxes. But that's about it.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:17.000
mark sweet: Um tomorrow. I'm just waiting to hear on one case today. It's been The regular stuff, and then I'm gone. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, at the conference

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, what kind of conference?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
mark sweet: Uh the brain injury. One in San Diego We go.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
mark sweet: Pretty often It's a good one.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Tina Marie: Nice

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
mark sweet: So.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Tina Marie: You're gonna see Dan

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
mark sweet: Wasn't planning on it. But definitely go down there for a little bit, so I don't know

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Tina Marie: Um Does.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Tina Marie: Shauna have a good Accountant like somebody who can help her with that

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
mark sweet: Nope.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Tina Marie: Can we get her one

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
mark sweet: Sure. Still gonna have to give them the basic information, or they're not gonna be able to help

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Tina Marie: Right. Um

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Tina Marie: Like I

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
mark sweet: We're we're making small progress, but we'll get it done. It's just She just needs to get it done. And then the fast pain, Doc switch stuff has been

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
mark sweet: Hard for her to figure out But I think she's got most of it done at this point

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
mark sweet: And then we just got notice Well.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
mark sweet: What the heck Just got noticed. Um remember how there was another West Side pane

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
mark sweet: So I know him like Dr. Nasiri.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
mark sweet: He's opening up an Orange County office that's literally like across the street from where my office is, which is like a mile Down the road from where sweet James is so

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
mark sweet: That's going to eat into what China's doing.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Tina Marie: That sucks.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
mark sweet: Yep, but nothing you can do about it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
mark sweet: So we got a lot of stuff going on But

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Well, I will

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
mark sweet: One thing at a time.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Tina Marie: Um Bring up to her and see if maybe I can do a Google search. And maybe we can find a good

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Tina Marie: Person to help her Cause I know

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000
mark sweet: I literally. I offered Michelle my office. She's a Cpa. To do it, but She just

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Tina Marie: I wonder if Esther might make It.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes people receive other people differently, and maybe her friend was also a woman making a suggestion. Maybe she might receive it better

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
mark sweet: Maybe they were talking about Picky. Bona

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Tina Marie: But I don't

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.000
mark sweet: Flower stuff today uh over the weekend. And then I guess Esther also has someone in Japan who gets her Japanese lessons, which is kind of cool

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Tina Marie: That's amazing. I love that

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So random stuff.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I know how to bring it up, though, because I already know that Esther does this financial stuff. So I could ask Jonah Um

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Tina Marie: Ah, yeah.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
mark sweet: I mean, it makes sense like tax days. The 15, th like everyone, knows that it's not a surprise like It's it's pretty well known

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:57.000
mark sweet: Um And then we'll hopefully get that payroll thing started for her at some point. But I think that'll actually be a good recruiting tool for her

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Tina Marie: Um Has never been.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:12.000
mark sweet: She definitely needs help on where to post ads and how to do it cost efficiently There has not been anyone that they've found so far

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
mark sweet: And Yeah, she got lucky with Maria, which is great, like, I'm very, very happy for that. But

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
mark sweet: This next one's gonna be a little bit tougher

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Tina Marie: Ads for

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
mark sweet: Uh, like that assistant person who helps with scheduling and like, actually goes in the office
