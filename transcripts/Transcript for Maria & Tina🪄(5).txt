Hey.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:00:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. But just not super high energy.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's nothing wrong. It's just snow.
00:00:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just kind of.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The head with fuzzy. It's not great. how are you doing?
00:00:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good. Good. I'm just making some. I know you're going to say, Marie, I should outsource it. I'm just making some graphics for grants funnel. And I finished his OTO one upsell page. And I may hire a go high level expert to spend 30 minutes with me.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I can't figure out a couple of things of the tagging.
00:00:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because they've changed a little bit. Since I've used go high level about a couple of years ago, they've changed some of the things. Pretty minor stuff. And then I'm ready to test the funnel and it'll be ready for traffic then tomorrow.
00:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's really cool. So that's what's been. Thank you.
00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Busy yeah, because you know and and you know, I think this is why and this is you know How do I word this with your agency background and stuff like I want to get the youtube offer going But I think we can make so much money doing these little ticket offers because like um I really I really I really it's just 20 to 50k service like I really go in and Watch their their content like grants like his videos for so two on his videos book for eva that I consume it rather than a lot of people and I know you probably do the same tina But like I oh no. Oh, okay. Anyways, so I do that so that I know the real good hooks and the energy pops off the page I think that's why these little ticket funnels. do for some people like, you know do so well, right? But the good news is That I'll be finished this end of day today and I'm really I'm really happy with those turning out actually So I did I did reach up to a couple graphic artists. There's some people that do For 500 a month, one fee, they'll do unlimited graphics for you, but it's not that's really not true because it's like only you can only submit every two days, you know, and they and one guy is very expertise in AC style low ticket funnels and the graphics for that. So I've been conversing with him as well to say, Hey, you know, do you do this? And hope you don't kill me for this. I did go off the track. You're not going to leave me.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can already feel it.
00:02:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Leave me. No, no, no. The YouTube funnel, right? Because I know we want to do the school funnel and stuff, but we want to have a low ticket funnel for it, right? So I'm trying to, yeah, like because that's what we're creating the seatbook, right? Because we're going to do a typical low ticket.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I think it's an ambiguous term. So I'm not super specific about and I'm not obsessed with low ticket at all. So I don't, I don't know that that was my thought about it. I don't know that it's not. you know what I mean?
00:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think it's a very clear defined. It's one of those words that gets thrown around a lot and it can mean different things to different people as to what low-ticket mid-ticket high ticket is.
00:03:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So basically getting a funnel built for sure around product.
00:03:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, But they still take a part I get stuck on. Got it. So I'm testing someone else to create it for me in two weeks instead of me creating the YouTube funnel.
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just gonna see how she does. I would have been willing to do that. I was just waiting for the product to actually be made.
00:03:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Well. All right.
00:03:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to communicate more.
00:03:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably. Because the big concern I have is that I think you ping-pong around a lot of different things and I don't know what's happening. But you have a lot going on. And I think I'm able to do more than than you. We want to ask me for or think I should or whatever, but I've got lots of time and I want to be building it and creating it and I'm kind of just sitting waiting for the most part right now. And I'd like to be useful.
00:04:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. got it. Okay.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, when you're talking about, like, I, it, I got uncomfortable when you said it, I know we're doing the YouTube thing, but these agencies, like, I'm really concerned that you're kind of a flight risk for going up on a different direction. Okay. And so anything that shows up like that, I'm going to be like, okay, are we going to be able to see something through? Cause I'm a steady eddy, like I know something, massage it, but that's also how I don't have to spend hours and hours watching people stuff and hours and hours doing anything because I'd rather spend hours and hours. living my life and being mom and being with the people that I love. I do love work and business but I like it at a really high level and not consuming other people's stuff or I do like learning but not for hours and hours and watching other people's content takes a long time. Market research takes a long time. High level market research you know that's okay but I would really rather spend my time refining one particular thing because that's leveraged and optimized. Agency work is not leveraged and optimized. It can make a lot of money but it's a very very competitive game. You take a wrong client and you're stuck in very bad energy for a long time for months. It's two volatile. I have zero interest in volatility.
00:05:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Okay. That's why I have you to keep me straight and narrow. You're right, we need to communicate more. So yeah, I probably over consumed grant stuff. Yeah.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and if you, if we can really focus on getting the YouTube stuff done and prioritizing that, I know you have a commitment and you're paid, he paid you. So that's, you know, that's, that's, when we're paid, we got to do a good job. So that's the thing. But what you'll get to buy yourself is time to spend time where you want to. You love studying. You love going and doing that. I'm studying psychology. I'm working on a school degree. Like I've, I've got these other things where I am spending my time and doing those things and I want to keep it for that. And then I, I study AI and systems, right? But there's only so much studying that can be done. And so. Well, but but I think and I said before I think that that's something that you're going to need to have is the ability to go study what I say shiny but it's still useful. Yeah, marketing systems, automation, things like that. But the thing that will give you the most freedom to do what you want to do when you want to do it and not worried about is is building a scalable business. Yeah, which you have the built the best foundation for with this YouTube stuff.
00:07:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'm just my cleaner is going to come in any minute now. So I'm just going to put my headset on.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm getting a really bad headache too. So it always makes my like energy worse. Okay, I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not growing up in your anything. I just like energy just Yeah, but um, yeah, and I think for the graph It's all probably end up doing it. I don't want to go back and forth with Maui. I would just rather Set it. I think I've never used Canva, you know For anything big for product images or PDFs because Canva didn't exist the last time I was working on something But I have used it a lot for Etsy designs and things like that and I think it's pretty quick to create a PDF And I'd like to see how it goes or at least to get the framework and then have somebody else go do it I don't I don't think I'm gonna work with now anymore. He just takes too long and his tools aren't quick and Anyway But like for putting the stopwatch on because you were as you did the timeline. don't know if you saw the feedback I put in the loom video.
00:08:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have not no, sorry.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I love the timeline idea I think that um you said you want to focus on 30 minutes because that sounded cool and I think that um six 30 minutes is more realistic for most people. I still think it sounds fast because I think when most people think about YouTube, I think 60 minutes still sounds like, yeah, that's easy.
00:09:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No problem. I gave you hour.
00:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then we were talking about the kind of imagery. I like the stopwatch because that's name for a timer, right? A kitchen timer.
00:09:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But either way, it's something that like starts the stops time.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was the feedback that I had for that. I was wondering if we can use YouTube in the name without it being copyright infringement. So, YouTube FastTrack.com is available.
00:10:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, the actual domain name. I don't know.
00:10:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's in name books, like people have it in books. And so AI says you can, if you use content that is public domain or is licensed under creative common license, which allows for reuse with specific conditions, I don't know.
00:11:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, public domain.
00:11:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But creative common license to us if I have that work can be used often with attribution required required.
00:11:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see, we're just googling YouTube courses as well and see if there's anything that shows up with YouTube in the domain.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But we could use IT, FastTrack.com, and that's available.
00:11:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's pretty commonly understood as YouTube. Yeah, because I would doubt. Yeah, so far on the first page, I'm not seeing any domains that have the actual way. or YouTube in it. then again, because I said YouTube is bringing in YouTube videos. Yeah, I like YT. That's that's good. Yes, I see one guy has a part-timer YouTube Academy as PT YA. That's pretty funny.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Trying to see. I'll just, I can screen share. I mean, look at that thing real quick. Even if the copyright and material you use in your YouTube videos, let's not do it. Oh well. Yeah. I think it might be just safer unless we can get a definitive answer or not to use that. But I don't know if you can use it in the product name or the book title.
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I would imagine you can. I just found a sales page that is how to start a YouTube channel.com. So he's got the word YouTube in here.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, you're talking about it. So, yeah, you have to have all the disclaimers. We're not affiliated with YouTube in any way, like all over the place.
00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Okay. He doesn't have any disclaimers on his at all either.
00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am not trying to mess with the FTC on anything.
00:13:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, speaking of that, on like every Wednesday, do a 10 a.m. and presentation called in my school community. And I'll put in the chat. This one guy's thing. And one of the ladies said, system, diet, I owe that she's using kicked her out. Like she can't use it, said that you're using stuff against violations. And I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, I don't understand. And I've never seen that ever before. And she said, oh, well, I said, what were you saying? Well, I was just selling a digital marketing course, but it's reseller rights to it.
00:14:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I bought it and selling it, but I heard somewhere else that the FTC is cracking down on reseller rights stuff, cracking down on everything there, they're basically an unconstitutional and a legal entity because the government can only be empowered to act on behalf of the people that deputized it with power, which means the people that deputized it with power had to have that power in the first place. We don't have those kind of God-given rights over each other, so the government can't operate like that. But it does, and it behooves them to control small business because small business is the lifeblood of the economy, making more room for large corporations. So the compliance issues are very much don't make claims like one of your domains was like fast internet cash or something.
00:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't remember what it was. that was ages ago, like, yeah, 20 years ago.
00:15:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, like, that would be FTC. Okay. And yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. But I think as long as we make the disclaimers that say we are not in any way associated with YouTube, Google, whatever, yeah, that it's fine and it's good keyword research. Um, I mean, keyword, do you call it?
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Don't mean.
00:15:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But also, I think Google benefits from anybody that feeds its system. Um, you know, so Google and YouTube are the same thing. And yeah. So I feel like as long as we're not doing anything that takes money away from Google, yeah, we're probably safe, but in terms of domains, why tech, what YouTube fast track dot com is available and maybe we get both of them and maybe we build on YT fast track. So if we get slapped for YouTube fast track, which could be forwarded to It's actually built and resides the tables and the HTML and everything. Resartum, ytfasttrack.com, but we have the branded, whatever.
00:16:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it would be easy to transition, or you think, okay, I like it, I like it.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that answers that question. Let's get back to a Trello you had. Oh, so you finally got to the suggestions I gave you for how to keep your time corralled.
00:16:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How did that be? Was it helpful? It was. And I love those answers. So next time I get some inquiries, I'll just send that. Like to one girl last week, I just kind of said, she asked me take it on a new concert and no. I said, maybe in January, you know, and she wanted to meet on Friday and I just said, So yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so No, no, no, no, no. And I inquired when my next payment thing is for Alan's satanic and that's like the guy that Alvin Tan, do you remember that name? He's Alan's right-hand man. Yeah, so Elvis had just let me know before November 24th if you're going to drop out so make sure you don't get charged for the next one.
00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's charging, I just got charged for high level again.
00:17:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no. Yeah, yeah, because I guess my mind went racing a little bit the other day but all these other things because it just does. And then I just realized, oh, you're paying $2.97 for that. And then I'm like, we did it because originally, I think one of the funnel ideas or what we're doing is was going to be maybe making money.
00:17:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The only reason I activated it was because they keep charging me something and they said they'll charge it. I had to get into the account and the only way get into the account was the reactivate agency. So I didn't do that. Uh, for this, you didn't cancel it because of this, but yeah, you just annoy me and a lot of ways.
00:18:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you cancel it?
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, I will.
00:18:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:18:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got a few weeks, but yeah, I'm just, I'm really busy with birthdays.
00:18:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have three daughters with birthdays with the Oh, yeah. How was the yesterday's?
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did yesterday go? It was good.
00:18:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good.
00:18:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. She was a happy girl. Oh. then, yeah, three, three daughters with birthdays from November 19 to December 8. Yeah. And then there's Thanksgiving and I'm traveling. Yeah. And homework and all this stuff, like end of term is coming in three weeks. So lots going on there, which is why I really want to keep focus on this. And I have a light roster with clients. But they're also super high pain. I always want to make sure to really bring my.
00:19:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
aim for them and take good care. Got it. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Slack, my response was yes, I think that we should, I think we should integrate it with Trello because the tasks should be here and so the comments. But the only reason I would say yes to Slack is it's a good interface for having conversations and because it can by directionally update Trello and Trello update Slack. But also it allows for the audio messages and transcripts like Boxer does so we could just keep in those two apps but we wouldn't lose stuff. So like if we say something and you share a link in Slack and it's and I want to get it into Trello there should be integration where I can just you know easily pop that over into like a task or something.
00:19:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, okay.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a Slack account. I can invite you to, if you want me to professional Slack account, and so if you just have an existing Slack account, it'll automatically bring you over without a new fee, I think. And I can create a workspace for us, and then I can work on doing the Trello integrations. Also, if you want any help with whatever you're doing with, what's his name, the grant? Let me know, I'd be happy to help, and also I do want to work on learning high-level. So if there are things that you just want to say, this is what I'm working on, you know, I can put my brain on that, because it's going to be useful to understand that tool. way you've gotten the level I've gotten to and the payments that I get is because I have an understanding of the core tools thoroughly. It helps me hire better, it also helps me architect. the business is better. And so I don't have that for high level. And because so many people are using it, I want to, which means I need to get my hands in it. Yeah, actually doing work is the best way to learn from me.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a tactical learner. Yeah, I am cool. Then that I will think of that. Like right now, I sort of, because as you know, I'm trying to help Sally little bit. So I had Sally kind of doing the, okay, here's the email. Sally now, please go load that up and go level. And she's like, Maria, I know I used to use this a lot two years ago for one of my clients, but they've changed everything. So I don't even know how to connect once they buy the OTO to make sure they get the OTO one purchase delivery email and all that jazz. So, but yeah, definitely, we'll do that. And if you want, you're more than welcome to, I can give you access to it. I bought probably four months ago, a guy that's sort of like an Alan Sotanic, but not as well known or anything, his name's Caroash. He created a course, funnels and branding. that gave away really good templates for System.io and go high level for low ticket, know, funnel service. Yeah. And his training is actually really good the videos because when Sally was stuck on something, Sally, don't know how to do that either. Here's access to this course, go watch this video, he shows you in this video.
00:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I can give you access to that course because it's really good. If you want to, whatever, this is not me trying to get into your your business, I want to learn high level. And I'd like also to help free up your time to work on the YouTube profits. Yeah. I don't need, I don't, I'm not trying to get money out of your project or anything.
00:22:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would just like to help.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Specifically with high level, because I don't have anything to be building for myself at the moment. Okay. And if it can solve the problem and if it can also free up your time so that you can spend more with us on the YouTube and we, we build that. other, then I'd be interested in that. Yeah, my headache is growing.
00:23:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, do you need to get going soon?
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I probably got about like five or 10 minutes left in me.
00:23:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I'm excited about all of it. That's, that's the other thing is I just, I feel like I'm like gonna have a hot flash or something. I felt like I haven't taken my estrogen for a few days.
00:23:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So interesting.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that could be a really. Yeah.
00:23:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'll definitely do that. I also just to help me so I didn't miss anything out on Grant's stuff. I relooked at like from about three, four years ago, I used to use a sauna for getting everything that needed to be done in a what you call it like, kind of like a Google Sheba basically.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just got everything all in one place, right?
00:24:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, yeah, I was not showing anything. I was going to share a screen and show it to you. But anyways, um, like I have a whole, I'm not gonna waste your time on that. But yeah, I have a whole like, you know, blown out thing with doing the front end, the order bump, and then like tasks underneath it, like the end, and the OTO1 and OTO2, and back in the day. That helped me because like when Sally asked me yesterday, um, we honestly, like, like I felt little scattered because I haven't done a funnel for so long, like the details of it. And when Sally asked me yesterday, well, how on go high level do I connect this and even the course, connect the course of the page and stuff? said, well, um, let me just go grab what we used to do, even those click funnels back then. I'm sure it'll have the steps.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because the mapping is, is translatable.
00:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I can always share that with you so you see that too.
00:25:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's pretty good. If you let, yeah, if you want to share whatever so I can see it and help Holly Sally can get the payment for it. I can just go look at it and go, okay, here's how we would do it. And now I understand it, then she'll do it and then I can review it and go, yeah, that looks great. Or if she runs into an issue, I can just be additional support, but that will let my brain like I have no concept of high level right now, because I'm not doing anything. that's just the fastest way to do it.
00:25:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, perfect. Yeah, because I think it's almost all done because we've been dealing with it for last, you know, a few days. But the next step would be after people buy, we want to offer them to book a free call. And I know both me and don't know how to do that in a song and go whole level. yeah, if you want to help with that, that would be great.
00:25:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because build something and sell snapshots and whatever for ourselves, like, we'll all have a better understanding and be on the same page. So it's even more beneficial for us to be doing that too.
00:26:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Oh, yeah, totally. So, um, yeah. So I think I found it like, uh, do you to show you it?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
do you want me to show you?
00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
let me, uh, this is so funny. I guess I realized that like, , I got to get my act together. But yeah, this is, uh, I used to use a sonic mirror. Like this is the micro for funnel.
00:26:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought that's what office was for getting to act together.
00:26:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. It is. But you know what? It's Wednesday and I just haven't had a chance because I wasn't feeling well until like yesterday, right? Or yeah, yesterday morning. And I stopped the intermittent fasting. I think that's what caused it a lot. It screwed up my hormones. Like last night, I didn't have any hot flashes.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So crazy. So it's supposed to make it better. But when my blood sugar is low, I have flashes.
00:26:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They seem the same.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're not actually the same, but do you feel the same? And the other thing is, I think that like my diabetes is acting like type one diabetes. So the longer I fast, the more my sugar rises. It doesn't drop. rises when I'm fasting.
00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's, yeah, and I bet something like that happening. I bet you, yeah, because you know, I started it about 10 days ago, and it wasn't until Monday morning when I went, okay, I gotta stop this. And I had what I typically have, I was like, I'll have protein in the morning. Like this morning, I had two boiled eggs on top of the salad with some avocado, right? And yesterday, I had something similar. I think maybe zucchini or something that was boiled with some pasta sauce with two boiled eggs. I know it's a weird breakfast, but you're like me, because I know you have a steak for breakfast sometimes. Yeah, but whatever my body feels like it needs or is available. Yesterday was the first day and over two weeks that actually could work till 4 p.m.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like because all the other days I wonder if your hypoglycemic and the hypoglycemic Simea is feeling like a hot flash. Because when I first had a hot flash, I thought it was type of I see me because I've had it so much. Okay. And but I'd never had a hot flash before.
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're almost identical. Well, that is interesting. Well, I do have the appointment because I think it took up my time sourcing out someone maybe I should be interested to see. I was processing out a menopause expert, right? Because they're hard to find. So I finally had a discovery call with her a couple days ago. And then next week, I finally will have a full on blow. I paid 299 bucks. It's not a lot to meet with her. And she's a nurse practitioner for over 20 years and she can prescribe stuff. So she sometimes knows more than a doctor, but she was recommended by the menopause society because there's a menopause study in Oregon. There's a few people in Ontario where I live. So anyways, that's where I was sourcing out too. Because I'm like, this is not right. I was getting I was actually, well, probably like you, like, times you get scared, right?
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're hormone also yeah so they all affect each other and everything related so regardless of whether that's what the main trigger was yeah you'll still benefit from getting an update finding out where hormones are and just having conversation about it but you may look into your A1C also okay she she probably would check that it's a good idea to check it and just to see how you're doing but you might also want to get and this is what I need to get done is kidney liver and pancreas labs because they have they all play a function in glucose metabolism if one is not working correctly it can cause the other to work too much if all not working correctly but again insulin it's a hormone and so when any hormone in the body is out of whack and when glucose is out of whack then all the metabolism is
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and all the rest of the system is.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, everything is connected, but the older we get, you know, like if you've taken lots of medicines or antibiotics or just have the DNA for it, those particular organs don't get looked at as much as like the heart does. You know, we listen to the heart rate and they listen to the heart and they listen to the lungs, but nobody's checking the pancreas, nobody's checking the kidney, nobody's checking the liver's. And sometimes the symptoms that they're giving, people have no idea that that's a symptom of a kidney that's having issues or a liver that's having issues or a pancreas. I know because I know where they're at in my body because they cause me pain. Like very specifically, if I eat flax seed, chia seeds, any of the seeds, my pancreas hurts. If I eat it three days in a row, my pancreas hurts.
00:30:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's interesting.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't know that's a thing, but that's a thing.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Whoa, that is that is interesting. Um, yeah, bodies are a lot. Yeah.
00:31:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And mine is a lot of work. Just I have to think about everything all the time. My sister, for the very first time was sick for three weeks and she's like never been sick one in a couple of days in her life. I'm like, welcome to my life because that's I'm in pain with something all the time. My counter is covered in supplements. have like, have my own apothecary between essential oils and herbs and things like that. But, but on paper, I should just be living a really rough life, but I've learned to have a heal so much that I'm not. It would be worse. Anyway, so you've been filling out of work. You're working on getting stuff together. takes a little while, but how I can help with some things. And so, utilize me. Don't be afraid. I will always tell you if I'm like, well, I don't really have that in me or I know I said it out, but I can't like, I'll tell the truth. I will inconvenience myself or whatever, not inconvenience. I will sometimes, but I sometimes, I think it's okay that we do that for each other.
00:32:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's charity. It's good.
00:32:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's good to be in service. But anyway, so taking care of Grant is definitely going to be a thing. And if we could spend the little time and you could just say, just an update, here's what's going on, say, what can help with this, help with that or whatever. So that because the whole goal was, let's make sure Maria gets paid and yeah, that way we can work on building a thing together. And then I want you to keep in mind that as soon as we get to a stability point, which I imagine happens within six months max, you have income, that doesn't take you a ton of time and you can chase all the things that make you excited and light up your brain. And you're so weak because we need to do that.
00:33:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I do it.
00:33:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mine is in my mission and my school.
00:33:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So they're already planned for me.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So so I have that I do it as well.
00:33:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just do it and AI. Well, and yeah, and I would say, and I don't know if I'll end up doing it or not. But if there's any passion project on the side that I thought would be cool is that sort of longevity offer with my mom where I'm actually interviewing her and all that stuff like that would be like, not even for the money, it'd just be cool to do, you know? Yeah, I did.
00:33:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I might be a spirit inspired thing that I really try to pay attention to that because the spirit does not always strive with us. And if we don't take heed to those promptings, we lose And we can lose the gift and we can lose the time available to us to do those things. just keep that mind and where you think that idea might be coming from and make sure that if it's that's something that God is giving you that you meet time for it.
00:34:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. And the other time in the last couple, like probably last week, I had three one-on-one calls from legacy stuff like when people bought for 188 special ages ago or 500 even from YouTube. I always promise them a second call, even though it's only when you go and call it. And I know that's really bad at me, but I was always like, I want to know how it goes once after you implement this for a few weeks or a month, then book a call here. This is the free booking call because I want to know what's going on and so, yeah. So yeah. That's what happened. And so anyways, yeah. So here's the this thing I just YouTube fast track, but here is like the whole micro offer project plan. Like. Micro offer determined the micro offer and then then you've got the seven tasks underneath it to turn it off for offer price I'm not from a look. Yeah in order box. That's very similar to the base camp project outline. I have how cool Yeah, and then emails Right right the email nurture if you come over here and then we have a Google Doc that goes to like template, you know So that's so cool. Yeah, well we because you know for a while when I had the I impossible brand and I brought on a couple of partners Mia Ashley and Sally And what happened there is that me and actually have their own business and that was their priority and I impossible sort of many things So I had that graph for magic that people bought for $27 and then we had like, you know typical funnel for upsell and stuff But real upsell was for $15,000. We'll build your funnel for you So that's why we created this and that's what we have like some some good clients But I just realized unfortunately I just branded them really
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
well with with everything and they were able to go get their own clients from it and I didn't make those agreements if that's why I loved it when I started talking to you and you're right away saying yeah well if clients come out of this venture for you or vice versa we figure out a percentage like that's just the right thing to do you know so yeah so you know this would be great for because we were talking about a Trello project template this could be this could be you know translated to Trello as well where we could create something like that so that's another going back to the original like assignment that we had of yeah the legacy post and also you know all of your assets this is a huge asset yeah so yeah so I can share this in the Trello board for now I can just put it in there because this is like a copy of it but this is the you could say this is a CSE and then you upload it into a sauna each time you know your new client or whatever and then it's all
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like everything so um do you have I think you talked about sharing that Canva template but I didn't see it the one that you were showing me um that have the timeline and all that stuff um I did in in the document um let's see where it is um this is what I'm creating for grant by so is that cool looking um the last up will be something here on the right instead of double of him teaching but uh yeah anyways um can go home let's go I don't even have kind of an SLP for this too look how to create the power graphic um let's go home Canva there it is oops oh you saw it I'm pretty sure this is that youtube profits used to make for new design yeah oh oh so you already have it yep yep yep it's awesome
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, put it in the dock.
00:38:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. But I agree, by the way, and I agree if you on 60 minutes, because honestly, the whole reason, I'll just hit stop share, the whole reason why I had 30 minutes, because that's what the original document had. So I thought, Oh, maybe you left 30 minutes more than 60, but I just like 60 minute fast art is really cool to, you know, yeah, could give me two hour fast start, four hour faster, like, they're just as really cool.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I think one of the things and the ways that we can stand out is not being the type of people, exciting, like, it's it's exciting, but it's not over right. Yeah. Because that's really a marketing thing. And people are hesitant and they pick up on it and they're like, well, if you're going to use hyperbole like that, I know how I'm going to trust you. Like, nobody can trust Donald Trump, because everything he does, it says is extra. The other thing he says is actually true, but everything he says is hyperbolic, like, I, you know, I can't believe anything that you say.
00:39:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, I agree. And a lot of the marketing language is that, so, but I think that there's a way to kind of crawl it and just, you know, anyway, that that's what I was thinking.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like 30 minutes is like, back to my time sheet homework, I was like, it can be done in 15 minutes. It can be the average person is not going to do that. And if they're really thinking about it, it's going to take longer than that. And this is, this is even more than to me, what was happening there. So, um, even if what I would love to see happen is we just update each other.
00:39:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, these are the things that I worked on related to what we did today.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if it's, I've got other things to do. I'm not touching any of this. No worries, but I think if we get comfortable being uncomfortable sometimes or just, you know, and comfortable saying I'm not doing anything on this today, um, and I still like feel like I'm in integrity. here it prevents us from ever slipping into the not being fully transparent situation.
00:40:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:40:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because we're in the practice of being radically open and honest and saying this is where I'm at with things. I just don't feel good and I have too much to do and I can't prioritize this today or I just I'm not going to prioritize it today. And I don't think that either one of us would let that happen to a point of neglect.
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
00:40:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think learning to just us each other and talk about how we're feeling. Because when you're working as partners, it makes a big deal. Stuff happens in our lives that can disrupt us for weeks. How do you feel? How I feel sometimes can disrupt it. week winter is really hard. It's a very volatile time for me. I've managed my energy really well and there will be days and sometimes days on end. But I'm just like I'm not doing anything. say anything. I might do like deep dive, but I don't want to talk at all. Like communicate through text and written, but I'm like, I cannot be on video. I don't want to talk. I don't want to deal with face to face energy or just looking at the screen other than to actually sit down and do my work. So that kind of stuff will happen. I'm not checking out of the work. I'm just, it's just my energy. But so, and I think that you probably have some, some similar stuff that happens, but I feel like you've had to present yourself as high energy and on, because people feed off of that. As a person who other people feed off of, I have had to work really hard to give myself permission to be like, I don't have to smile so that you feel good. I don't have to give you energy because you want energy. When I don't feel good, Because I'm normally very bubbly when people see me. I mean, when I don't feel good or even when I just feel like just sober or Sombre or pensive or any of these things, right? My energy is very different and people freak out Maria.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're like, are you okay? Are you mad?
00:42:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you sick?
00:42:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you something?
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I appreciate the concern, but also it's not your business. I I'm just not smiling and I don't have to explain to you. Yeah I'm just I'm not unhappy.
00:42:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just not up here Yeah, but people really love it when I'm up here because It's contagious.
00:42:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a battery for them. I think you're a battery for other people.
00:42:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh for sure.
00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh god Yeah, and I feel like you probably feel the almost obligation to be the battery Hmm I don't think you allow yourself Maybe even awareness Just be Maria. Yeah, and not have to be super charged and energized and I Say performing but I when I say that I think of like, you know doing videos When you make videos you you're you're we are performing and entertaining our energy matters And it that once that video is made like it's made it lists there forever if you have low energy It's you might as well not have done it right right and you do a lot of video But you do zoom calls and and but anyway, I I think that Something to know is that we don't have to be on Yeah, don't have to be on for me You can tell me and you can just come up and I'm not gonna take it personal or feel like you're checked out Whatever so anyway, yeah, just some really good thoughts. I wanted to share with you.
00:43:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you Um, I wonder Let me see if I have that and and yeah, I was actually even thinking of having Sally Take over every other week the Wednesday calls with the school community So I only do it this month instead of four times a month because you the people are paying five bucks a month Yeah, you know I get take you five dollars. Yeah. Yeah, but there was I have to admit though I'm just trying to find the picture of the Bible thing that I think I showed her for you a while ago, too But I will admit though today was worth it because someone joined from the YouTube video again on Monday, so she's on today's call and she used to be one of these high-ticket, you know coaches health coach Whatever, you know very mature, but she sent me a long message and she came to the I just come to taste coaching call she wants to create a product and Coaching around this is where I know okay. This makes it worth it around helping Women that are managing I've been also taking care of their parents and getting burned out, know, because that's what happened here. Yeah. And I said, well, that's what happened to me, you know, like when my and then when my dad passed, then it's like all these things. So I said, that's really no, well, says, yeah, but you know, all the high ticket coaches say to just teach more from an angle of this is not going to help you make more money and stuff and But if you're passionate about this and this is your calling, then you don't have to have the low ticket offer or any kind of offer figured out yet. Just start your YouTube channel, sharing that, you know, and she's like, that's a minimum viable product. Anyway, our people and she's going to find out they are. Yeah. Well, and what was cool is that she even said, um, she even said, I'm so grateful to have found you and here in this community because like, you just gave me permission, like she was just kind of waiting for a fish because all these other gurus are saying, you know, no, yeah, it's not made it worth it, you know, Yeah.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, this is the other thing about building the thing that makes the money allows us to be to do the things that don't and serve and give back and serve the mission that God has called us to. And I think that is probably a gift that we both share as well is helping other people find that permission because we talk about we're vulnerable. We talk about the good, bad, the ugly and it's the ugly that everybody else hides from. But also, one of the things that I've done is just I break the status quo. don't do what everybody else does, like even why it's sweetheart so many times I was like, Tina, no, don't do this, that doesn't work, you know what, I'm like, I appreciate everybody thinks you're amazing and you're smart and you've made hundreds of millions of dollars. you have to understand your values and priorities are not mine. It isn't about how much money I can make or the conversion rate, it's about accomplishing my mission and what God has called me to do.
00:47:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God will enable me to do.
00:47:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so you need to understand that my metrics are different. And when people are on mission and their spirits are calling them because God is using them, it's the same thing, whom God calls he qualifies. And he also wants us to be successful and financially independent. And so when he puts these things on our hearts, there is a way to be successful, and we need to not follow. There's a scripture to you that says, you know, lean not on the arm of man, but trust in me. And it's another one. Like, why would you be afraid of man where like moth dog corrupt? And yeah, basically, everything dies. But I'm eternal. Why are you trusting them? Oh, for me.
00:47:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And we think, well, these are the experts.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like, I mean, if anybody understands persuasion, it would be king of kings.
00:48:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
things on Lord of Lords and the grand world.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, yeah, I love that. I love that you had that experience. And I think that you know that you're supposed to be a community leader. And I think one of the appeals for me for a low ticket is always that I want to be accessible to people. Yeah. So I do like that.
00:48:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I don't want to focus on that.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to focus on the mission first. And like I said, I think it's the mid ticket and the high ticket that provide the resources to allow us to serve free and low ticket without or burden because everybody else over here that can pay for it is paying for it.
00:48:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So this is the what I was journaling a few days ago, and I think I might share this with you a few days ago too. But yeah, I just love this because when I was reading Proverse 426, consider well. path of your feet and let all your ways be established and ordered, right? Then that kind of reminded me also of like your path to your new self or self-concept, because I was, you know, getting ready to do in the script for my YouTube video went out yesterday and I talked about self-concept. But this sort of, I don't know, I just thought this whole fits consider well the path of your feet. And that, yeah, the path of your feet is to your new, renewed self, too, right?
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
anyway. And we are new in Jesus Christ. He is the bridge. It is walking over with him to our new selves. He overcame death. He's the bridge from death to eternal life. And yeah, I love that. I love that visual.
00:49:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Awesome. Yeah.
00:49:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Well, thank you. So just to think about like where we're at for, so Friday, I'm not working through Monday, because I'm going to be with my sweetheart. Tomorrow, mostly kind of prep I don't I'm trying to figure out how what I can do and spend my time on helping on anything. So because I've answered the Trello questions, I can set up slack. Let me hit highlight this. So I can set up slack and invite you. I can invite Sally if you want. And we can create an area or project there.
00:50:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How do you guys normally communicate, by the way? Well, actually, it's mostly voxer and Google sheet. And then we meet everyone's wall just to kind of have a like a huddle. Yes, that's usually it. But I do prefer slack because now that I'm kind of needing to focus more, I think slack is better. And actually, funny, I actually said to Sally yesterday, I said, I need to restart doing slack.
00:50:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. So, and then I'll look at the slide doc that you put together. And then also we're. gone updating a cover image for us and see what we think about it. then let's choose a domain. If you tell me what words you would like in it, I'll get you a whole list of domains that are available and then we can make a choice so that all you have to do is choose, you don't have to go to name, chief, look and see what's available. we can set that up in a high level account. You have one. I have one. We can use the one that I set up because we can upgrade that to agency later, but it's not. It doesn't matter for the agency. Now we just need to have something built in. And then if you, whatever you've sent to Sally for high level, if you could share whatever you guys are working on level, just so I can like peek at it around my head around things with you. If you give her an assignment and you like CC or BCC me, so I can be like, oh, I'll go look at that on the back end or look at it on this account or something and start being, full in some way, but there has to be a kind of a bridge of getting that going and started. So, and then also if we ended up taking an agency clients together, we'll have some mutual skills and working together on that too.
00:52:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay!
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I would be open to potentially one because the practice of the the funnel building and the system will help me also with the goal of understanding high level and refreshing my memory on on a lot of things that will be useful to us.
00:52:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Great. Well, then we need to get the go-head level going with your stripe connected to it so that we get all connected.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still have accounts in good standing. I can take $10,000 payments and they send it to me in three days.
00:52:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it's very good.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody's like, you can't use it for coaching and consulting. I'm like, My doctors and attorneys pay me $7,000 and they make $10,000. I think the biggest transfer it's made is $19,000 in one day.
00:53:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's going from never, you know, that's great. Yeah, I hate how funny they actually sent me an email saying, we've just increased your ability each month now to like 24,000 on PayPal. I was like, what, where'd this come from? So I think maybe PayPal's trying to take advantage and scoop up business from people from strength. I don't know.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I was making me a fat working capital offer. was like, that's interesting because of the high volume that I've been doing with these different clients.
00:53:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we can get that all set up.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my chest is burning. Okay, so I've got some things to keep us busy for a few days. And let's just touch faces on. Here's what we'll do that's related today. I'm not going to do anything for a few days.
00:53:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And here's when I'm catching up. No, I'll be able to work on it tomorrow for sure. I'm not sure if I can probably. tonight because right after this call, like in four minutes, the lady that bought the paid call, I'm having the second one of her and that's going to our busy and then you shut down for the day. So taking my mom for pedicure up for.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. very sweet. Yes. No, no sweat, no stress. And I feel good about this call. glad that we need. I always enjoy my time talking to you. Yes. All right. Take care. Bye.
