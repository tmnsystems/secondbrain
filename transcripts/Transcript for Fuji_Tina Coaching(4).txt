00:00:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, I forgot to click the last button to finish the meeting.
00:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, good.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. How are you?
00:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Today's the first day back. I, uh, yeah, it was pretty not well to him. Yesterday I called better day before that. Uh, yeah, but people tell me this is the first of a lot of, uh, little weird viruses where I get coughs and runny noses and headaches, so.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, because of the kids?
00:00:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Welcome to parenthood.
00:00:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It may seem okay. may be up for like a day, but that was about it.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Better work on that immunity, Fuji.
00:00:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I know. How are you?
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I'm good. Family drama is fine. That's, that's it. Just, but healthy. We're healthy and getting stuff done.
00:00:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Awesome.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me switch over to your times. So why don't you give me just an update on how the business has gone.
00:01:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's been a couple of weeks since we spoke and well my manager got me the numbers for November this morning so I'll just let me share that with you first.
00:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:01:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We can go over that together how we did.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Oh, I'm getting a new puppy. I'm going to send you a picture. Oh, more just a picture of Ronin. That food Ronin is his dog.
00:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You got any dog?
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm getting a new dog.
00:02:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
He sends me a picture of his big fluffy dog all the time because it's my emotional support therapy. Oh, that's funny.
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He, I just sent you pictures. He's a Yorkie poo, sorry, Yorkshire Terrier, Yorkshire Terrier with Poodle. Oh, he's adorable.
00:02:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is like a cat or something?
00:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dog!
00:02:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
dog?
00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You do not know dog breeds, do you? It's a poodle.
00:02:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's like little, it looks like something with four legs that I don't care for.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ha ha ha, that's okay. I love the fur babies. Alright, are we screen sharing or?
00:02:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Alright, email view the report.
00:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Alright, I hope this email finds you well.
00:02:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You actually, Paul actually updated the one document to rule them all as well so that it is there too.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you. right? I have like all these tabs up and there it is okay so let me look at date. Oh it's from there huh? think now 325 November there we go. What's the difference?
00:03:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah so we got last month we did 315 new referrals this month they're on November we did 330 so we increased by 7.9 percent.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice and that was the first increase since July.
00:03:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah that's right.
00:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So good job.
00:03:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yep I don't know if that was the launches or if that was the the calls that I've made on HubSpot and then we had total number of visits went up slightly by 1.4 percent. about 412, so we're definitely comfortably in the 400s now, which I'm happy. That is not a high, but we're close, so that's good. Yeah, cool. under it, so yeah, we get a little bit more, we're pretty close.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I'm looking at the total RPVs completed compared to the new ones. So that's good. I'll see what's the percentage. No, that's... Yeah, okay, that is the percentage.
00:04:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I clarified with Mark little more about that 500 number we're shooting for, know, for the total visits, and yeah, and he just, he keeps reiterating that essentially that, you know, all the insurances kind of track their numbers of every time a doctor signs a note, whether it's by an NP or a physician assistant. So he's like, you know, they have a rough number of how many you do a month, so he said you just can't be crazy about it, right? That's why he said like four or five hundred a month is probably... It's solid, but you know, he's like, you know, there's no way they know how many you're doing truly, but he's like they can estimate if they start to see yours on like 50 a month. They're like, well, you know, he's doing it for all of it, you know, all the other five big insurance companies. He's probably doing over 400. How is that possible? You know, that's, that's why he said four to five hundred. But, yeah, anyway, so, yeah, and then, you know, was thinking about that a little more over the last couple weeks and yeah, you know, I'm, I think, I think if. If we did go over 500 and my operations are still tight, meaning we're, you know, we're still scheduling visits within two days, we're still responsive to all my, you know, the case managers who send us, you know, we keep our customers happy. You know, I don't mind going above 500 truly. I'm not really worried that they're going to track me down. I don't.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only provider. You're, you're actually taking care of visits, right?
00:05:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're not doing anything. thing that would get you in trouble? Well, I don't see any of the patients. Like, I see pretty much zero patients, right?
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that an issue? I feel like that's what you said might be an issue.
00:06:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If they look really closely, I think, you know, they might be like, well, how did you supervise so many visits? I'm technically supervising five nurse practitioners and PAs right now, physician assistants.
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So... My suggestion would be assume that they will.
00:06:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So...
00:06:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you think up to 500, I could reasonably say I'm watching them very closely. 500, it's like, well, know, two are operating at the same time.
00:06:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing that?
00:06:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right. You know, and the way that you'd solve that is I find another doctor, essentially, to rubber stamp or just full-time supervise my NP. And, you know, at a... cost, that's fine. It's just an extra cost.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it a profitable cost?
00:07:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, we're talking about, I probably could find someone for like 20 bucks a visit to rubber stamp, know, the supervise and I make, you know, we make roughly 300 visits. So there's margin there to spare, if I want to do it, adds another layer of complexity, you know, else in the operation.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, since, you know, what we're looking at is where do we get the growth in across all of your businesses, what has the best margins, what has the best effective hourly rate for you, but also what's within an acceptable amount of risk, there's risk in all business, there's risk that you'll do all this work and that nobody will buy things, delto.
00:07:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right.
00:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that time and that money, that's real. Your time could be spent. somewhere else. So there's real risk involved, but the risk for your breadwinners should be minimized at an acceptable level. But if I like that you're contemplating different things and looking at that, so if you can find way to evaluate the risk, if you can find cases that people have been charged with and precedents and who won them and what did they do to win the cases, what was their business structure, a case is lost, what was their business structure, I feel like you could probably find a safe ground because there's got to be cases there. And I think that if you found maybe five winners and five losers, you could probably find Venn diagram, right? Here's the safety zone where you could operate and consider what kind of expansion might be, not too risky, still within the profit margin, still within the effective hourly rate targets that we have. That would be a conversation, I think, would be worth an investigation that would be worth our time.
00:09:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I mean, right now, I'm just going to keep doing just the basics, right? I'm just going to keep working with the calling the case managers and trying to scrum up more new referrals. then I think, yeah, I'm just looking ahead, if we do hit the 500 visits per month, what we should we do next. yeah, I agree looking into it a little closer.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a ways to go. Well, so one of my favorite things about this is we can do some quick calculations, and I don't know if my brain's going to let me do this, but let's say that we had an 8% increase month over month. the next six months, how long would it take us to get to 500? So we think about this.
00:10:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So 8% of 300 is 20 patients, right? We increased by 25 patients last month. So yeah, it would just be three months. We could potentially get there by February or March.
00:10:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's 400.
00:10:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's 400 new patients, which I assume would translate into 500 total visits.
00:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that's what I call dirty math, right? it's dirty projections, but it's reasonable. It's within the realm of probabilities rather than just possibilities. So what that means is before you get there, you want to have a clear decision as clear as you can and the roadmap to where you want to go, rather than making the decision just once you get there. You know what I mean? prepared because because here's what happens with momentum. it's harder to gain. So when you slow it down, meaning people want to keep sending you referrals, and you have to be like, no, I can't do that. But if you did it, you'd have to do it in another area. So, right?
00:11:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, it's not. I don't think I'd have to do another area. I would just have to start doubling. Well, let me just before we do that, dirty math, the other dirty math I have is the capacity per week. And right now, my doctors have enough capacity roughly. They're doing about 106. There's a hundred and sixty hundred, say, 150 openings per week times, times, you know, four weeks in a month. So that's 600. I can't, we have just right now the capacity with the current physician assistants and nurses I have to do 600 visits a month comfortably. really without any issue.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And once that money actually came in, what would that approximately earn you?
00:12:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We're doing 300 again. So it's 600 times $300 per month. Yeah, 1.180,000 a month times 12. Yeah, 2.2 million a year.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's doubling, right?
00:12:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, that would be done. So where I am now, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the first target, right?
00:12:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is how can we do that?
00:12:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because in my experience, doubling is usually the hardest part because the learning curve of scaling is what you have to learn, right? So you have to learn how to calculate your ceilings, your capacity, and how to, of course, correct, when you realize your calculations are wrong, because it almost always happens. that there is other issues that we didn't predict. And yeah, so you have a fairly simple system, a fairly small team that has the capacity to get to doubling, which is that's my perfect ideal situation. So that's really good. So again, before, so three months from now, you could be at that, we'll call it the danger zone, right? it's the decision zone. We're going to call that the decision zone instead right now, where you decide is it worth exceeding, you know, that particular target mark for the revenue or not? But I think if you can, I think you can find the model that keeps you safe. Yeah. It probably reduces your. Arjun's a little bit, right, that extra $20 to stamp it, but if it increases, if it doubles your capacity for earning, then that's an overiner because that's the issue you have with scale is the margins tend to shrink anyway.
00:14:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just kind of the cost of doing business.
00:14:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think the adding the physician, I think I misspoke. It's more about CYA. If I brought in another doctor, my name's not on the notes. It's just that it's a cover my butt in the long term that some other doctors using their license, not me.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I get that, but you have to pay for that does not not increase your expenses.
00:14:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's about $20 a visit.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:14:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So that's all I'm saying in terms of margins.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will impact the margins a little bit, but not a lot, but it still will.
00:14:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, okay.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's all that's all I'm saying.
00:14:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it. I would love to do that. I'm really. be hesitant because it's hard to get a doctor to sign off like I want them to and not mess up when I set up my notes. Like I like my notes done in a certain way and all the nurses and physician assistants do it my way because they have to, right?
00:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what if though I don't know if this is possible can we templatize your notes?
00:15:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They are already.
00:15:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can we combine that with a editor that says here is my template, here is the information I got, I need you to combine these two so that the information received matches my style.
00:15:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
My templates, there's only about 12 changes they do right now. don't think it's going to get much faster than that. It's pretty tight. Every note is.
00:15:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I mean is if so if you had somebody else come in. Yeah, right. Your issue is whether they take notes the way that you want them to.
00:16:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, they wouldn't have to take any notes. They just have to certify that what the nurse wrote was like reasonable. So they're just reading, you know, and my thing, I don't want them to like, I want them to be like, yep, that looks good.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So then you just have that conversation upon hiring, like, yeah, and you give them multiple examples. Okay. So to me, all of these things are good. If this comes across your desk, I want you to say it's all good. Is that a problem for you?
00:16:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yay or nay? Yeah, you're right. I guess it's just a matter of expectation setting and kind of like we hired our, you know, housekeeper, right? Yes. You know, okay. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't be too scared about that.
00:16:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should actually probably start looking okay. Well, because you can also be quick to fire. If it doesn't work, then move on because you're not going to be scaling up until you have the person that you're positive, right? Um, and the sooner. you consider onboarding somebody the better, especially if they're like, well, don't want to go whole hog and give you all this capacity if you're not sure about this or whatever.
00:17:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So keep that in mind.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you probably can find somebody young and hungry who would like a little bit of extra income is now you bowl.
00:17:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, rubber stamps of notes at night, make an extra 200 bucks.
00:17:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Fuji for real. So, you know, but also you're a great guy to know, great guy to talk to you. Like, there's, there's other benefits on professional relationships. And if you, and if you're thinking about it, like hiring somebody also you don't mind interacting with, maybe enjoy a little bit, these little kind of fringe benefits, they just make business that much better. Um, when, because remember I talked to you when you were hiring your housekeeper about alignment and values, the natural consequences, you probably like those people. when you have similar values. So if you take that into account when you're hiring somebody, but also if you take it into account when you're setting intention for who you want to hire, you're more likely just to attract that energetically. It is the way that it works. And it's just more likely that you're gonna find the person that is gonna fit right in. But if not, it means that you are much quicker to recognize they're not a good fit, why they're not a good fit, and move to the next phase.
00:18:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, sir.
00:18:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:18:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I'll keep calling and calling the first I gotta get there, but yeah, if I do get there, I think it's worth trying to look for a doctor to rubber stamp, essentially my notes.
00:18:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what we really should do is spend some time looking at where the leads came from, call by call, like new person, new referral, referral by referrals, what I mean. And then, compare that to your outreach. We can do that right now. think it'd be a good use of our time.
00:19:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yep. Okay. Oh, and then just real quick, I went through the schedule planner, the Fuji goals plus schedule planner.
00:19:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes.
00:19:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then monthly numbers. shocking. We're at Estranaire at 2.7 million this year.
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was about a million off of my how much we made this year. Nice job.
00:19:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's got to feel good.
00:19:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, you're, you're really no idea. 20. What, how much did you say?
00:19:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
2.7 million so far.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So not quite 30% to your 10 million a year goal.
00:19:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, December and December stuff to come in.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're going to be good months.
00:19:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So we might have to clear 3 million this year. Crazy.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Yeah. That's so good.
00:20:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I wanted 10 million of assets, but now, you know, my goal now is 5 million, you know, revenue, so yeah, we're pretty close now.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can, we can get another million off July, and then maybe- Without being a partner with anybody else and having to, you know, it's not about sharing per se, but it's more about ownership of the business and all the nuance to the business, right? For your time, your schedule, but also the risk and all those other things. So, you know, most people don't get to that level of success and autonomy and freedom and clarity and organization and structure, number one at your age, but also to your age with two kids. So I think that you really should acknowledge that success. It's pretty fantastic.
00:20:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, happy. Yeah. Sustain it for a couple of years.
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll be good. Yeah, but you can. That's the whole thing, it's actually one of my taglines in my teaching and programming and sustainable growth. It's the systems, you have, it's pretty simple systems, simple systems, teams, based off of the values which inform priorities, inform your tasks and everything else. had such a great structure to start with, that when we just put the kind of guardrails on it and a little bit of optimization, it's good, it's just going to get better.
00:21:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, Okay. July looks good, so long as July keeps pulling its weight, then it'll stay there for you.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as long as you keep feeding it, the leads and doing work for it, it will. And taking care of the clients like you are, like that's the end. So acquisition, fulfillment and retention, those are the three main things. If any of them die, the business dies. And different points it's a little slower death but all of those have to be nurtured constantly. So you're on the acquisition now the fulfillment has been part of it and the retention is more about multiple visits if you can get them but also it's retaining the lead sources.
00:22:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was re-listening to the Emith this time I did the Emith mastery and he made a different differentiation between customer and client and he said a customer is someone that uses your product wants but then never comes back or no a buyer maybe he said buyer customer or something a buyer is someone that just buys you know uses my referral wants and never comes back. A customer is someone that keeps coming back to your business so yeah that's to your point that's the tension pieces that if I have a good product which is my you know my initial visits It's my initial consults, and they keep coming back. That's what I really want to see.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm adding it to my, because I could revisit. It's been...
00:23:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I've never listened to the last stream. Remember, I don't only listen to Emith. Emith revisited and loved that book, but...
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Heck yeah, awesome. OK, let me take a look. I was listening, but I wasn't really peeking at the number so much. What's B46?
00:23:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is that Esther's? Yeah, that's Esther's. So that was where the numbers were got a little mucky, but our bookkeeper's kind of cleaned it up, so that's why the numbers were slightly changed from a couple of weeks ago. That's correct. Actually, we're still... The recruitment looks gigantic, and that's not a real number, so I've actually had to yell up my yell. Keepers I need that stratified even more like don't just tell me 52,000 right because I know that that's not all recruitment That's I think 20,000 from recruitment. The other 30,000 is from like I Have like retained kind of reoccurring revenue from another from the from the surgery center that we sold and then I have Some other reoccurring revenue as I have a medical director for a infusion spa, so That's that's that's 7,000 of it. So I know that that's not a true number Anyway, they're gonna break it down Right.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did um Esther feel when you guys got that?
00:24:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's quite shocking. know, we knew we do We knew we were gonna do over a million this year and that's what we we've been thinking But we had no idea that it was 2.7 to maybe do this Hey So this is so my favorite thing about the numbers is
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
most the time they're better than people think that they are. And in a good way, because sometimes, like I'll give Mark as an example, and I said it before, he was going to completely cut Washington out because he's like, it's not profitable at all. And we did the numbers, and Washington was winner. So in that sense, because it actually cost the less to, at least on a money to acquire retainers. That's going to be retention. Well, anyway, retainers, my brain, my brain.
00:25:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I'm actually tracking the health of Mark's business just by the number of referrals he sends to me. So yeah, Washington, New Mexico, Arizona's lagging a little bit.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This month. Yeah, it is. It was actually doing really well. But New Mexico was about two a month last year.
00:25:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And really well.
00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, now it's doing really well.
00:25:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And also it was on the chopping block for a little while. Oh, no, no, no. Exactly, but that's the thing.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing that I taught him is that and you're doing the same thing, but it's business one on one, you diversify. So we're diversifying across states, but the other thing is knowing your numbers. They all have different metrics. They have different revenue potential because of the laws. They have different speeds. Arizona is very slow, not just because of the attorneys there, but also just because of the system. Arizona has New Mexico has less competition. Washington has less competition. And then we're getting into Missouri where it's ideal other than it's a good old boys kind of network that he has to infiltrate. So, but Mark's got the charisma and the personality to do that. And he's got the skill. And then they have an additional law, which is Google GMB won't let him run ads unless he actually a physical office with signage like operating, not just a suite which you can have in other states that collects mail.
00:27:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It has to be somebody.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's nuance to all of these states, but the thing is one of them or multiple of them dip constantly and it's never the same ones all the time. Some of them out of nowhere just fly and they make up for the fact that two other ones just tanked. And if it wasn't for that fact, we would be suffering every time something took a dip, but because we have so many vendors and so many states and we're increasing them, we have built a hell of a moat around the business. no matter what comes out and hits us, there's something to offset it every single time. You doing what you're doing with your lead sources and all of that nurturing on top of of managing the team and the way that they take care of the customer so that your resources and they're very happy. But also, you're going to be looking at SEO and ads and well, that's Delta, never mind. But anyway, just all the different things. we're talking about your revenue, right? So, or your revenue is you've got all these different things to diversify. Let's say July, have them forbid, just wasn't doing what it was doing for a while. Maybe you got some bad press, something happened, right? And you dipped for a while. If your other businesses can offset that for a few months, because six months, I think there's a statistic in it. But basically, most businesses can't survive six months of no revenue. They'll just go completely under. We're at.
00:28:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I had to survive nine months of no revenue with July.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, I could survive another six months. Right. You're already exceptional. What I'm saying is it can get even better. We're like, I mean, that doesn't even phase you in the least. You don't even have to adjust your expenses or your budget or anything. So anyway, that's the power of the organization of the numbers. They're almost always better than you think that they are. There is usually some kind of outlier where, I should go check this real quick, OK, good or bad. And either way, that's really informative and gives you optimization. But my favorite part is is when you look at it and you see all the things that are good that you didn't know, it's energizing. It's motivating where you might have wanted to be kind of dragging your feet before, because you're like, oh, I got to do this. got to do this. He's like, hell, yeah, I'll do that. I'll make $3 million this year. You know what I mean?
00:29:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I feel that about July, because I could see it. And I stopped for so long just making cold calls. Well, they're really cold, but you know, look, yeah. the case managers, it's cold to me. yeah, it stopped for so long and I tried to pay the marketing companies to do it for me. But there's really nothing like when I can call and I get to know the case manager. Because when I look at the referrals, I still know almost every case manager that sends me business.
00:30:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I hear the guy, there's nothing like talking to the top dog.
00:30:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I think that's why it's powerful. And if I could just find one new case manager, that's an extra 30,000 a year almost, if they send me 10 a month. So yeah, it's worth it.
00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now you know exactly what that's worth and a system for acquiring and keeping them happy. So good. And it still isn't it simple though. Like you have to do it. But it's simple, meaning like you don't have to keep figuring out new things. It's it's a Just don't that you just keep showing up for yeah, I'm as long as I do it and I get to do the wrap. Yeah you know and easy are not the same things and Showing up constantly though That simple is not always easy either because you know sickness and all kinds of things so All right, you know the other thing I haven't done any any ways I haven't done any true old because when I first started July even when I first started July I made very few completely cold calls to law firms.
00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
don't know but you know I I could probably start doing that for Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, right where mark is and Missouri I haven't made one and I haven't made one new network to a new law firm and You know That's somewhere that maybe that's the lowest hanging fruit is I just start completely cold calling new law firms in those new states You know if I can get a couple of new referrals each month from Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Missouri, maybe that's easier than California, I don't know.
00:32:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This one's like, yeah. I have, I have to hire an attorney and I just got a call and I just need to know if this is urgent and I need to take it now or if I can wait. Yeah.
00:32:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I missed the last sentence.
00:32:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
was saying if it's worth doing completely cold calls for Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Missouri. The problem with those is that my capacity to serve those states, it all rests on one nurse right now. She does all the, my extra states. So that's why I'm hesitant to really pump those other states more than what Mark does because it's all just a single person problem.
00:32:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And that becomes a bottleneck very easily which can affect your reputation.
00:32:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. And that's why California, have unlimited, I mean, we have capacity to do 600 a month or I mean, what, 400, 412 a month.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how long is that one lady where it's for you from the beginning?
00:33:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
was my first, no, a second hire.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I saw, has she ever been MIA or like just unable to work?
00:33:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Uh, actually travels the world and does the visits from her over country.
00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's in, but she doesn't like get sick or have drama and mental breakdowns. I can't, because it happens. People, people sometimes just can't deal with life. So if that's the case, then you may consider expanding and just knowing the numbers and really going down numbers with her and making a plan and saying, how do you feel about this? Would you like this? you commit to this and just explore it and find out what's possible by real numbers and a real conversation with real expectations rather than an assumption that maybe that's not a good idea. If she's been working with you that long and been that stable, I mean.
00:34:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I, you know, every time I go into a new state, I ask her, like, you know, do you want it? And I think to her, she just wants to make sure her schedule is full because it's just, I pay all these people just eat what you kill, right? You see, if you see 10 patients today, then I'm going to pay you 10 times $35, and that's how we pay. So she's the actually the only provider that I pay 35, the other one's pay 30, but yeah, she has it. She's never asked for a raise, but I just keep, I keep giving it more because she's so valuable.
00:34:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, where's she at in capacity? you have any idea what her capacity is?
00:34:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. We actually prioritize her schedule. We try to get her full, her capacity, she does, I think, what's her name? Elizabeth. Okay. She's a minor. So she does about six hours, so she's right at about 20 hours a week. So her capacity sees three patients an hour, so she sees 60 patients a week, 60 times four. Is a 240 so she does her capacity about 240 patients a month.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're pretty good at fitting her schedule almost completely Usually So I would have that conversation I would do the math if you have other people who can do other states and she doesn't want to do other states like I would Figure out what it would take to Be able to get more Washington Have her fulfill it and balance out the rest of your load I think you need to pivot a little bit who gets what maybe But I would definitely do a Forensic type of inspection of what the possibilities are Before making any kind of decision.
00:35:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have a feeling there's more for you that you'll feel confident about if you do that Yeah Yeah, and then the second thing is like, you know completely cold calls. I always I was thinking, you know Maybe I can get Mark to get, Mark's actually already given me a couple warm introductions to law firm in Washington. And so I was thinking maybe we can, I can get a couple more from him there. And then I work with the physical therapy place agape. They do it all the states that Mark does too. could ask the owners there, hey, can I introduce, can you introduce me? Some new lawyers that you might have met, you know, so.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm trying to think the other thing.
00:36:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, sorry. One more, one more thought about that is I was watching YouTube's about how to call. I'm not, you know, when I call people, they've already used my service. So it's a different call than being like, hey, you've never used my clinic. And so I was kind of watching videos about how people do a cold call or a warm call. And that's quite different than how I do it, right? I kind of like, I. And on the phone, like, oh, hey, nice to meet you, case manager. I'd love the opportunity to do a console. But that's not how really good salesmen on YouTube do it. They ask a lot of questions. They're like, what are you looking for? What do you need? lot of questioning. then if it fits, they're like, hey, I can see your clients and solve this need you have. So it's quite different than my phone calls. So that's the thing. Like, I should do some training or like. Sales training would be very good.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark, how'd his team go through Black Swan's company? And it's Chris Voss never split the difference. And it's about sales and negotiations. I'm sure it is worth your time to study and read. Just the psychology of it is really great. But then the other thing is you want to do the numbers, right? So how many calls does it take? you to get a new case manager, a new referral source. That number should improve as your skills improve, not just on the phone, but in your research and targeting of who you're trying to even call. However, there's more than one way it's going to count. Where did that come from? It's so weird and so stupid, but I just said it. There's also a different, know, newer age approach that you can do that's by the numbers and I don't know if it's better because I don't know how many, you know, if it's worth this on a numbers level, but there's services like a video service called Bonjourno and you create sales videos and you can, you would make it specific for each person. So rather than a phone call, it's a video and you can be like, look, it's not AI, here's today's paper, that kind of thing or whatever. And be like, hey,-and-so from this firm, whatever. And then you can call them and you can voice drop. voicemail drop, right? So instead of actually call them drop a voicemail. Hey, this is Dr. Fujinaka. I just want to whatever and I made you a video. Just, you know, it's real. I really made it for you. So until name, I promise this is not AI. I'm doing personal outreach. I would love to talk to you one on one. You know, we don't have any robots or anything like that. And just really highlight the personal part of it. But you can let the video do a lot of heavy lifting for you. And also, if they're not in a great space to remember what's great about you, it's pointed out in the video. And you can follow it up with like, here's a link to, you know, the bullet points. Here's my contact information. Here's all of this, you know, like, I would love to talk. can really personalize a fairly automated outreach.
00:39:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's kind of cool. You know, interestingly enough. I, I talk to the case managers, like they'll actually pick up my call, like a shocking amount of time, like over 50%. I'm actually talking to the person. And when I listen online, they're like, you know, that's, that never happens. It's like, oh, they only get through to 10% of people. So my issue isn't, isn't getting them. It's, it's doing sales, closing the sale, you know, with them. But yeah, you're right.
00:40:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you could record some of your calls and let me listen to them and I can audit them with you.
00:40:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have, I have them.
00:40:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anytime you want to listen, or you could send them, and that could be how I make up the hour that we didn't do last week.
00:40:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair. Okay. I'll record more. I have like, 20 of them. So, yeah, it's all on the day average. Like, how much time is that? Three minutes each. I mean, it's, you know, I guess I feel very uncomfortable and they could probably feel that, right? Because I'm asking them to send their client to my clinic. Okay and yeah.
00:41:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:41:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The thing that keeps me going is like I know that my clinic can help them like if I just I'm just not articulating it right or I'm not probing them so they feel the need or they feel the burn.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well both of these are in my wheelhouse so I can help you with that so send them over let me listen to them you should go get that book never split the difference um see what you gave them. It's a negotiation book so it's sales psychology um but well so okay he was an FBI negotiator a hostage negotiator. Yeah I see but the basic talk actually. So but but here's where it is and this is why psychology books are probably my number one thing over any kind of business and leadership um because all leadership is psychology for the most part it's it's also I don't know, integrity in operations, but if you can't read and persuade people to do things, it doesn't matter what things you have to do and how well you have a system for them to follow, you can't get them to follow you. And persuasion is about psychology, the art of war, it's all about psychology, it's all it is. It's like how you observe people's behavior, why they behave that way, what their motives are and how you know that it's all psychology and how you deal with people behaving this way, that way and this way. It's all psychology.
00:42:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So is there another, someone like I like to pick one person, I just don't think Chris Boss is like a salesman, he's a negotiate, I mean I get it, but he helps sweet love for sales?
00:42:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So.
00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll talk to more about it, I mean if there's someone else that's you know specific for call that's what I want to learn from. I mean, yeah, I mean, I'll ask them to see.
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there are, there are cold call sales experts. And if you want to, I like surgical cuts, precision cuts right to what you want to get to. So if it's cold calling specifically, then I think that that's, that's a good thing for you to do.
00:43:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Well, let me talk to Mark to see if this fits. I just don't want to fit like, I mean, I get it like more knowledge is always better. Like, I'm a big knowledge person, but like, this is a very specific use case that I want to learn. And it's like, I got the contact, I'm speaking to the person like every, I probably treated one of their patients before. So like every advantage that people on the internet are like, you know, they're like, oh, you need to try to do these things. Like I have all those. And I'm still not closing that final piece of the sale. And that's, so that's why I want to like, I don't know, develop a script.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to come down to questions, it's going to come down to you, finding out what people need, what they want, and more important than out with the gaps are. So figuring out what is the thing that doesn't set them off. If somebody asks me a question, get the hell off my phone, I know who are yourselves, I don't want to talk to you here. That's how I am. Now, they might be differently, so you might say, Hi, I'm Dr. Sajinaka, I do this, whatever, and how to highlight, either you start with the questions, and I would kind of split test this and see what works out better for you. And so either the questions of, you know, do you have more patients or more clients than you have doctors to take care of your doctors, getting your clients handled within X amount of time, which you already know is your time frame, are you getting the notes that you need that are good for your cases, or that from
00:45:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I've literally never tried and when I and this is this is what YouTube was telling me to do like when I listen to them They're there those questions. They're like you need to find that stuff out and I'm just so nervous to ask For that.
00:45:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's the thing if they're pet peeves I can't get a doctor to give me things within a week or 72 hours or 48 hours or whatever if that's on their mind They're gonna gush it out of you.
00:45:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see Maybe I'm just not give them a chance to gush it because I just start I'm like hey I see initial consults. I order them rise No, cuz you're making it about you when you ask questions you make it about them But how do I but I'm always afraid that they're gonna ever respond like you do is like I hear a question You're trying to sell me or you're like and then that's not your person and you move on But not everybody is me.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am nothing like most people I see I see them a mile away.
00:45:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Most people don't I used to pick up women is like okay I could do my normal game and then if it doesn't work then yeah Okay, and then you got us there.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you obviously did something right. Hey, okay.
00:46:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so Maybe I'll try to come up with a little sales. He's not like a script.
00:46:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But like Ask the opposite questions that will lead to making you look good. So what are your bullet points about why they should work with you?
00:46:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's really about the customer service and I can get them their initial consult for their patient within 72 hours What else? We are very responsive if they ask us a question by email or phone the case managers I we pride ourselves in responding to their emails. We're not gonna like ghost them What else you got to give me through at least How do you take care of the patients? Absolutely, we you know, we do we I don't know how you say it like Okay, so you made an all their injured body part
00:47:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whereas ERs would you know just say oh you're neck in your backer we make sure that everybody that got injured in the crash is Documented on the note we take pride in that and we Second so I don't forget these things So the question to the first thing is What is the average amount of time it takes you to get your clients when you were when you refer a patient to a doctor What is the average amount of time it takes you to get them returned to you if it's over 72 hours You're you're you're in but you don't go there yet. Okay. I just want to ask you two more questions How do you how do you get them to agree to even answer your questions? I'm dr. Fujinaka.
00:47:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm a chiropractor and I wanted to know if I could ask you three questions Okay, yeah, sure go ahead.
00:47:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes or no or what are they about? And it's about Your your PI science and the doctors that you refer out to, would that be okay? Most people are going to say yes.
00:48:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. So then ask the questions and they've already told you that they will answer three questions, maybe you have five questions. I see, okay.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then you tell them, like don't lie, so whatever the number is beautiful about that. I'm not saying manipulate, but I'm I'm saying ask them three, but if you ask that expectation, yeah, it's like expectation setting, right? Just like, hey, I'm not going to take up an hour up, but I just have three questions. Okay.
00:48:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right. Yeah, speak to women.
00:48:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's great. Okay. So you already know how to do that.
00:48:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
but.
00:48:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how many of the case managers are female? um, who did you see the correlation there?
00:48:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. So, okay, I'll lead off and then ask a question that kind of leads them. So, hey, how after you refer one of your clients to a new doctor, fear for a console. How long? Like, how long does it? Yeah, how long does the doctor take to see them? Okay, something simple like that.
00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Um, and then the next one is actually going to be the third one.
00:49:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you leave it open ended or do I throw in something like how many days does it take for the doctor to see him? Or do I be like, how long leave it open ended? I guess open ended.
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Open ended is great because they give you more information sometimes.
00:49:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Not just like one day.
00:49:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That that information can really help you go. They're bitter. They're angry. They're not in big need, you know, or they'll say, well, most of them in X amount, but I've got some to do this, you know. So I like open ended unless you find somebody is just on a tangent and then I switch to close I'm happy when they talk to me.
00:49:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I I I I prefer when they are, you know, talking more they tell you.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, number one, if you even want to do business with them, but two, how to do business with them and let them sell themselves on you. And here's how they do it. They tell you everything they need and we you tell them, this is what I do. Look, here's it on a website page. I already put it out like the things that you just said. Let me just show you. This is what I offer. So like it's pre-written. You're not making it up as you go. These are my people's. These these are my my my things. That's not the word I'm looking for. can't think of what it is. But anyway, I'll practice that.
00:50:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll practice that opening where it's like, here's Dr. Fujinaka, whatever. Do you mind if I run three quick questions by you and we'll take too much of your time?
00:50:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:50:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, great. And then so that first question is asking about the time because and then how would you ask a question about service? Like the second thing is like, you know, my. clinic, when you ask us a question like, hey, my clinic skin my patient's scheduled? Hey, what is their appointment? Hey, did they finish? You know, we're actually going to respond. That's what I pride myself on is customer service to the case manager.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do you find when you you know, refer your patients out to doctors, are they seen in a timely manner? Are you getting the report sufficient to win your cases quickly? Is it communicated well?
00:51:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Are your clients happy that they went to the doctors and they communicated well? That's brilliant. That's a good open-ended friend. Are you, do the, does the doctors office communicate? No, that's a yes or no question, but how well now?
00:51:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What on it?
00:51:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How does the doctors office communicate with you? Yes. How do you feel about the way the doctors communicate with you? How do you feel about the way the doctors office communicates with you?
00:51:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now that you've sent their
00:52:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
open-ended.
00:52:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whatever is the stuck in their crawl kind of thing, they're going to tell you what they love, which is probably not going to be the thing that they say, but rather the thing that annoys them, what they're going to tell you. If they well trained and well vetted their doctors, that's also going to come out. But the chances are that they would welcome somebody who already knows how to do that and wants to do that does not be trained. So all of this should wait for you unless somebody is apathetic or absolutely full of doctors.
00:52:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I just want to get off the phone.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Apathetic falls on that.
00:52:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I've had a couple of calls when I'm like, man, this person just wants to leave.
00:52:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you ask, I'm sensing that maybe this is not a good time for you.
00:52:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Would there be a better time? I see. Okay. Oh, yeah. I didn't hear that on YouTube. was like, get their permission to speak for a couple minutes.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:52:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
study sales but I study people and yeah that's it all you have to do Fuji is just like pay attention to people you you can read that this is like one of my hot female friends would be like oh just be confident I know but like I want a plan so I like I like having a plan so I think these questions that I could and then once I get good at them I have the capacity to listen but when I'm just practicing I have no capacity to like feel people not an person but when I get better I will then I'll learn just yep it's good okay so what's the third thing if I want to emphasize that I take care of the patients well by documenting what's hurt like I'm not gonna miss injured body parts ruin their claim right so that's exactly it statistically what percentage of cases do you get back from doctors that have all of these information that you need, all of the reports that you need, so that you have the best chance of getting hitting max policy limits on your claim. Max policy limits.
00:54:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, how often do the doctors give you? How often do your doctors that do initial consults? Right, it's solid note that allows you to hit maximum value for your K or something, whatever you said.
00:54:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Max policy limits. So because...
00:54:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What's the operative word? it how often? How do I do it open-ended? It's like tell me about tell me about the doctor's notes that you get back and if they help you achieve maximum policy something like that.
00:54:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't have to be open-ended. If there's anything less than 100% Do you would you like a doctor that has that gives you that?
00:55:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so just how often would be how often or what percentage of sign is the doctors?
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you satisfied? Oh, okay. Equality of the notes of all of your referral partners because they give you such a thorough report that you're able to maximize policy limits as frequently as you feel you should have been able to.
00:55:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, let me let's just stop there with those three. Okay, so I'm going to lead it off like I'm picking up the woman and be like, hey, I'm this person. I have five minutes. Do you have five minutes just to answer couple of my quick questions, three questions, and then I'll launch into them. I'll do just like that and then let's try it 10 times just those three and then I guess afterwards, I don't know how you I lead into my sales pitch, but essentially like make the transition from questions. Like you get to the last one. So make sure. I would be perfect if you don't know.
00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it. So you just make sure.
00:56:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Buy my clinic or buy my console with your clients.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there are video calls. You can be like it. Okay. So make sure that the last question is the one that is the most meaningful to them. So maybe run it by Mark or a couple other ones. What's the sexiest thing that I can say to them? probably going to be. The return time and policy limit.
00:56:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So maybe putting those two together.
00:56:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and maybe that particular order because sandwiches by starting with a powerful question. An important question power question right at the end. And that one directly correlates to money. Say, well, the reason I was asking you that is because I want to see if maybe we might be a good fit. And here's the breakdown. This is what I do. short and sweet. Absolutely. As possible, tell them, I do this, I do this, I do this, and I would love to be a referral partner for you and take care of your clients. Take excellent care of your clients.
00:57:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can I count on you? How can we stay in contact so you can send me your first case?
00:57:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's an assumption close. But it can be a little bit, it can be a little bit cocky. So they have to be in the mood for cocky. Confident is okay. Cocky could just be a little bit too much depending on how woman feels about that particular energy, what kind of mood she's in. So you could say, if that sounds good to you, what I would like to do is give you my information. And if you want to send me the next case that pops up in this zip code, this, whatever, send it to me. And I'm going to show you how I can take excellent care of your patients. So that's still an assumption close. but it's not cocky do you see it's a it's subtle did you see any kind of difference yeah less cocky yeah that's that's all it was there's nothing wrong with that some woman be like I love a guy who drive let's go you know that's great or a doctor a lawyer whatever you know had to do that because you know I'm Asian and Asians are very passive so I had to throw that in at the end of my nights you know I attended girl how can we hang out again yeah but even that was not as much as the first one okay because that was how could we hang out again not like when can I take you out on a day huge difference same question I see first one was like how can we stay in contact you okay yes so but you don't want to stay in contact like when you have this next opportunity I'd like to prove myself to you so that's humility
00:59:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, yeah, and then like I even have one more because I'm going to start offering pro bono but essentially I'm going offer these the first one or two cases with these law firms for free. So I have that but I won't throw that in yet.
00:59:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, yeah, so yeah, I just like this is just like a flow.
00:59:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, I love flows. Okay, all right. So I'll get that permission if it's a good time and if I could ask them three questions it'll be quick. I'll them my three first ones are very open-ended, second one a little bit less. one is my breadwinner, whichever one I figure out is that. And then I'll say, hey, just this really quick, enter into my clinic and then kind of close with, hey, you know, for the next case that you get where the patient lives in the boondocks, you don't have a doctor for them. I would love to show you what I have. Can I send you my information and email afterwards?
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Cool. And also I'm still calling you to send me one referral. Yes, so I love an accountability question. I love it and then you be quiet until the answer. Can you send me one and I would do a pro bono? Like something like that or not? I do the first case pro bono.
01:00:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Why not the first case pro bono?
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because it costs you almost nothing. It's only one but it's one. Yeah, it's one more than most will do. So it's all so, you know, like sometimes an extra dollar in a tip. Sometimes a $5 tip will make a person just as excited as a $50 tip. But they didn't know $50 was on the table. They got five. They're happy. You know what I mean?
01:00:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I just worry because the case managers aren't usually paid, you know, per case or they aren't paid for settlement. But that's why I was like, if I throw in a monetary like free case, they're like, I don't care. It's not my money.
01:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. You know, and that's a great point. So. But, you know, don't put on the table what you don't have to, and you haven't had to do that before. and I don't, I'm not a fan of gimmicks. I am supportive when somebody wants to try something, I don't, I don't like things that cut into margins like that. I also don't like things that set the wrong dynamic and gimmicks can feel like they can feel like a gimmick.
01:01:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I just want to try the case management or something because I always heard, YouTube is like, if you can give them something for free, people want to reciprocate giving, so it's not trying to give them something right.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, this is where I diverge from a lot of sales tactics, because I also, I mean, there are people who don't want to feel beholden and they like that, but, but it could be, you know, I just want to send you something for your time. It just feels like a sales page whereas the other thing feels like a mutual relationship that I'm asking if we can start but here's how I can show up for you.
01:02:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay yeah and just be outstanding yeah I believe we are outstanding and I do believe that so it should come through that yeah I don't need to give you anything but you know also I do want to work with you.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any reviews that they could I don't want I don't want I don't know if that's how it works.
01:02:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't want any public attention in my clinic you know so that makes sense. I tried cancel all google reviews and google Yelp ads that come up yeah um I am completely with you all right so all right I'll let you go this is over time so uh no I told you I can go over time and but if you want me to listen to your sales calls we can use it for that so so we have to you. I think I have a really good plan and
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
uh next week i think uh let's see next week i'm going to give you an assignment though okay the assignment is you need to um correlate whatever you can to your outreach and the the visit you got this month mm-hmm okay yeah i got i'm gonna actually talk to my manager paul um he was asking like he should he actually asked like hey should we keep track of how much they send us after we send them a lunch so i said yeah i need to figure out how we do that i just don't want to have like a thousand spreadsheets for him oh you don't you just so hubspot um maybe you can put a link in there for referrals but you already have a spreadsheet where you're tracking them so um yeah you just you may have to add a column or two to the existing spreadsheet oh yeah like a count the number of Yeah. Okay. And but month over month, so then you can correlate it to whatever, like we can figure out how to automate it. But for right now, you always start with the manual data. And then when we look at the data and where we got it, the automation show themselves.
01:04:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. All right. So I'll work on tracking the money we've spent on the lunches, see if that if that pays out. And then secondly, I will do at least 10 case manager sales calls with my new found flow chart.
01:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
