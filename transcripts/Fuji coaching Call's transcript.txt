00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Esther: Can you hear me?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I can. How are you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Esther: Good. How are you? Uh? Where's my video? I literally just tested before we oh, Hi! There we go!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Tina Marie: It's Esther in the office. Now. Wait, I can't tell, because everything, Fuji, you're not where Fuji normally is. Are you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Esther: I am. He's his desk is right next to mine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Tina Marie: Are you there. It just looks a little different.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Esther: It does. It's the same like I blurred. Um, yeah, it's the same office. Um, he's just next to me.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Tina Marie: Well, it's nice to see you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Esther: You too.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Tina Marie: Go! Oh.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Esther: I'm so glad that I'm the one sitting face to face with you this time, and not him.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Giving all the goosebumps and stuff, and then I'm not gonna be able to focus.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Tina Marie: Alright, I'm gonna go open your notes as to.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Tina Marie: Um. I had them hold on a second. You do all the planning so that everything's ready, and then you know what happens.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Esther: Yes, right? Something goes wrong.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Tina Marie: Goes. Wrong. Okay. I am not.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Tina Marie: There we go! Nope! Um. Oh, did you get the invoice that I emailed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Esther: I did get it. I just need to double check with Fuji, which credit card he wants me to use.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Esther: Cause. We've got 2 different business credit cards and. He was like. Oh, last week, he told me. Oh, let's use this one from now on, and now I forgot which one it is. So I gotta.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Esther: But I'll get that paid today. Yeah, thank you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Tina Marie: No problem. I just wanted to make sure. Um, sometimes, you know, things get lost in spam and all of that. So.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Tina Marie: There it is. Okay. Um, so that's why I always want to check, especially with someone new that. I have aggressive spam filters, but I also have.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Tina Marie: Like. I mark all my people as Vip, and all the things that I said. Hi, do you? Do you need to be out.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Tina Marie: My dog. Okay, do you just need to be held? I left for a few days and. He um! He got really sad. You want to go out.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Esther: Oh, yeah, that's really that's understandable. He misses his mama.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay. So. Um! I would love to know how what you've been contemplating since we've we've spoken.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Tina Marie: I know this, we had a really long email. That was good. Let's see.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, yeah, I'm just gonna have to go back to that one, because I remember what we talked about. And I have my notes. But what I wanted to add in it was what you had sent to me so.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Esther: Mhm, cool. Okay, no, all good. Um, that email I wrote you. I think that will hold true for some time, anyway. So um, it's not necessarily specifically, you know, um.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Tina Marie: Um. Yeah.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Esther: You know, related to any like topics, just kids in general. So what I've kind of been contemplating.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Esther: Is this idea of really just balancing the kids? And you know. Where they fit into priority, wise with everything else that.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Esther: I may be exploring or want to do. And I think what's been a little bit.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so, sorry.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Esther: Eye. Opening. Oh, yeah, all good.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Tina Marie: This never happens. It never happens, Esther. It's it's it's the, you know, when new things happen. And you're trying to get a rhythm. There's always that resistance, so we'll just land. Sorry.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Esther: No, no, don't, please don't apologize for that. That's totally fine. I I understand. Um.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Tina Marie: Thank you. Okay.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Esther: Yeah. Um. So one of the things that also prompted me to reach out to you, too, is that there is a potential um opportunity that came across my table. Um Fuji has a friend who runs a real estate investment company that primarily focuses in on Mobile home parks. I don't know how much he's told you about. Oh.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Esther: I don't want a car anymore. I want to buy a mobile phone park. Anyway, this is like mobile home parks or something. He's always wanted to um own commercial real estate or real estate.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Esther: Um. And I I understand why there's a lot of tax benefits to. That come with um owning real estate.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Esther: And and everything so. In short, we were thinking that because he's a physician.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Esther: It would not make any um. It's not logical or defensible for him to try and achieve real estate, professional status. Um, that just doesn't really fly um, you know, because of his profession. So then the next logical thing would be having me do it. And then the last couple of years that we just haven't really found anything that.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Esther: I love about it, or any kind of work that would give me that status. Um that I'm really into. I would love, or that I would actually have a mentor to kind of guide me, because I literally have no idea.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Esther: About real estate, so um fast forward. There is one of his friends. He owns a um. Real Estate Investment company that primarily um buys mobile home parks.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Esther: And um, you know he'll hold them for a couple of like a few years.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Esther: Refurbish it and everything, and you know he'll sell it at. You know, you know, a multiply like cap rate, or whatever um, so. And this guy he's done several of these deals himself, and he's really just starting out. Um.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Esther: You know, making his own like company, to do these deals before he like worked with someone else, and everything. And so he.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Esther: Came to me because he's parting ways with his. You know, Vp. Of marketing and operations. This gal who is doing that.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Esther: And um. He came to me to see if we had interest. In, you know, you know, filling that role for him.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Esther: Now um. I think on the surface level it sounds interesting. Um, cause I'm I'm kind of a geek for operations.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Esther: You know. Um, when people talk to me about business operations or processes and stuff, that's the kind of thing that gets me excited. Right, and you know you've probably heard Fuji maybe mentioned here and there. You know how.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Esther: That's the kind of thing that I really enjoy. And um, you know the processes that I've built for our businesses. Um. The only thing is, though I have. I am.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Esther: Not sure how exactly I want to approach this offer. One is because um, I do see some potential red flags.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Esther: With working with this person. Not because I think he's a bad person, but I they're just things that kind of tip me off that he's like kind of green.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Esther: You know he's um. He might be really really good in his. Um area of expertise which is finding these deals.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Esther: Doing the due diligence, operating and managing these parks, and then turning it over and making money for his investors. But um.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Esther: I think Fuji and I concluded that he. Doesn't. He doesn't know how to build a team.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Esther: And the person that he had brought in that gal. Um. He brought her in a year ago. They're parting ways because I think they're just having. Grossly mismatched expectations.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Esther: Um. He gave her 20 or 30%. Gp. Or something insane like that, plus I don't know whatever it is.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Esther: And he tried to offer me the same. Uh which I was like. Why would you give me that much where you literally don't know anything about me?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Tina Marie: It's because of what you just explained. He's not good at anything. His his ability to make money. Is his strength. So what he does is throw money at people and at problems, and.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Esther: Yes, exactly.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Tina Marie: Specs that well, I paid you. Fix it so he abdicates power with money, and when people realize that they don't have the power.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Tina Marie: Because he holds everything, and he's part of what needs to get done. So answering questions, giving advice, um. Creating the solution, hiring somebody whatever they get bottlenecked. So they're told to do something they're not supported in doing. Money's never enough for that it's it's kind of a hopeless situation.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Tina Marie: But if you structure a deal right.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tina Marie: If you make sure that you're not having your hands held. That kind of situation can be very good, but if you can't structure a deal like that, you should run as far away as you can.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Tina Marie: But I could help you structure a deal.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Esther: Yeah, that's um. Thank you. And you know, that's really in line, what I what I'm what what I was telling Fuji, that I think his problem is like. He, the way that he was speaking to us to telling me he.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Esther: You know he thinks that throwing the money or the equity out is going to fix the problem. And he I was just like, you know, he hasn't really learned his lesson with Kelsey this other gal he's based. I told Fuji he's literally.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Esther: About to make the same mistake with us, except, you know, I am able to say no. Hold on a second. We need to talk through how we're gonna structure.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Esther: So, and I totally agree with you. Um, that's kind of the red flag I have with working with that kind of. Personality, plus the fact that he wants to throw money at the problem, ie. Me. But he also doesn't seem like he wants to.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Esther: He's very. He might be very selective in terms of what control he's abdicating. He's okay with abdicating control until he doesn't like what you're doing.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. That. That's what. Actually, that's the hand getting the hand side that I'm talking about. Yep.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Esther: You know. Yeah.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Esther: Exactly so, you know. For example, she he brought her in to be the Vp. Of marketing to do marketing, and when she made her suggestions, you know, based on her expertise. He didn't want to listen to her. He don't want to do it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Esther: So I'm like, Okay, well, that's gonna be really difficult to work with a personality like that. And I definitely do not want the 20 to 30%, whatever he wants to give me.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Esther: Um, because. You know, silently, with that means.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Esther: You know he's not. He says that, but then he also goes like, Oh, you can work as much or as little as you want, I'm like, no, no, no, it's never like that. When you give away that much.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Esther: There's the expectation that he's not saying there that he expects you to. Yeah, there's an expectation that he has inside that he's not. He's not saying.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Tina Marie: But they can fix that in a contract. You can. Yeah, you can fix that in the contract. So you you can take the money, because what you would be taking is the burden of.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Esther: I can. Yeah.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: Teaching him and corralling him when he doesn't want to be corralled. But you would tell them ahead of time. You've sabotaged yourself and your company by making these choices like you really need to be that frank and bold with him. If he can't take that. If you can't have that conversation, you can't work with him.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Tina Marie: So. But if you can tell him, do you realize that you've sabotaged yourself, and that you put yourself in a situation where nobody can win, and that's why your lady left you and everyone else is going to leave eventually, because you've created a situation where somebody can't win. And if he will not hear any of that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Tina Marie: Just stop talking and be like, Yeah, I don't think this is for me, and just move on, because if you um.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Tina Marie: If you can't, if there is no even kind of um. Acquiescence, to.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I. My Mo basically is what's sabotaging these things. And there's no awareness at all.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Esther: Okay.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Tina Marie: Um his ego. His ignorance is all just going to be too much work, even if he says I agree.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Esther: Yeah, um, I totally agree with that. Um. You know, and one of the things you know, that I had told Fuji was like, you know.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Esther: If I decide to work with him, I think one of the ways that I can approach it is a project based. Approach. By hours. I don't want equity. I don't want anything that would.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Esther: You know, essentially open up the door for infinite, whatever it is, you know. Well, you know, I think maybe I could. Identify like certain needs that he has.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Esther: And do you know and present to them to them to him as a more of a project based model with, you know, hours that way we could. I have a lot of control over the scope. I have more control over the scope and.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Esther: Control over the time. On. So that's 1 of the ideas. That's the best idea I have so far.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Esther: I did. Um. I also do not necessarily. You know, agree with where he wants to take the business.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Esther: Um right now.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Tina Marie: Can I ask you a question. I want to listen.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Tina Marie: But um. Just just thinking about this. Do you want a job like, would it just be because it's fun for you? Not because of the money, because.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Tina Marie: And if you're doing it hourly, what would you be doing? Because you have such huge earning potential. That you and you only get so many hours, especially with kids.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Tina Marie: That if you say yes to this, you pretty much give up all your other yeses. You have finite yeses.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Esther: Okay, I love that you um kind of brought me back there because. The point of all this is that I told Fuji.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Esther: I only want to do the bare minimum to achieve rep status. If I'm gonna do anything. And I don't even know that any of the projects or things that I would work with him on.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Esther: Would qualify for materially participating. So my guess is that it may not.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Esther: Rep status is only requires me to have 750 h in a year, which roughly works out to 15 h in a week, which roughly works out to about 3 HA day. I think that's doable.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Esther: Um. But I do not want to go above that. The other thing I told Fuji to say, too, is that okay? Well, if if we achieve rip status.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Esther: How much are we saving in taxes? You know, maybe at the earnings that we have right now, or you know, if we buy this Mobile home park with this guy.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Esther: You know. Maybe we'll be saving like a hundred 80,000 in taxes this year. Maybe um. And I told him well.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Esther: Is this worth a hundred 80,000, or can we make easily make a hundred 80,000 with the same amount of like. Work, or less, or whatever it is.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Esther: So again. That's a question that um, that's where I'm coming out. As. Um every time I talk to this guy, and I think the writing is already on the wall for me doesn't take that. Many conversations.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Esther: That like, after 2 or 3 conversations with him, I literally cannot make heads or tails.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Esther: Of what he wants done, what he wants. I'm like. Yeah, I just don't think that this is the more I think about it, the more I'm like, I really don't think this is worth my time.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Let me see.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Esther: Um, you know. So anyway, um and Tina, I'm 1 of those people that has a really soft heart. You know, I want to help people, and I'm like, Oh, my God! You know this guy. I feel kind of bad for him. He's really nice. Guy.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Esther: You know, he's really just trying to do it all himself, and. You know. He's parting ways with his, you know. But I'm like you know what? That's not necessarily her fault.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know, and I don't like.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Tina Marie: I have a suggestion.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Esther: Yeah, huh.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Tina Marie: Well, so what I love to do, and especially when people are. Kind of evolving into.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tina Marie: A new phase in a new space is. Is, you know. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time? Right? Just kind of um, especially for you. You're in a very unique situation where you don't have to earn money.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Tina Marie: You've got these young babies. You've got this brilliant mind and experience. Um and and skills that you can offer.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Tina Marie: And an excellent communicator, an excellent problem, solver and organizer. So you don't just find an Esther out in the world. And you'll have a lot of people that you can bless and benefit what I would love for you to begin to notice.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Tina Marie: Is that you can do that in a very small amount of time. Because of the insights that you have.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Tina Marie: And because of your boldness and willingness to say what is real and what is true. And leave somebody a little bit better than you found them.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tina Marie: Your job is not to fix and heal everybody, but to improve everything and everyone. And you can do that just in a little bit. So something that you could suggest is, look, I'm not going to be your person.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Tina Marie: But for the sake of learning and helping, and just kind of dipping my toe in something. I will consult with you for a month or 2, and what I'm going to do is ask you a lot of questions.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Tina Marie: So that we can kind of. So I can kind of extract from you what you want. I'm gonna tell you, if I can't get clarity number one. You're still gonna pay me for my time.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Tina Marie: And number 2, you're going to go practice trying to figure out what you want and working through that, because if you can't communicate it to yourself, and you can't communicate it to me. You can't communicate it to the person you want to run your business and guess what's going to happen. You're going to keep going like this. If you don't know where you're going, you will never get there right. It doesn't matter what path you take. And so it's just going to create frustration.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Tina Marie: If you would like to help him have less frustration. You can do what other people probably won't, because those I assume he has big energy and big personality.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Esther: Mhm, yeah, he's got like.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Tina Marie: That's usually how.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Tina Marie: That's usually how how these types of things happen, how they get where they get and mass the amount of money. It's charisma. And it's gumption kind of like a combination of all these things.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Tina Marie: So the thing is is, most people will cow. And cower right before that type of energy. I don't think that that's you. I think you may.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Tina Marie: Not necessarily want to go grab the bull by the horn sometimes, and just realize that's a bull that's not worth my time, you know.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: But if you want to give the gift of helping him, and you know that you have. Um wisdom and organizational structure that that can help him.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Tina Marie: Then maybe you structure a deals like, Look um! I'll meet with you once a week. Or however many times you want to. But I want you to make your effective hourly rate 100%.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Tina Marie: Not less than $500 an hour.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Esther: Mhm, okay.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Tina Marie: So whatever time you do, I want you to do that because you need to get that win under your belt right away and recognize the power and the skill that you bring to the table. If they say, No, okay.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Tina Marie: No big deal. You didn't need it, anyway, so you offered help, he said. No, and it's not not offering help because you charge. There's a currency exchange you have a family to take care of. There is a real drain from you, so it's just a trade, his money, your time, but it's still a trade, and it's definitely equitable, even at $500 an hour.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Esther: Okay. Mhm.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Tina Marie: Because of the precise way I know your brain could extract from him. You know, or at least attempt to right. If if his brain.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Tina Marie: Can't answer your questions. That is not a fault of you. Um. I ask questions sometimes. People don't have answers to.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Tina Marie: But then what I would tell them say, okay, you know you need to go find the answer to that question. You need to go sit with that, ask yourself some other questions. Here's some other questions you could ask yourself. And, for example, why are you doing this? What do you care about most? What is your priority? Because if the reason you're telling somebody they have to do this or not do. This is just because you feel like it, not because it meets a particular goal or detracts from a particular goal. Then you need to get out of the way and let the person who's running your business run the business as long as it falls within the Prime Directive. Whatever the Major.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Tina Marie: Goals are right. So the major positives. The major negatives is where we find. The guidelines. So what do you think about structuring something like that?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Esther: I think it's possible. I you know the thing about me, Tina is. I'm. Very non confrontational.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Esther: Um. So part of what might be interesting about this is for help is to help me. Learned how to really put my foot down. Um! And really this might be a really great practice in boundaries.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Esther: Right terrible at boundaries I always have been, because. I just am not confrontational. I come off as very nice, but I want to be able to.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Esther: Come off with a little bit more power. Um, you know, come with a little bit more dominance and power. I think I think I have good ideas. I think.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Esther: I've never been formally trained, but I think I've got a little bit of business acumen in there somewhere, you know. It's just not been honed and um.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Esther: Running. My 1st company was sort of like a playground for that. A lot of mistakes and a lot of you know, and everything. But I did learn. Quite a bit now, do I don't. And this is the part that Fuji and you might not agree with like.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Esther: I don't know if I can command $500 an hour, or something like that, but maybe this is a good exercise for me to hit that, and believe that I can. Now I think what'll be interesting is.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Esther: That'll probably be part of what, how we structure the contract to be. Like. If this guy wants to talk at me for 20 min during our 1 h check in.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Esther: Dude. That's his money, you know, but I think very. I need to be. Make very clear like.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Tina Marie: Exactly.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Esther: I'm here to consult you. I'm here to give you advice on what to do. I think I also need to put a boundary like.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Esther: You know? What are you gonna do versus? What am I gonna do.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Esther: You know. Am I not gonna be the one sitting here creating these. Documents for you. You know I'm not gonna be, or you know, if I am, then this is what my rate is.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Esther: Or whatever it is, I think we really have to define it, because he's going to be someone again like you said just throws money at the problem and expects someone to like do it for him.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Tina Marie: So here. Okay. So he gave he gave you I don't know what, 20 to $30,000. That's 1 thing of millions of dollars. That's another. But what you could do is say, okay. So under this fee, now you don't tell them it's an hourly rate, and you don't tell them how many hours you're going to work you in your brain? You do the calculations. And then you say, this is what you're going to pay me to work with me for 60.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Tina Marie: Right, $10,000, something like that. And then maybe you're working 20 HA month, which is, you know, 4 HA week.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: But in addition to that, what you'll do is go hire somebody to train and tell him I'm going to hire somebody to begin working with you now, that might not be your right hand person. But you just mentioned documents. So if he needs sops created, it would be somebody. You delegate this to, okay, go, do this research, go create this. So you you create the tasks. You assign it to somebody, they do it. You approve it. So now we're shrinking how much work you have to do! But the work is still getting done.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Tina Marie: He. It's not. It's probably not a 1 person job. I don't know how many properties he has. Um. Do you have any idea how many properties, properties he has.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Esther: Yeah. So he's got one deal that he's closing right now. And he's got another deal that he's working on, and I know that.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Esther: You know he's it's a very small business. And I'm still in the process of learning what has.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Esther: Process is like, what is gal that's leaving him doing for him.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Tina Marie: Bye.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Esther: And what kind of hole is that going to leave? I think I just need him to be very clear that I am not here to fill that hole. You know I'm not here to fill that hole for her, because I'm not going to be your Vp. Of marketing and operations. 1st of all those 2 things should not even be mixed together.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Tina Marie: Yes. 100%. I'm so glad you said that because I was about to say that.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Esther: Like those 2 things should not even be mixed together. So that tells me he doesn't know what the difference is.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Esther: You know. So anyway.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Tina Marie: But you can hire those 2 people for him, and.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Esther: You can hire those 2 people.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Tina Marie: Think about the head hunting fees, you know. That's like $1,500 to 2,000 or more each, just to just to fill those spots.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Esther: You know, and then, but for me, I don't have that much experience in hiring. Yes, I hired a team, but I also made a lot of mistakes in hiring that team. So I was thinking like, you know, I would.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Esther: You know, I could probably put job postings up for him, or whatever it is, or hire a headhunting agency to find. Him a sales associate, or whatever.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Esther: Anyway. Um, you know, or.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Tina Marie: You wanna know how I would do it.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Esther: How, how would you do it?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Tina Marie: I don't know those, either, because I've never hired for those positions, but I know marketing right. I know enough of it. I know enough about operations that I have a solid foundation, but what I would do is I would go to 2 or 3 of the AI models.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Esther: Hmm. Uh-huh.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Tina Marie: And I would describe everything.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tina Marie: And then I would say, these are the 2 roles that I think that I need to fill. What questions do you need to ask me to, then give me advice about how I should go about filling these.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Tina Marie: And the reason I would go to different models is because, 1st of all, I think that it's good to learn what models have different strengths, but generally one will suggest one that the other won't. So you basically get 3 experts to go ask for. Free $20, whatever it takes right inexpensively. But you will go learn by drinking from the fire hose if you have interest, so like you and Fuji were talking about getting into real estate. This. This also ticks one of my favorite boxes, which is, get paid to learn what I need to learn and want to learn.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Esther: Okay.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Tina Marie: So that would be allowing it, allowing you to kind of get in there and learn some things while getting paid to do it.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Tina Marie: But now now back to commanding $500 an hour. 1st of all, he was offering you a huge percentage, right? So you just need to wash that away. But the but the other thing is.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Tina Marie: We are trained from infancy to be institutional people. We go to school, then we go to school. Then we go to work, and we are told, for the majority of our day how to live our lives inside of the institution and be obedient and follow the rules. It cuts creativity and autonomy, and. And then we're told. This is what our worth is right. So we get a grade in school, and then we get a wage in in the company and in the job, and.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: None of them really amount to what we are and what we can do. So you are bred from the beginning.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Tina Marie: To be valued this little to be a cog in the wheel, and you're so much bigger than that. There's a real world value.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Tina Marie: That has nothing to do with the institution's value. So if that man can go out and make a deal, and running and keeping those properties, generates him 50,000 to 100,000 to 200,000 a month.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Tina Marie: Right. I don't know what his revenue is right, but I would be asking those questions. What do you think you're worth to him now? He may be of the mindset that you know I just hire employees, but I know he's not because he offered you 20 to 30%.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: Right. So he is willing to pay big value to not have to think about the things he doesn't want to think about. You know everything you need to know to structure this deal, you know. Now.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Tina Marie: If you were to put it in hourly terms. It may not translate as well. Right. People don't want to do that math when they hear it hourly. It's sticker shock.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Tina Marie: Yet. They'll pay 20 to 30%. So you don't want to bring it in hourly. But I need you to think about your effective.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Tina Marie: Hourly rate, because the reason entrepreneurs need to do that. Is when we're looking at delegating.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Esther: You give me one moment? Um.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Tina Marie: No problem. Yep.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Esther: Sorry, one second.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Tina Marie: Whatever you need. Yep.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Esther: I'm sorry I'll be.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: That's okay.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Esther: I hired a guy to build 4 pieces of furniture for me. For Emmy's room. It was the best 150 bucks I've ever spent.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Tina Marie: 100 and $50 for 4 pieces of furniture.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Esther: Like, if. Yeah, they're small, like Ikea shelf, he finished. In like an hour, less than an hour. Ikea shelf, a little wardrobe, rack, little table and little bookshelf.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Tina Marie: Wow! Oh!

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Esther: Like. I tried to build the bookshelf the other day, and I like totally messed up. It took me an hour and.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Esther: This guy was done, anyway. Yes. Um. Apologies for the interruption.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Tina Marie: You don't ever need to apologize. Don't worry about it.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Esther: Thank you.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: Um so. Value. Okay.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Tina Marie: The value that you bring in in what you would do. So let's let's say that what you would do would be short term.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Tina Marie: It would be a fixed project contract. I am going to go in. I'm going to learn your business and understand it in a way that can be translated to somebody else.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Tina Marie: Right, and I'm going to give you these things. Um, I will look at um going and hiring a marketing person and an operations person. But 1st I'm going to spend the 1st 30 days.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Tina Marie: Seeing if I can understand. So this is going to be a 2 phase, or maybe 3 phase project right. If we don't get past phase one, we're done, and there's no commitment to you that I'm willing to make. That says we get past phase one, but phase one is in the 1st 30 days.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Tina Marie: I just learned your business, and you pay me to learn it, because if you can teach it to me, then I can help you. Get what you need to manage it, not going to manage it for you.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Tina Marie: But I'm going to help you find the people who can do better than what you've ever done before. And, Esther, you do have the ability to do better than he's ever done before. The bar is set very low.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Esther: Okay.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Tina Marie: So you don't have to get it to run perfectly. You have to make an improvement, and that will be worth what he will pay you for that improvement.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Tina Marie: But it probably is going to be. Multiple times better than it was.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Tina Marie: So, then, if you understand it. But but you have to put in the contract also. You will sit down with me no less than.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Tina Marie: Blank hours a week, right? Whatever you feel like you need. And it's it's probably just a couple. But you'll say, during that time. You need to allow me to lead and direct the conversation.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: So that I can ask you the questions that I need in the allotted time. Do you agree, or do you not agree? Make it a tick box.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Tina Marie: On the contract. Okay? So. Now, you said you need to work on putting your foot down, and maybe um.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Tina Marie: Some dominance. I will rephrase that to assertiveness. You're not looking to dominate people.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Esther: Turn it.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Tina Marie: But you do need to assert yourself, especially where. You're being asked to do something that requires you. Be asserted.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: The other thing is, you need to understand that you cannot teach your children what you cannot model. And you cannot model what you cannot do.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tina Marie: Do you want your daughters to be asserted. Do you want them to be able to speak.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Esther: Yes.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Tina Marie: Their voice, and protect and project. When they need to.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Tina Marie: So they need to see you do that, and they also need to see you do it.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Esther: Okay.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Tina Marie: And still be respectful and honorable, because there's a lot of women that are like. She power. Men suck.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Tina Marie: Take the power. F, the patriarchy, all this other stuff. And I'm sure that you don't want to raise women like that.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Esther: Okay.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Tina Marie: But if they, if they find a lack of strength in Mom. They might model after another woman that they find is stronger.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: So um. You have a lot of goals for the kind of parent that you want to be.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Tina Marie: And it doesn't have to be hard. It doesn't have to be. Hard as in difficult or hard as in hard-hearted.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Tina Marie: Right, or abrasive, or anything like that. Um, but it also doesn't come instantly.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Tina Marie: We grow through opposition. And if we're living a life where we avoid opposition, we.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Tina Marie: Of of automatic default. Avoid growth. So, putting yourself in a situation to need to assert yourself.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Tina Marie: To have this experience. Put yourself in a situation to gain.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Tina Marie: That skill and ability. Does that make sense.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Esther: Yes, it does, and I think you made. A really insightful connection for me just now.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Esther: That this potential opportunity, should I decide to pursue it. Um will bring it's will bring me more than just.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Esther: The money, however much it is, whether it's Rp. Status that I can. You know that I can achieve.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Esther: But it'll bring me the opportunity to. Really work on some of these skills that I've wanted to improve and develop on, not only for myself, professionally, but.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Esther: Like, you know personality traits, or, you know, personality, traits, behaviors. That I can learn to. I can practice and learn to model for my own kids.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Esther: They're not. Yeah. My, okay. Oh, my God, that makes so much sense. Like like my personal professional life, like.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Esther: This all lives within one person. So why can't? Why can't they be connected like? Why are they.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Tina Marie: They are.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Esther: Be separate. They're they're not.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Tina Marie: We tried to separate them, but they can't be. That's that's just the illusion.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Esther: God, that's mind blowing. Okay? Yes. Okay. Mhm.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Tina Marie: Which is why I take a holistic approach to business. And why we talk about our choices and our behaviors, and all of these things, because everything is.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Esther: Mhm. Uh-huh.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Tina Marie: The person. It's always the people. Yeah, it is an illusion.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Esther: Mhm, okay.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Tina Marie: So you're getting paid, not just to learn real estate, but to develop the characteristics that you want to. You're basically paying. You're getting paid to go to a gym where you can build up the strength of assertiveness.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Esther: Yeah. Oh, okay. Mhm.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Tina Marie: And organization and managing potentially, maybe a narcissistic personality or just a really big energy. And you know, um, unaware kind of thing. But.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Tina Marie: It would be, and. It would be fixed. You could say, like, you know, maybe 90 days.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Tina Marie: So 30 days to learn. 60 days to begin to, so the second 30 days would be hiring.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Tina Marie: And filling the roles because it takes time. You can't just go put out ads and find people. There's an interviewing process. It all takes time, and then you need to train and onboard.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Tina Marie: And what you could say is, after that, 90 days. Right? So this is going to be much higher wage. The 1st 90 days. If you want me to stay on to consult for a little while, I will, and we can do that on a month by month basis until your people and you feel like.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Tina Marie: You know you don't need me anymore, or until I say I'm done. At any point as long, you know.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Tina Marie: So you get paid upfront.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Tina Marie: And um. You fulfill on a 30 30 day basis. Right? So, phase one phase, 2, phase, 3. Phase, one. Learning phase, 2. Hiring phase, 3.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tina Marie: Training and onboarding, and then phase 4 would be ongoing uh. Consultation and support.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Tina Marie: Um, but he should be paying you so. I mean.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Tina Marie: I know you're gonna end up working more. Um.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Tina Marie: I'm also trying to think about what I think that you would be comfortable with.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Tina Marie: I really think that. You don't know enough about his business, so we don't know what his income is.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Esther: I really don't know about enough of his business, enough about his business.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Tina Marie: I want you to get paid not less than $6,000 a month for your time.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Esther: Okay.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Tina Marie: And I don't want you working more than 5 HA week. How do you feel about that.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Esther: That sounds pretty good. I feel like 5 h is very little.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Tina Marie: It is, but I want you to learn how to be leveraged. So in that 5 h. Now there is a gray area, so I don't call education time, work, time for clients.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Tina Marie: But education is always work that I need to do for my clients. So if I go research. For my people. I'm filling my brain anyway, and learning things that I'm going to apply to other things. So it is still working right.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Tina Marie: But it's not something I would put under the umbrella of working for them, even though they benefit from the work that I do. So, for example, if you to go have these conversations with Chat Dbt, and learn, you're also learning. AI. You're also learning real estate investment.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Esther: Um. Mhm.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Tina Marie: And you're gaining skill and knowledge that's going to allow you to serve him better.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Tina Marie: That time, that education, time. And can be.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Tina Marie: However much you want it to be, there's probably plenty of hours in the day where you can go. Do a 10 min session here, 5 there hour there with the kids, you know. There's there's a lot of those windows and gaps. Where you could do some learning and education that makes the job easy.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Tina Marie: Now the 5 h of actually working a week is assembling all of the things that you've learned. Or asking him questions.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Tina Marie: And so the other thing that you can do is say, you know, maybe it's.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Tina Marie: Hard to get him nailed down to. Um answer questions when you're talking one on one. Say, look, I'm gonna send you um.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Esther: An email.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And now my experience is that those types of personalities do not like long emails. And they don't type a lot.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Esther: No.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So you're not going to get a good response that way. But what you could say is, I'm going to send you a long email, and all I want you to do is dictate your answer. So just open up a memo, read the questions, and reply to them, are you willing to do that?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Tina Marie: He says, no. Then the only other thing that we can do is we can do it in meetings which I'm willing to do. But I need you to stay focused and on topic. And if you're going off topic, I'm going to need to interrupt you so that I can bring you back so I can get the answers that I need, because if you fill my brain up. With things that don't matter. It won't be able to process all of the things that I do need to do. I use that all the time, because that is the truth.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Tina Marie: When people wander, my brain is full. I'm I'm. Fried, trying to process everything that they just vomited all over me. That has nothing to do with what I really need to do.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Tina Marie: So they hired my brain. They need to support. It isn't a will thing. I have real limitations. I get really overstimulated. I get really too much. My brain is amazing and does wonderful things. It's worth hiring.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Tina Marie: But if you overload it with garbage. When I've asked you a specific question and you didn't answer it, you you have to be accountable for the fact that you just sabotage our whole.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Tina Marie: Um Conversation.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Esther: And you're still paying me, and we got nothing done. Yeah.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yeah. And I'm not going to give you more time, because you ruined the time that we had. So.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tina Marie: This isn't dominance. This isn't rude. This isn't confrontational. This is one thing I want to tell you. I tell everybody who's like, I hate confrontation. You want to know what you hate worse.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Tina Marie: Promise you is conflict.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Tina Marie: Internal conflict.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Tina Marie: So my mom used to tell me, do you just love to fight, and you just love to argue? No, I don't. I love peace.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Tina Marie: Hate fighting, but I will do it in a heartbeat, because. There's already conflict.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Tina Marie: That internal conflict. Kills me. I can sense energy. My energy is very strong, it's palpable. You can feel it from me so you can feel it when you're not even in the room with me people can feel it just from my written words. It's strong.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Esther: Mhm. And.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Tina Marie: But I also feel everyone else's energy as strongly as they feel mine. Even if they're not strong energies, I'm just super sensitive to it.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Tina Marie: So when somebody's in a mood, I am very aware I am feeling it in my stomach. I'm feeling it in my chest. I'm feeling it in my head. I'm feeling it in my extremities. That is conflict. I'm not willing to sit with.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Tina Marie: So what I will do is say we need to have a conversation.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Esther: Okay.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Tina Marie: And I'm going to speak as plainly as possible, which means I'm not sugarcoating things, and I'm not trying to make you feel better through. How I describe it, but I'm trying to make us both feel better by resolving the conflict that exists.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Tina Marie: By confronting it and saying, Here's the elephant in the room. Do we want to put a hat on it and then invite it to tea? Or do we want it to get out of here because it doesn't belong here. Do you know what I mean?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Tina Marie: So, sometimes reframing things and understanding, because, as women, and especially in the Asian culture.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Tina Marie: We are bred to be subservient. Submissive to do what we're told to fill our role.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Tina Marie: But defining that role is what really is more important, I don't disagree with any of that. I think part of America's biggest issue is the individualistic culture that we have and the selfishness that we have, that we have no collectivism.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Tina Marie: We have no culture, we have no group, we have no subservience, we have no obedience, we have no respect, we have no honor. It's killing us.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Esther: I agree. Mhm.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Tina Marie: So I'm not saying being the antithesis of that. What I'm saying is. Define by your own choice who you are. There are strong Asian women that were matriarchs of force that didn't.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Tina Marie: Cower, but they were still respectful and honorable, just incredibly honorable, but they defined what their role was in their family.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Tina Marie: Women anywhere, any culture and male female whatever. But for women it's it's harder to do and say. My people. I can serve you best, because.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Tina Marie: I know who I am.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Tina Marie: In this way I can serve you best. By leading the conversation.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Tina Marie: I can serve you best by extracting from you the information I need.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Tina Marie: To structure and to organize, and then to go find people who can help support that structure and organization. That is my humble way of being able to serve and honor and and fill my role. It is not. Prideful or arrogant. It is.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Tina Marie: You can be humble, but still confident. Knowing who you are and what you bring to the table. Now I understand you're not 100 sure what you bring to the table. What I'm going to tell you, Esther, and this is also something that.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Tina Marie: Um. Most people have have to go through, especially women. Um, because I don't have them as clients, but I I help my friends all the time in in finding their strength and their voice, and.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Tina Marie: Their purpose. And all these things. But your brain is uncommon.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Tina Marie: You are uncommon. What that means is you're going to be able to add value almost everywhere you go because you are above average.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Tina Marie: So there's intrinsic value and worth in you being there because you will improve the situation. Now, your perfectionist type, a kind of mind is going to want to go. Yeah, but it's not perfect.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Tina Marie: Perfection is not the goal, improvement is.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Tina Marie: In every aspect of life, because it's perfection, even attainable. It's not so you have to remove the expectation of. I only deserve to get paid high amounts if I make everything. You know a fortune. 500 level quality.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Esther: Mhm, Mhm.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Tina Marie: No, you're getting paid a high amount because the value of improvement is high value in a high earning company.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Esther: Oh, my, gosh, okay. You've hit my problem right on the head. I don't feel like.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Esther: Like I bring the value unless it's perfect. And you know that we were raised like this. You know I was raised like this right.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Esther: Like? No. And what is this? A minus. Why is this not an a plus.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That's the Asian part of it. Yeah, yeah.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Esther: Like. Yeah, it's like, if it's not perfect, then what are we doing.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Tina Marie: Man I would not have survived, I would have been beaten.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Esther: Like. If it's not perfect, then why even bother.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Esther: That's really the mentality I was raised with.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes. All or nothing, and all or nothing is why people commit suicide. That's why, for the longest time I think the thing that stood out for me.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Tina Marie: When I was a teenager is, and I feel like crying about it now is because my Asian counterparts, like. If they didn't get to college.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Tina Marie: Suicide was a thing. And those were the stories that I was told like just.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Tina Marie: Or are being kicked out of a family and disowned. And I thought, you know, it doesn't even matter if that's a small amount. The fact that that's the story that. This can even exist, breaks my heart.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Tina Marie: And I think about that in professionalism, like how many Asians I've heard about who have committed suicide because something bad happened in the company. And I think, man, that is too much pressure on the other side of the same token, which is where we find our balance, because all of our strengths.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tina Marie: Are also on the other side. Our weaknesses, my confidence, and my boldness and my articulation are my strength. When I use them in the wrong way, they are my undoing.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Tina Marie: And the pressure to excel, that Asians have high expectations of their family. Um! That's fantastic!

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Tina Marie: It's good, it becomes bad when it's. At the cost of the person.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Esther: Right.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Tina Marie: Right. So um trying to figure out going through your mind and observing. Your patterns.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Tina Marie: Because you're very aware of what they are, and you're very aware of what they came from. Where they came from.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Tina Marie: What you have to decide is. What part of that is good.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Tina Marie: Inherently, but maybe had been twisted. In a way that made it not good.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Tina Marie: What is good about that, and embrace what is good about that, rather than call it good or bad, or right or wrong. The whole thing right.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Tina Marie: Take what is good about that? Take that pursuing of excellence.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Tina Marie: And high expectations and go. You know what I'm glad that I have that. But now I need to refine it and make it not something that sabotages me, but something that supports me and strengthens me.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Tina Marie: Because it it's not wasted. So just all of these things just need a little refinement. But that's true of all of us, no matter where we came from. We've got refining to do.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Esther: Got it. Okay, I can use it to my advantage. It could be like you, said a strength, but I also have to recognize. Like that. It's a double edged sword. And how do I kind of blunt the other edge of the sword.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Tina Marie: Nice. Yeah.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Esther: So it doesn't hurt us. Okay, I think that's excellent. Okay, that gives me a lot to chew on.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Esther: And a lot to think about. Um. Okay. Oh, I had another question for you on the tip of my tongue.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Esther: And I don't remember exactly what it is now. Um. Oh, okay, so.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Esther: This might kind of go into the path of um. Labeling, which I know we don't necessarily want to do, but more is to give me some guidance, like what you are.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Esther: Um recommending to me, in terms of how we might want to approach. Um this whole situation. Um! Oh, his name is Ben. By the way, Ben.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Esther: Um um with with Ben and his company. Um! Would you say that this might be the makings of. Me as a consultant.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Esther: Like a business consultant, or something like that. Um. Yeah, because it sounds a little bit like that.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Tina Marie: It is what it is, and I'll tell you why. It's really attractive as a mom.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Tina Marie: Um. You have way, more autonomy and the ability to play. In projects, and have fun.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Tina Marie: To meet with other businesses to learn new things, because I know that you're curious. And inquisitive. It allows you to develop a variety of skills.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Tina Marie: But it also gives you the freedom to be mom. And to um.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Tina Marie: Set your set your schedule so much more than having a job, or even your own company. Um where it pulls you.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Tina Marie: It pulls you mentally. It can pull you in the middle of the night. It can pull you when you're snuggling with Emmy or holding Mari. It can. It can pull you when you have ownership of a big thing. Now everything can pull you. Your job will be to learn how to compartmentalize. But.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Tina Marie: When you know that. You are not the.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Tina Marie: So generally an organizational type person and an operational type person. They're kind of the.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Tina Marie: The nucleus. And the nucleus never gets to go to sleep.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Tina Marie: It's always working. It's always the center of everything. And that is a heavy role to believe you're the nucleus of your home.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Tina Marie: You can't be the nucleus of anything else. Not right now, so that could be a place where you really get to do a lot of exploring, at least for the next few years, while the girls are getting bigger. And you're still learning what kind of mom you are and what kind of children you have, because they came with their own personalities.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Tina Marie: You get to shape and persuade, but they are their own people, and you don't. You've barely even met them yet.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Esther: Okay.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Tina Marie: So. Um, you know. And you're evolving. And Fuji is evolving who you are today is not who you're going to be tomorrow. And it's definitely not who you're going to be 5 years from now. And so, if you consider consulting as an option, knowing that you've got value in your organizational mind that does not exist in most brains.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Esther: Okay.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Tina Marie: And then, on top of that, your intelligence does not exist in most brains. There's a reason we have something called averages. You're above that. And the other thing you need to understand is that most of the people that are actually really successful in business.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Tina Marie: Aren't good at organizing. They aren't good at business, which is why I get paid the way that I get paid. They don't understand fundamental concepts, or they just don't manage themselves that way, and they shouldn't, because what makes them great and amazing.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Tina Marie: Is that their brains isn't bogged down by thinking about all the details like ours is they're able to go and do some other amazing, powerful things.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Tina Marie: But without a person like you, they're really. Constantly spinning their wheels. They're in fight or flight constantly. They're in feast or famine constantly there is a cycle until they learn how to be consistent, and a lot of times they never will be.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Tina Marie: So they need to hire consistency. And you can bring that all day long, and that is high value. So it doesn't matter what the business type is.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Tina Marie: If you can ask enough questions.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Tina Marie: I don't know anything about Beacon Doctor. I know a lot of things about a lot of things, but I don't know enough about running all these different types of businesses. I learn as we go, and they give me permission to do that because it's still valuable to them. So I've got 23 years of evidence that says, you can do this.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Tina Marie: If you wanted to, if you wanted to.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Esther: Okay, I think that's definitely an option. You know um.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Esther: Fuji is always of the Oh, you know, we build these businesses, and we build these, you know, get, acquire real estate, and just just passive income, passive income. You know he like wants to not have to work for his money, you know. You probably know that from him, from working with him for like a year. Now.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Esther: And um, but you know I'm. But for me, you know. So it's like, Okay, if I do a consulting business, it's like.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Esther: Okay. I'm still working like for my money hour per hour. I'm training my time for money, and that's for some reason that's something that he's always been really like.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Esther: Like doesn't want to do unless he has to. Um. So it's a little bit of a you know, and.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Esther: I haven't decided what I want, so he has a big influence me on me in that way.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Esther: But I don't know, always necessarily agree with his approaches, either. Um. So I think what'll be really good for us is um.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Esther: I want to find out and. Like if I do.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Esther: You know, if I do this project, or whatever it is, or I try my hand at essentially this. Consulting idea. Um.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Esther: If this is something that. Brings me a lot more joy than the money that I'm earning.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Esther: You know it brings me me.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Tina Marie: Joy, the great currency.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Esther: More value than the money that's coming in.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Esther: It gives me the opportunity to work on characteristics and skills that I've always wanted to get better on. I don't really care about real estate. It's not a topic that I'm excited about. I'm like.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Tina Marie: All right.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Esther: You know, cause I hear him harp out out all day, and I've never been interested in real estate. You know. But maybe it's just another topic.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Esther: Um, you know I don't have to be that interested in it. Um, you know. Maybe it's the skills and stuff that I'm getting to practice that are more interesting to me than the actual.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Esther: Topic, or the actual industry.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Esther: So I don't know. Maybe it could be something more like that for me.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Tina Marie: Well, and also consider it as getting paid to discover.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Tina Marie: What you really want to do. So if you consult with different things and you have different experiences, you're going to learn a lot about different people.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Tina Marie: A lot about different businesses, and you'll learn, like I have that there are fundamentals that work in every type of business. And that's what I'm going to work on, building a course and writing a book.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Tina Marie: And there's.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Esther: That's amazing.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Tina Marie: I teach very differently than everybody else does. But lots of people don't want to do it my way, and it doesn't make any sense and my approach and my language makes no sense to a lot of people. It doesn't matter the few people that it does. They'll resonate more with me than anybody else in the world.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Tina Marie: And that's enough like it doesn't matter if it's only 10 people that want to read it. I've got knowledge to share, and I want to share it, and I'm 48. My girls are almost grown, you know, like. We evolve. But because I got to play in all these different areas, I have an understanding about people in life that I never would have had before.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Tina Marie: And I have. When a friend wants some help with something I have value to give to them. Because I've worked in such a variety of things like if you if Fuji, if you're not interested in real estate.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Tina Marie: But Fuji is, you could still help them. Not make a lot of mistakes. If you have learned some things. But my favorite part is that new things spark, new things spark new things so like. In these conversations I might say something, and that has an entirely different meaning or insight to you, which then sparks a new thought that grows and evolves, and evolves and evolves and evolves.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Tina Marie: But so I'm with Fuji on that. I don't want to work. I don't want to have to work. I want to work, but I don't want to have to work. So I'm getting to the point where my money will be. The thing that makes my money. It will be investments that do it.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tina Marie: But I won't stop consulting, even if I did it for free, and fly to Africa and teach women how to build better businesses there, and just did it as a mission. I would still do what I'm doing. Um, because I do love doing that. I love organizing.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Tina Marie: I love strengthening, I love. Bringing out people's most magic version of themselves, and seeing them.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Stand with confidence.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tina Marie: In who they are, and love themselves. I love watching a woman love herself and embrace herself.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Tina Marie: And there's not a lot of that, you know.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. So I would do this forever. And it isn't trading just time for money. I love everyone that I serve. I think about them. I think about their families.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Tina Marie: I pray for them. So I get that back. Also I get energy. I get validation. Um, I get all kinds of things besides just being paid. So I think you're wise to look at it the way that you're looking at it, but also.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Tina Marie: You're not building a tether. Around yourself when you do, consulting, when you can.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Tina Marie: Create a project. Right? So I just have these ongoing things. People end up staying for years. So it's not a project thing. It just ends up being this kind of relationship instead.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Tina Marie: Inside their business.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Tina Marie: And it works for us. So finding what works for you, and then being okay with saying, You know what. Now I want to go build a business, or you know what. Now I just want to be with the girls, and maybe I'll coach soccer, or maybe I'll just teach them how to do a craft, or something like. You're buying yourself.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Tina Marie: The the space to grow and to be who you want to be, and to have some experience that is outside of motherhood. And that evolves you, and that gives you value and purpose and meaning.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Tina Marie: On your terms. That's what you're doing.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Esther: I think that's great. Okay. I love that.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Esther: And I. You know. I feel like this between the 2 of us. This is the start of gonna be a start of an amazing relationship between you and Hi.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Esther: Um, you know, and. I literally just hang on to every word you're saying, because I think you and I, we just we get each other. I think we, Vibe, and I think you you have a knack for.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Esther: Release. You know um. Having a knack for kind of seeing.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Esther: What or it's seeing and guessing and estimating what I'm looking for and what I need. And I feel that I don't have to say that many words for you to get what I'm thinking and what I'm needing.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Esther: So I think that's wonderful. Um, if you have time. Um. I would love to meet with you again this week. I you know I don't know if you have time, but.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Esther: I think, as I'm trying to quickly figure out what to do with this um. You know this. Um, you know this thing with Ben? Um. I'm probably gonna need um.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Esther: A little bit more frequent support from you to know, because his his um gal is leaving at the end of the month. I'm on their slack channels. They've given me an email address. And now I'm just like, Ooh.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Esther: I probably should have, like, you know, kind of stepped back a little bit. Um to draw my boundaries first.st

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Esther: Um before it gets any deeper cause she's, you know, giving me resources. And he basically told her, Oh, yeah, Esther's coming in to replace you, and like what?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Tina Marie: It's not delayed.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Esther: Okay. So you know she's acting accordingly. You know, but I am not in a hurry to put meetings on her calendar every single day this week, when I have not defined what I'm actually gonna do with him yet.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Tina Marie: So. Yes. So here's what I would say. Um, because I uh, I do need to get to another call. But.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Esther: So, yeah. Sorry. Yes.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Tina Marie: Um, I generally. So I I try not to book extra calls, and but I the support is there. So this is the way that I think will work best.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Esther: Got it.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Tina Marie: And it actually, I think it does work best. Generally speaking, and it's just audio messages, so you can either type it or you can leave an auto message. Either one is good, and I will either type or give an audio message based on what's happening that way. We can do it in real time. So things are gonna pop up in your head.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Esther: Okay. Okay.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Tina Marie: Situations will occur.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Tina Marie: I put my phone and do not disturb when I'm not working. So you never have to worry about. Is this a bad time to message.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tina Marie: You can always send email or signal, you know. Right? So so you never have to worry. Is, can I send it to Tina now, if it's on your mind. Send it. I will reply, when I can reply.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Tina Marie: And I never reply to business things on Sunday unless somebody is having an emergency, and they really need help, because, you know, that's my sacred space. But if somebody really needs help.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Esther: Okay. Yeah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Tina Marie: I want to be there. So you know, you would know what that is. You're having a panic attack, or just there's a fire, you know. Fire quote.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Esther: Okay. Mhm yeah.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. I'm I will be there anytime. But I think that you'll find that it, that it is enough.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, and it also gives me space to kind of ponder a little bit more if we're looking at a tactical approach.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Esther: Mhm. Got it.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Tina Marie: If maybe you're looking for verbiage that you want to use to address a particular situation, because the words that we use. Um when we think them through strategically.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Tina Marie: They save us a lot of work.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Tina Marie: When we use them to their most powerful. You know, way that we can.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Esther: Got it. Okay.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Tina Marie: So I'm totally available as much as you need. We're just not going to schedule an additional call to do that.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Esther: Makes sense. Okay.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Tina Marie: Okay, but I think that you can articulate yourself plenty well, in an audio message, and likewise.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Esther: Okay.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Tina Marie: So if we find out that you need more, then then we'll cross that bridge when we go to it. But I think that you'll find that this is is enough. Please do not be afraid of sending messages, don't, because Chona and this is a woman thing don't want to bother Tina.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Esther: Okay.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Tina Marie: I don't want to bother. I don't want you can't bother me.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Esther: Okay.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Tina Marie: Nobody has ever used me as much as I've allowed them to ever. I'm constantly saying you can ask me more. You can ask me more, and people aren't doing it. So I promise you, if you get in your hand, you're like, Ah. Now, if you happen to be the one person that exceeds my boundaries.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Tina Marie: It's not gonna happen. I will say, you know, sir, but but generally what will happen is um. I'm in the middle of something with the kids, and I'll shoot you a message and be like this is when I'll get to you.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Tina Marie: Because you can't, because I adore you already, and I want to be there for you. And in the beginning. There's a lot more. There's a lot more to do.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Esther: Yeah, mhm.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Tina Marie: And so I prepared for that. It's why I don't take on multiple. I don't take a ton of clients, only have a handful, and I never take that new ones at the same exact time, because I'm going to eat, sleep, and breathe Ester, for a while, worrying about you.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Esther: Okay. Got it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Tina Marie: Hoping for you and all of these things. Okay.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Esther: Okay, thank you so much. This was immensely helpful. And again, I'm so excited. I love you.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Tina Marie: We should just give you a big giant hug.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Esther: All right.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Tina Marie: I just need to come down and visit, and you, me and Sona, go have spa days, or something like that.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Esther: Yes.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Tina Marie: Then we take the girls to the park, and we just go spoil them afterwards, and.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Esther: We should. Okay, all right.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Tina Marie: Right take care!

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Esther: Thank you so much for your time for your insight. I'll talk to you again next week.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Tina Marie: No, I expect to hear from you very soon, when you've got questions.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Esther: Okay? Or I mean, I'll you know, yeah, okay.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Bye us, sir.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Esther: Bye, bye.
