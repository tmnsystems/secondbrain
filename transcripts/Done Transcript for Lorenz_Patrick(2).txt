00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you there? You're muted, by the way.
00:00:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I'm here.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
Good.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. was a week then.
00:00:26 - Patrick Shahverdian
Pretty good week.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, tell me about it. Workways.
00:00:34 - Patrick Shahverdian
Got some settlements in. got a big demand expiring tomorrow. So fingers crossed. But we hit the settlement will today. It's to Lorenzo and I. He helped get a policy limits on a case that I had him second voice. So it's good.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's working. I didn't hear that. Let's see. So how come it got so close to the deadline of expiring?
00:01:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
On that one, it's, that was your worst been negotiating for like a week and a half. But the case tomorrow, it's a really big one. And on big ones, they'll typically take up to the deadline. And they're entitled to wait until the last day to respond. So I followed up last week. They said they'll get back to me. So we'll see what happens tomorrow.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing that you feel like your team dropped the ball on or anything.
00:01:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, we're obligated to give them 30 days. So they want to take the full amount and they're entitled to do that.
00:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. There's still lots of things I don't understand about the processes. So when you say expiring, I'm like, OK, so it was. Um, like, expiring meeting that they have to respond by that day. Got you. you. Hi, Lorenz.
00:02:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, how's going?
00:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. That was an awesome email update you sent.
00:02:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, well, I was over to you.
00:02:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
apologize for the delay.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all right. Uh, I thought that that would be a good jumping off point to go over in our call today together if you're okay with me sharing it.
00:02:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that's fine.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, um, just let's see. I'm trying to figure out how to do this. Um, I think the best thing to do would be. I'm going to share and I'm going put this in your notes in the bottom. Um, and. All right, so I'll do it, I think. Everybody see? Okay, so this was your monthly one of ones? Yeah. I love this. Can you tell us the structure real quick of how, like, what we're talking points?
00:03:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How did you handle your meetings? How long did they take? Okay, so yeah, as scheduled an hour, we're trying to be done in about 30 minutes. But that way if it goes over this particular issues, we have plenty of time. for them to feel like we're, you know, they're being listened to. And then the way I structure it is we go, you know, basically over, I try to ask them how they're doing, and usually they're telling some defense or about how they're happy and, you know, everything is great. It's like I try a little bit and I break it up into where the biggest stress is from, that comes from the client aspects aspect of your job. And what are the biggest stresses that come from the firm, the administration aspects of your job or the structure or whatever. And so I try to keep it pretty organic. Like I don't, you know, them an agenda in advance. tell them, you know, kind of what I want to talk about. But we kind of move through those, those things pretty organically. And then I go, once we discuss those things, it kind of segues naturally into coaching points, things that, you know, we can come up together about how they can improve, how we can address their concerns and improve their performance at the same time. And then that lead, that naturally leads into goals on things that we, I want to see them work on in the next month until the next time. All right. Good.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how, did all of these happen last week?
00:05:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, actually they happened like two weeks ago. Okay. Just really bad at, you know, finding the time to digitize all this.
00:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you, so something that you could do is just, have, use your phone as a recorder, and then figure out, I could help you with this if you wanted, I don't know if it would be helpful, but it's just something to consider, but or set something up recording on your computer actually would be better because then the file would be good, and then we could give it to like an AI to scan it, but you'd have to check it and make sure that it's right, and it may not even save enough time for you, but that's something that I could teach you how to do, and it could be fairly quick, and it may save you a little bit of time, but it also may help you capture something that you forgot to take a note on, because one thing that I have always struggled with and why I do like the AI note takers despite the fact that they capture things incorrectly is that I find it difficult to be, to take really good notes and also have a really good meaning, like I can be fully present in the conversation, Or I can fully capture the conversation, but I can't do both really well.
00:07:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's true.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's something to consider that you could do that. And even if it's just recorded and then go back over later to make sure you did something. But what I want you to consider, both of you, is that there's a lot of leverage in those types of meetings, the feedback that you get. And the opportunity to take that and to improve it and to also look for the leverage in that feedback is is potent. So, for example, the conversation you had with John, who feels like he doesn't have enough time in the day to do everything he wants to do, you brought up the conversation that we had that is about efficiency. Why does he want to spend more time, probably because he feels like he could serve the clients better? And the end result is that it isn't about the time, it's about the result, right? Yeah. They really didn't come to Sweet Law to find a friend and they came here to get their issue taken care of and to get the greatest settlement that they can so that they can have the healing from their injuries and whatever else taken care of, right? So and you talked to him about that.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I had mentioned to him that 10 years I've been practicing, I've never closed a case and after the fact that the client called me to see how I was doing.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that as an example. That is an awesome example.
00:08:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They only call when they need something.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And then how did he respond to that?
00:08:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I told him that. told him, look, know, it's the reason. They like you or want to have a relationship. you ship with you, it's to the extent that you can help them. And if the only thing you provide is a good listening ear, that's not enough for how much money they're paying. They need, you know, they need their their law firm to be efficient to work on their cases rather than. And, you know, that's all I told him, look, you can, it's fine to listen to clients, and they'll probably feel a little bit better for five minutes afterwards. But ultimately, you know, the reason they hire us is because of the service we can provide to them. They have friends already.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a feel even better when the case is resolved than they were for that five minutes of conversation.
00:09:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But the question was, how did John respond to that? Did it? How did he respond? Yeah, he said he agrees. You know, he says he agrees in theory is just like when he's in the moment, he has a hard time.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make him a sign.
00:09:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Make him a little sign. Dickey never entered. I told him you'll set a timer to it. Yeah, I really.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have the timer though, but there's something really powerful about a visual reminder and what and have him write a note for himself if it's helpful, but I would suggest that it is and he should try it and write it in his own language and ask him, you know, like, do you believe that that that's true? Do you believe that you can serve them better by moving their case along and getting it resolved? So the first thing that you need to know is does he agree with that and is he bought into that? Does he really understand it or does he disagree? Because if he's not really bought into that mentality, he's going to keep struggling. He's going to continue to feel this this pull and this dissonance when, you know, he's trying to push a call through and I don't have enough time in the day. So,
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What you're saying is give him the tools to implement the conversation you've had.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's multiple parts of it, right? So he clearly still had some conflict over what is the best thing to do. Because if he didn't have conflict, he would have just been like, you're right, I gotta move forward. Because he would have been agreeing that that is the best thing he can do and the best way he can serve them. That doesn't sound like that's what he said. Did it not sound like there's still some conflict to you?
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think, well, I think I understand what you're saying. I think you're saying like if he really believed in it, he would. be able to to keep the conversations short. But the fact that he still has a hard time in practice shows that he doesn't really believe in it.
00:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what you're saying? Yes. So and it's a matter of priority. So a lot of times, most of the time, people are not conscious of priority period. They haven't even made a choice to decide that there is a thing that matters most. And I'll tell you how you can tell that this shows up in lots of people. People will say, I'm a family man. I love my family so much. then they spend 80 hours a week in the office. Those two things do not really say the same value. Now, there are different ways that that happens, right? if you think that the most valuable thing that you have to give to your family is financial security, then then that's an alignment. But if you ask your family what they value most, they'd probably say your time over that financial security. It's not always true. But my point is that there are a lot of times where we tell ourselves a half truth, right? We don't complete the story. So I'll give you an example for me. It was that my children are the most important thing to me. And then I heard somebody talking about how we save our best manners for strangers. And they gave examples of one and you're like, oh yes, thank you. No, whatever. Even when you're mad, really being polite to people and then going and snapping at kids. And I was like, I do that. I was so upset with myself. I was like, why would I let anybody else have better manners than my children. So let, lady, you're annoying me, you're going to get my attitude and my kids are going to get that happy because I'm going to let you have what you just are. I mean, I'm not, I am. I'm really that girl. Anyway.
00:14:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but there's, there's fewer immediate consequences, right?
00:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing that I want you guys to really notice is a lot of times we have half conversations with other people, half conversations with ourselves. We don't really explore the fullness and one of the things that rarely gets really clearly defined is values, almost everywhere you go. So we have a concept of a value, but what we don't do is go, okay, of the things that I'm facing right now, which is the greatest value? Because there are almost always convening values, in everything that we do. So, you know, for salespeople, maybe you think you're a person of integrity, and also maybe you've got a sales quota. A lot of times, that integrity drops priority to hit the quota. So we want to look for where there are competing values. So John's value is maybe I want people to like me. Does he like to be liked? Does he need to be liked?
00:15:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'd say so. Yeah, he's definitely not.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a yes, I know nothing about John, but just by this habit, I can tell that about him.
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:15:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is deeply ingrained and not going to change quickly. And it's not going to change without his conscious effort. So first, he has to be conscious of the fact that he needs people. People don't like him. Is he handle distributions, Lawrence?
00:16:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's that?
00:16:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
Does he handle distributions?
00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Kind of. We we have distribution meetings and I drive the negotiations and then they send they send off the the final distribution to the client. Client has needs some questions answered. They'll try to answer the questions first and then I'll come in.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is your concern Patrick that that's not a good batch?
00:16:43 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, the reason I ask is because I used to kind of have the same tendencies as John. When I first started and like every client was like super important, I would spend all this time with them. The reason I kind of stopped like really investing so much time and just talking with them is because when it would come time to dish. distribution and they would see the amount that they were gonna get they would just totally change and it was like Yesterday you were saying all these nice things and now happy you were for all the help and then now that you see the number you're getting this like totally Opposite bad review like so that kind of helped me understand that like you know I'm gonna do my best to help these people, but I'm not gonna Spend all this time just talking to them getting them to really like me because at the end of it They're probably gonna turn around and be mad at you for the amount that they're getting any ways So that's when I like really felt it on my skin and I was like that's when I kind of understood what dynamic I should have with them Yeah, I guess that's like two ways of saying the same things is I think I'm I'm concerned with Is it is not establishing solid boundaries right away, but you're saying
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
those boundaries, you and Patrick are saying those boundaries come from values.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His value is I feel good by making them feel good. I want them to like me and be happy with me. What you need to do is remove the veil of falseness, which is that's not even real. There is no friendship, they don't like you, they may be in a good mood and happy with you for moment because you're doing something. But number one, if your real value is I want to do the best job that I can for them because they'll be as happy as they can be with it, then the best job is the best job and that isn't about listening to them and feeling like they're in a good mood. That's a pacifier. That's thumb sucking is what it is. It's don't say that's it.
00:18:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's a Tina with no sound skills.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always people's favorites, but it's what it is. It's placating himself. actually, not the client. So what you need to do is find a way. And it's important. The reason I'm making sure it's very clear to you is because what you need to do is walk down that path. And so you can try to say it as gently as possible. But if you have to tell him he's basically sucking his thumb for his own comfort, if you know what but that they that they can see is true to go. Oh, and some people will never hear it. And that is important also. You need to know can they acknowledge the truth? Because if they can't, you cannot coach them better. So you're going to continue to have this issue. Then you have to decide, you know, trade offs being what they are. Is that an issue you can tolerate? Or is that an issue that you need to coach towards termination? And, you know, if all other things being considered, he does a good job. Sometimes we just have to tolerate that people aren't doing a great job because that's the situation that we're in. so, but you at least need to know where that's at, because also you don't want to just keep having the same conversation over over But, as you can see, like we've spent 15 minutes talking about this. There's a lot of nuance to it, nuance to why these issues happen and how you can resolve them if you can resolve them and understanding what the default behavior is in a person that causes them to operate in a certain way. Sometimes it's just because of ignorance. Sometimes it's because of psychological. this needs that they want to have net and they're just not aware and sometimes they can fix it and sometimes they can't. So you understanding why the thing happens first as his supervisor is important. So then maybe that you can find a way to help them through that. So and it comes up and other things. All right, so let's move on past that, ponder that a little bit, kind of come up with an action plan, trust your instincts, you know him, you know, use your own language to have those conversations, but consider the conversation about values, about needs like needs to be liked and and helping him be aware and decide, you know, what he wants to work on in himself. end in the business and also discuss competing values, the value of doing the best job or feeling the best about it for a little while while he's on the call with the person because those two really don't have any true relationship as Patrick illustrated. Okay, you so, man, there's a lot we probably spend most of this time talking about everything that went through on these meetings because on your meetings and notes that you took, because this is going to be about leadership and managing your resources. So I'll make sure to save a little time at the end. And if there's anything like Patrick, if there's anything you want to bring up. And we'll talk about this, but because you talk such really good notes, even even if it took you two weeks, these are good notes. So focus on the win, not that we could have done better. We can all always do better. better, you know, that's true, but this is good. One that you had the meetings, two that they were thorough, and three that you had good notes, and also your notes illustrate your understanding of it. And I can tell that you coached well. So that was good. Okay. So you talked about efficiency. I've also got some Patrick sent me an email. not sure if we talked about it together. I want to go over some of the stuff that he shared to. I don't know, my days are like 10 years ago was like yesterday and yesterday was like 10 years ago, like, and it gets worse. older I get. Okay. Anyway, stressed out about older cases, talked about the need to just touch them at least once a week, and they won't seem overwhelming. Okay. So I loved this. One of my strengths is consistency and it's movement. And it doesn't matter if it's a something very powerful. At the end of the day, when you go and you kind of take inventory and take stock of what I have. up in, you don't have those big goose eggs right on the board. don't have like, I did nothing here, nothing here, nothing there. You may not have a win all across the board, but you have movement. And there's something very powerful psychologically at the end of the day when you're going through that without having those big zeros. You know what I mean? Knowing that there was nothing that didn't get touched that needed to be. And so what people tend to do a lot of times is procrastinate, you know, and just leave themselves a whole bunch of stuff to do. But when part of the job is waiting, and most of the job is waiting, waiting for insurance to get back to you, waiting for the client to get back to you, waiting for all these different things, the frequency of the touches has a whole lot to do with how well that case goes. It should never be held up by Sweet Law. Never. everything should be moved on your end, steadily, all the way through. One of the things that can help that is the kind of the time-blocking that I think that we talked about a little bit, sometimes like the days run into each other, client conversations run into each other because I'm talking about the same thing all the time. But it is doing like tasks with like tasks, like and Patrick and think last week, which is you know distributions, types of conversations. So if the work is making phone calls versus writing things up versus checking email. Keeping like stuff with like stuff will help you get into a flow better rather than constantly changing types of tasks.
00:25:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense Lorenz?
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out of curiosity pastor, did you have any thoughts about that? Since we spoke about it last week, did it come up for you at all?
00:26:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
What topic exactly like categorizing doing certain tasks together?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so one of the things that we talked about specifically was checking email frequently versus just trying to get in a rhythm of certain types of tasks, letting it come to some type of clothes rather than going, oh, there's an email or something else.
00:26:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, like yeah, I've been checking it less throughout the week after we spoke. But like this morning, it was like, and I walked in and checked my email. saw there was like a few distributions that needed to get done and it was like an hour just spent on that. You know, getting the client's addresses to send checks, sending it to counting, so that was like an hour block. off just to get those done. After that, I think I wrote two demands. that was like sometimes spent there. And then I just did like, had some offers, gave the clients calls about offers. That was like another 30 minutes. So it does make things quicker because I'm in the state of mind of negotiating or, you know, convincing a client to sign something. It's not like I'm going from, you know, a bad conversation with an adjuster and then have trying to sway the client to sign a distribution. It's like, yes, angry to know I need to be very convincing.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, you know, so it's energy management and mental focus. And I love, I'm so glad that you were able to observe even any kind of shift in the week, because what happens is that gets even better. Because I'll take it back to consciousness. Like we were talking about. consciousness and values and people generally just not even being conscious of the fact that the thing that they're doing is based on a value. Sometimes the value is fun. I'm doing this because this is fun. Sometimes the value is, and frequently, consequence avoidance, right? Almost, I don't even know what the percentage is, but if you think about what you watch a lot of people do, it's consequence avoidance. Something got their attention and they're doing it because they don't want something bad to happen. The proactive people who are constantly working because they're building and they're creating intentionally, do you think that that's the majority of the people that you know? Just kind of scan people in your life. People who are always on purpose, always like, I'm doing this because of this because of this because of this because this is what I want. Or is it more like, yeah, I got to do this. I got to do this, because otherwise this, and I got to do that, because otherwise this, right? So what you're doing is becoming the first person who is intentional about everything, everything, rather than reacted and consequence avoiding, you are driving towards a specific consequence, only good consequences, right? By being more conscious about why you do these things and how you spend your time, rather than like I said last week, to, I got an email or some sort of stimulus, a phone call, just a thought that popped into your head, oh, I should do this, which is me ADHD. So I got to really think about, okay, wait, don't do that just because a pop, a head popped popped in your head. Do that because it is that the thing to do right now. So the compounding effect of the way that you're choosing to behave is first of all, because you're allowing yourself to. to get into flow, you're going to get better at all of those processes way faster than you would have if your bed mode shifted constantly. So you'll probably get better at distributions because you're staying in a zone for a little while, you'll probably get better at all those types of tasks. Now that won't be as noticeable as quickly, but I'm going to tell you it will happen. Have a little faith in me, trust me, keep watching it because you tried that experiment and you're like, Oh, was actually. But the other thing is, and I don't think I brought it up to you last week, maybe I did, but you brought it up is the energy shift. So that's a really important thing, things that make you grumpy. I think we have talked about it at one time.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Have I told you guys about energy sandwiches that sound ring about little?
00:30:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing, right? Some of the things that we do really suck. And specifically, some of the things we do make us kind of probably in a bad mood because they're contentious by design. So, Well, distributions is doesn't have to be contentious, but it can be probably as a lot of times dealing with certain insurance companies, they farm, know, there's it's conflict. So that's not something you want to do where you got to go, you know, try to get something out of a client because that's going to put you in bad mood. So you want to sandwich something that kind of regulates you in between. So email might be a good time because you can like calm down a little bit, take a beat and then go make phone calls where you're not taking the energy of dealing with this negative person to this client. Does that make sense? So, like I said, there's a lot of tiny little things about how you do your day to day stuff that has nothing to do with the law has nothing to do with a lot of things, but just the way you think. And just the way you choose to do your work. So keep that in mind. Stress about all the cases. Okay, touching them stress about him. getting firm numbers. So I love this. When he feels like there are so many things outside of his control zone, client response time, clients following through with treatment insurance limits. And you talked about how to do the things that we can control really well in order to minimize the effect of things that we don't control. I was like, yes, I read that and I like, you go friends, that was awesome. And I can totally see Pat in his very calm demeanor, saying the same type of thing. Like, who is he doing that? Because I feel like you're trained for that, for the military. I just know you shared enough that I think that that's something you would do.
00:32:39 - Patrick Shahverdian
Am I wrong?
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. All right. So good job, you guys. Okay. So John still wants to know what he can do to make his job a long term career that allows him to provide for his growing family. And you talked about how to become indispensable by consistently growing as a case manager, team lead. Mentor for Mary and Paralegal. I love that. That is one of my favorite things. have two kind of I don't know, M.O.'s part of my M.O. two aspects to my M.O. which would be one having unimpeachable character. That means I am the same everywhere. My feistiness, I will punch an old man in church if he's encroaching upon a young lady's face. I don't care. You can be high priest. I don't care. If you crowd a knee back off and if you don't take the signal, I have punched people. Okay. I'm a defender at all times. I'm enthusiastic all times. I love God and Jesus at all times. I sometimes swear really badly. Jesus loves me at all times. You know, but that means because I'm the same everywhere that I go that if somebody says something and it is out of alignment with my character, everybody's gonna do know that that's not true. Even if they don't like me and they don't want to defend me, they'll just be like, that's not possible because she's literally always the same person. So unimpeachable character meaning just you're just the same and you're person of quality and integrity. I sometimes I'm not the most polite I can be rude, but I'm never hurtful, I'm never vengeful, I'm never dishonest, I'm never um anything that somebody would go like those qualities, right? So that's one thing. The other thing what was the oh this I am always seeking to increase my value to those I serve. So I think everybody is technically replaceable, but that word indispensable is one that I'm always looking for. I've been a consultant for 22 years. My business is 100% what I'm mouth. I have not done any marketing and it's been a six figure business for working about 10 to 15 hours a week, by the way, since, I don't even know, it's about nine years. So, I have the people pay me a lot and in my industry, I am an anomaly. This doesn't happen. My business stands out even at like the highest level coaches. There are a few exceptions that that can do what I do, but almost nobody does. And here's why is because when I feel like, and this has happened several times, I feel like we're having the same conversations and we're just maintaining, but we're not growing. Well, my job is growth. My job is improvement. They can maintain if they get to the point where they're like, yeah, Tina, I'm doing all the things you taught me. I've got nothing else to teach them, then I don't lose that client. I don't want to, mostly because all my clients are really awesome, but also because then I've got to go replace that and I don't want to do that either. So I'm always sharpening my saw. I'm always looking for a way to be better at what I do. I'm looking at the new technologies, I'm improving my study of psychology, I'm improving my study of leadership, I'm improving my study of operations, and because I'm always growing, and also because I'm working with people who are always growing, that conversation continues to evolve and I know that they're not having that conversation anywhere else. Plus I'm paying attention to them, I'm taking notes, I'm thinking about what they're working on throughout the week. I don't just talk to them and then I don't think about them until I talk to them again the next week. And so because of that, I know because most of us don't have somebody that is really paying close attention to how well we're doing, and looking to make sure that we're doing better every week. So I know that I'm serving a very unique function for people that probably no one else is serving except for maybe their mama's. No. And so what you said is great is what are the functions that he can serve that maybe other people in the team aren't serving or what can he do best, but because we can't all do, like there are some things I just, I don't pay attention to details really well. So I do if I'm listening, but if you're going to give me a 20 page document, I'm never going to read it and I'll read half of it because I will read a paragraph and then there's my place and think a new thought and my brain just can't focus. So we've all got weaknesses, things that we don't do really well. The point is not to try to get better at the things that we don't do well. The point is to be excellent at the things that we do well because that's already in our real house and what that does is create so much lift that where our weaknesses creates drag the lift over compensates for that does that make sense uh so I love that you did that how did he respond to it um I mean he he was positive and he agreed with me which is his natural response you know that did he and this is what I want you to listen for and I also want you to tell him if he doesn't give this to you that this is what you're looking for and the conversation is not going to end until he does this which is give me an example of how you would do that what do you think about when I say that what does that look like to you open ended so he can't parent your words back to him and if he tries to parent your words back to him you say okay but that's what I say said. In your own words, what does that mean? What does that look like? And then you can just be quiet and let him sit in the awkwardness. However long it takes until he decides to not well also did you know that I think it's like two twelve is statistically across the board the least productive minute of the hour of every day and guess what our meaning is it's right around there so I won't take it personal just little bit just little bit and I'm sick did you eat oh that's not good did you eat chicken or beef I did the chicken first today so now you get to look forward to the beam all right all right all right this is last Please come and say some words. Um, so with John, there's, there's a little work to do, but I love what you're doing. I love the goals, nine cases ready for demand, 200 K and fees. So what I would like to see, I don't know if you have this next week is, and this may take some time in my brain literally can't even picture the start of it because generally when I want something like this, I will create a foundation. But I would love to see team steps, um, with all the cases that you have, who's working on what on a spreadsheet and then what that equates to monetarily so that we can track that improvement so that we can track your performance, your leadership performance. Obviously, we're going to have the big number at the end, which is what are the gross to. but if we break it down by how each individual set of goals impacted that bottom line number, then you'll be able to have an even bigger impact to that bottom line number, because now you know what the little levers are, right? specific goals by what specific people was able to create that lift?
00:41:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:41:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Patrick, can you do something like that for your team too?
00:41:31 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean, I've still yet to speak with Cynthia for a monthly meeting, but I spoke with Elsie on Friday.
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can start. Maybe you guys like could power out together or we can just do it on a meeting together, because pacing wise, it isn't massively urgent. It's as important as it is important to you. But I promise you that the experience of organizing your data, visually so that everybody can see where we are, what the the micro goals are for the macro goal, which is, you know, whatever your attorney fees target that you're trying to hit and settlement fees. There's something really powerful when you see the numbers there, especially when you see the pattern of the numbers and how it's changed over time. And generally, with almost no exception, I'm just going to say, because I can't think of an exception, there probably is one. But when you start to visualize and you have those goals, and the reason there's no exception is generally because of the people that I work with, the caliber that they are and the caliber of their teams and their efforts and whatever, is that it automatically starts improving. And then what happens is people see their improvement. So a lot of their self doubt and their excuses go away. because the evidence is irrefutable and they know everybody else is seeing what they're doing good plus they also see everybody else is good so that kind of inspires competition but in a healthy way really you want people to compete against themselves not everybody else so whatever your best is this month best it next month if you can we know that seasons don't really work that way and really prefer overall looking at year over year rather than month over month uh because of the dips so you just want to make sure that the average is increasing remember how we looked at your document um Lorenz and we were looking at the averages which is also something on a gover let me any notes to self uh we'll do that for fathom so i want to remind myself that i want to go over oh attorney fees okay so anyway your spreadsheet with the Averages, but I also want to go to mark who said he will get us a report that you guys can look at that has Oh, he gave it to you.
00:44:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he didn't tell me not not not do attorney fees, but the settlements.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I Want you to see attorney fees too. I Want you to see everything. I want you to see who's hitting percent who's who's maxing Policy limits. I Want you to see all the stocks. Do you not want to know?
00:44:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah I feel like he's keeping that pretty close to the best. No, I don't think I don't think that's the case, but I I'm not asked No, well, that's not true because he does publish attorney fees once in a while doesn't he mark that trick Yeah, he doesn't do it at the end of the month. So like he doesn't do it on the last day of the month
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the reporting is inconsistent. I don't think it has anything to do with keeping close to the best, but Mark doesn't like doing that.
00:45:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I misspoke.
00:45:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think he keeps it close to the best. Yeah, I mean, even if he did and he chose to do it, there would be a reason for it and I would probably get behind it. So it's not an issue, but I'm just thinking based off of the conversations we've had that it's probably less of that report exists easily and making sure that everybody has access to the report. Because there has to be assignments and all of that stuff. anyway, but the average attorney fee plus total attorney fees plus cases, because if you guys can see that, both of you would feel pretty good about some stuff. And until I get to share that, I'm just going leave with her. right. So, you said she's happy and feels like she's learning a lot each day so and that she feels like. she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. Is that just like, did you feel really good about that?
00:46:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and she's, you know, there's definitely things, you know, I still want to work on with her, but she is kind of growing into her own. It's good to see, it feels good to see that.
00:46:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just two months ago, she felt really guarded and you kind of had to pry things out. Yeah. And you set an intention of helping her feel safe. That was one of the first conversations I had with both of you is like, you know, be aware that you have the ability to do that for people. And from what I could tell, I didn't witness anything, but Viri seems very guarded and unsure. And for you to have a report like that two months later, when we only talk, you know, we've had maybe six conversations all together.
00:46:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, she's really, really kind of, you know, her shell is kind of cracked open.
00:47:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want you to think about this. Imagine that this is your, your wife your daughter or your mom or whatever, right? A woman that you care very much about. And she goes to work and feels like I don't want to lose my job and I'm kind of afraid to speak up. And then two months later, she comes back and she feels like she's happy. She's learning a lot and she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. How would you feel to see that woman that you cared about, have that kind of environmental change at work? Is that a little thing?
00:47:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, it makes me happy. I'm happy for them. proud for them. I'm proud that they're, you know.
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was my sister because my sister has had some issues with some terrible people and that she went from a place where it was a hostile environment to she felt like that. Life-changing. And I need you to understand that because you created that intentionally. That's really important. I think that you need to understand that you improved her quality of life, not just work, because do we not all take some of the stuff home with us?
00:48:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's just, I'm just, that's a big win and I'm great job. Thank you. Okay. So feeling like she doesn't have enough time for tasks, ask her to set three non-negotiable tasks each day in order to prioritize more efficiently. I love that. And the other thing about that is you are helping her set wins and wins. Like I was talking about those goose eggs at the end of the day, they feel terrible. But if you have some big W's on the board, when you go at the end of the day, those goose eggs, that they are there, they don't feel as bad. You guys are understanding what I'm saying when I'm talking in that analogy, right? doing yes. Okay. No, Patrick, are you being a smart alec?
00:49:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, Goose, what do you mean by Goose?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goose egg, it's a zero.
00:49:17 - Patrick Shahverdian
Why does that do a geese?
00:49:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is some expression.
00:49:24 - Patrick Shahverdian
I figured it out, but I was just wondering. About the egg.
00:49:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, I lost you.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really hope that didn't freeze in some terrible looking. You did. Good thing I don't know what that looks like. Okay. Anyway, scoreboard, a big zero goose egg, right? So that means, you know, mentally looking at it as or an L, right? loss, something that didn't get done that is emotionally impacting you because you're like measuring all the things. that you should have done and you've got this, this weight of that wasn't there, you know, like imagine you're, you're in a, you know, tournament, you're looking at the scoreboard and it's a zero, like that just sits there grinding at you versus counting your win. So if none of us can get all the things done every day. So you had our set three non-negotiable tasks, which automatically insinuates that those were chosen by a priority, right, and a value, because how do you decide it's non-negotiable?
00:50:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
had to have some sort of valuation process.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you, it was embedded in there, even if you didn't talk about it specifically, you did. And then what you gave to her is that if she is able to complete those three non-negotiable tasks, she automatically has three solid wins every day. Yep. that's really powerful.
00:51:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, something that we did in my last law firm. I want to add on to that, you know, as she builds that habit, but it's like a, I think it's Tony Robbins method for what is the three set three non-negotiable tasks. Eventually, you want to set like three tasks that are not as important, but it would be nice if they got done and that helps you organize your brain in terms of priorities rather than what's in front of you.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and it keeps you focused because if you're trying to think about everything, that's overwhelming. But if you're just focusing on those, those non-negotiables or Stephen Covey uses it as big rocks. It's a big difference. Okay, so feel safe with our team, challenge her to take a more active role in meetings and take more client calls. I love that. She wants to move 10 cases ready for demand. and then we'll push on collecting medications. Okay, so nice clear goals. started making intro calls for new clients and said she needed more training from John in order to feel more comfortable. So with John talking as much as he does, make sure that you record those calls so that you can also say, okay, here's what was great about that. Here's what I don't want you to do. Kind of thing.
00:52:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just. I have a plan actually. have a grand master plan about those intro calls.
00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's that?
00:52:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me talk. Mike, if you scroll down to Mike, one of those goals is we're going to do this together as we we're going to start drafting an intro call script. And we want to make it pretty standardized across the board so that when files shift from one team to the The other is not like, well, why didn't we get that information? Now I got to go back and get that information myself. Um, love that because we're working on that with intake. Did you know that? Uh, yeah, Mark has hinted at it.
00:53:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We've been working on it for months, but we've been talking about it for over a year.
00:53:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So just, you know, takes a because that name, you know, the attorney intro call is a lot shorter. Welcome to the forum. Do you have any questions? know, this is kind of the process for 10,000 views is what's going to happen. My, my, my will be in touch with you. But from the assistance point of view, there's so many things to think about that I think sometimes they either focus too much on two or three points and not get the other points or sometimes they just like, it's like an over little bit of information we don't need. Yeah. They spend too much time on the floor on those intro calls.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you did that. And something else to consider is almost kind of a, like a game plan. So what do you do if this happens on the call? For example, they go off the rails telling us about all of this stuff, call control. We talked about call control skills, right? So to me, that's what you're implementing is a specific game plan for managing and controlling the calls that are had with the clients. Probably be done elsewhere too, but especially with the clients where people are often going to feel like the client is driving the conversation, but really we should always be driving. We know where they need to go. We know how they need to get there. We know what needs to happen. We know what's not helpful, you know. So I love that.
00:54:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I don't know, they all responded, I'll ask them all how they felt about bringing in some people to. give some training about regarding call control. They all were pretty excited about that.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is awesome.
00:55:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
an option that you're considering.
00:55:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just have to get Mar, where's my note that? On board that, okay. Team wants call control training. Yeah, I think that would be amazing. Having had that experience myself been like changing. Literally, because I use it in all kinds of conversations, like the way people use probably the numbers put the different kind of tactics. I use that all the time. And to be able to politely interrupt, nobody likes it. But even if you don't like it, you can help kind of assuase them so they don't there. and really focus on them as though everything else doesn't exist. But you need that context. need the things like, hey, Mark's the guy. can call it 10 o'clock at night or message at 10 o'clock at night and ask a question. And he's responding with help, not, hey, idiot, why didn't you get this figured out? It's 10 o'clock. Why are you bothering me? That kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that context matters. So Mark gets to be a human being like the rest of us. And if he stressed, you know, it might come out. So not excusing it if it's if it's ever bad and that if there's a conversation that needs to be had then have that. But I'm sure all of you are just like sometimes like if something's really stressed, it's hard to hide it. What we can do though is just make sure that what we say is true. So maybe he is disappointed. I get disappointed with things. I did it on the call with Mark yesterday. I was asking him about something. He said something I'm like, I am flabbergasted. You just said that to me. we Hey, I'm talking about this for three years, and I ask you this question, you telling me it's hard? I don't care if it's hard. Blah, Yeah, anyway, so. Okay. my God. He's still very nice to me though. Yeah, so anyway, again, if there's an issue that's a real issue that needs to be addressed, then let's have that conversation. But if it just is uncomfortable to be told, we could do better and we need to do better, and we don't like how that feels, we can probably get over that. Now, if you're being insulted, if you're being degraded, if you're being told you're worthless, if you're being like, why do you always fail? Like, you know what I mean? That type of stuff, that's unacceptable, that should not happen. But if you're being told you can do better, we've had this conversation multiple times, that's a real thing, right? So, keeping those and then really counting, okay, but what can we rely on?
00:59:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
ion and what that does for you is helps them make sure that they're looking at other people like that not just Mark or not just you but they could probably relate that to you too like if you get impatient from time to time and you give them this conversation then they would be like oh yeah I can relate that to Lauren because he was not happy about this but he's also the same guy that's like how are you doing how can I help you here's some tips blah blah blah you know what I mean like yeah and I and I reassured her that you know a lot of that is because she's working away from the office she doesn't get the physical instant feedback and physical cues and you know body language and expressions yep and so this it can be triggering when you don't get that feedback over time you kind of feel a little bit you can feel a little bit suspicious of everything everything everyone says you know
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you guys get kudos from Mark's like, hey, good job.
01:00:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You did this really well Yeah, he said good job to me a couple of times and that yeah, I mean Realistically Mark when that's concerned like I'm very focused on what what else can we do to to keep improving and So sometimes I forget to like let the people know that yes, you are improving. Yes, you're growing.
01:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, you're doing a good job I guess so what I'll ask him is being his coach also is like Do you feel like you look for an opportunity to compliment everyone? Sincerely, but it is One thing that we all need to do. So if and there's also a kind of, well, coaching. Okay. I'm complimented.
01:01:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel the same Patrick? I would really like your thoughts on that.
01:01:16 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, he's told me good job. know, for me, I mean, because I don't have as much experience. Sometimes I don't know if I'm doing like enough for. Like sometimes I may feel like my numbers are good that month. But then he's like, you know, we suck this one. So I really don't know if I'm doing a good job sometimes, but I take it more as like. You know, he comes and talks to me basically every day, once a day, just to check in. So as long as he's not like bringing something up bet negative, then I take that as, you know, just keep going. Because like if there's something wrong, be like, hey, I need to get you to get this done or. So I don't expect them to be like a good job on every case.
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't think that's effective or whatever, but I do want to know, do you, um, because there may be subordinates, maybe they don't get as much interaction and maybe they only hear if something is wrong, but also I'm an extractor. So if I don't know how things are going, I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask everybody, I'll ask clients, I'll ask, like people may, I may report to them, but I don't think anybody's above me. Well, they are in respect, you know what I mean, but, but some people are never going to ask for that. They do need to hear some level of, you know, or they, for sure, at least not need to just hear what's wrong, you know what I mean? But female staff might be more inclined to feel that, I'm not sure.
01:02:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And Marci Fence, he is, like, I've discussed this with him before and he is very well aware of that. blind spot. And he's, you know, he's made, he's really, like, made lot of effort to go out of his way to help.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is members night and day from the time we started working together. So that's good. But it's just nuance. And we all need it. We all need somebody to help us see what our blind spots are. So it's not a pick on anything. And I wouldn't care about it. And I wouldn't be here if Mark didn't care very much about everyone and how he shows up. He shows up every single week. Has that passed away? He came to our call the next day. He's like, I'm not messing this. That was amazing to me. So, you know, we're talking about it, but we're talking about it because we're all here to grow. And I just want to know, so I wouldn't just be like, Hey, you're a jerk, but I would ask him.
01:03:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think, you know, to go back to Jessica, this is not about Mark. Like it is, but it isn't.
01:04:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more about like, you know, when you feel isolated for a while and start thinking about disconnected. But that's also part of the structure of Sweet Laws. There's a lot of remote stuff. So what can we do to help facilitate that feeling of connection and that unity and that confidence. So if this is the structure that we choose to operate in, and that's the company that he's created, what can we do to help make sure that the human resources, right, are getting the human needs met and taken care of. So because he chooses to be the best leader that he can and he's always working on it, I want to know that so that I can share with him. What do you think about how you do this? Whatever. It's a small thing, but it's an important thing. And it's one of those things that we work on. And it's also something I don't get a lot of insight into because I'm not in the office. So and we only have an hour a week that we're talking. We've covered are a lot of browned so that's helpful but I promise you I'm not making it into a big thing be that okay anyway um 204 uh my concern with the amount of handholding necessary to take care of sweetball clients feels like it's eating into other clients times it's almost like the opposite of John um so that's interesting yeah if there are ever two polar opposites that'd be John might they are complete offices I would be really interested to see what happened if they um doubled up on each other's calls for a little bit and just you know like like Y swap kind of like what is this like um ponder on that a little bit because I don't want to take really much more time I want to go through this really quickly and then we'll just table the rest for our next time um concern with time management I love this three non-negotiables once they keep getting case closed out um want for more big cases there's not Not a lot of control over that. Everybody wants bigger cases. If Mark would have it be that every case is a big case, so there's that doesn't love case review, meaning I love that. So the one thing I wanted to point out here is that if we get some stats that everybody can watch, what you're going to be able to do is say, OK, is when this was our data before we started these team review meanings together. OK, and this is our data after. There is obviously a correlation because we didn't really change much else. And so as you start to implement things and you're watching your stats improve, you get to then reinforce their understanding that I didn't just tell you to do something randomly that it was strategic, that there was a reason for it. And here is the fruits of your labor. So in terms of just them being consistently, you're still doing the things that work because people tend to forget.
01:08:03 - Patrick Shahverdian
I don't know. I was thinking maybe for Jessica, like, you know, obviously she used to work here and now she's a remote, so maybe kind of reinforced the fact that, you know, Mark liked the work she did and allows her to continue to work remote because, you know, clearly he likes everybody to be in the office and, like, remote working is, like, last resort type of thing, so maybe that could... It's true. Reinforce her thoughts about how she's doing, like that.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I have only heard good things about Jessica and I don't hear things about pretty much anybody except the attorneys. I would always get her confused with America because he would have different tasks, he was doing certain things, and anyway, the point is I've heard good things, so that's something also.
01:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I told her, know, in my nose. That's basically what I explained. look, I know there's like a difference between like being in the office and not being in the office, but I can tell you from my end, I've not heard anything but good things from Mark and I want to, and Mary and everyone. think you should.

What do you guys think about if we had just kind of like a Wednesday or something and like you or just some sort of highlight of somebody on your team did something good that you just make sure to pick out something good that anybody on your team did once a month and maybe I can get Mark to have this be like a sight-white thing, hey, just wanted to celebrate these people on my team. did this, this, and this and then maybe he, you know, do that for the attorneys too, but it's really, we're human and we do need to be told that we're doing a good job and there's a lot that happens when we get that public praise, know, we could just be like, oh, we're adults, we don't need that, but. We're human beings and we do need that. What do you guys think about me proposing that to him?
01:10:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'd be interested to see the structure so Yeah, I guess I've tried that with my kids and All they see is like I'm praising one of my kids and all the other ones see is that they're not doing that so Children is very different The timeline perspective and it's very selfish In because I'm working on my psychology degree.
01:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
learned a lot of things I had no idea and I wish that all parents knew and we really should have a manual. Okay, that's all I'm gonna say Subox off but That is part of it is just that the children are inherently and psychologically and development me developmentally very selfish and self-centered So it's an interesting correlation, but it's not probably the same thing and the thing is as it happens over time so like we could start it with let's celebrate everybody on a team okay so markets all his attorneys you guys get all your people and we just have a great big this is amazing you guys are amazing let's celebrate that and then after that maybe it's one one person each and we just intentionally rotate through and just keep it going because it really it feels good and we'll know it's not placating like you have to look for real things but you should be able to find them because the thing that there's quality people so and we don't want to phone in that effort we don't want to patronize them we want to say this was real and here's why it was real this is what value it brought to us it was a great job what do you think Patrick I think so I think it could get a little bit like I don't know how would it be like good job on getting this record in or no like really just so it could be a quality it could be a growth or something of improvement like I know
01:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
is this quality.
01:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
noticed this behavior. I noticed this improvement. And, you know, and maybe we reduce the frequency.
01:12:09 - Patrick Shahverdian
That's what I'm concerned about.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like if it's like, everyone's that type of thing that's special, then it's like.
01:12:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah.
01:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe we rotate with the attorneys in each week. One of the attorneys highlights one person on their team, or it could be the whole team. You know, it could be a win for the whole team. But really, they did want to make sure and pay attention and make sure that somebody's not left out and that everybody's getting celebrated. But yeah, so you guys would need to kind of brainstorm on what the frequency and structure would look like. But just the idea and the concept to make sure, especially because you guys are remote, like it could be a spotlight on the person, right? So you're not just talking about what they did great. It should be. something that's in there, but also who they are, what they like, how long they've been with sweet law, whatever. And as big as the team is, I mean, you could go one person a month or every other week or something like that. So there's ideas we don't have one defined yet, but I would love you guys to think about it. And just remember that these are human resources. We are people. We do have psychological needs. doesn't stop because we're on a job and getting paid. We'll do better and perform better if we take care of those psychological and emotional needs as well. Okay.
01:13:38 - Patrick Shahverdian
I do think it's important for sure.
01:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Well, you guys keep thinking about it because every week you impress me with all the things that you're learning and you're doing. And I think it's awesome. And I look forward to these calls. I was dead tired. I had zero energy. And then we're inside that email.
01:13:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
