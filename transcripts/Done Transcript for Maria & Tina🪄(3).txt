Hey.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:00:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry about that.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've been late. No worries. I am dead tired today.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what? And I've been. I turned off everything the weekend and did nothing and I'm just getting into it. Do you want to just go tomorrow with full fresh energy or later today?
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I can't even think right now. Honestly, I have a call in an hour and a half. And I think that I thought that I'd be able to function better because I'm getting up at 5 30 in the morning, but getting up at 5 30 in the morning. So I take her, then I pick her up at 6 40, then I take her back to school at 7 40. So there's no napping or anything in between, but there's no anything really in between. Because there's not enough time and it's killing me right now. So I don't know what I need to have my schedule be. But like, and then on Mondays, I have a 10 o'clock call 11. a clock call and a one o'clock call. So no nap or anything, but also those are super high level meetings that I need my brain at. So I probably need to figure out the, re-figure out the schedule because I want it, I need this and I, but I, I need to be functional.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm really glad that you took the weekend off. And also, I didn't want to just not say hi even if it was short because I think, I do think that this is good. I have enough to, to see. Oh, I can tell you that last week. I didn't get all the things I wanted to get done, but I made it major attraction and a lot of things that was really important. For one thing, I have two storage units, combine them into one. I finally was able to get a bigger one. And the other thing is for videos, Okay, so I realize I need to script everything because I'll go much faster scripting everything because otherwise I'm reworking a lot and scripting will help me do that. So then the other thing that I did was spend a lot of time looking at video editors and solutions. These high definition cameras drive me nuts because like you get a regular camera you see the person that you see in the mirror most of the time but you find that one to like pull out all the wrinkles and the bags and you're like you don't even look that bad in real person in real life. You know what I mean? it just doesn't feel good and I don't want to be like super filtered or anything but I also don't want to be like why are you like magnifying everything that's wrong and whatever um so but then there's then there was the you know So the AI help with the scripts can help you look like you're looking at the screen if you need to look down and look at the script. So that really helps with time because you don't have to memorize it and keep practicing. You still make good eye contact and then I don't know if it was the script or cap cap. But one of the versions was really good at the It's mobile friendly, there's a responsive nature of the video. So any size they looked at it, it would move the talking head. And format everything so that it always looks good no matter what screen size. And so I'm thinking long term future and also one and done kind of video editing that can I could just put on all the platforms. So I did a lot of research for that last week. So I think I'll use a combination of cap cut and descript because I think the script was the one that did the. out of formatting, although I imagine CapCut will catch up soon. CapCut does almost everything else, has a desktop version and phone version. I didn't know they had desktop version and they can do the skin smoothing features without like the crazy Instagram filters and you know, just try to like, I'm not trying to look glamorous. I'm not trying to look 20 years old or like the Pripy for thank you camera. Yeah. I don't want to go buy new camera, new lighting and all of this other stuff. So I'm trying to figure out because this is my thing. What is the simplest way to feel good about what I do to eliminate rework, whether it be because of a script or because I shoot and edit the video once and it works on all the platforms. So to me that was a major coup because now I can just sit down and write my scripts and shoot the videos this week for the um, profit time, energy maximizer plus I have a video testimonial coming for that exercise from somebody. She did it 12 years ago. So do you know who Leanna Ling is?
00:05:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know if I told you this. That name sounds really familiar.
00:05:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. She owns AdSkills now.
00:05:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's the CEO of AdSkills. God.
00:05:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's in bulk.
00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Anyway, she's been working with another media buyer that I've been working with for 12 years.
00:05:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know Ryan Moran? Yes. Yeah.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he wrote a book called 12 Months to a Million about a company called Shear Strength Lab that I helped him build.
00:05:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:05:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I have a testimonial from his partner that says I forexed them when I came in, when he felt true. he didn't say, he didn't give me a testimonial. Of course, I'm not noted in the book, but they wouldn't grown that fast without me. Yeah. Anyway, his media buyer for that same company did my program and is like, it was life changing. He still applies all the principles now and he went through it one time. So that's the staying power. That's... So anyway, so I didn't get done what I wanted to get done, but this is the thing that I measure as I made significant traction and what I did was make sure that the work I do will go faster, go smoother, all that stuff.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, which you'll find is like, that's how I work. I don't beat myself up about what I didn't get done.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure. Yeah, but this is the good stuff. So anyway, so that's what the script this week basically is it shooting the videos for as far as that goes. And I'm working on getting a new merchant account to.
00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's kind of stuff that I have to get done. How about you? We're going for a merchant account. Deposit. Deposit.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that a good place to do it? Yeah, they're amazing. So they've been in processing for 25 years. Their company is new. They did it for other companies.
00:06:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So they know a lot about it.
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
they. They have white glove service, you get the text constantly, text support of the owners are handling things and they have a team, but you, they will negotiate to give you the best.
00:07:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know anybody that can be third marching team fees.
00:07:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They also have a great affiliate program. So either like, you can offer a really good discount to your people and get a little bit of a good discount whatever, like there's, there's some play with that. But yeah, they're, and we don't know how great anybody is really until it's been a long.
00:07:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, so they've been really tried through the fire, but I don't have a lot of processing. I have Stripe and I have PayPal on top of it. And I've got like, I thought Stripe would give me an issue with a $10,000 coaching thing with all the issues they've had went right through.
00:07:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never done such a big transaction with Stripe.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really good. Single transaction 10,000 and single transaction two days later, transfer to my account with no problem.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So okay, that's really good.
00:08:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I didn't but I have been with them for a long time. But I've probably not even done $10,000 over all the years I've been with them because I used PayPal or wires. I use wires a lot, because I do big amounts. So anyway, deposit. Yeah, I can send you a link if you're interested in it because then you can also recommend it to other people and you get a kickback from their processing.
00:08:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, some of the link is yeah, I'm looking at others. Yeah, no, and so I'm doing good. I got I'm going to go soon and now pick up my dog from Dougie daycare. And then I'm going to take my mom out for lunch. So it's good. I went for workout yesterday and made a workout schedule to go now in the evenings. I used to go in the mornings, but then I sometimes didn't make it because it's the morning, you know, I want to do this. But nope, seven 30 at night, which is good. Because that's my snacking hour. So if I'm in the gym instead, so I feel great today. Still like waking up, but I feel good. And yeah, that's about it. We're for tomorrow, right? You want to just keep tomorrow? I'll fill in tomorrow on everything I've been doing. I've just been actually creating a new school community because I, being the mama bear, I just want to get that going. And it was a bit of a learning curve, just because silly things don't work. Like you click the HTML editor because I thought I could just cut and paste from Thinkific, each course module over to school. But no, so anyways, but it's worthwhile doing. I have a VA that could do it, but I want to do myself because it's refreshing my memory. I've had so much good content out there, but I sometimes forget what I taught. So this is my memory to then make a good introductory video. Hey, this is what you get, you know? So I'm excited about that to get out and being more visible in the lights.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Since you're paying that much money for school, I will tell you that. high level and Dan told me that he sent me like three amazing videos last week, but okay school is taking the best of I mean high level is taking the best of school and One of the other platforms. I can't remember. Oh, I don't maybe a circle, but high level is it's got the leaderboards and Oh school you get one community with high level. can have multiple communities multiple sites So I know you just did all that work, but that's something to think about if you care about the monthly fee The one thing that school does have is people can you know? You've got kind of foot traffic because they see they'll tell you similar communities but that hundred dollars a month for a really limited thing and I tend to stay away from the thing that marketers who market to marketers do Yeah, yeah, I was shocked that it was per community because I was gonna try and start the paid community
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yesterday and I'm like, wait a minute, I got to pay another night seven. So then I thought, well, maybe I'll cheat. So maybe I do have a free go high level account for a friend of mine.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe I'll just use that for the paid. I will send you. Yes. Let me send you the videos that Dan sent me last week.
00:11:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Thank you.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, because he I mean, I get Dan's brain for free, which is for fun. And he's gonna get this snapshot. Where's Oh, I love a blows my mind. Oh, I hated it. Well, I didn't hate it at first. Um, I'm texting this to you just because I'm in text messages as a twerking code. And I was like, I can't on that. But the thing about it is, it's like, I mean, because open source, that's what that is when look how many amazing things we have gotten. And tech people have loved. It's been built off of open source Linux. We have Firefox, you know, these I think that tools that I lived with for the longest time, I'm going send you two more just because they're not all related. But when Dan goes on a rabbit hole, he finds geniuses.
00:12:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's what he did last week.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he talked about what he wants to do with you, too, which is cool. He's got long term plans for working with Maria because he also thinks you're awesome.
00:12:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll pick it up because I was like, I'm going to talk to Maria all the time now. Introducing the last one.
00:12:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The right thing. Hold on. This was the last one. One, two. this is the right one. This is the right one. Copy. Yeah.
00:12:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, yeah. So. So that snapshot.
00:12:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't remember what it was that he.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
spot, but I feel like you're welcome. feel like it's like $500 or something, whatever, but he will, he's buying it and he'll figure it out and see how it works. And then I can pass that on if you want. So you don't just like go get it and don't know, but he's been really digging deep into that.
00:13:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, okay, what was I going to say?
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. So the high level thing, what I think about it in terms of like the open source thing is that what they have, because I hate building everything all under one roof.
00:13:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's why I'm not done. I'm fusion shops on support.
00:13:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't have my, I didn't want my business all under one roof because first of all, it's just such a bottleneck. You have one tech team, you have one, one visionary, right? And it's just, it's slow, it's corporate, it's all that stuff. But with high level, the way that the snapshots work, all these designers, all of these coders are building all of this awesome stuff and worst case scenario, even if high level sold or like split off got really ridiculously expensive. All these other people have been working and doing something that they never did before because there was no reason to it. So now we have all these new visionaries. There will be splinters left and right if high level screws up the system somehow. So either way, I think that the innovation pace is enough that I don't have to be worried about it. So anyway, just sharing that perspective about it. Yeah, but the collaboration that is available and the way we can tap into other people's brains and get their snapshots with their training, nobody can compete with that right now.
00:14:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So since you're talking about school and I've been on this community hunt for well yeah like and I have a free Version go high level because my friend of mine pays the five hundred She just gave me one and I use it for sales pipeline management for taxing mostly But that's more for Korean's business, but uh, but it's like my account so I can do whatever I want so Den just gave me once you had another client give you one. I'm just like yeah exactly. That's what happened Okay. Well, um, you have an amazing day and I'll see you tomorrow. Um, And hopefully you get energized I love terrible Oh, you're good.
00:15:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
