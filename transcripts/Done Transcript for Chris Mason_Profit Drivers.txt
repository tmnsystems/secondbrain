00:00:00 - Chris Mason
Interested in for him is he he has this he developed this app the software that uses in his gym and it's like in 25 other gyms That That tracks each individual because the the model the model that he runs is called semi-private So it's like one trainer to six trainees and they pay like a hundred bucks a week And so with that model You you can get to a million dollars with only you know a couple hundred members and And so that's so he built this app that it When the trainee is doing their workout like they they see what their workout is on the app they log Their workout and then it You when they hit a PR or there's like celebration what's their universal? tree, celebration kind of thing there, but I'd like to explore a little bit more of that. So that's on my radar for the future and seeing that as selling it as a SaaS to other gyms. And that feels like an opportunity for me to be able to share in that revenue because he he would sell it for a couple hundred bucks a month. So that's on my radar. And then I had a few conversations at the Grow Summit with a couple of gyms, one of the speakers, and those years new relationships I follow up with them over email for back from two. I'm going to meet with one of them. We're emailing back and forth to find a time and he actually has a he works with him and he has an agency and is a gem owner. I don't know his full story. If you saw this guy, he would not look like a gem owner. would look like an alcoholic. He would look like a... but...
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry.
00:02:20 - Chris Mason
So I'm going to have that call with him and we'll just see. No, it's just relationships. and then with with Brian, with Titans, he actually... I'm in the middle of an email exchange with him now because he didn't want to do this live event. He backed out of that and so I just asked him like, is this... or have you reached the limit of the amount of work that you want to be doing? Because that's helpful for me to know. and He said that Okay Don't run your ideas Okay, so I told him I was like, you know, let me know if you reached your your max and I can when I come up with ideas I can run the idea through the filter of is this going to create more work for Brian? he said don't don't run it through that filter Rather run it through the filter of if it's not in Brian's sweet spot Who can he slash we pay to do it My checkbook is still the most valuable tool in my toolbox and they said please keep thinking without filters
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and then filter but still it is definitely much more clear yeah so that was five that was five days ago i i haven't responded then he just sent me an email i have given you that same filter many times he's not as clearly and and and brian and brian's word but which is um so the difference is the thing that he really clarified is his sweet spot um so what we need is for him to define what how he sees that because how i would have defined it and i think this is based off of what you would say is that brian loves talking to the people yeah but he um and this is why he really needs to clarify because live events but but um at his convenience and when he feels like it to me, that's the thing, because if he's not feeling well, if something's going on in his life, or he just doesn't feel like doing it, like, to me, that's his sweet spot, but it's not a dependable sweet spot. So I think that he might not being really knowing himself or paying attention. Because to me, that's the issue. Do you do you like, how do you see that? What would you say is his sweet spot that you can consistently count on?
00:05:34 - Chris Mason
Well, he, earlier in this, you know, he talked about his definition of retirement. So it's like, well, he wants to, if he's going to do something, he said, the live event qualifies under two, my three rules of retirement. It's something I'm good at and it attracts people I want to hang around with. the third issue, it doesn't qualify in the present. It's something I don't like to do. And then he talks about, like, he, I guess he had a
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a really bad taste in his mouth because one of his mastermind events like nobody showed up and he was really you know that but it was during covid and anyway um hit I mean I don't know what his sweet spot is so you added another thing that we need to have qualified quantified which is who does he want to hang around with and does he always want to hang around them or does you know like what are the parameters because you have to think in filters because here's the thing and this is what you should say um in your way he has committed to doing things and not done them every year to the point of things getting canceled. And sometimes we're for health reasons, but not every time. So, how many times have you canceled anything that you committed to?
00:07:16 - Chris Mason
Never.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Whereas I have never done that. So, trying to figure out what your parameters are, I can only guess, because we don't operate the same. And that, you know, some of the old-timers and I will take that as flippant, pass it aggressive. It's not. It's just the truth. And so if, like, you need to know, should I ask you about this? Because you guys have a menu. basically. These are the things we do. Is there anything on this menu that you never want to do? Is there anything on this menu that you really, really would like to do, but potentially may not do? Like, this is what I need to know, because all the things that you've agreed to and not done, you agreed to. You're grown , man, a grain is something and you don't do it. Now the health stuff is completely separate. Yeah. Right. daughter's running was a plan thing. Yeah. You know, just not being in the mood for stuff happens. Now it may be that he's actually really feeling bad and not fully being transparent. That also happens too. But the point is that probably at least 50% of the time Brian over commits and doesn't do something. But that over commitment is not an unreasonable business commitment. So for sure. Or that he wants to speak to it or not, there are limitations significant in the way that he will show up in business. So now you need to ask yourself how much effort do you want to put into a conversation with somebody who is not honest with themselves, much less you?
00:09:20 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I was, I want to walk today and I came back and I was just thinking about, and I didn't have this email from Brian yet, because he sent me an email an hour ago saying, I didn't get a response from you on this, although it didn't require one, but I love your thoughts, smiley face, just wanted to explain myself further. So he wants me to reply, I was thinking about that email I just read to you from a few days ago and just feeling this like, he, I didn't, I don't think I thought this, but like, he may not, I don't. I don't know that I can that's not what I'm wanting to say this is not what I want to say, but I'll say it like I can't count or depend on him for things I'd for like when he says I want to do this live event, and then he he backs out and I guess I'm just thinking I'm ahead of like, I need to there's opportunity there and I started I was like what what are the opportunities with with Brian that that don't require me to have to do it a ton of things and wrangle his schedule and I was like, you know, I've been wanting to do a new experience and on the break through advertising sales page. I started thinking about like what are things that I earn pieces on, and then I had this idea last night, is what kind of got me thinking about. about it. Michael Cinoff has just a ton of like old-school seminars and products and I mean he's probably got hundreds and I was like you know we've got all these TXL members captive like they love Ryan and we never really sell them anything we give them stuff for free and I started thinking about I wonder if we could do a deal with Michael where we're just offering like his digital training things and Brian can talk about the the glory days and and we sell to TXL they get a discount we sell to his list and and there's that connection to the the the OG days I guess yeah so I had that thought last night of You're just trying to think of something that's simple that doesn't require, I mean, I'd love it if Brian would show up to, you know, to do like a live event or something, but it's like, it just doesn't feel like I can bank on that.
00:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you just kind of brain dump and you whatever can rip on it, but look at the opportunities that you're interested in What the thing could be, what the price could be, what the revenue could be if we get X amount of people in it based off of experience, right? So some calculations with the potential upsell to something, whether it be into TXL or something else, and then go, okay, this is what it would take to fulfill it. This is what Chris would do. This is what Brian would do. Now, if Brian isn't interested in it, so create the contingency with the plan originally. If Brian isn't interested in, we could do it Chris alone. We could do it Chris plus a guest. We could do it Chris plus, you know, past recordings of Brian. We could do it with Chris plus. It's Brian prepares a video ahead of time just on his own convenience since you guys are making like podcast type content and it could be repurposed into little clips that way, like what are all the things and the partnerships that it's in. Brian's world. So he gets a piece of it. And but also for your own, you are your own man, and you have your own connection and you're developing them on your own merit. So not everything needs to come back to Brian. So when you look at that, let's go, okay, what, what on your own, just do it on your own. And then if there's something you're like, this really, I would only want to do it if I do it with Brian, then then present that. And then start making your decision. But say to him. If you commit to this, I need your agreement that the only reason that you would not do this would be, you know, severe help.
00:14:53 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just I change my mind and I don't feel interested in it. You ought to have the conversation about reliability and potentially over-committing. I think it's time for you to start speaking a little more plainly in terms of accountability. Brian likes to feel good. He needs to feel He wants everybody to like him, wants to, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that. Until it gets in the way of truth, you need clarity, clarity requires truth, and he doesn't do that. Like I said, not necessarily honest with himself, and I don't think it's malicious. I think it's just, I think it's a defense mechanism. I think that other that that emotional discomfort is difficult. And so he kind of dances around things a little bit. And I don't think you're gonna change that in him. And I don't think you want to change that in him. I don't think you want to do that work. So what I think that you do is just really think about his patterns and what what he really does show up well for. And give him a chance to say yes or no, but really look him in the camera eyes and say. Do you think that even if you're having a rough emotional week, you'd still want to show up and do this? Unless like, you know, you're in the hospital and you're having some symptoms or something like that. Like I really need to know. How not just Brian on a great day feels, but Brian on a this week is rough. This month has been. like, do you think that you'd still want to do this? Because if you don't, let's create the contingency right now. And if we get, you know, and depending on what the contingency is, if the contingency is you do it on your own, you just plan and prepare for that. So you're good to go. If the build it with the other person and Brian can come in as an additional bonus. You know, those, anyway, those are just some, some ways to think about it. I do think it's time for you to spend a lot less energy building around Brian.
00:17:45 - Chris Mason
Yeah, that's, I wasn't probably time. It feels like a could pull back from Brian just in terms of like how much time I spent thinking about what to do to grow that business. I remember when I went through that traction book or whichever one talks about the integrator.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rocket fuel?
00:18:21 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Traction Matt had talked about it too, but rocket fuel.
00:18:25 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel. I went through their test and I wasn't quite like a full-blown integrator, but I was definitely not a visionary. One of the things I've appreciated and I've been thinking about this lately just because I haven't had this in a long time, like a really good about like setting a vision of like what do you want. And I've I've felt in me like when I have that Like I can I can go there's fire. There's energy and you're not the only one bringing it Yeah, I think I was thinking like when I was working with Lee like I came up with all the ideas Working with Brian's like and now even in this email. He's asking me to come up with the ideas and It's like man. I Yeah Yeah So But I have really appreciated that about Tim and And it's got me it I was thinking over the weekend Actually on my way back from Chicago is like like really like being In this little team Like because I got to meet everybody that I've only seen and it was the dinner together like it was really cool and fun and this girl Amanda you know she's she's got a couple of like product ideas that she shared with me that she just doesn't know how to bring them to life and we talked about maybe just kind of jamming together once the dust settles from the sun but one of them is targeting the wives of people who are into prepping and I forget it was usually called like it's not this plush prepper or something but basically like why should you give up your free fee girly things so it's like prepper stuff but for for women. And I was like, that's an interesting niche in that market. And so anyway, I mean, right now, my whole thing is just like where my thing I think about is like, what can I do that will bring me revenue. And then I'm just going to do that. And I'm just going to work and keep making my connections with people. We've got the breakthrough advertising bootcamp coming up in October.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask you question. Do you remember, since in a while, what we figured out your effective hourly rate is?
00:21:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, with 10, with 10 is like 70, 75. And, but that was, was doing two hours of work a day, and so I, since we did that, I've just been doing one hour.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. And what about with Brian?
00:22:14 - Chris Mason
Uh, with Brian. I don't think we calculated that.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to, because here's, there's a lot of opportunity around you. And I love that you're realizing that you need to be with higher energy people. Because energy is contagious. And if your energy isn't the thing that's being caught, you're catching other people. Yeah. it can drag you down. And that's really, you've been fighting it. there hasn't been a lot of awareness about that. It was, but it was, it wasn't at the surface. It wasn't in the conscious subconscious way. Yes. But energy is not enough. Earning potential is huge. You're in another situation, though, with Tim as energizing as it is and as good as the team is, where you're not the offer owner and you're not earning anywhere near your potential. So we need to have a minimum effective ROE rate target. And I really think it should be $250 an hour minimum right now, like ASAP. So I think that everything that you do needs to be ran through a filter like that. So there is fun stuff about working with cool people and helping out the amandas care of. So first things first is we've got to improve your earnings per hour. like immediately. Because then you can do the fun stuff. this is the thing. Really, I don't know anybody else that talks about it and I, we talk about it and our stuff and I'm just going to, I think I'm just going to keep harping on this and be teaching everybody. Most of us need to have tiered offers and it isn't just about income but it's also about fulfillment and need. So I have three and they're not even tears. They're more like arms, right? arms. I've got my little Etsy store. It is not profitable. It oozes money. It's a creative outlet but it has compounding power because every time I create the product it can be sold on multiple platforms but it also it's niche. There's kind of LDS phrases, things like that. It's a spiritual thing. I create things that other people haven't. slightly but that slight difference in messaging really can be whether something just really slaps and just hits like yes that's me or not right so it really isn't about profit and that's okay and I'm consciously making that choice and that's just all there is to it but it fulfills in a way nothing else does then there are my high-level people my doctors my attorneys just like you know they're a thousand dollars an hour they're seven and eight bigger businesses they hit differently everything that I do I can spend an hour with them and make their whole years worth of investing in me giving them something to do so there's a few things about that first of all I have to keep my saw super sharp I really have to be thinking on a time I have to have my data organized I really have to have my numbers organized I have to take good notes. I have to, you know what I mean? Like, I have to be on the top of my game. I've been able to not be on the top of my game and still get paid really well and then still be happy. But the more I am on top of it, the happier I feel, the less stressed I feel about having to replace them, the better they do, the more that they go make referrals. So that pays for everything. That's the income generator, but it's also the, you know, keeping me super sharp kind of thing. And because I'm looking to leverage them always and which means smallest teams possible, max profit possible, it gets me staying on top of things. check all the different AIs, all the new types of tools, including in the medical field with HIPAA compliance and all these different types of things. So like I'm playing at high level across the board and I don't do that anywhere else, but that takes a toll on me mentally. and I can only do so much of that. I can't do that more than two hours a day.
00:27:04 - Chris Mason
if I do it two hours day, I'm spent for a while.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's really limited. I can't have a lot of that. Then there's the give back. There's the people. I just want to help all the moms. I want to help the dads too, but especially the moms. the moms are gonna go help the dads. moms are gonna help the brothers. It's like, then they're gonna be taken care of if I take care of the women. 100%. But I want to be able to help them. And that is not a very profitable thing in the offers that I'm thinking about doing because they can't pay as high level. My earnings per hour to start with, like if the number gets bigger, but then I have to hire more people and manage because the more important thing to me is really serving that community very well. So the margins are going to be much smaller. They should still be good, but much smaller. a lot more group effort and but it's a completely different level of fulfillment, a different level of I'm going to say the same things over and over and over and over and over again, which I kind of do anyway, because fundamental concepts, right? But I'm going to say the real big stick things over and over again. And so that doesn't satisfy my big brain efforts, right? The one is like, let me think about all the fun exciting new things, let me learn, let me explore. And on top of that, I'm also serving my mission on top of that, I'm in school for my psychology degree. So, which sounds like a lot and compared to how it's been for the last several years, but I was bored in languishing and I didn't know that. But with those are the compartments. And so when I'm looking at everybody, unless it's, well, even the doctors and attorneys, the entrepreneur visionary ones that reach out to me, they love marketing. They love automations. They love leverage. So I'm working with people who are also, no matter what they're doing, they're not the average type. They have different levels of fulfillment that needs to happen. So all of us need something that has staying power that has the compounding. It's the steady rock, right? So it's got a community. You've got followers. You've got a constant message that really just doesn't change. It's a fundamental message. It's a fundamental thing for you. think it's copy and marketing or maybe even just direct response itself, which is getting people to respond to you based off of what you're doing. But there's also just kind of business. I would really put you more in the marketing realm of what gets excited because of what you go back to most. is offers and serving the the market. So, but you're also interested in business and you're interested in freedom and you're interested in self-providence and you're interested in sustainability and you're interested in people working for their own values not for some arbitrary amount of dollars, not for shiny objects because you want to keep up with the Joneses, right? So, you're the, we talked about this before like average Joe, but the not average, like it's not average. It's think that, so when I'm talking to you about me, to change things. What I think it is is that, and I also know that when we get clearer on what we want, that's when it comes to us, right? Because you can set a really clear attention. Your conversation starts to change who you pay attention to and want to even converse with changes because you've made this switch in your mind and made a decision. This is what I want to attract. So there are two paths that I think that you could consider, and one is, potentially three, one is a consulting gig that is a profit sharing performance-based incentive that is decided from the beginning, so you're not arguing about it. it could be relatively small, feel better not be having a hot flash going on. Okay, then pause is awesome. Anyway, so it isn't about necessarily how big the percentage is, but it's that that there is a growth opportunity, right? Because then the onus is on you is to leverage that. And you can potentially either reinvest some of your earnings into somebody that so you're barely touching it. And that's an engine because it's an engine for you because you brought it because it will keep making money and then you have a person that helps you with it. Like I've been telling you I want you for sure to be using other people's time and talent a little bit more, but first we've got to get you to the money where you can really do that. So that's one version of it. Another one is a you know a profit sharing partnership, but not with somebody old. this is not an ageist thing because some people can be really old and just really just like they're they're still at it there's there's all kind of things but I mean like old in their heart just like right you know like it without fire let's let's put it with that somebody who has fire in them for the stuff that they're doing and maybe they hate marketing but they love their products love the market love but but don't love marketing you know there are lots of those people they're really good at fulfillment and they may be good at marketing but they hate it and they or they also have come to the realization that they're splitting their time doing something that they're not efficient at and can make so much more money so that is the thing I really think that you should be kind of super powering your magnet for yeah Somebody who's very energized very excited and has a profitable product who just realized that They are ready for you know a full-time marketer and can pay a base pay plus performance So your original EHR isn't going to be very high, but your job is to do some really good marketing Research and to see that you're willing to put some skin in the game and go I think that if I put these split tests in if I Created this order bump if I created this continuity program if I Make sure your list hygiene was really good and improved your inbox, but I don't like that's a whole lot of stuff Mm-hmm, but you know, and so it's an investment But that's how you explain to them and justify why you're going to give me this percentage Because there's this is a lot but you really need to make a list of these are all the things I'm doing. This is Each one of these are expert level full time jobs. Do you understand that person like that I'm talking to you? These are all full email, like list manager, full time job, affiliate manager, full time job, marketer, full time job, copywriter, full time job, right? These are expert level things, and you can do all of these things, or you can hire somebody out. So either there's a budget for it, so it's not coming out of you and you make that agreement, to begin with, but either way, I think that that's super leverage, gets you into some exciting stuff, and can keep your EHR around $250 or better. For sure, better would be great. Cause let's do some quick during math. Hold on a second. So if we did, if we had you working at, go away, what is this, these camp? called you base camp. Bye Felicia, hold on, kept you here later. turn 50. I can say, turn 50. the truck times 30 times 4 equals $32,000 a month.
00:36:08 - Chris Mason
River and months, yep.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you worked 30 hours a week at an EHR up to 50. So if you cut that in half, and it was $125, then it's $15,000 a month. Yeah. the thing about that is you could easily have $5,000, $10,000 in paying other people, really great other people in any of those departments, and have them split across multiple partnerships, right? Yeah. Where they're really happy, that's the thing. Where do the numbers look amazing? Where you're not stressed out, where your brain isn't the only one on the things, because that is a huge bottleneck. That's if you get sick. if whatever, so many things, right? So you're leveraging by having multiple other people. If you have a copywriter, but you don't have a marketer, guess what the copywriter is also? They're a marketer, you know what I mean? Marketer, not the copywriter, guess what they are also. know, like there's overlapping skill sets. So in terms of like giving a brain a break, or giving your brain a super boost when you get to talk to those people and they give you an idea and you're like, oh yeah, that's awesome. And it's just part of their job to do that. So this is where I think that you're at, Chris. And if you, I don't know where you're going to find them, but I think that if you just spend a lot of time, we were talking about it in 2020, building your network. I want you to be so much more intentional, intentional. What the crap is with my brain, intentional bowl? That's not where Tina knows that. Anyway. Keeps talking in the third person psycho. Okay. really reaching out and looking for people like that who have amazing products, who are still fired up and excited about their stuff, and who aren't talking about. We're going to 10x this year and blah, blah, and making those really crazy statements about these arbitrary goals that are just about getting attention. You want to see that they're having conversations about life is all about family. At the end of the day, this is what matters. So you want to see value statements from them that show that they have a center and a compass that is not money. You also want to see their language being about appreciating talent and really lifting other people up. Like create the avatar for your ideal partner. What do they look like when they're talking in social media? What kind of emails do they write? What kind of videos do they make?
00:39:02 - Chris Mason
What is their language?
00:39:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you will profile that type of, like Jeremy Weiss, always lifting people up, always about his family, super smart, loves the stuff he does, always enthusiastic. And super connected, he may know some of these people. And another thing that you can do is you can do a tiered commission thing like, hey, man, you got these connections. I'll pay you a referral fee if we do some business. I'll even pay you a long term of referral fee of like 5% of whatever I make. So not whatever the thing makes, but whatever you make or 2% or whatever. So you just be like, I mean, nobody pays me. I make connections all the time and you're going to pay me just to introduce you to people. You know what I mean? Like, play differently, but pay to play so that that everybody gets blessed, um, and it's not about, you know, manipulating or anything like that. It's just showing gratitude in a currency that they can use however they want to.
00:40:13 - Chris Mason
Mm hmm. That's an interesting idea, um, because I'm working with him now on this podcast and you brought him up. was like, yeah, he may know somebody, but I mean, heck, he may also be that somebody I know.
00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like him. I think he's an amazing guy. I think the two of you have a lot of synergy chemistry, like, um, synergy was really the word that I had the chemistry was that for sure too. Yeah. Do you know how God be working? He just like pops things in. Yeah. wasn't an accident that that's the name that popped in my head either.
00:40:53 - Chris Mason
Like there's a lot there.
00:40:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's interesting. That's aspect of it. Like he's not going to meet Chris Mason's, Chris, you're very special. I've told you that lots of times, but your values and your quality, your integrity, people aren't just going to find that. How many people like me have you ever met?
00:41:17 - Chris Mason
I don't know. Not many, if anybody.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Never met Chris Mason before. You know, and I can't say that of everybody. There's a lot of people I'm like, yeah, I know few of you. And they're the people that are idolizing Grant Cardone. What's his face? I want to say Vinny, like my cousin Vinny, but that's not it.
00:41:45 - Chris Mason
What's his, he drinks wine, Gary Vee, Gary Vee.
00:41:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Gary Vee. One of the two of them kind of in the same boat.
00:41:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah.

They're not that unique to me. There's, there's, there's other ones of them. And it's the grand grand grind, money, money, let me, motivate you but really my stuff isn't just not together and it's like Gary V looks like like like the emperor on on Star Wars. Brad Cardone's doing a video about hustling and grinding in the hospital when he just had a heart attack and his wife looks like she wants to slap him upside the head.
00:42:23 - Chris Mason
He just had a heart attack?
00:42:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, this was a few years ago.
00:42:26 - Chris Mason
Oh, few years ago.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah, yeah, no, but he was like, you can't stop me. I'm like, you're the poster child for what not to do.
00:42:35 - Chris Mason
Oh, I remember that. Yeah.
00:42:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, my nurses are mad at me and I'm looking at his wife out of the side. And now, but now she's all, you know, she's all big and she's in front of, you know, she's got her own following and everything. And so, of course, she's gonna toe the line and play the role. I'm like, anyway, so you bring in not just like you know all your marketing skills and business skills but you you come with a compass that matches just a very small group of people and especially in your age bracket because it takes a while for people to realize that money is not everything you know so that's one of the reasons a lot of the older people are more drawn because they finally figured it out but there is a generation of people that are like they got it from the beginning they're like oh what no this is crazy anyway so Jeremy Jeremy's connections anybody else that you might find through there build out your avatar and make sure that you have a base pay if there's an existing business and it can be relatively low but that's their skin in the game with you because you're going to put your time in they're 100% going to get a benefit out of it And, you know, you can put your time elsewhere and they can say no, but base pay, minimum of 2,500 whatever a month plus performance incentive. And then your job is to start acquiring the types of people that you would need, whether they be an automations person, which you've already got that infusion soft girl. So you might be able to do some things for you, several things for you.
00:44:24 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Potentially a media buyer, junior copywriter, graphic designer, not top of the line in cost, know, optimized leverage kind of people that don't charge a lot, but then you kind of give them incentive to be like, Hey, that did amazing. Here you go. So they're really happy and they're loyal. But I think that that is a good play for you for a while until you've made enough money that you can start putting in investments and getting your money to make money for you.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, that's So it's like, the thing that I, that I wouldn't want to think about, what is it that I want, is like, well, just want to pile cash away and, and be able to have revenue coming in through from investments. And, and when I think about that, was like, you know, by it, because I really like working. Like, I like singing my teeth into something, into a project. And so, like, if I had that, I don't feel like I would not, it's not like I would just sit around. No, I'm fine.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then you could be a really high level consultant if you wanted to do, or just a profit partner consultant. You know what I mean? Not an operational consultant like you are now. I think you and Seth, and maybe you, Seth and I, should do something together.
00:46:11 - Chris Mason
He... Oh, Seth.
00:46:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Now, the difference is he's not making money, and so it's not, this would be, this would be one of those things that you feel like called to or don't, but what he is working on now is teaching people how to create trust and use trademarks to basically protect yourself against government theft. But given the state of the economy and what we all see the writing on the wall, whatever, you know, I think that there are extremist levels of that, and then I think there's just not preparatory levels of that, but I think that there's a life on all the, you know, the family compass, the liberty compass, the hard-working entrepreneur that I love my nation, but my nation has a lot of issues, compass, you know. So, but he just had a baby, his wife just had a baby. Marketing is not his thing. You could do it in your sleep. He can teach the stuff. He does a lot of research. He has very high-level conversations. And he's got millionaires at the Wazoo that just love him and trust him immediately. There's a lot, if YouTube became good friends and really talked a lot, I think that there's a lot of synergy there as well. And I would love to be part of that.
00:47:57 - Chris Mason
Yeah. I mean, I like Seth. have a really good conversation. with them and I don't think like they're all I'm in them through you and so yeah I mean I'm totally open to that like I for example like one of the things that that I there was a guy at the grocery summit that I didn't get a chance to to speak to but he was talking about this infinite banking concept which I mentioned to you for a long time ago this way to use whole-life insurance and yeah I have and I wanted to meet him and I just it would have felt anyway we didn't get a chance to talk but he was he's teaching that concept for Jim owners and I've always been attracted to that taking that idea working with somebody who's an in that and in setting up those those policies and I mean, you've got to love to hear about that, too. Like, I could get, if you get your insurance license, which is not that hard to get, then you can earn on the contract, the policy contract that somebody does. And so that feels like a really motivating message to me because it's like, man, because I see how it works. And my missing piece has always been like, I'm not the expert to talk about it. I don't have all the credentials behind my name, and I'm not a financial, whatever. So that would be both a good partner for me and a good industry. Yes.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested in you should go back and have that conversation. I'll go back to stuff, too. He almost pretty much doesn't like to work, but that's not it.
00:50:04 - Chris Mason
The work that he does is learning.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's having high level conversations, so it's learner teacher, learner teacher, that's it. But he learns the most high level types of things and he wants to teach. He wants to teach everybody. So buddy marketing operations, so like I would be all ops managing all the teams, making sure the money is taken care of, making sure he stays grounded and doesn't keep, because he will jump around a billion times classic visionary, you know, but you can't take the good of somebody and not take the bad, like we've all got our stuff. So I think if you were willing to, like I would just do some work until it made some money and we'd have the parameters, but I wouldn't be getting paid. My money will have to come elsewhere, but I don't think there'd be a lot of time in it. But what I've watched him do time after time is he makes a post, a millionaire's reached out and want to give him money. So you can't do regular math and regular predictions working with people like that, not working with people like me either, working with people like you. mean, your math has been regular, that's because you've been playing in other people's playgrounds with their rules. But you are, and I've told you this repeatedly, nobody shows up as consistently as you do. You are a rock. You stay on top of your game and you're always helping people, which is two things. One, you just get the benefit of the gifts of but also that good karma, God is out there blessing you in ways you don't even know it. And just helping you through things because You're just always taking care of people. So anyway, I will all set up a three way chat. Probably he likes telegram. Are you on telegram?
00:52:11 - Chris Mason
But I can be.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't what's up. I don't know what's up to you. I think but because it's owned by Facebook and the conversations that we're having on Facebook is super spy. They just are like it was crazy because Dexter had this experience and I'm like, I'm telling you I've been telling you turn off your messenger microphone because he's had profiles of people he was around playing poker with show up and he's never been around those people ever. And I'm like, I like, I promise you it's listening just it's that one app. So because they own what's up and they're talking about end to end encryption, whatever. I'm just, you know, whatever.
00:52:53 - Chris Mason
Okay.
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, if you can do telegram, if you can telegram send me Can I say we'll connect all connect us with Seth and then we can have a conversation about it because again, that's a long place. So you have to control your time limited a little bit. But I don't think it's very difficult because you're part of the conversation to me would be offer creation. You know, and that's just an idea. Then Seth has to actually create the content. And my job is to make sure we're okay, let's create the framework and make sure all the stuff is there. Find the resources whatever manage that type of thing. So it shouldn't be a burden. It's not going to be big and fast, although he's probably going to need something big and fast, but he's good at doing that. Anyway, that's his burden. Our burden is make our money. You have to make your money. We would do this together. So just keep in mind it would be something that you need to compartmentalize. Anytime you do anything like that, that's a passion project. You, you got to keep it limited. No matter how it excited. is somebody else gets, don't feel obligated to do more than is prudent to do. Don't outpace anybody. Don't care about the project more than anybody else does. That's just kind of my rule of thumb. I will not work with anybody who I care about their business more and I show up more consistently than they do. I'm like, I'm going to pull back because that's just a recipe for resentment and failure ultimately. So don't do that. Okay. So just to recap everything for anything with Brian, I think that you should just think about all the things that you would want to do and do dirty level of work would be. And I also think that you should repurpose as much stuff as you possibly can. creating those offers. And can you repackage that people have said no to and offer it to them as like vault access at a lower price so that you're getting money out of people who have never paid you but are on the list who have definitely raised their hand with interest but said no for whatever reason why did they say no was it a price? Can we survey people like what are the actions that you can take to get to to extract more out of the existing assets that maybe you've been neglecting because you do book camps and you do TXL and you do everything else like let's really think about extracting from what we have and leveraging what we have then if it's thinking of stuff to do with Brian um a real conversation with him about how are you going to show up and and what you need and just say okay here's what's on the table in every single one of these scenarios it can be done so i need your full agreement, either one that you will show up on number two, that it is okay if I do it and you are not going to go back on the, well, I don't want you to do it by yourself kind of thing. Okay, so either you're all in and you will do it, or I get to do it, but we are not saying we'll do something and not doing it again. Then get what you have a good conversation with Tim, like really meditate, ponder, pray, however you want to handle it about what's on the table and be willing to walk away if you're not respected fully and honored for a time. Don't be afraid that you won't get more of that. You know you will. You know you will. Talk to Jeremy, just nurture the conversation, find out what his goals are. What does he want to do? what's he not doing that he wants to? What likes him up? Like really get to know him because he spends all of his time talking about everybody else. Talk about him. Like what's going on, Jeremy? Um, and then, uh, see who else is around and see what's on the table and I, and biggest thing is in the back of your mind, always $250 an hour EHR, keep that in your mind and do the math and figure out how can I make this happen? can go down to $125 an hour EHR because we did that math. That's $15,000 a month at 30 hours a week and 30 hours. We know that you'll work that and not be burned out, but we really, really, really want to shoot for that $250 with everything new that comes in unless it's the passion project and you limited to maybe two or three hours a week tops. That's, that's what I think.
00:57:46 - Chris Mason
Okay. Yeah. That's, um, did we record this?
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you send me the recording? Yes. I had the note taker come in, so yes, I will send it to you. Okay. It didn't, it wasn't at the very beginning, but I think when we started getting into it, I realized it and turned it on, so.
00:58:05 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:58:08 - Chris Mason
Thank you, Tina.
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're always welcome. Good to talk to you.
00:58:11 - Chris Mason
And let's see where we are. guess I'll talk to you in a couple of weeks, huh? Yeah, I sent you a text on my telegram.
00:58:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool.
