00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, oh wait, you sent the, I just saw that.

Yeah, we're a little bit behind. We can always screws with things. Yeah.
00:01:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You didn't post how many are out.
00:01:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, I left this one. was three or four. Well, let's see where it goes.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm lucky is like non-existent right now.
00:01:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I've been sending them updates because usually when I give them updates, things change pretty quickly, but it's not, it's not turning. That's a little frustrating. So I'm putting more into Walker because it's working. And quite frankly, we need the leads, but they're really quite expensive.
00:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, are you on a laptop or phone or what?
00:02:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I got both. mean, I'm on the phone, but I got my laptop with sort of screen.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then what's your situation right now?
00:02:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So because.
00:02:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And I went to distilleries. In Louisville, Kentucky.
00:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're in New York.
00:02:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I am in New York.
00:02:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was in Louisville until yesterday. Oh, nice.
00:02:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes.
00:02:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Real bourbon.
00:02:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Like real bourbon. Bourbon and horses.
00:02:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
00:02:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, he's known for. Yeah. I don't want it to because it was Christian from Gape's 50th birthday. I was the only work person to go. So all the other people were his friends and that was cool. So I didn't have to be like.
00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so we got to have fun and everything else is good. Okay, so there's been some back and forth with what Josh is working on. And I mean, it would kind of be helpful to me, Dan, if I could be looped in with Stacy and Josh, so there's not quite such a middle person who's not on these conversations. Actually interacting with Josh, is that possible?
00:03:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's the first thing I'm going to do is let me send an email to you real quick and Stacy. Yeah. a second. It'll work better if I just do this now. You guys can talk amongst yourselves about ads or anything if you want to.
00:04:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, let's talk about some of the other state specific pages. know we talked about that bit with Missouri and New Mexico and Colorado. Do we make any progress in that regard or not yet?
00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they're all getting built. So there's all written pages for each.
00:04:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they did.
00:04:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They linked the like there's two. There's like that's footer. There's the footer text links that go to actual URLs and then above that are like map links and the map links go to GMB. And that's what the SEO guys wanted. Like no, leave that alone. So we'll add the state city, whatever specifics.
00:04:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
they're filling in separate pages that are Yeah, sweetlers, Kansas City is the best because XYZ got it correct.
00:05:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So they'll do Kansas. I'm sorry Missouri, Kansas City and whatever the other one was and then so the same sort of thing For each state and then area so each state will have state page and then the featured cities We'll call it in each.
00:05:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We'll also have their own featured city page And then what are we doing? So I know Isaac read into like a complete wall on St.
00:05:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the last I heard he well he ran into a wall using Regis and then he was gonna go try to get a Different location that would put a name in the lobby That's the last I don't know how he was doing that, but he's seen like he had a plan Okay, so I'm not cuz we could and we could ask I can ask the these dudes like they you know Yeah, I have to ask that do you guys have a method for this? I'll ask Aronzo if they have a way to do it or if they know or is it they said they have kind of approved in that city. They're like we have people that are doing the same thing so I'll assess them. Where's their office?
00:06:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or is there a better way to do it like we first need to do a Yelp account and maybe sign up with the X for that and then did the GMB?
00:06:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well they said it was it's this photo. This is all that's all they want. They want a photo that you're listed in the lobby right? Like on that headboard thing that's in every lobby.
00:06:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's so cool. What it makes sense to them to go on like say task rob it and have someone literally just go and hold up a sign next to it.
00:06:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh I mean it needs to be in with everyone else's name.
00:06:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay I mean just like print out a sign and put it next to it.
00:06:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't know. I'm just trying to a plug about them to go by the letters at Staples and just go make their own listing just really just put it on the They're similar font and just stick it on there.
00:07:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, for the worst idea, it's not a lot of.
00:07:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'll ask them. I mean, that I swear they said it was specifically that city that they ran into it before.
00:07:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
got to have an issue or a self. Well, because we're going to keep stepping this out in Colorado, probably Idaho. Obviously, we got Washington going. The same though. Because we just signed a potentially monster case in St. Louis, and in one nation, we don't lose it by every church imaginable. Like hit by a commercial truck and bring me. So that's really, really good.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what kind of situation do you have in St. Louis? Is it like one of the virtual offices or an actual? Yeah.
00:07:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
OK, yeah, it's a religious. It's location because I don't miss a plan on putting someone there. Oh, probably imagine Google being Google knows which offices are good our virtual offices.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I mean, if you really don't want to be screwed over by them, I would not play that game.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The problem is trying to find another location because we're not going be as good about this and right it could be. Janky ghetto has to be a place that forwards mail. Because whatever is listed, people are going to send mail to him if we don't get things that can be a really big problem, like from a ethical ability standpoint. So we can't just go like round the corner store for a month, like put a sign up and then leave. Plus, you know, like this case, if it looks good, I'm going to fly out to the client and we'll have them quote unquote meet us in the office in the conference room. or go to their house, or trailer where they live. But if we're already running the decision in Missouri, I know it's like some time I've heard, it was, it was Arizona or somewhere else. Because it shouldn't just be reached, like our Phoenix office, we have two physical offices we pay for every single month that two people are in and are working in and clients meet them and they're, you know, once every two or three weeks.
00:09:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said it shouldn't be Regis?
00:09:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, it shouldn't just be because it's a Regis. doesn't work like we have.
00:09:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's not. It's that Regis won't put you on that board.
00:09:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So it just needs to be different Regis. Yeah. That's the problem.
00:09:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They will not, they don't have that option or whatever. So with that photo, it's all down to this, the monument or whatever the thing is called.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you tried like easy offices or anything else? Or could you use task? I have somebody go physically inspect these offices and tell you which ones and like go ask questions in person That's you which one Joel. I mean, I guess you could call and have somebody there do but which one's like one Efficient or effective that some brando on tus grab it. I mean my brain is just going through things and I was like Oh, you could just call so anyway, yeah But like there's easy offices It's like usually Google wants photos, right?
00:10:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You don't suppose I'm inside the building in your office.
00:10:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They want some video Yeah, totally But we can pay someone to go do a video and like send some business cars with some business cars on a desk We can do those things. Yeah There's no we did that with Aaron's own at one point because they were being a pain in the There are several different But I need to know what the main hold of this It's that one photo They want a photo of you listed as in office sweet and 20 or whatever, you know what I mean?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Like, yeah, that's in the lobby of most buildings, right?
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you got a Missouri anyway, so if you get one of those buildings and are actually there, and you have like, here's my travel receipts, I was there on this day, here's my picture, here's my office.
00:11:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sadly, you're not going to get that kind of level of a touch from GMV.
00:11:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're not. I mean, setting it with videos and photos when we try to set it up can help, but I, yeah, I don't really care about your travel receipts. Actually, they would try to hurt more than it would help.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh, yeah. Well, anyway, there's other office things, so can you have somebody call and say, which ones will get you sign it, is there something?
00:11:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, it sounds like, because it's, I've been pleased in like the front when you come off the elevator, where there's, you know, the 20 different businesses listed.
00:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I emailed the rounds, I'm Um, are there, like, uh, St. Louis adjacent towns that would make any sense? Like, do you does it?
00:12:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes.
00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:12:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's like Chester field. Like we don't have to be in downtown. one Chester would. There's a couple of smaller cities that are where, like, nice people live.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:12:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

00:12:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:12:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's not working for you, so.
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, so there.
00:12:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fair enough.
00:13:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But before we do, maybe we have the Google guys say, hey, this is thumbs up. Once we saw the address, yeah. And then I'll have them start looking for, well, no, we have a call, lot of one. So let's ask them how to do that one first as well.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, do you need a reminder to do that?
00:13:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I just emailed her.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. So that's instruction, hopefully. And then you might as well start looking, well, I guess you get the thumbs up, then you'll go look and find the place. Yeah. So Daniel, report back. Can you just see C on there so that I know that we're on the next phase and Mark needs to be looking for a place.

Businesses won't mind.
00:21:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's going to be a car-free LA Olympic.
00:21:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, it isn't.
00:21:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, because the businesses close, then the economy tanks and then people beg the government to rescue them. Right. We're just becoming communism.
00:21:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's fine. They're literally pitching car-free, like, what is it? Yes. everyone? Like, that's not going to the Olympics. Yes. yeah.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're doing what?
00:21:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
For LA Olympics, which I think is 2020.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is.
00:21:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. They're trying to make it a car-free Olympics, saying that LA will be a car-free zone, so you get to use the public transportation that they're bringing in or whatever.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no. You'll get Elon stuff. This is what I was telling my guy. when they launch it. I'm like, watch there be, you know, probably roll out in China first because that's where they do all the will control you step first. It's like, you know, the pandemic shut everything down and how much can you. But with all the autonomous cars, watch them make it so that, and they'll say it's for our own good. They'll find a way to make it safer for kids because that's when people are like, oh yeah. But you can't drive on government roads unless it's autonomous. Or you have a very specific kind of license, but either way, mass control of the roads.
00:22:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, a company hates Elon right now.
00:22:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're not going to say it won't be launched.
00:22:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they won't even let us face like launch, which is just like, how much more business do you want to send out of California?
00:22:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, the thing is, Elon created the tech. So if somebody else just goes and makes a different version of it, that's California friendly and still same thing.
00:22:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, Elon.
00:22:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no, their is so far ahead. No one's going to. catch them. But they're trying to use just copy it and marks going to have a bunch of lawsuits and they use someone's other anonymous thing.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, the way most at 4am hunting ones in the parking lot by the way, it goes back to diversification, business one on one, have more terms of income and some that have nothing to do with law.
00:23:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, if you don't buy Tesla people, if you're not buying it by it, they are going to be huge.
00:23:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because they're not just cars or anything.
00:23:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They are not a car company.
00:23:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, they're overvalued still.
00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're probably forced to split.
00:23:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Also, I don't think they're even properly valued. They're like 200 bucks 200 bucks a share or something.
00:23:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Like 80 X.
00:23:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That and Nvidia, Nvidia. Yeah, I want to get it. They are the only thing that can run all the AI. They're it. They are
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like Coca Cola, like there's still has 10x at least in the last four years. Also steel, yeah, like fast and all I bought fast and all four years ago. And it just keeps growing and I could find out that Dexter has been like researching how that company runs and they're cutting edge. But, but they're so, um, what do you call it? Not just natural resources, but specific kind anyway that are harder to get and keep up with the demand. that's what I went with there. It's doing very well. That's what do you call it? Fast and all and you can't remember what it is. Yeah. That one has done really well for me too. Anyway, okay. So Elon and cars and whatever.
00:25:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, also randomly the, um, it castle and key to celery? Uh, was bought by a construction attorney, uh, the nationals, the sellers left in disrepair and he decided that he would bring it back to life.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, actually buying businesses, not law firms, but other businesses might be a good idea right now because a lot of baby boomers or businesses, they're just going down and they can't keep up with it. But if you went in and bought it, like, it would depend on the business and how bad it was run and how many leads it has, but so many of them just barely got by and they did, but they have good branding, they have, they have loyal customers, but they don't, they don't do great marketing, they don't have great systems, you know, there's a lot of optimization to be optimization to be done in some of these older dying businesses that could be gold mines.
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:26:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, speaking, I'm diversifying this long time and other interests and the fact that you have been studying marketing and whatever.
00:26:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I like Fuggy daycares.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, oh my gosh, that's what my, we spent like an hour going through chat TBT sessions because she wants to be a vet and, but she's also wanted to be, have a dog bakery and anyway, she's obsessed with dogs dogs or her life.
00:26:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Lower on the dog bakery, uh, don't think the margin there's good, but basically you have an empty warehouse, like three teenagers and the dogs just run around all day playing with each other.
00:26:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh.
00:26:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know, uh, there's a two, there's a, this gay couple down here that went to high school with a buddy of mine and they, they have a place called camp run a mutt because of what it's like.
00:26:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh my gosh. That's adorable.
00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And dude, they've not like, I mean, they've been only been around handful of years and I think they're up to like six locations in just like greater San Diego, like just sort of like I could believe it sitting outside. Yeah. And some cameras. Yeah, you get the dog pools, you put up the cameras and then they kick dogs out, right? your dog doesn't, your dog houses a bike, they do your .
00:27:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm that we were talking about that. was talking about margin. So I'm like, if you have the dog bakery, but it was optimized for like dog health plus a doggy daycare. And then my other daughter that does like special effects make up she also does. She gives the dogs haircuts and she dies their hair. Mike, you could just have this whole business. Anyway, speaking of dogs, they're going nuts right now. Okay, so Dan, what's the situation with your Google accounts?
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
More deep, whatever their name
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's now, they're, they're, they're, they got back and see the number seven. Yeah. Uh, on Wednesday or Thursday, they're, are you still having this problem?
00:28:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm like, yes, I'm still having this problem. You idiots.
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm trying to give you money. So they, she, he, not even sure, uh, It's been escalated. Uh, the escalation has gotten me approximately zero, uh, outreach. But supposedly, it's escalated. It's clearly just broken. It's, there's something wrong on their end. Just don't deliver it. It's, and I've tried many more times to get it to work.
00:28:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, this is never going to work. Uh, well, good luck screwing up my other business too. I'm like, come on. Another 71.
00:28:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now I'm trying to launch this lead website that I built for the wedding plan.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or people.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't get suffering from the exact same problem and that's a brand new account I can't get in.
00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it doesn't, if you can't get those to work, what's your next plan?
00:29:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I would have to try to open a new account with a credit card I've never used before. From an IP, I've never used it. I could have to go all healthy stealth until they jump through their hoops and not get detected, even though I'm not really trying to get around anything, but that would be the only thing. I do think I do have a credit card that I've never used, so I have to confirm about those.
00:29:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You can't build any of my accounts, right?
00:29:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. No, I don't want to, I don't want to like risk like cross-pollinate because I don't know exactly what's wrong. So I'm like, it's like, I don't think I've been banned. don't do anything.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay.
00:30:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, I have a credit card and I took out credit cards in my parents name through the business. So I had different credit cards. I have a credit card. My dad's name. I can literally put whatever these things. They don't care. they do. I tried to do it with my kids and somehow they figured out they were under 18. That was like, oh crap.
00:30:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because we've done like MS, we've done wash.
00:30:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:30:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Amex? Yeah, they don't care.
00:30:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, they didn't care about my parents. They did care about the kids. Somehow they sniffed out that they were under 18. Mm hmm. Yeah, which I thought was weird and I was like, oh, I guess that makes sense. But now actually Abelens now under 18.
00:30:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
should get one in the table of name. There you go. build her credit and.
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All right, yeah, yeah, feel her identity it's for a good cause We're gonna use that word for to use your help builder credit.
00:31:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
00:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Um, okay, so I have Uh, I got to finish this I just didn't email to myself. I don't think I finished it. Um call control. Hold on Have some websites. I just have to review them And then let's set the reminder Wait for it to come through Don't You Do you know, Dan?
00:32:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do not.
00:32:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Come on, come through. There it is. Okay, reminder. Okay. All right, let's see. So I sent an email asking and I CC you also mark if maybe all of us could and you maybe you don't want to, but at the very least I'm going to get on a call with Josh so I can understand what he's already working on what he knows and what can be done, but where I think that at some point, having the all of us on the same page would be, you know, what data is right and wrong when it shows up. And I just think that we'll get where we're going faster being all on the same page, but maybe the. First conversation would be I want to see what he's done and so I can get my head wrapped around what's there and compare it to what we know we want in the reports already. So maybe that's one and then step two if we could just if we can get on a call all together validating the data and then just tying it up, wrapping it up and being done with what we're asking of him would be ideal to me. Okay, okay. All right, I just sent that email so we'll get that rolling and let's see then we can stop talking about it every week hopefully and just have it to use.
00:33:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, Dan, some of the people we met in Louisville who run marketing for MSculpt. Yeah, I like medspots stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're going on. Yeah, we're see your hand. I think it's my call go high level. They're like, yes, but we love it. It agrees with everything.
00:34:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, how do you know about this? Like been there, done that.
00:34:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So again, it's definitely the right thing to use, which is good. And knowing that it has a lot of great availability medical spaces. You feel a little better.
00:34:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So well, yeah, and then our, my, our internal developer guy, like we, I'm now at this point with him where I'm like, oh, you know, would be great. we should make it do XYZ.
00:34:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then this morning he was like, Hey, I was thinking about what you're saying. We could totally do that. was like, okay, go ahead and do that.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:34:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we're like building our own app. Like it's the app's inside, but you're really just going out to your server and doing this other stuff. So it's okay.
00:34:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm excited to keep building this out for three reasons. One, because it's just kind of fun. Um, two, obviously, Chona. That'd be great. Our business, but three, the more I thought about this, and I want to pick your brain in this part, that's where I'm transitioning to. What if we, yeah, I'm trying to think of how to make the doctors work with more and more sticky to what I do and what we do. Yeah. In terms of I own you for lack of better term, we're already paying them well, we're already in communication, you know, we're saying them to like, you know, the suite or whatever we're sending them lunch. We're doing nice things for them. Most of the doctors I'm dealing with are not the most savvy people in the entire world, in terms of like business, in terms of technology.
00:35:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean, some of them are, right? That's like obviously a very, very general statement.
00:35:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but if we're able to put more of these doctors on our high level, so we can, I want to say control the data, but. but keep them sticking to us, help them convert more of their patients, and then, you know, push us whenever possible. It could open up an entirely different segment of what we do.
00:36:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know if that's getting too close to like crossing the line. What do you mean a different segment? I'm not totally following.
00:36:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, so the keros and pain dogs that we work with, most of them are using like three or four different kind of EMRs, right, the electronic medical worker systems. Some of them have automated reminders, some of them don't, but none of them really have great lead nurturing, and almost none of them have good reporting. So a lot of them are just downloading the reports, doing everything manually, like getting it back, like how much they are to go about. For a lot of these guys, it's all about their AR, but they don't track how much they're getting by lawyer, how long it's been out, you know, different things that I know we can easily. input, assuming the information comes in.
00:37:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to get him to do that, and it's all so chaotic, like not chaotic, okay.
00:37:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Correct. Yeah. And there's so much easier ways to do this, because I know high level has a lot of great integration, whether it's with QuickBooks or just even just basic information coming in. Yeah. the more people that we can get switched over to what we do, they're never going to leave. Right. how from there can we get them on our system, and then subtly the nudge, you know, sweet lures, sweet lures, I don't know. That's the part where I'm kind of like, okay, I see from A to C, but I don't know where point B is. And that's what it's about with.
00:37:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, do you think that what would happen is that you'd get that this would get a doctor that's already working with lawyers that are not new? And so then it would be like, oh, hey, it's got this feature that reports back on the firms that you're working with. And then we would see that we'd be like, Oh, well, they're working with this firm and this firm and this term. Um, mean, I've done second.
00:38:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've no idea. going to call Michael. Hello. Okay, no problem.
00:38:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the very least, you're going to be able to see what doctors are working with firms and like the volume that they're getting in the app. then, I guess you just told call and be like, Oh, well, I already know I can beat what you're getting from the lawyers that you're already working with. Well, you know that. Right.
00:38:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Other averages and other things.
00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Slippery slip. Don't do it. I just think you like it feels really like a bad, bad, bad idea. could see. how you can do it. And I don't think you should. I think that you should just be glad for the business that that you have that expands and you get data and that data will teach you other things. But I think that it's just putting too much risk. So let's say you have a competitor who knows that you're doing that and they've got somebody who is high up who could just go twist it and make it look bad. just want to avoid the appearance of evil. Meaning it like that's the phrase, right? But avoid the appearance of doing something shady and trying to get business from those two. use it as a plan that it's an amazing business model because that market is underserved and you know how to serve it. And that that data will tell you how to continue to serve it better. And it may inspire you to know what you can do for building suite law. But Rather, look at it as a diverse way for your portfolio of businesses, but I would not try to figure out and almost even just say these people cannot do business with us because you are too open and too vulnerable to get them both shut down.
00:40:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So then we just do like the data. can get overall data, so we say, hey, here's what we're seeing across the entire market, but not having this individual.
00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, it would be primed to be an expert speaker, to be a consultant, like you didn't be caught. You weren't an attorney anymore. You sold sweet lock after having done this for years, a few years, stayed as a consultant so that you still get the own, like the ability to access the data on both sides, you know, but, but trying to mix the two, you get, you had just have the wrong person looking.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at you and you lose both of them how you would lose anything but yeah you could um because the more the bigger you are the worst enemies you have it doesn't matter if it's even legal or not you just but i mean i would what would they do to you oh you stole my dog they're like go back yourself no you know the issue is it's it's about it yeah oh they did differ because you you they can't for hit for lawyers you can't they can't pitch doctors anyway like there there's uh i mean you can but like there's what you can you can that's how that's how he gets doctors yeah i don't know anyway it just it just feels like a very very bad idea i mean i think you just let the data accumulate and then you make a decision like it could be nothing there.
00:42:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Got it.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're more in the world, Mark, powerful people who do really unethical things and just make it short people. So maybe you get what I'm saying more. It's not too.
00:42:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's not legal.
00:42:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not about what what makes sense. It's just that certain people got nothing better to do with their money than go do like that.
00:42:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Correct, but I'm also trying to think more and more of I don't want to say merging people. But the more you keep them within your ecosystem, there's two ways to look at it. more I have you by the balls, the more control I have over you. That's the worst way to look at it. That's not how I tend to operate. But still good to know. can just rip your balls off whenever I want. The better way to look at it is if I keep you within my ecosystem, then I've got a bigger and bigger ecosystem and growing, which more things coming into this ecosystem. but are okay. And everyone wins and everyone's happy.
00:43:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you probably find what you're probably find is doctors that don't have this aspect to their business at all.
00:43:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you could say, Hey, I'm going to get the most of the chiropractors that I work with, the pain docs are like, some messes have the time when it comes to business.
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a Tina version of this conversation that is a little bit different and about grounding, but also morality and being careful. there's a scripture that pops in my head from time to time. And that is that we have learned by said experience that is the nature and disposition of almost all men as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. The thing that you have to watch out is for temptation. So when you say, you know, I wouldn't do this, but just knowing I have the power, you put yourself in that position with the power, the temptation. and grows. So don't put yourself in that position and not even with that mindset because there's another one, the story of the two worlds, which one grows when you feed. Don't feed the power thing. Feed influence. Feed. So you having all of the data and being the sage, the wise sage that knows all of these things, that's more power. And it doesn't create enemies and it doesn't put a target on your back. Just be in there, know all the things, be the wise advisor, the one that people go to because with that flows money, flows more power and influence, but without setting yourself up in a situation to want to use it badly and just blacken your soul over time. That's all I'm saying.
00:44:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yay.
00:44:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Blackened.
00:44:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To hear the buildings.
00:45:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Get those black molds when they're just sitting there in the celery because of what's coming out of these bourbon barrels not doing even bad. The building's so turn black.
00:45:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Real happen.
00:45:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Anyway, my goal is not to try to screw over people. You guys know that about me. The goal is to try to figure out how we can build these things that everyone works better, more efficiently, less frustratingly and help me grow my business at the same time and multiple streams of income. Is always really good and has done a more than sure will attest as well. Tina.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Monthly recurring revenue is fast ever.
00:45:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and I don't have that as much with what I do.
00:45:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the more we start talking originally, you're like, I eventually just want to sell this business. think here's the thing. If you're going to like you, we have to go back to the value conversation. What is it that you want to do most of my. I was what brings you joy, but also what empowers it, right? What supplies it? You have to be able to fund all of the things that you want to do. But one of the aspects was being a consultant and the anyway, just keep thinking about not when you look at opportunity, you have to run us through some kind of filter and the filter has to be, how does this help or support my greatest values or how could it potentially hinder it? How could it distract me from what?
00:46:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
These are distractions, but the more that I build it up, not only do every cring, I do better understand from the doctor side as well.
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you just hope to pitch. are talking about that just trying to get everybody to come back to sweet loss specifically.
00:46:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm that one, but the more people, remember, it's top of mind on all this stuff, right?
00:46:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the reason I do all the webinars and everything else. It will probably I just naturally gravitate and create some magnetism so that but trying to engineer is what I think is not wise.
00:47:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Right, trying to force it.
00:47:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's all I'm saying. And it's not a decision to make now.
00:47:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We're not even there.
00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't get there but I'm just saying just check your intentions. Keep a check on yourself and go build the thing and do the thing that helps everybody grow their business and be better and be smarter and think about it that way and know that so gravity is affected by mass, right? Gravity, the whole. Anyway, the formula for gravity, I can't remember what it is but it has to do with mass. The bigger you grow, the bigger mass is, the bigger gravitational pull is. More will come to you naturally and consequently anyway.
00:47:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Make sense?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So just build it and get better at it. more that you understand the data, the more stretch and almost even surgical, you will see in terms of a path to what's the next thing, what's the most leverage thing. And so, but since you brought that particular angle up, we had that conversation, but I think it'll be a moot point once we get there anyway.
00:48:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So back to executing it. So Dan, did you have a conversation with Jonah?
00:48:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do you know what you need to start working on to build something for helping her? It's on vacation with somebody.
00:48:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I can grab her if you want.
00:48:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You tell me what time it works. No, I'm just going to email her.
00:48:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
As long as I can email her at that Yahoo, I'll just be asking her questions.
00:48:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I'll just ask her questions over email, but legit me.
00:48:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm like, just going to wait till they get back. No, that's that.
00:48:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have enough going out. Oh, okay.
00:48:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or you sitting in like a bunch of No.
00:48:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She has expensive tastes and she needs to be able to pay for a portion. So no. No rest for the wicked.
00:48:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? Oh, such.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hope she's watching sometimes. I mean, generally speaking, her life is great.
00:49:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She's fine. Generally speaking, she's fine.
00:49:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Generally speaking, I only drive her slightly crazy.
00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I gotta figure out, I could go like and search our messages and see if we, because I don't have something on my calendar for this week, but I've thought we talked about meeting. I mean, we're back Wednesday night, so we should be around. Yeah, okay, so hold on, let me go to where's the last time I had. I will meet this repeating. Okay, cool. thought I was on the calendar. Okay, so what's the next step then for getting down and showing it together?
00:49:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's about it.
00:49:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I have a email. Yeah, I know I I literally just stick my head in the other room and yell at her. just the way you do have an email address and I'm going to yell at her. I'll throw the empty pizza box at her.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine. Mark, be nice.
00:50:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
New York pizza is awesome. Yes, it is. residents. I don't want to go.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So any excuse.
00:50:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're such a punk. Yeah, what else is new?
00:50:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.

That's okay. We went to a super arrogant dude. Oh, my cousin last night. So you should buy a scratch. Andrew Philip Lee, was on like Top Chef, competing with her. But there was like two investors. was basically just pitching the entire time, ignoring everyone else. If it was like good, I would say seven out of 10, but yeah. So I don't know what I came up, but yes. This area and tables.
00:50:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's fine.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're okay.
00:50:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That saying that that's what made you think of it a little bit. All right, well, no whiskey for Tina. Sorry, bourbon, no bourbon, bourbon bourbon list, bourbon list. I haven't got chocolate, bourbon balls for and now, I had enough blockouts when I was 18 that I don't even if it wasn't for replays and I wouldn't be drinking things in halves. Fair enough.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, um, let's see.
00:51:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How's Patrick?
00:51:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so last week I was sick and we need to meet so I need to meet with them.
00:51:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Patrick's doing better so whatever you're doing with him is working.
00:51:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, can you quantify that for me?
00:51:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Will you now? Um, yeah, he's slowly there and he's responsible for everything, which is good because he's kind of complaining one of his staff was out on vacation, they got sick and the emails weren't getting properly folded. So now he understands like he's going to take responsibility when stuff happens in his team. But the competition wise, he's trying to beat everyone else, which is good. We're getting fewer and fewer complaints, so he's getting his systems down a little bit better with his flow. So I don't have like it's 23% better or anything like that, but I can see the difference. So that's positive.
00:52:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:52:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And he's going to take the Nevada bar in February.
00:52:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:52:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So yeah, then Hank will take the Georgia bar in February. So by summertime, God willing, we'll be able to open up those two states. One second. Doesn't about it just makes too much sense. My job will be a standpoint.
00:52:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he's taking about the Nevada bar.
00:53:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Also on February? No, you seen the Georgia mark.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Georgia.
00:53:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. The Atlanta is a large city that really it apparently works pretty well for there's already some doctors there.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:53:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, um, Sam's waiting into Illinois. So I've Missouri, Illinois, Georgia is kind of our Midwest East Coast ish stuff to start. And then everyone keeps talking about South Carolina, North Carolina is great for commercial trucking accidents. So I got to look into those. And then maybe we stop extending seats.
00:53:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a lot of states. There's a lot of evaluating that has to be done too. And again, with the goal of you don't want to be in the office a lot. And you really don't have a great leader there to be running the business for you. really, if you want to keep this business going and you want it to be leveraged and massage well you need somebody. who isn't going to go off and have babies, who really likes running, likes leading, likes teaching, likes knowing the numbers and get them in there, so that you can work on the marketing, the strategy, the schmoozing, all the other things that are really important to making it work well, but you're missing that piece inside of your business right now and there's going to come a breaking point sooner rather than later in the growth cycle, if you don't have that in there, Mary is not that person, you don't have anybody that I don't agree with you. So now whether or not that's something that I know we've had this conversation before, but Salko, I don't know how much he would want, he's not the right person, he is definitely not the right person, but that's like abilities, not the point, especially so that's one part, part two is I don't
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And he wants to do that.
00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:55:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I really don't think he has any desire to do that. He likes to work two to four hours a day on most days. And I can go to everyone with my kids.
00:55:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, that's good to know. Also, the thing to keep in mind is, so when we started this, Sweet Law was really the opposite of the building was your, I would say, emotional support business. And I don't think you need it like that, like you did before, because you're going out and socializing more and building a life. So the things that you might not have done, because you wanted everybody to be happy, might not be how you feel about it now. And I want you to just ponder on that and come back to me next week. Do not reply to me now about it. Think about it and think about what is true or not true about that.
00:56:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would love to find a far far better than anything I've got in my office. I'll call it a supervising attorney for the lack of a better term, because I need someone on the legal side, but it's a supervisory slash COO type role. And I hear what you're saying with the finances, what's going on with all of this.
00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the finances, but the leadership style and the absence of a firm and organizational presence. And how much you care about how your people like or don't like them, like that I really need you to contemplate that part of the conversation I just said, and what your emotional needs from your business were and are now. Because there's been a detachment that is good for business and good for you, but the way that you were operating was based on. a previous version that doesn't exist anymore and that should be considered.
00:57:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's probably two roles. That would be a good supervising attorney. He kind of is doing it right now. He'd be good at that. He would not be good at running the business and you're right. He would not want to do it. Then you need like so, the odds of you getting someone that is good at the supervising attorney and the other is so slim. That's more than more couple. But you'd have like a C.O.L. supervising attorney. It's very much integrator visionary. integrator here doesn't need to know how to run it as a business. They don't need to run it as a lawyer.
00:57:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, so you do need the supervising attorney from the past. that will help us because I don't know. So I was the right one.
00:58:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know.
00:58:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's very knowledgeable.
00:58:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's sort of the role he's serving right now.
00:58:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is, but he's still pre-lit and what he does is still a bit different and he's still very, very conservative on the side, which it's fine. It just is what it is. Mary's best role is continuing to train people and recruit people. She does good job with that and is great at dealing with the case managers and the assistants and everything else that I think can continue to be her role. That's fine as her role. But someone who's actually running the company, yeah, that's not her. No. I know that. know that we all kind of are aware of that at this time and it's okay for now, but as we continue to grow and extend, it's not going to be okay.
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:58:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So this is where the attorney going over all of the attorneys and also. So overlooking intake would take each gigantic load off of my shoulders.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how do you feel about Samantha doing that? Now hold on a second, hold on, just for a minute. Don't think about the impact of her not being able to run all the cases.
00:59:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nope, that's not where I'm even thinking about that side. She has zero apt to do it. She's shown a complete and total unwillingness to want to learn, to want to get better, any responsibility for anyone else. OK, she's just focused on her own racetrack and how she can squeeze every penny out of the law firm that she can, which is a right as an employee. But she has shown zero apt to do it. Because some that we talked about, these just I'm very, very disappointed to say it that way, because I thought she could really hit that.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:59:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's right.
00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really thought she could. That tracks with just the tiny experience that I had with her. but also other things that you've said. So it is, it's too bad, because she has a lot of fun. Yeah. Okay, so- I don't think a siler, although Taylor has a very good knowledge base is very good with people.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think he has the desire to do it necessarily. He wants to be in the office five days week. No, he doesn't basically probably do it now. Now, Bren's not really the right one. And everyone else kind of too new to this to really be, you know, it's not Patrick, he's just too new.
01:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, it's not his fault. just- Part doesn't love baby.
01:00:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's baby. Hank's still new to this. The law of course, obviously, too new in the Nick R. Lee Asian attorney doesn't make sense.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't do any pre-lit, so. So what if you're looking for a new attorney, because we're always looking, we've always got things Now, you set a new intention of you want it to be a managing attorney, a supervising attorney. That conversation changes like what can you afford it to be and do some forecasting we can do together as to like, if we could get somebody in there who could create a 5%, 10%, whatever improvement across the team, maybe not Samantha Rice, probably capped out, but I don't know. What would that do in returns for sweet law and then kind of put the salary or not the salary, but the salary plus an incentive program that only pays the money on the performance. And then, and then you've got a good offer for somebody who might be looking for a place to be respected, have the opportunity to work on their leadership that they haven't been able to, because they've just been working. in cases, that type of thing, like just get super clear on who you're looking for, who they are, like where are they at in their lives, where where they've been working, like it's an avatar kind of definition, right, of your ideal candidate. But the more specific you get on that, the more likely that you are to attract that particular person and have the offer and the package and the position ready for them to just be inserted to. The clarity increases the speed and likelihood of getting that.
01:02:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But this is unicorn level stuff people, unicorn level. Oh, crap.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not late for a meeting. That's not so cool.
01:02:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is really difficult because the hardest, I think the hardest thing is what we do is the volume. It's not just legal said, you can find plenty of people who've done personal injury out there.
01:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The volume's the difficult part.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the firms that tend to do our volume are higher or not firms that I think highly afraid. I've been to major issues. And realistically, we'd be pulling someone from one of those firms. Now, they may be ticked off with how that from works. And that's why they're looking to leap, right? Because they're tired of the doctor. It's not going to be a lawyer cash, not going to be a lawyer. How many people are you providing attorney role?
01:03:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, for that. That's it. But I don't think you need which role do you really need next? I guess would be if you had to prioritize a role, which one?
01:03:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think that'd be the biggest one because imagine if you could drive another 10% of just top line with what we're doing for a year.
01:03:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where does that come from They send is drive to winter.
01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I can tell you that because if I was meeting with these guys on a daily basis and even just had half an hour to check on them on them every day, especially if I actually had oversight. can see them. The things that we're talking about, there, there is so much room for improvement in their systems. So, if somebody can actually be there and spend more time with them and watch what they're doing and knows that inside out as well on top of that, the list is 100% there for the taking. They will get to resolution faster, will do better on, I don't know how much better they can do on on distributions and getting getting those attorney fees.
01:04:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. pretty good at, but I think they could do a better job working up the cases, essentially catching other issues, other injuries, they're missing, other percent of them.
01:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just scratching the surface of where we're doing, but and you're going to start getting a compounding effect of that. But if you have somebody in there who's doing that all the time and working with them closely and seeing how consistent. Don't mean they do that because sometimes, you know, we'll show up in the week and they've done it, but they've barely done it, you know, and I've got this one hour, whereas that's the kind of thing that gets managed every day. The speed is going to be so much faster. The results are going to be faster. You're definitely going to get more money out of the existing team you have. So, but on top of that, every new person coming in should be starting at a higher level, which makes them more valuable from the gate if you have somebody who's in this role and doing a good job at it.
01:05:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Now, so the second voice thing that we are having them do for each other, is experience. Yes, they should be able to get more and instruct. Hey, here's where this case went wrong.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what we can do better next time. Yes, yes, yes, they, they need that. Well, go ahead. Okay. Anyway, so they're from another firm. One of the attributes, though, is that you should be looking for is somebody who learns quickly and likes to learn and also is good at teaching. So one of the things they might be unhappy at the other firm is, and they might not even know it. I can't even tell you, Mark, because of the way that I ask questions. One of the things that happens as a natural consequence is just people going, oh, I never thought about it that way, right? So they know that they're unhappy, but they don't know all the reasons they're unhappy. what we're putting out energetically is that this person is unhappy because they know that they're called to do more things. Like they want to lead, they want to teach, they want to learn, and they're just stuck operating, but they want to fulfill all these other things. And so there's probably other things that are off and dragging them nuts, but when this is put in front of their like, oh, like, that's the think I didn't know I needed that that kind of conversation. I think that that can happen. Are you there?
01:07:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm here. I agree with you. No, I don't disagree with anything. Well, I don't I do think it's an area of need. It's obviously a it's a key expensive iron, but the right person will, you know, help not just the bottom line, but help all the processes realistically.
01:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So we go do some forecasting and look at what would happen if we got 5% improvement across the board, or maybe we make specific percentage of improvement targets for forecasting exercise with each of your different attorneys, attorneys, because they've all got different room and and plates for lifts, right? Samantha probably doesn't have a lot, but Patrick might have more Lorenz even more maybe based on the numbers and then go look at okay, what What would that generate and revenue if we were to get even half that or just super conservative numbers and then go higher and we know it's going to take a while to find this person and hire them. But yeah, the specificity of what we're looking for will help us find them faster.
01:08:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. And look, it's not going to be perfect person. You like the very first one is multi-stage practice and most of the state's rent is almost nil.
01:08:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not a lot of people to do it. So what I would love you to do is write out everything that you know that that person should be if we were going to make it perfect. And then on the on the left side, so do the non-negotiables, right? Absolutely, requirements and then the negotiable, but we would love to have. So you start with the overview, all the things, right? And then you put them into non-negotiable and negotiable. And then we go from there and we'll also do some the forecasting numbers. I got a goal, but I sent a calendar invite for you in China for Thursday at 6 p.m. that we can catch up and then and I think that's it. Unless you have any questions or anything else that you're going to my notes for later.
01:09:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dan's in the high level going for her since we're talking about it. Yeah, moving a little bit. I'll really start thinking more about yeah, the summarizing and turning what that looks like. We've been such an up on a good managing and take person. We've had another interview, it wasn't.
01:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll keep pushing.
01:09:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sorry. Yeah, look, having Patsy back in January will help, but yeah, overall, we're really a stronger person there. So it's just upgrading some new ski rules more than anything else as we keep growing and then definitely putting people in difference. any plans because I think I was a little overly generous while we were smaller. I need to pull back so we're getting bigger. So yeah.
01:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So write that out though, don't just think about it. It needs to be.
01:10:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I need to sit with I think both Michelle and Mary to look at what the numbers actually look like rather than me just trying to guess where things look like if we give them two or three percent set of five or seven percent what does that actually look like and go from there?
01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before you implement it you should bring it back here so we can just go we will brains on it just to double check and support you that way.
01:10:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah it may just be a higher base but much lower percentage although we'll see. I need to play around with those numbers and I'll bring a couple options and we'll look at it together and see what makes the most sense.
01:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes but written because that really helps us visualize and be on the same page. Okay cool. right then you've got to be nice to your wife.
01:10:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's like nothing right now.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She should be fine.
01:11:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Do you make her happy? She will make you look more.
01:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:11:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, you get what you get then. Well, I literally have a financial planner set for tomorrow.
01:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:11:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

01:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:11:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But he has learned how to be sweet and guess who is learning. How to be happy even while the FTC is trying to murder him. Yes.
01:12:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So listen to me mark Okay, mean it's gonna your dogs are going crazy. I know somebody's probably here, but I don't answer the door because imagine if they were in a doggy daycare Maybe so happy with a big hurry attached to it Like I haven't been here for six days and they're just like can you hug me for the next hour, please? No, good. I love them. I need a doggy daddy. I need a baby daddy and I don't even know how to find one for my dog I want puppies so bad Make a doodle dog Well, is golden poodle, but I want to mix either with an abishon because I miss my bishon maggies I'm gonna cry later.
