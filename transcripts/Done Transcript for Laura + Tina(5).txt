00:00:05 - Laura L
Hi, Tina.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, how are you?
00:00:08 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. of tired out from the gym, but it's good for me. okay. So I have made some decisions. Um, I do want to use my existing domain. Profit drivers, or profit drivers.
00:00:27 - Laura L
Yeah, profit drivers, right? Yeah.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember everything. Okay. Um, and then, okay. So last year, I decided that I really wanted to use Buddy Boss, but I was having a hard time with it. So there's two things to that. It is, well, first of all, are you familiar with Buddy Boss at all?
00:00:48 - Laura L
And I haven't heard of it. Is it a final, I mean, bench builder?
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Kind of. Have you heard of Buddy Press?
00:00:59 - Laura L
I can. didn't. I mean, I didn't hear about that.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the Buddy Press has been a WordPress thing for a long time, and it has, it kind of is Facebook-esque. Like it has a social platform to it. You can send friend requests. It's a forum, but it was created to be more social. I don't know how old you are, when I started, well, first of all, when I started, we had dial-up internet, but we used forums and chat rooms a lot, and then Facebook came along. So this before Facebook came, we had all these forums, which I'm sure you've seen forums, they're still used, but this kind of combines all of that. So anyway, they have a WordPress theme, and then they also have a native app. So I wanted to be able to offer a native app to people. Oh, yeah. Okay, so here's a thing. Hold on. me see. Magic link. I forgot that that's what we were looking on. Buddy box magic. I don't know if they have that Magic login. The magic login link. So I don't think it has that. Okay, so that kind of changes it. I was so sorry. I was thinking about a few different things and I remember that we were going to do high level because high level could do that. But then my friend was like, are you going to want to resell it? And if so, then you should Probably get your own accounts.
00:02:49 - Laura L
So Yeah, I think I did a test with a page speed score or mobile. They don't have that impressive score. But for desktop, it is good, but most people are into mobile nowadays.
00:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And then there was another thing that a friend of mine told me about called system.io. It's system with an E at the end of it. .io. Let me see if they have magically log into my and all caps. Let's see. Magic thing. I want the benefits of Web3 with highly scalable, battle-tested secure. no, that's not it. Set up your magic link with system.io. Okay. Um, well, I'm sorry, but this, this, I'm very happy to pay you
00:04:00 - Laura L
You just sit here while we figure things out.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll show my screen. So we're looking at it together.
00:04:06 - Laura L
I also have a like a spreadsheet of the other platforms that has magic link, like. Oh, you do. Yeah, the test that you delegated me last. Yes. I did a spreadsheet. And the one that has that magic link is teachable.
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not OK.
00:04:28 - Laura L
So expensive.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It isn't or it is.
00:04:32 - Laura L
It is not. The basic plan is $39 per month. Oh, nice. Yeah. And there's another one thing, Kiffik.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, yeah. And I have clients that love Kiffik. And did you have any thoughts about either one of them, any anything that you found? Like you think that this would be good, bad, above your feedback.
00:04:58 - Laura L
Yeah. For most people, like I search, I mean, one of the blogs, I mean, three blogs, actually, they prefer beachable or thinkific. Let me send you the link here to this spreadsheet, because I included the cons, the pros and the beach juice.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, Trello, huh? Yeah. Okay, I'm already here. Sorry. We'll definitely start to get more organized once we're out of summer and school starting, but wait, let's see. The recent maybe at OR and there go.
00:05:50 - Laura L
And then the card is in progress. Okay, that's not this one. Yeah, correct. Okay. And then you can see There are the below that. Yeah, the Google Drive link, that's it.
00:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you are so sorry about this. Okay, easy to use, strong course creation tools, good student engagement features, that's great. Highly customizable limited marking tools. I don't care about that so much, sign customization, track reduction fees, lower 5% transaction fees. Oh, yeah, that's the thing that I forgot about. Like, I don't want to let's see, free plan with transaction fees. Oh, and then if I pay the pro, there's zero transaction fees. Okay, that's probably where I'd end up being anyway. And then this no transaction fees on paid plans. Course in creation. Okay. and let's see, let's just take a look at them. Do they have like, let's see, anything you want to tier, membership tiers. I like the affiliate marketing a five admin seats, the example for website. And community, although I guess that's not. as big a thing, but I do care a little bit about community. Was there anything that stood out to you about having like a forum where members can interact with each other?
00:08:15 - Laura L
That's the one in Nance, I didn't check for the community.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I don't know that I emphasized that I was thinking about it, but I don't think that we really made that a thing.
00:08:31 - Laura L
And it's, it isn't the priority, but it is for the community thing. Is it also not like doing a Facebook, a private Facebook group?
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but I don't want Facebook to control my business because they can shut down very quickly. So remember live lessons, events, let's see, easy to use, of course quizzes and surveys. love that. at um community. I think if I can then teach people how to and so let's look at this. No person do not refer us community. So let's look at some examples, teachable community example. I can type. I really can. Let's see what this well that's not great. Oh rainbow cursor. What kind of dog do you have?
00:09:49 - Laura L
I just eat cute um mix of a poodle and I'm already afraid but it's a very small dog. We have two.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:10:02 - Laura L
Yeah. My kid likes to have dogs. So that's the reason why we got two, but me personally, I'm not the talk lover.
00:10:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we have two dogs. We have one that's a poodle mixed with a B-Shawn Frigé. What was that?
00:10:21 - Laura L
Very cute.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, she is very cute. But she loves a lot poodle, and then we have a havinise.
00:10:28 - Laura L
Is it hypoallergenic?
00:10:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's supposed to be, but he's not. He bothers my allergy and asthma. The most hypoallergenic dogs there are the B-Shawn Frigé, which they're white and they're fluffy and they look like stuffed animals. And then poodles, which are cousins of them. So they have the least amount of dander, smell, they just have, they just, anyway, I did so much research because I have asthma and allergies.
00:11:00 - Laura L
And it's me too.
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sign is clean. Oh, yes. And if I'm on a cat, I will literally get pneumonia and die. They're terrible. I've been in the hospital because of them. So let's see. Okay, I don't, what I want to see is an example. Why do people not just do like, Hey, this is what it looks like inside for the community. They realize that images do the selling for them. Apparently, I'm not. To teach them how to do the better job. Okay, let's see, um, teachable circle, like circle and teachable as an example. Now I don't want that. I just want a picture that looks like a community area. So I can see what it looks like. That might be one of those images. Go away, blah, blah, This looks like a Facebook group. It does. Yeah, it is Facebook group. Well, click bait, I'm just kidding. Um, come on, people, I have to make a decision here. And get the app store. I do want to kind of see this, but what are their integrations? Like what's the name? Xavier Mailton. Okay, spec. Okay. Let's see if we do this. Okay. Examples, five successful online community examples. That just looks like a straight up form, which is okay. We are there so that's a Facebook group.
00:13:37 - Laura L
was wondering if we could like customize the look.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's part of what I want to know. So let's see what they do online courses, membership community. Maybe very quick on the links you see here. My post review on the introduction general trial. Okay, let's escape the algorithm teaching conversation happens in a form that you control students will be distracted by the rest of the news feed conversations at the center boost value Okay, um once again all right um so it says it's easy to customize we're waiting so and of course it's coaching see
00:15:01 - Laura L
If they have like a free trial, maybe we could avail the free trial and can't steal any time.
00:15:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And that's really how I like to do it is I like to log in and see what it looks like and play around with it.
00:15:17 - Laura L
How much time do you have right now? Yeah, I'm still available. work with my other projects in the afternoon.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Do you have like at least 30 minutes?
00:15:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Great. why don't we just set up a couple of accounts, one with each of them right now. And let's see. No. What? Last pass. Pick a password for us. Wait. Seriously. Create that account. Yes, are you already teaching, are you already teaching, I'm not a platform. There is your current audience size. It's only how much money do you make charging for your knowledge? Well, that's none of your business. How much content or training materials have you already prepared a little bit? Oh, I hired a video editor today and hopefully I think she'll be pretty good. So I'm trying to get all the pieces in place. Wait, how much time can you spend on teachable courses? Choose your product online course coaching. Now, I want it all. we'll do this. I just want to explore teachable for now. Okay, let's do that. Because the priority is the course, but oh yeah, add that.
00:17:28 - Laura L
Okay.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's course in community. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I'll just call it that. online, it's started to create digital download, create a community. I'm not worried. I think the courses is going to be really straightforward. It's just going to be pages and containers. Yeah, let's look at the community first and then we can come back to the course. course. The community you want, whatever, you can't see it. Okay, without upgrading, not yet enabled. All right, to create it, I'm facing as well as use by our AI schools. Let me go to chat to the team and see where I have the search works. I'm going to get something here and plug in a little bit. I don't want to use AI to generate outline, I've already got that. That's cool. I might be sold already. Cause I love using AI and integrating, especially because I'm, I'm good at training it. And the, the biggest thing that it does for me is it basically gets rid of the blank screen. Like I don't want it to write for me. It can't write as good as I can. It can't teach as good as I can. But what it does for me, and I think that my favorite thing about AI is it starts, you get traction, you know, and you're like, Oh, I think, cause one of the things I teach in my business, and this is something that you can think about when, when you think about what you want to build, almost always, almost always Laura, when I ask people what they want, they're really non specific. And they have a really hard time saying, I very specifically want this business. And, but when I ask them, okay, what do you not want it to be? A lot of times it's the same kind of answer. But when I ask them things like, do you want to have to work 80 hours a week? Absolutely not. Do you want to work on the weekends? Not really. Do you want to work at night? Not really. Do you want to be available to the people that you work with 24 seven not really do you want to only make $2,000 a month? No, you know what I mean? Like so you start doing that and you go Oh, okay So I want to be able to work mostly Monday through Friday from X amount of time and I needed to give me at least you know $4,000 a month or something like that so you start with that and then so so when you find the where things cross over Meaning so if you're only going to work, let's say 20 to 30 hours a week and not more than that because Statistics show that if you work more than 20 hours a week productivity actually and creativity start to dip So if you want to have a most leveraged type of work life then you want to keep it under under 30 hours between 20 and 30 hours and If you need to make at least $4,000 a month And you can only work 20 to 30 hours a week. So now you have have some simple math, right? let's say 25 hours a week times four weeks, that's 100 hours a week. And now let's say you need to make $4,000, which is going to be $40 an hour, basically $4,500, $40 an hour. So you need your effective hourly rate to be $40 an hour. Well, or, so you can do that an hourly rate, right? If you were taking hourly type clients and work, or you could say you need $4,000 a month, and maybe you want to have a subscription. So how many people do you need at $40 a month, you need 100 people. And then you have to allow for a term. So let's say a 20% term. So you want to aim for about 55, 60 people at $40 a month. And then you have your $4,000. And you won't be working more than you want to, as long as you're doing a good job with things. So. Anyway, that's what clarity does and the thing that I like about AI is that AI doesn't feel anything. It can't be offended, but it will get things started and you can ask questions or get it to ask you questions. But yeah, anyway, so that's the thing. All right, let's go. I'm just, I'm pretty much just sold on this, but let's just go check out Teachable. So that was think epic, right? No, that's as well. Teachable. Okay, so think epic. Make the leap. Let's see, get started for free. Let's see what you have. I'm not really like, like you can just really top that.
00:23:52 - Laura L
The one you're impressed with the Teachable is the AI thing that generates, or I mean, the outline of the course.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's pretty cool. It was, but so there's multiple things that that tells me because they've already integrated it and they've integrated it and the outline was so good and it was so clean. What I know is they know people and they know training and they know the technology. So like as a business owner, one of the things that I look at when I'm choosing a software platform is how long it's been around and what do they know? How good are they at understanding their own business so that I know that they're going to be around. Like a lot of people are price shopping, they're looking for pretty things, they're looking for integrations and I'm looking for can you keep growing with me so that I don't have to start over and are you going to support my customers in the way that I want them to be supported.
00:24:58 - Laura L
Yeah. Okay. best part is still. I mean, free plan and they already show what they feel.
00:25:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. Exactly. that's that's pretty powerful. So this is very interesting because they obviously have AI too. Let's see what let's see what they do. impressed me. I dare you. Come on. Locking down key learning objectives.
00:25:30 - Laura L
Oh, there's also a little new page.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. import, setting, strip, after purchase. Hold on a minute now. Let's go look at this. your course, create a pricing plan. Sales page. Let's see what you have for a sales page. Wow. Holy heck.
00:25:56 - Laura L
Yeah, very it's me. easier.
00:26:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Wow. Okay, I'm so impressed with both of these. Okay, so already has a sales page. Um, this is pretty awesome. So I like how it does this publish, build a landing page. Let's see what this looks like.
00:26:29 - Laura L
Okay.
00:26:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, that's, that's simple for building it. That's, that's going to be you. We can look at it more if you want to. What I want to see is, um, because what Teachable did it already had a sales page and you can edit like there's, so we would just basically, and it's kind of parallax away. Oh, yeah.
00:26:57 - Laura L
So, yeah, change the.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You would change the change of stuff, but it's already got a very familiar professional type feel that people are people seen before.
00:27:14 - Laura L
Yeah, like layout. It's already blocked.
00:27:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so why do I keep going and build a landing page. Just look at that again. And then of course new course. Yeah, so just the fact that it gives you starter. Yeah, so it's like you are overwhelmed. Yeah, so it gives you example. Hey, here's what this image could look like. Tweet the colors, you know, this type of stuff and it gives you, yeah, I'm okay. Okay. Add new blocks. Let's see what kind of blocks they have. text by the video email each form image with text down our text image with grid pricing. Let's see the pricing. Oh, set a price. We can do that. Let's just come up with free. We'll just call it free. Free. Every plan. And then out of pricing plan. One time purchase was 497. I have no idea. Okay. That. And then we're going to add one more. I'm going to call this subscription. I'm going call this 97. something like that every month. Whatever. We really are going to fix everything and just want to see what this looks like. So.
00:28:53 - Laura L
Okay. Maybe.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might, but I want it. want to see if it does or not. So. let's see content. Oh, we'll go back to that. And then pricing, pressing plans. Okay. So did it create the block? She's a pricing option three. Oh, okay. One, three, and where are you seven? Let's keep you. Okay. Now what? More. Okay. there's content here. I don't really like the pricing block.
00:29:32 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe it needs to be like adding an element like rose.
00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know, I like the pricing blocks where there's where they're side by side, and there's three of them. There's one in the middle and that is strategically and psychologically, people tend to pick the thing that's in the middle.
00:29:52 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe we could fix that like other.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It would allow us to customize. Yeah, so let's do this. Was that think of a carteachable of teachable, right? Yeah, so Custom pricing blocks. We'll see if there's different pressure products use custom sales page blocks on teachable I mean because you could probably add some HTML code, okay Yeah, sets blocks Oh, they have code for you to just copy and paste there How do I add custom HTML to a teachable sales page and then HTML, okay, so um You I think you said that one of the things was here peer, limited design customization, oh fees, yeah, period, basic plan. But I don't have to use their sales page. The only time I really care about formatting is for a sales page or like an opt-in page. So that's not a big deal really. That's not a big deal. Because we could use WordPress for that and aligning page beyond WordPress. Yeah, okay. Sales pages. Check up page. I wonder if they have different builds from template, generate from AI. I just should imagine though the blocks they have or the blocks they have.
00:32:13 - Laura L
How about their default pricing?
00:32:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There wasn't anything. That's why it said you have to add prices and then this is all it had. This is it designs you can change this type of stuff so what I don't see though is HTML so can you let's see what happens if you copy some of that it. Is this the one that had some custom code?
00:33:07 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And see if it just, I mean, I would not think it would take code here, but nope. Yeah, so but again, anyway, I actually don't care about that. I don't care about that. Um, so the thing, um, like for delivering the content, it just needs to be easy access properly, like a magic link. So, and you said teachable how the magic link. Yep. Design templates, serve the certificates. Oh my gosh, we can talk. So just a bit of coupons. I like coupons. Upsell funnel. I don't necessarily care about that because I might just do something like even like WooCommerce something or funnel kit. for selling. I'm just known ships. Okay, so think Epic then. Products, channels, marketing. It's not really care about trip yet. So users analytics, analytics. I do care about analytics and engagement. That's important to me. Oh, I wonder if reports, lesson completion. Okay, so I get quiz scores, leaderboards, and lesson completion. That's that's some kind of stats. Okay, see average course completion rates. That's something. And I probably couldn't put Google Analytics on there. I wonder if they'll let you go. Let's do this. Can we put G, A, or on... That was teachable. I mean, keep forgetting. Can I Google Analytics for to teachable Zapier and I'm in planner. But I wonder if you can do it in the courses, not just the landing page. On your teachable school, set up a thank you page for each course. So it's a fine variables in the Google time manager. Okay, that's what I want. Because I do want to be able to track interaction. I don't want to sell something to people and then they're are not using it. That kind of is the way it goes. People always spend money on stuff and a lot of fun. They just don't do it. And, you know, they sign up for gyms and they don't go to the gym, you know? But I would like to be able to see what works well, what content is most engaging. And um, okay. So I'm really feeling teachable. What would you like us to look at anything else?
00:36:34 - Laura L
Um, let me check. There's one. Let me go back to this sheet.
00:36:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:36:47 - Laura L
There's one that, um, all the memberful memberful. Yeah, that's number one. But it's limited design customization.
00:37:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And overview, well, I already like that because it makes me feel like they've got AI. I've already used that, let's see. Apple Pay and Google Pay, coupons discounts, VMP, group plans, one-time payments. Monthly annual weekly, I like that. Two, that's pretty awesome. Cancellation surveys, referral program, growth metrics, I'm reporting. Wow, well, try for free. I guess, why aren't you triggering a copy, paste? Did I have one before already? duplicated it right now in your site, profit to others before.com. Well, let's see, revenue, things, things, content, podcast downloads, community, I do not want to do this card, members, subscriptions, activities, websites, websites. Yeah, this is, it's not really poor or online course, right?
00:38:42 - Laura L
It's what? It's not really for online courses.
00:38:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't think look like it. Welcome, I was just checking in for another credit gift.
00:38:55 - Laura L
Oh, okay.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's great. I mean, it sounded like it was a number thing.
00:39:05 - Laura L
Yeah, it's like a membership site.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Intense podcast downloads. Create a new download. Community. Okay. Okay. Huh. I mean, it's interesting, but it's not what I'm looking for. I just want to say connect to my words. It looks like it's mostly just like a paid community.
00:40:00 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe easy course then you can disregard that. thought it was like for online courses.
00:40:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You definitely don't want Kajabi.
00:40:19 - Laura L
I think it's easy course. It's like a competitor for the job. See features.
00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is the one sales funnels affiliate program online courses website builder. But it doesn't say community. Um, working emails, build websites, magic lights, create online courses. One more. Uh, we'll see that's what it doesn't look like it's got community. So So it doesn't even let you actually see it without, let's see, it does. Hey, my name is Bill from FunnelScene.com. And that's pretty much it. It's actually how you can go. So let's go here and create a new community community. Okay, I am. We'll look at that one more time. Pricing. Oh, communities. There it is. Unlimited. Start for free. Contact. Sales funnel. Courses. One quick upsells order bumps. Deadline funnels. There's a lot of different pay integrations. The program custom domains. Say anything about AI stuff. All right. My busy. See? Let's see this does, or use AI tools.
00:43:34 - Laura L
Oh, you can integrate it by the exact year?
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is good. always appreciate that. Well, let's see. What is that? Oh, it's there. See. There's this free and then, and then, yeah, so I guess sort of a very, we did, I already create one, I don't know, okay for that password, I'm Wrong one. No, I need this. I see the password. No, not that. No, no. I'm Let's just look at Let's just look this. Products. Add a new course. I'm thinking. I'm It's not going to have AI, which, well, sorry. Okay, let's see.
00:46:30 - Laura L
I need to build it.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this is, this is, I mean, it's just not anything compared to the others. So let me just go cancel that subscription really quick. Make sure I'm not charged flex. don't want it. And. That is my subscriptions. So. Are you sure you're on that? I'm going to subscribe. Okay. All right. so that was all that I wanted to look at. These two I was really familiar with. I've heard of that. I don't want Kajabi way too limited. Um, some of the other ones were like, but I don't know if they had magic links. And so I don't want to really go into that, but it was, um, Sergio. I don't know if they have it. No magic link. They do have magic link. And Sergio, let's see. The force. Let's see, was actually looking at this coaching creators, as long as to was surprising. I'm pretty happy with Teachable, actually. Yeah, so wait, that was, I can't like, but it's a whole other thing, but I do like the analytics. don't it. I like that. Oh. But what was the, they had communities, right, or we couldn't, we couldn't see it, products, home products, communities, spaces, organize, engage with threads interacting. Oh, I like that.
00:49:41 - Laura L
That looks very, that's like Facebook. Yeah. There's trade forward.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How much a welcome post of your profile. Wow. Okay. Making it hard. Okay, so they also had the AI set up, but, okay, I've got to close some browser windows so I can just stay where they say they have multiple browsers. I always, and let me show you this because, well, again, so this is actually my tab manager. All of these are different tab settings and each one of them probably have like 50 tabs opening. Like, this is my Etsy store one. What's all the tabs changed?
00:50:37 - Laura L
Yeah, oh my goodness. Yes, eating all the, I mean, eating big memories in the computer.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but the cool thing is about this is that when I, when it would be better, which I'm never better. I could just have spaces so I don't keep everything open, but I just forget to switch between spaces. I do use it for for my clients like so I keep theirs. Nope, I don't keep theirs clean either. It helps because it's better like 50 tabs than 250 tabs which I've done. And that doesn't work out very well. Okay, so let me okay create your curriculum. I really love this. Let's look at there. It wouldn't let me see community, right? That was the thing.
00:51:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:51:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so let me just analytics this will all pay plans in case and I'm limited. Let's do this. And then if I have to get a refund, I'll get a refund. All right, I'm going to stop sharing for . You're back. Well, I'm here. I mean, I'm here, but you know, Well, we're going go away. Okay. No. A card. It's going to take a second because I want to see it because if this has a community that's similar than I for sure want teachable but Because it is better creating AI and I really like that, which will help me a lot. But I also have you to help out. So, um, for in terms of like actually setting up the pages, which is the one thing, because this already had the fill in the blanks, basically. Yeah, yes, I'm to. Yeah. But you have skill and you don't. Need that we could we could find something that we like to model after anyway. Wait, I should use to keep on. think I have one, but that's okay. And come back to sharing screen. Continue to the building. Why are we on building? I want to go to Okay, so immunities. Which one are you this? Create your community. Okay, don't worry, you can always show us later. Here, create. There we go. Alrighty then. Well, that's a little underwhelming. Okay, so let's go back to this then.
00:54:22 - Laura L
I mean, this is really awesome.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, back to my dashboard. All my products, my dashboard. That's nice. So that's what the users will see when they log in their community and their courses. I like that. Okay, so go back to the site builder. And I like that it's got a mobile builder too. So you can see what that looks like. Oh wait, it already has, oh let's go to this, oh it does have content, it's just not, it's just not as graphic intense and it has, it's just not as pretty I guess, so headings down this is also has CSS, did you see that? No I didn't, maybe if we add block, yes think checkup pages, button collection, I don't really have, let's just button back, theme settings, styles, not a lot, which I think, oh okay, let's try this.
00:56:00 - Laura L
Okay.
00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's something that was in Manhattan. That's Parker. Okay. but. If this is not the sales page, if this is just the course welcome page, that's okay. You know, it really don't care about it. Being too much. Welcome. Build a landing page. That's where we were at.
00:56:36 - Laura L
Right. Yeah. What happened if we click add section.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here. Additional products, all categories of pricing options. Maybe they have better pricing options too. Pricing options. That. putting button background on layout. Okay, there's column two columns.
00:57:04 - Laura L
like that.
00:57:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Still not a lot of control for that. But again, I don't have to use this as the sales page. I don't think, I don't know. So, let me look at this. Can you separate sales page? You can listen to link directly to check out. Yeah, that would make sense. Yeah. Redirect, I think, get the page to your external sales page. Okay, I think it's at least sort of starting on. So let's go back to Teachable and see if it's got the community ready for us. What? Or else? Lame. Let me check the Gmail. Teachable. Welcome to the number four. Nope. Well, I wonder. It said it can take a few minutes. Okay, so let's give it a little more time. So of course it's coaching, right? Managing coaching experiences. would like to see this. We're, let's see, we'll do a hybrid. No intake form. And then go to check out and be enrolled, so now approval, one-time purchase, get a plan subscription, like this, this, two-point-seven, continue, fine. I'm definitely going to to change everything if we use this on the enrollment date. Customize your first milestone is often used to open the client and prepare them for coaching session. Add scheduling, p6, I really don't want to use their sales features. That's not what I'm looking for most. It's the community, the magic link login is super important, the most important really of all things, the magic link and that the content is easy to deliver and that it's mobile friendly. site pages, comments, text, go back, go here. Oh, yay. Okay. you community. Oh, how. Okay. All. All. All. All. All. All. I wonder if I could log in with my um, teachable. Tina Marie's school, so the welcome email is or like the email that they send is a nice. Looks like this, basically. Hear your school. You know. Oh, my heck. Okay. Okay. Okay, so, I'll products my products preview us public preview us student I like my membership. Yeah, I definitely like the think ethic um community better.
01:02:23 - Laura L
Yeah, it's very straightforward forward it is here too.
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I um discard it. So, just come on some more time. Just, I mean, they'll be there. It looks so months like Facebook.
01:02:49 - Laura L
Yeah. Great thinking that is it basically out.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, and that's what buddy boss does also or yeah buddy boss, but it's so much more are expensive, and it doesn't have the AI stuff powered on. So I'll go ahead and then cancel this. Settings. Oh, that's not what I want.
01:03:16 - Laura L
Maybe.
01:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really nice.
01:03:19 - Laura L
What's that? Under billing, if you wanted to cancel.
01:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:03:23 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Manage really in the card. And it's plan, cancel plan. No. Well, please choose option. Why did I not want this? Oh, the community was better. I don't I think. Take. Oh, going to do my out. It's better. That was the selling factor. Yeah, sure, because if you'll change it, then that's good. Okay, so. I'm going to stop share for a second. I'm going go to the last pass. And about. Open my boat. And I'll share. Let's see. Think of it. Or teachable think of it. Okay. Oh, wait. So one second. This is, I don't know if they're going to do to back draw authentication. That's teachable. this is. Can I? I don't remember. If I can create an admin account for you, like a team kind of thing. So, account, account management, billing, subscription plans, I'm not a free plan. I'm totally upgrading right now. One administrator, two administrators, one community, service and transaction. Let me pick which one I want here. represent lessons, certificates, memberships and bundles. We'll start with this. One of them, so that's going to be $100 a month, and we need to upgrade to it right now in the community. One them Okay, I will go to this, I'm not moving into that yet. So, it was share. Oh, there you are. Sure. Okay. So that task is complete. Yay.
01:07:09 - Laura L
Oh, sure.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll share again. Okay. now I have to make a decision, though, about sales pages, and what I would like to do for quick. Like, WordPress, like fast loading WordPress sales page builder. think it would probably be like. Oh, Divi. D.I. V.I. Divi. Are you good with that?
01:08:01 - Laura L
Because I am not. I tried, but it's for a blog posting though.
01:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the four sales. Yeah, no, I, I'm really interested in something that's for sales. I'm high converting landing pages. So. Let's see. And I think I already have a mentor and I pay for it. Let's sign them. Let's share. Log in. Let me search maybe not real quick. I'm almost positive. Elementor. Let's see. There's my. I wonder if I did it with. All And you want to count that wall and see. Okay. See how it not takes. There. So. So. So. So. Well. So. Tables. Well. I click too fast. So yeah, this was what I was thinking about. This type of thing. So we can do this with elements. All right. And back to log in, see if I got my, nope, it's not reset my thing. So see if we can get loops. And on my hack, I just closed it. One accident. No. Okay, open everything back up for me. I think it was, I don't remember which one it was, I think it was in this time. Oh, did it stop sharing when I closed it? Yeah. Oh, sorry. Because I accidentally closed the window and what happened.
01:11:00 - Laura L
Yeah, can see now.
01:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, No, that's not right. No, that's not right. Yeah. still didn't send it. Got password. Okay. Okay, under what will happen if I try to log in with Google. I don't think that that's how I did it. We'll see if it's a new account. So I feel like I might have some licenses. I'm not Are you going to junk? Up here. Elementor, we say your password. Okay. All right. should have decided that I should have done. Okay. I'm going to do it from different browser, so let's see, this is one, maybe it'll Now we should be done, we'll be done, let's see, generator, password, Did you copy, did let's see password Okay, so back here, I'm on my tour, refresh, so don't want to do it now, now. I won't see maybe if I refresh here. Listen here, I want to come in. I am on a call to sooner. Huh? No, I can make it, hold on. You Okay, my daughter is going to bed and saying good night. Joke mail, here's your verification. You say your password. But recent verification. You say Hopefully, that will come, but it should be able to send us services, brand and business Hopefully, I'm sharing the right thing with you. Share Elementor with you. And what I would like is. To see some options for landing pages. The new Basically sales pages. So the things that I want like I like this, what I've got nice blog. box where there's feature blocks and there's some parallax, you know, where you scroll down and there's different colors. I like the pricing blocks that look like the one that I showed you where there's three side by side.
01:17:17 - Laura L
Do you remember that?
01:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, shoot. Okay. So my brain goes all over the place. really what I want to say is like, okay, Tina, I need you to buy this or get this or whatever so that we can build a good sales page. And then we have kind of a I don't have all the content put together yet, but my brain will work best if I can kind of have like I was talking about before kind of a home and a house for it and then and then I can fill in the blanks easier so um yeah is there a particular page or sales page that you want me to model or how it's not what I was trying to think about so let's see um let's see um let's don't know you don't want that, skill chain, I don't want that show for a while because there's going to be a love next step um Let's see. see. I like this. A lot.
01:19:41 - Laura L
50 page.
01:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah but so what I like about it is the movement. And that it's very eye-catching. want to let me go see what it looks like on the novel real quick. It looks fantastic on mobile and all of those things pop too so that all the movement catches eyes and it just keeps people interested and the color is really good too. So, let's see, Kajabi storefront, that's Kajabi, that's shocking to me, it's interesting.
01:20:47 - Laura L
Yeah, in Kajabi page builder, there's kind of animation.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I do not want to build on Kajabi. just don't. So let's see. They also watch her. Oh yeah.
01:21:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See all the movement.
01:21:44 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:21:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when you log into her course, there's this like confetti explosion too. I'm just trying to think of some other names that we do. All the movement. All of them have movement. Oops. That'll work. DIVI theme. Kinta blocks. So this is built on Let me think of a few more. One of the key to using this. Okay, let's get social. Social media. Social media. Okay. And that's okay. It's not great. That works. There's a space book. Well, so James is actually really. I like that. And I feel like. I've seen these types of animations. think elements are can do stuff like this. Yes. I might even already have it in. See what's Thank you. I don't have it on this one, maybe it was Tina Marie dot com. I know I have it, okay, so did I share this?
01:25:52 - Laura L
With you, I don't know if you have this access. Oh, I not yet, only the profit driver.
01:25:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Share with you. because then you can play with an element or a little bit and see if we can get something similar to jameswedmoretraining.com.
01:26:11 - Laura L
You want me to copy and paste that to.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, check for chat. Yep. Chat. And we'll just over here. Chat window element or emphasize performance with our optimal speed boosting features. Yeah, we like that. Create a page. Magical pose. I don't want to post on page. They have so many things animated headline. Oh, yeah, I like that one. And there were different, so highlighted, rotating, like that, see, where do I go back? Settings, Style, Advanced, Paint Builder, User Preferences, and so let's do this. Hi, this page, I don't, that's not what I want, I want the the heading call to action. Not moved, I like that. So, section dot, so elementary templates might be a thing. Basically, if you could do some research and figure out how we could use elementary to have moving things so that moved. left to right. That was what was this one? What did they do? Like it got bigger and small to big or just appeared. That's not a lot. That did the same thing. That moved left to right. The first one that went right to left. So they're just tiny animations. That's really it. And then it's got these nice testimonial blocks and has a gradient background. Which we don't necessarily need to copy and definitely don't want to copy the colors but I do like the gradient background. Here's the thing that's tricky about him is he's using feminine colors to attract mostly females and because he does really good with them. He's really nice. You thank you. Super nice guy. I went one my friends introduced me to him and we were supposed to take a picture of us and instead he took a selfie. So I've got pictures of him on my phone, um, working me. What does that look like? No, my programs. Yeah, so there's, oh, that's nice. But that is really powerful and keeping people's attention and getting them to look at it for a while and not get bored and with people in business they tend to have ADHD. so movement actually draws their attention rather than distracts them and keeps them engaged longer. So your assignment then would be to just get familiar with Thinkific and, um, Elementor and see how we could build a landing page like this. Also, So these are colors that I have been using and we can start with this. can, I can actually add you to my Canva team or I can just share specific things with you. However, it might be useful to you because then you can grab a logo. You can look at the fonts. You can get colors. I am so tired right now. can even think anymore. Teams, I think I have room for one more. Where do I add? I don't remember invite people. too much for people to identify and more people. I don't think I need everybody that I've got in there, so I don't know how to manage them. I'm too tired. I'll have to do that later. This was a lot. Thank you so much for just being here. So tasks for Trello just see what you can do to duplicate the not duplicate but kind of pattern after this layout of just so I don't know what that is open image in new tab. Let me take a look at that. Okay, and so that fades out is what that does. So that's the image and then this is just plain background. the text. Being able to have movement like that, if you could find out way to do that, that would be amazing. And obviously, we don't have like that exact image or anything like it, but figure out what to use it.
01:33:18 - Laura L
How to duplicate the movement?
01:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, is it a divider that's a GIF or how do they do that? And yeah, I'd be very interested to know. But if we can't do something like that, that's okay. But we do want to create movement in every section. So if you want to like note that movement in every section of a sales page or a landing page. So if it's an opt-in page or that or sales page, then we want to create movement in every Reception and even this though there's no movements. There is kind of because the edge pulls the eye from left to right because of the gradients. So the colors. They don't physically move with the eyes move if that makes sense.
01:34:16 - Laura L
Yep.
01:34:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then whatever you can explore in in think epic and I would love it just if you have some questions if we have a little more Interaction this week because there isn't a super specific task other than exploration. So if you have questions or, you know, like help with that. Okay. What's next kind of thing. Here's what I think That will help me a ton because but right now I'm fried.
01:34:46 - Laura L
can't think anymore. Yeah, just play around with think epic and elementary then you know, Perfect.
01:34:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Thank you so much, Laura.
01:35:00 - Laura L
was
01:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
forward to talking to you again and I'm going to go get ready for bed.
01:35:03 - Laura L
Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Tina.
