Tina Marie: Mark.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
mark sweet: Okay, let's see if this audio setting actually keeps working.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Tina Marie: How are you doing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Tina Marie: No, no.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Dan Ryan: That's a what though.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
mark sweet: No.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Tina Marie: No, I just other updates.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
mark sweet: Oh, uh! I tried to edit the one or 3 content. But I don't have editor access so small problem. Um cause. There's 1 or 2 things that I've.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
mark sweet: About 6 things. I have to actually change. Um. Ethically.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Dan Ryan: Well, you don't need to change them as far as like.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Dan Ryan: Hey? It's not ethical, or whatever it's more about. Oh, yeah, that looks good. Stick it in the design.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
mark sweet: Okay, cause like cash advance on your case. We we can't say.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, but that. So that you just need you can just tell me, like, Hey, use these 6. There.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
mark sweet: Got it. Okay, cool.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Dan Ryan: But I'll I'll give you. I'll get edit access, too. It's more like.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Dan Ryan: That we'll get that in the design and then be like, oh, you know what change like. I already changed stuff to be 2 lines based on what I saw. I was like, hmm! That's not gonna work. Um. But yeah, I'll go. Yeah.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
mark sweet: Who.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Dan Ryan: Edit, access.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tina Marie: Seems like things slowed way down. Last week.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it ha! Seems like it happens every month, but there's always like one week that slows down.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
mark sweet: Um. We did sign a bunch like this morning. So we're at 69 incidences.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Tina Marie: That's good.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
mark sweet: So we should hopefully be at. Least 72 by the end of today, and.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
mark sweet: Should be on pace for 90 something.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Tina Marie: Nice. That's.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
mark sweet: But I'd like to see us cross a hundred.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tina Marie: I'm just going over the. Where they came from, 5 employee referrals, nice and returning.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Help. Pick up her low doctor. Referral.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Tina Marie: Say that again.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
mark sweet: Help pick up her low, doctor and low monkeys. Monkeys are low again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
mark sweet: Axes pretty much cropped the bed, so we'll probably be done with them pretty soon.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
mark sweet: And final unsurprisingly, has been garbage.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Tina Marie: Find. Law. Oh, find. Law. Yeah.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah, but.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Tina Marie: Me!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
mark sweet: With them for a year, so we'll see how that goes. But. Yeah.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Let's see, find law. Update. Today is the 24.th

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Tina Marie: Um. What's that gonna cost you being with them for a year?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
mark sweet: Quarter 1 million dollars.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:35.000
mark sweet: Yep, but if they can't produce much of anything, then I'm sure there's a way to get out of it. But they're we're in month one like. I'll give them a little bit more time at least. Give them 3 months.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay and axesaccident.com right.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
mark sweet: jackson.com. Yeah, and that one I can just turn off. Whatever. Um, but we're having.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
mark sweet: Meetings with them every like 2 weeks.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Bees.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Tina Marie: Is there a way to highlight it? No. Vaulted. I guess that's cool.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Tina Marie: Valiant? 5. What was he last week? 2.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Tina Marie: And last month 7 for the month. Um, Dan, speaking of valiance, how's your stuff going.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Dan Ryan: Mhm. So it's getting impressions. It's gotten like no clicks.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Dan Ryan: 10 clicks. But obviously it's not spending any money. So I'm going to roll out.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Dan Ryan: It's. I'm gonna roll out a bot like.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I'm constantly buying data from this other source. So I was looking at that before I left.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Dan Ryan: So I'm gonna roll out my next 2 campaigns. Because now I'm like, all right, I could. This isn't gonna go nuts. It's not gonna get out of control and and take off. So I'm gonna roll out 2 more campaigns based.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Dan Ryan: Off of that, but it was like. It was interesting.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Dan Ryan: Where is it to fucking? Did I close it? Where'd it go? And then I'm going to oh, Mark, send me that! I don't know. Devin didn't put me on that email with the Csv. Send that thing to me.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I saw that email. I have no idea. I don't see an email from Devin with a Csv file.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, me. Either.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
mark sweet: Like, yeah, I have a tiny bit from 10 0 1 to 10 0, 9, like 8 days worth.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Dan Ryan: No, that ain't it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
mark sweet: That's just. That's the only dot Csv that I have.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Dan Ryan: I'll I'll send an email from both of us asking for that.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Dan Ryan: My new, best friend. Sure he loves me.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you're connected with Devin. You just haven't got what you needed from him.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
mark sweet: It's fine.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Dan Ryan: He said he sent it, but I never got it.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Don't have anything.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Dan Ryan: So I was like, I guess Mark got it. So I'll just get it from Mark. But I guess Mark did not get it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
mark sweet: I did not.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, so I'm gonna launch this. Competitor campaign, which.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Dan Ryan: I don't get it. There's this site called buy crash.com. And that's like.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Dan Ryan: Highly searched keyword which I find insane. Because how could a person possibly how could a searcher know that.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000
mark sweet: Oh! Okay, hold on there, there's a reason, and it's stupid. But it might make more sense to you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Dan Ryan: Like that can't real.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
mark sweet: Lexisnexis. Runs a site called Buy crash! That's where you can.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
mark sweet: Pay to download police reports.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
mark sweet: So it's a little bit of law firm.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Dan Ryan: I just don't think a consumer would know that.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
mark sweet: I don't think that consumer necessarily does. A lot of law firms do.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Dan Ryan: I know. That's why I'm like, I think this is. That it's searched for a lot. I'm like this can't be real.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Dan Ryan: So all right. Uh uh! Well, it should be fine, because I'm only doing it in Tucson. So it should be fine.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
mark sweet: I mean, I do see people ppcing it. Yeah, I do see people people seeing it. But I will.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
mark sweet: Be willing to bet it's mostly law firms, because that's how I.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Dan Ryan: It's gotta be like. This doesn't make any sense.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Dan Ryan: But the one keyword that. Looks like it would. Pop is.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Dan Ryan: Let me see if I actually have this. I don't think I've got this one running.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Dan Ryan: No, I don't. So I'm gonna I'm gonna roll out. Where is it?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Dan Ryan: So. Car accident. This is bizarre, because I would have never guessed this. The best keyword based on the data.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Dan Ryan: Is car accident, report, lookup. I'm like, Okay.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Dan Ryan: Followed by. Uh, and I'll I can run this one. Geo. Arizona accident reports online.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Dan Ryan: So I am going, and then the the top out of the top. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 6, 7.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Dan Ryan: So 3 out of the top. 7. Don't have the word.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Dan Ryan: Today yesterday in them like I feel like today and yesterday are bad. But I might.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Dan Ryan: I'm not gonna do that because someone looking for error, the number one keyword based on volume. Is Arizona. Fatal accident reports today. There's no way that's a client.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Dan Ryan: That's some buddy that's some morbid. Curiosity, action, Happening.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Dan Ryan: Because if you were. In a fatal accident. Why would you search for fatal accident today?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Dan Ryan: But that just seems weird. Also, I don't think you get.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
mark sweet: No.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Dan Ryan: Fatal Accidents.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
mark sweet: The. There could be more logical reasons.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Dan Ryan: There could be, so I can run that if I run it in Tucson I just won't run it. In Arizona, and then, if it works in Tucson, then it would work in other cities.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Dan Ryan: But today, based on my earlier data, is dog shit. Anything with today.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Dan Ryan: But it might not be anything. Maybe today paired with. Certain things, works, but.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Dan Ryan: It seemed bad. So, anyway, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna roll out those 3.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Dan Ryan: Or 4. I'll do buy crash, but I think buy crash is bullshit.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
mark sweet: I would not waste your money on. Buy crash! I that one, I can tell you, is not people looking it up.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Dan Ryan: I don't think there's either. Yeah.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Tina Marie: Those search terms. Just confuse me.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Dan Ryan: You're welcome.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. Just a second.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Dan Ryan: Actually, yeah, I'll do online. And. Look up!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Tina Marie: What's the status of get paid, not played?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
mark sweet: I haven't heard anything back from the broker yet.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Dan Ryan: There you go! That sometimes takes forever.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's with the domain broker. And that was on was 11 days ago.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Tina Marie: And how about the trademark process.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, I haven't done shit on that yet. Um! I was. Gonna wait till I had the domain first.st

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Okay.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Tina Marie: Um. Trying to figure out which one I want next.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
mark sweet: There's an email asking if there's any updates.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And then after that the custom number, for when are it's free.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I still want that one to like.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Tina Marie: Haven't. Okay. Well did anything happen between now and last week.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
mark sweet: I've said no to like 6 more.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tina Marie: Can you give him more specific parameters so he can. Find it without the back and forth.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
mark sweet: Uh, I tell them something that's easy to remember, and preferably uh. What's it called? Repeats.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Tina Marie: And he suggested 16 to you that you refused because.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
mark sweet: They they didn't match what I said.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Tina Marie: So my point is. Maybe you need to give.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Tina Marie: More clear examples or something, because Isaac isn't dumb. Right. He's missing something. There's a disconnect.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Tina Marie: But there's how many numbers like, how much time is it? What's the priority but to take. Weeks. It's been a month.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Tina Marie: Since we started that. Um.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Tina Marie: And you had 6 suggestions as all right. Um. I guess if it's not a big priority. Taking this long is probably not a big deal, but it seems like a simple thing that could be done.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Dan Ryan: It's actually not because. They're super hard to come by like.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that's the problem.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Dan Ryan: Stupid. I tried to get one. 15 years ago. I never got one. I was like F. This.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
mark sweet: Unless I want to pay 6 figures.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Dan Ryan: Tens of thousands of dollars. Yeah.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
mark sweet: Number.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Dan Ryan: It's very much like domains. People have locked this shit down, and then.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
mark sweet: So cool.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, no, I get that for a very specific number, but he's not looking for a very specific number. Just.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Tina Marie: We? It's a it's a. Fairly vast realm.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Dan Ryan: It isn't.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Tina Marie: Repeatable, rememberable.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
mark sweet: No like the best one that I've been able to find was 4, 4, 1 0 0 7, 7. That ain't great.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Tina Marie: Right? Okay.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Dan Ryan: You look for? Yeah, you gotta find something patterny or whatever. But yeah, they. They scoop them all up because they do do the thing where they're translating, which I think is dumb. But they're translating numbers into letters. So weird combinations get used up because they spell something and.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Dan Ryan: It's dumb you could. You can't.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Tina Marie: And what are the prefixes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Dan Ryan: You can do the thing where you make it the word longer than the numbers, and people don't have to keep hitting. I've seen people do that, but it's like that's kind of dumbed.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Tina Marie: He's not using words at all. He's just using number.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know I'm just saying you could do that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, um. What were the prefixes that you're okay with.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
mark sweet: 808, 6, 6.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Tina Marie: Only.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
mark sweet: I mean, I think maybe the 8 7 7. But the problem is, I still don't think a lot of people know that the 8 8. I don't think people know very well.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Dan Ryan: 8, 8, 8, 7.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
mark sweet: 800 is.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Tina Marie: What did you say, Dan?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
mark sweet: What?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Dan Ryan: I said, 8, 8, 8 is probably not bad, because it's.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Tina Marie: Dances.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Dan Ryan: 8, 8, 8, right? That's easier. They don't have to remember one number.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tina Marie: And you also can tell, that's not a normal area code. So it's. Um probably toll free, but you could also, you know, of course, say toll free next to it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
mark sweet: Yeah, the 8 through threes. I don't love the 8 6 sixes I hadn't heard of until I started doing this.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Like this.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Dan Ryan: Has he asked. Chat gpt.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
mark sweet: Yeah, Cbc, can't tell me what's available and what's not available. Unfortunately.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know, but to like. Give ideas like I need a number.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Tina Marie: Operator might be able to do it, though. Crickets. Okay.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, that is.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Tina Marie: Chat Gbt. Operator with the pro version.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Dan Ryan: Got him.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Tina Marie: It. It's an opera and opera browser can go. It's not great at all. But autonomously go through a certain web tasks if you don't, if it's not behind a where you have to be logged in.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Tina Marie: It can do some tasks like this. Maybe. Anyway. Okay, so.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Tina Marie: A second voice tracking, how's that going.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
mark sweet: Yes, it's going.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Tina Marie: Well, I mean.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
mark sweet: So far we have added. I'll tell you.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
mark sweet: Since we had to restart it at the beginning. This month. Or the 10, th or whatever you want to call it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
mark sweet: Ah! $34,000 of value.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Tina Marie: Just in March.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Tina Marie: And how many months have we been doing it?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
mark sweet: A few. Sometimes they do it, sometimes they don't. It's a whole other argument.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
mark sweet: But yeah, it's working, you know, we can show it's working, which is cool.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it is. Um. I think that you'll find that it was worth a whole lot of money to you to do that.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
mark sweet: But it'll definitely be worth. Yeah.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Tina Marie: I mean probably at least one or 2 people's salaries.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Tina Marie: By the end of the year Hudson. Stop it.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
mark sweet: Hudson's a good boy. He can do whatever he wants.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Tina Marie: Hudson is eating my favorite shoes, and it's not good.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
mark sweet: Well, that's that's a you problem. He's enjoying himself. He's.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Tina Marie: We'll send you to Mark and let you chew up his stuff.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
mark sweet: That's okay. I don't have anything worth showing. Jonas, that's another story myself. Okay, cool.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um so touch bot.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
mark sweet: Dead!

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Dan Ryan: Good.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you guys aren't talking about any other alternative. Um.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
mark sweet: I'm gonna try to make a shortcut thing work, but it is dead.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Tina Marie: Options.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Dan Ryan: It's literally it cannot be done. You cannot.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Dan Ryan: The only way to do it is the way that I told them to send it from his phone number. Or you map your phone number to twilio and then you're gonna lose voicemail. You're gonna lose SMS. It's.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Dan Ryan: There's no way to do it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Move it over here.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
mark sweet: Which is crazy because we all get these spam texts, like all the goddamn times, not ask me for does not ask me to opt in.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Dan Ryan: What's that?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
mark sweet: You know, like the spam text that you get like. Every day. Yeah, they don't ask till I opt in.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's cause. They're breaking the law.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Tina Marie: Right. And and they're subject to those things. And whether or not they get caught or paid. That's not a game you want to play.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Dan Ryan: They're yeah. They were just like emails, man.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Tina Marie: So then the QR. Codes for gift cards.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
mark sweet: Oh, we made some progress on that.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
mark sweet: America kind of just made a fill out this. Sheet, if you scan it in.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
mark sweet: That way. We can send to them directly, and we don't have as much issue of people trying to go through 20 different times.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Dan Ryan: But we don't need to build the leaflow version of that.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
mark sweet: I mean, that would be better.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Dan Ryan: I guess we need to understand what she solved, so that it solves for that, too.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Can we see it? Can you.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:38.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'll have them share the form, and I'll send it to you guys because I'm sure there's a better way to do it. But we definitely could feed it back into lead flow, because those are people who are. Interacting with us. Which means that they're probably gonna be people that we can.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
mark sweet: Nudge for.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Dan Ryan: Things.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
mark sweet: Like referrals. Yeah.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Alright, cool.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
mark sweet: So it'll help pare down our list of who we're reaching out to, I guess, but in a better way.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Tina Marie: Do you need an email reminder for that.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
mark sweet: Uh, sure!

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:34.000
mark sweet: But if we can pare down to say, you know, a hundred people who actually use the gift cards, or whatever else we can. Feed them for both literally and figuratively.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
mark sweet: To try to get more referrals from them.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
mark sweet: Cause we'll keep. We'll still keep sending up birthday cars. People like getting them, and it means something to them. But. Yeah.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I think that can be automated too. In in lead, Chloe. As long as you have their birthday I'm sure there's an automation, and then it hooks up to a card provider.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Dan Ryan: Now we're yeah. I mean, I'm I'm sure, like.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
mark sweet: It's more expensive to do it that way than for us to literally mail them out from here.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Dan Ryan: That's what I was. Gonna say, it's definitely.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
mark sweet: Yeah. We looked at that one, too. It was. It's just cheaper for us to send them out.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, convenience is more expensive. Then licking those stamps, America.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
mark sweet: Because no use. Name of Jesus.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Dan Ryan: Get a sponge.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh, Uh-huh.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah, cause they're using the stamp machine. So it's the same cost. It's not like, Oh, you're doing so many more.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
mark sweet: Elon Musk takes it over and we're all screwed. But different story.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Dan Ryan: Efficiency. Damn it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Tina Marie: So hq intact, intake. Um getting them to send the lead back to lead Flowy. Is that the.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
mark sweet: We have not had much luck with that one.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Dan Ryan: Well, he said, they don't do it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah, they have basically. So they don't do it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Tina Marie: So should I just take this.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
mark sweet: No, sorry. Not basically.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Tina Marie: Task off the list and. Ignore it? Or what do you want to do about.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
mark sweet: I would probably take it off the list and selecting them, do something else. But we don't send them enough volume where they're really interested in changing their protocols.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yeah, that'll work. No, that's not what I want.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Tina Marie: Second. Alright um.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Tina Marie: This next one.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
mark sweet: We're making progress on a lot of these things which is good. I'm still waiting for ethics attorney to get. The retainer group backs me on Colorado.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
mark sweet: Um, hoping, he said. Sometime this week. So I'm hoping by mid April we'll be able to launch.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Tina Marie: Let me find that one.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:18.000
mark sweet: And then we just have to make one small change in our website. But I'll send an email on that. It's not a huge thing. We can't say 99% success rate.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Tina Marie: 3, 2425. Um.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Tina Marie: Expecting to me. In mid April.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Does Walker have any idea what kind of volume they'd be able to get you.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
mark sweet: No.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Tina Marie: And Dan for sharing the making the winner. It's free content stuff, edible, editable.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
mark sweet: You just did it.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Dan Ryan: Already did it.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Tina Marie: He just did it. Okay, shared it.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: This webinar. Update.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Tina Marie: Um. How about the Chona stuff with Jd funnels?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Dan Ryan: I have received nothing.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Tina Marie: Are they normally very. Timely.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Dan Ryan: Say? What.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Tina Marie: I said, are they normally normally um? Very responsive, like. So nothing.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Dan Ryan: No, I didn't get anything from Mark.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
mark sweet: You need from me.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Dan Ryan: Uh all like uh all the paperwork or whatever. So we can start to map the. Potential fields and whatnot.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Dan Ryan: You're supposed to like. Just show me everything that they get. That she would. That would uh.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Dan Ryan: Be associated with the user record.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
mark sweet: So when you say that like, just so make sure I understand. I know it sounds stupid. Um. So the name, the date of birth phone number where it came from.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, everything.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Dan Ryan: So if they're like, Oh, hey! Can you? Can you fill out this thing that tells us about your injuries? Well, I have no idea what they send them. But I'm sure they send them paperwork, or they're sending them 4. I don't know whatever they fill out whatever data.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
mark sweet: Literally, they're getting emails from a law firm, and each law firm sends something different. But they do generally get demographics which. Has those things in it.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Dan Ryan: Well, yeah. And we would just make something for so that it's like, if law firm A collects something and law firm B doesn't, it's there. It's it's what the it's what the record looks like on this end.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Dan Ryan: So, if it needs. That field, because suite law sends that, or it's whatever.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Dan Ryan: We just want to see, like every iteration of. An intake, and then anything that they.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Dan Ryan: That they have, so that. It's the data that they have on their end that they interact with.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Dan Ryan: And then, you know, they're transcribing it manually now or whatever. And then then we would move towards okay, how can we.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
mark sweet: Got it.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Dan Ryan: You know. Can we get these law firms to fill out a form? Can we? Do you know. Whatever. But so we have to map all the data first.st

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Dan Ryan: And then it, and you like. You'd create the fields and you put them into. You organize them inside the Crm and blah blah blah! Blah!

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Dan Ryan: But we just need like a full. So it's like putting all the puzzle pieces out on the table and say, Oh, okay.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Dan Ryan: Here are all the pieces. Now, how do we make this work. We'll put it together.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Dan Ryan: God who is texting me.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Tina Marie: So. Last week Mark shared the um.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Tina Marie: I was pretty sure. The the spreadsheet that you made shared something with us, and I thought it was for this purpose.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Dan Ryan: No, that was like 3 weeks ago.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Tina Marie: But that huh!

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Dan Ryan: Last week we talked about exactly this.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Dan Ryan: And that spreadsheets part of it. The question is, is there more than that? And the idea was that yes, there is.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Tina Marie: So, Mark, do you need an email reminder for this.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah, well, yes, because I think. You, me and Chona had to figure that part out a little bit better.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:40.000
mark sweet: Cause. I don't know everything they get like, I just know she gets emails. They do the phone call, and they put everything in their system, but I don't know all the specifics well enough. To be able to really give a good answer in that regard.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's what I figured. We're gonna have to tap into her and and. Like whatever they send people.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Dan Ryan: Or whatever they request, from people, or whatever documents that people send in that get transcribed or attached, even like, if if it's a matter of oh, hey! We need to be able to have an attachment area. On this record. Okay, great, do we need to.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Dan Ryan: Create a section for that. So it's like, here are the medical attachments, you know. I don't know. I'm with you. I don't know. I.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no. And I I just want to be right. And I want her to to understand what it is and be comfortable with it, because I I. I don't know, and I don't want to uh give you better.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Tina Marie: I'll get that email sent. I'm just. Trying to capture all of it. Okay.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Wow! That's the wrong.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
mark sweet: She doesn't. Your spreadsheet and the dashboard makes her excited. So yay for dashboards.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Tina Marie: Yay!

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Dan Ryan: I'm learning a lot about dashboards right now, so I've never really built one. But I'm about to. And I'm already customizing it.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
mark sweet: Why are we not surprised.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Dan Ryan: We're all.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Dan Ryan: I was like, this doesn't work.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah, they're 93 visits for the month. So they're gonna break a hundred just awesome.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Tina Marie: What did you just say?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
mark sweet: They're at 93 visits for the month. So far. So they're definitely gonna break a hundred. So.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh, awesome!

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
mark sweet: But yeah.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's see.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
mark sweet: But now I gotta figure out how to get more. Clients than she has visits.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.000
mark sweet: Because I'm unnecessarily competitive. Cause. I'm only at 83 people. So yeah.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my! Gosh! Listen! Um. Okay, how about the.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Tina Marie: Call control training.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
mark sweet: Me if I know what's going on. Let me see. Take a look at that.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tina Marie: Are you looking that up, or.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.000
mark sweet: Um messaging Isaac about it, because I don't know if modules ever actually finished or not. Oh, we added a new intake person. She starts pretty soon.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
mark sweet: She's got like 20 years experience.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Dan Ryan: And now.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh, nice!

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
mark sweet: Good, so she's a little pricey, but. Um. She should be good.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Tina Marie: Does she have the potential to be our intake manager?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
mark sweet: Uh, maybe, but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Her name is Elva.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:15.000
mark sweet: But she's primarily been like case managers before, like case manager, slash, intake, slash whatever. So she'll be able to talk to clients about the process a little bit better, and how things actually work.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
mark sweet: Um. So I. Kind of expecting her to be.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
mark sweet: Supposed to say it. Like more of a closer.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh, nice! That's good!

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
mark sweet: Because she has good background. Yeah? So.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Tina Marie: Did you say, Elva? With a V or with a B like boy.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
mark sweet: ELBA.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Tina Marie: B like boy.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
mark sweet: Uh v like Victor.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Tina Marie: Okay, that's what I thought you said.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Dan Ryan: That's the female version of Elvis.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
mark sweet: Uh! You know what it might be.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Dan Ryan: I think it might be.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
mark sweet: She had a whole bunch of little trohuas. That she rescued.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Tina Marie: Alright!

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:24.000
mark sweet: That should help cause. We can't count on Jose. Unfortunately, we just never know. So this should hopefully help in that regard. Um, I also message quantify to see if we can up even further, because.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
mark sweet: Initial results are pretty positive.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Tina Marie: Initial results for what is.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
mark sweet: Blue, steel, quantify.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
mark sweet: So we can get them to like double instead of. 10 or 13, if we can get up to 20 or 26, that would.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:53.000
mark sweet: That would be good. Then at the end of this month I'll send Monkey, hey? This is what we signed so.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:04.000
mark sweet: Kind of tells them we're not where we expect to be, and every time we do that we generally get a little bump. Just can't do it every month to them. But as long as they do it relatively, consistently, it's okay.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um, and we talked about you listening to intake calls to gauge.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Tina Marie: Well, I wrote down Black Swan strategy, but just. Um! How how they're doing with sales. If.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Tina Marie: So. The the conversation, I remember, was um. Are they applying what they learned?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Tina Marie: And should we get updated or just. More training, knowing that.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Tina Marie: Number one. Retention's not perfect, so repetition is important, especially when trying to acquire and then improve a skill. That that's valuable, that that is, that valuable.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Tina Marie: Um, but. First, st we need to evaluate.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Tina Marie: How much what we've done is even being applied. And if.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Tina Marie: Feel like there was something that you said like you weren't happy with them. Oh, it was because they. We're not very responsive, and it took a long time.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
mark sweet: I mean. Generally speaking, I'm not.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
mark sweet: Generally speaking, I'm not.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so. But um, have you listened to and take calls recently and just kind of. Thought about that in relationship to.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: Any improvement in sales and closing after training.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
mark sweet: Um, yes, and also just the fact that they know I'm listening to it has helped alone.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:57.000
mark sweet: So they're doing better, which is part of the reason why we're on a much better pace this month. Just better spend not really increasing. Our spend has increased because the other 2 sources, but they haven't produced much of anything.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Tina Marie: So I'll tell you something I shared with Fuji this last week also is that. Um. People statistically do before do perform better when they know they're being observed. There's been.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: A few different experiments that were run. And when people were told that they were being recorded.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tina Marie: On video, or somehow observed. Uh they.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tina Marie: Consistently across the board, performed better. So if they think that you're watching closely.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Tina Marie: Doesn't matter what it is. It should improve. It's just good to know.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
mark sweet: No, I I agree with you.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Alright um.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Tina Marie: One second. So.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Tina Marie: Did I move this over to close? I don't think so, but. The issue with getting a lot of visitors with Chat, but they aren't going anywhere.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
mark sweet: I mean, it's still happening, but I can't. Say, there's a reason like the chat. Bot!

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
mark sweet: Responds quickly. And then, if you just don't do anything.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Dan Ryan: No, we we rolled out a dedicated one. Not last week, the week before.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Dan Ryan: So now it's got a whole different, prompt. It's geared towards. They're not. We're not trying to drive them to making an appointment.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Dan Ryan: So we can start to manipulate that if it's if it's doing the wrong stuff. So uh. I can just tell Eric to look at. Look at it every couple of days and see what they're saying, and then we can start to tweak the prompt to address.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Dan Ryan: To make it more tailored to. What it, whatever it needs to be.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Dan Ryan: I will tell. I will tell Stacy right now.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
mark sweet: Okay. Cool.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you don't need a follow up email.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Dan Ryan: Typing it as we chat.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Um for.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Tina Marie: I have a task that says Dan, needs to get manager access to Mark's domain. Registrar.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Dan Ryan: That already happened.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Tina Marie: That already happened. Okay.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
mark sweet: He's in charge.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Tina Marie: He's what entered.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Dan Ryan: In charge.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Tina Marie: In charge.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
mark sweet: George Roland.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Um SEO stuff.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Tina Marie: What's the status of that.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Dan Ryan: I have not gotten my €1,000 from Gert, and I hit him up on Friday before I left. It's not responded yet.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Dan Ryan: And I actually just checked their dashboard. And there's nothing in there.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
mark sweet: Um. There's a problem. Sorry Chat. I'm looking at one right now.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Dan Ryan: Hmm.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:28.000
mark sweet: That's visitor KMON, C. May have an email address for the New Mexico branch to send a document release form for a client. The response was, we don't have a New Mexico branch. Please call our office.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, there you go. Let's see. It's.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Tina Marie: Wait!

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Dan Ryan: Clients that interact with it. That's what's so interesting.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
mark sweet: I'm gonna guess it's more an adjuster. But yeah.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Dan Ryan: Ah, yeah. So that prompt, probably. Doesn't know all that stuff.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
mark sweet: Okay, we need to make sure. It knows.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah. Good. Good. Yes, I'm telling Stacy. Just have Eric check it like every 2 or 3 days, and.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Dan Ryan: Modify the prompt based on what we're seeing.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
mark sweet: Got it.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
mark sweet: We're getting. Chats at least. But yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
mark sweet: Interesting.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Tina Marie: Let's see. There. It is highlight that one.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Tina Marie: Yuri. Um.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Tina Marie: So. I know that the typical.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: Process? Is he. The new attorneys. Once they're barred past the bar.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Tina Marie: Um are helping out other attorneys with their loads. Who who is he assigned to. Help!

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000
mark sweet: Right now he's a floater, so he's doing a lot of. Stuff for Lorenz, writing a lot of Lorenz's demands. Lorenz needs a whole.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I I knew about that. But who else is he working with.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
mark sweet: Team, run, zoom. Uh Patrick a little bit.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.000
mark sweet: Some of the Tyler's um. We work on some of the minor compromises because they're just. It's a lot of work on those, so at least he knows how to. Those are made.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Tina Marie: So um. The.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Tina Marie: Because Lorenz was telling me that Yuri was helping him with some things, and I'm trying to remember. What initiated my my 1st question, but.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Tina Marie: Part of it is because Lorenz is doing a really good job in trying to streamline the processes for how the cases are handled and. I would say good, based off of.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Tina Marie: Just what he's describing to me, and. What his stats seem to be improving, which actually, I need to ask a question because.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. All right. We'll get to that in a minute. But Josh, stuff.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Tina Marie: I need to talk about. But anyway, um! So I was asking him.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tina Marie: It. If he thought that it would that he could, I don't know, share some of that process like.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Tina Marie: How he works through the cases, because an exercise we started months ago was kind of the anatomy of the case and the order of things, and just. Um touching it, making sure that things are getting done right, not just letting it go weeks without following up on any of it, and just kind of.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Tina Marie: Showing him. Hey, this is how we've been doing things that work out. Well. And he's like, well, you know, he doesn't work for me. I don't want to step on toes. I don't wanna like.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
mark sweet: He should not expect Yuri to be with him long term.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But does it not help sweet law period just to train him on? And I don't know what kind of training he gets. But looking at things in a systematic way.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Tina Marie: Right in terms of order, of operations and efficiency. Does he get any training like that.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
mark sweet: Right now we had to just build up his pure baseline knowledge. Before we could talk about anything else.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Tina Marie: But didn't he already have baseline knowledge before.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
mark sweet: No.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000
mark sweet: No, that's the problem. Like he he! His legal work in the Ukraine was corporate work which there's no.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:45.000
mark sweet: Real overlap in what we do. So we have. We're we're training from scratch. It's not. That's not putting him down. He's not at fault for that in any way, shape or form like we. We go in eyes wide open same way. Patrick, when he came to us, had, like no experience.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
mark sweet: So we have to start from scratch, and they have to. Understand how a like.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
mark sweet: Pi is, for lack of a better term.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Tina Marie: I guess I thought Yuri was already working for you before he passed the bar. As is helping.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
mark sweet: Uh he started us in like December. And he hasn't pressed the bar yet.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
mark sweet: Um, you just took it. So we're not gonna know till like.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh, all right, he took it. He has to pass it.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
mark sweet: May.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay. He's. Yeah, I guess I was thinking he was not as new.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
mark sweet: And I'm still relatively new.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Tina Marie: So he's just.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
mark sweet: And then there's other issues of whether he'll be able to actually stay in the country and work in the country.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
mark sweet: That are outside of any of this um that are. Newer developments that we have 0 control over.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
mark sweet: Unfortunately.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Let's see.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
mark sweet: Which makes things more fun.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Um.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Tina Marie: City lifestyle. Are are you doing that.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Tina Marie: What's this up.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
mark sweet: I see how much of a fan Dan is of it. Um, but yeah, we're doing it.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Dan Ryan: I'm saying it will work. They've got all kinds of SEO SEO issues issues.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
mark sweet: Oh, you're probably right.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
mark sweet: Eh? It's cheap enough if it gets the one case a month that's worth it.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, if the dude fixed his SEO, it might. Help!

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
mark sweet: That would be good.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Dan Ryan: Don't! Don't throw my name in that ring. Don't tell Salco. I gave feedback.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Tina Marie: Oh, Josh, okay. So Josh sent an email. Basically, things are taking him longer than he thought.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Tina Marie: He!

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Dan Ryan: He wants to kick it down to his boy.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Dan Ryan: That guy worked on some of this stuff already.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so um. Is it cool to just talk with him about what we're working on? Does he have access like.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Tina Marie: I I don't. Did. Josh, huh!

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, yeah. So he literally sits right next to Josh.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Dan Ryan: So he's been in at least one meeting I was in. He was there in the background, and I think we were introduced. I guess he's probably still there.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Dan Ryan: In the same location. So he. I don't know if he has access, or he was using John, you'd have to ask. I mean, I don't care.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Dan Ryan: He knows how to build the stuff. And Ju, you know, it's just Josh telling him what it's like me saying, Eric, go build this. And then checking it after the fact. So I think it'd be fine.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay, and.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Dan Ryan: Rather than waiting for Josh, for sure.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, alright. So then I will get that moving. Um. I need to go get a drink real quick.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Tina Marie: You guys have something you can talk about for a couple of minutes where I get a quick drink.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
mark sweet: But we can talk about lots of random stuff.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Dan Ryan: Can we? Let's talk about a single near plane crash with a single engine. Go.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:08.000
mark sweet: Oh, that happens all the time. Um! Oh, I had a really really stupid thing. I had to go do uh! With a different business coach, where they made one of the engines go out, quote unquote.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Dan Ryan: Pardon.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:15.000
mark sweet: And you had to land the well, fly a plane. They won't let you land it. Uh! And they were mad, that I was too calm.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. What was that.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
mark sweet: Uh, so. It's so stupid.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.000
mark sweet: Literally, they're like they're trying to test your. Ability under pressure, and how well you can follow directions and give directions.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
mark sweet: And so you know. Oh, no! One of the engines went out. Good news is we can still fly on one engine. Okay.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Dan Ryan: But oh! We can! Great.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah, like, I, I know this. Uh. So here you do this, I'll do these things cool. Okay, what other things do I need to know, like, really basic things. But um.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I I don't know what else to say. Like I was.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Dan Ryan: Are are you like in a flight simulator? Oh, oh.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's like a 7, 37 flight simulator.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Dan Ryan: And they want you to panic as if you're in an actual. Plane.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
mark sweet: I mean, it's going around. It's like. Jumping all around. But yeah.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, yeah, I probably wouldn't panic either, just because it's not real.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
mark sweet: Um. Yeah, kinda I mean, that's that's really the.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Dan Ryan: But now did you see others who did panic.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Dan Ryan: Really.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I mean, you're you're definitely into it. Like.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know, but I mean like you. There's, you know. You know it's not real.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
mark sweet: I know, I know.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, so that means they panic. And yeah. I mean, it is a good test, what? It's saying, yeah, okay, yeah. I see that.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
mark sweet: So I, yeah. Uh.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Dan Ryan: And this was. Now, hold on! This was business coaching.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Dan Ryan: Not flight, school.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
mark sweet: Nope, it's in a ropes course, and whatever else.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, that I did not see coming.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
mark sweet: Uh, yeah, I know.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
mark sweet: Oh, and then I sold the Gt. 3 arrest today.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Dan Ryan: Because.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
mark sweet: It doesn't make me happy, and the battery died because I drove. It's a little.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, I thought it was because you're making room for the next one.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
mark sweet: Probably.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Dan Ryan: And that is.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
mark sweet: I don't know.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Dan Ryan: I thought you were waiting for some car that they were releasing.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah, they sort of, announced the Gt. 2 rs, but. No one really knows what's going on with that yet.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, Gotcha! No, I thought you were. Thought there was a different one that was like definitely coming out, that it was like a read issue. Oh, it is that! Never mind.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Dan Ryan: Well, supposedly the classic car market's gonna tank. You can get in on those. Get a MoD risto.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Dan Ryan: So it's got power steering and all the good stuff. Rock and roll.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
mark sweet: I mean, there's definitely options.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I'm like I was happy to hear it. I'm like sweet. Let me know when it tanks.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
mark sweet: Car prices are gonna get interesting, really, shortly, with the tariffs and everything else.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, that would be tomorrow. Oh, no! Next Tuesday.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: Wait. What's happening.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Dan Ryan: Reciprocal tariffs.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh, that'll be fun!

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Dan Ryan: It should be definitely interesting. Oh, no! Next Wednesday.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Dan Ryan: My bad.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Tina Marie: Well, the one thing we know is that the things. Good or bad, can change very, very, very, very quickly.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Tina Marie: That didn't used to happen. The kind of speed for better or worse.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Tina Marie: It's all crazy. Okay? Well, we have gone through our whole task list. So um.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Tina Marie: Trying to think about like.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, I will tell you this. This is interesting. Everyone that sees winner. It's free likes it.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Dan Ryan: Like, I just open on my computer. And they're like, Oh, that looks cool. They don't even know what it is.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
mark sweet: I I really do like it.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Dan Ryan: So I was like, well, that's what it's meant to do.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Tina Marie: Powerful psychology.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I thought that was interesting. 2 people in a row uh on Thursday. So I had a bunch of people at the office on Thursday 2 people in a row. It was open on my computer like, what's that. And then one of them said, Did you see the site that's open on his computer to a 3rd person? I was like, Oh.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Tina Marie: Nice job.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Dan Ryan: Right? Not not. It's just regular old feedback. I was like, Okay, interesting.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
mark sweet: That's a good thing. It's eye catching, and people are there for it.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Dan Ryan: It really is. I was surprised by it.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
mark sweet: Another goal.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, I do think it every time I it's very eye catch every time you open it. You're like, Yeah, that really does. Grab your eye so billboard, I mean, that's what you want.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Tina Marie: That's a billboard for you right there. Yep.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Dan Ryan: Right? So we do this content, then. Once we sort of nail that down. Then I was gonna start to just try to come up with.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Dan Ryan: I think some of it translates to a bull. But a billboard, but then.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Dan Ryan: We could have Greg just take a stab at a billboard. And be like, Hey, put, do a billboard that says this.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Dan Ryan: And then he should have that person with the check stuff back. Um. Well, he's gonna use it in this design, so I gotta get him the copy and stuff.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Dan Ryan: He's ready to go.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
mark sweet: Who. Yeah, no, I think this will look good on.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
mark sweet: Billboards or bus pinches or sides of buses.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Dan Ryan: Totally.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
mark sweet: Or skateboards.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Dan Ryan: Maybe. So I was up in Santa Cruz.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
mark sweet: Me!

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Dan Ryan: Boards.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Um.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you got that with Jonah. Oh! Speaking of Mark.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Tina Marie: I messaged you guys last week. Uh.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, no, I know I saw it. I'm not the one that makes that call.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Tina Marie: I know I'll text her.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
mark sweet: So let me let me know when you're gonna fire.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Tina Marie: Uh, I mean she's doing good, though, is she not?

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000
mark sweet: Okay. You let me know when you're gonna fire. Yeah, I don't know.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
mark sweet: I'm just gonna figure you firing her.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Dan Ryan: Who are we firing? What's up?

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
mark sweet: Jonah.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! From her current job.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Tina Marie: She's.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
mark sweet: Dan should fire.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Tina Marie: As a client.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Dan Ryan: Oh!

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: But she's. She's she is growing, and she keeps moving forward. She does have some.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: Disconnects, but then, if I call her out on it. She might get quiet for a little bit, but then she shows back up, and she's made that pattern consistently. So.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tina Marie: Um. But also when she shows back up she does better each time. So that's not really a.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Tina Marie: You know that's all workable for me. It's when somebody.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Tina Marie: Just I don't know.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
mark sweet: Yay Ken has a Csv. Now from.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Tina Marie: You can tell that they.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
mark sweet: Devin.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Tina Marie: Just cut me off for that.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, excellent!

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
mark sweet: Yep, because you're not gonna you're not gonna fire. So what's the point?

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Tina Marie: Sure. Oh, my gosh! Why do you want me to.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
mark sweet: Because it's fun for me.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Tina Marie: You have some issues that's just not nice. That's just me.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, no. We we know this.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Dan Ryan: It's just not here.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: I know.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
mark sweet: We're well aware of this.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Tina Marie: You have to decide if you'd rather be competitive, or if you want to be happily married, like, what is your priority?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
mark sweet: Yeah, the second one's not likely to happen regardless. So let's go with the 1st one.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Dan Ryan: No.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Tina Marie: What if you've already given up? Of course it's not gonna happen. You don't believe it's even possible you're never gonna do the things that will be necessary to make it happen. You know that right.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
mark sweet: It'll be fine.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tina Marie: But is fine. What you want.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah, sure.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I could slap me so far right now.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
mark sweet: This is what you're cutting for. You need to pet him.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Tina Marie: He's looking at you like what is going on with you right now? Are you okay?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
mark sweet: This sounds. Right.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Tina Marie: Did I wake you up? You're so cute. I love him. Okay, you distracted me. That's not fair.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay, anyway. Well. So you know, we're we're working on the leads. The mark.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
mark sweet: You think we'll do it?

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
mark sweet: More, leads.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Tina Marie: I know, but also you need to be able to get as much money out of the leads that you do, that you get as possible, so really, more and more. And I have said this before, but I got tired of saying it, but I'm going to say it again. More energy and effort needs to go into intake.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Tina Marie: Because that is where that's your leaky bucket. Right down.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Dan Ryan: It's definitely a optimization point. Like, I'm. Building it.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Tina Marie: It's a leaky bucket.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, it's not that leaky those guys. Do a good job. I mean, they're very prompt and.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Dan Ryan: It. I I don't know.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay, what I'm talking about is the closing skill specifically not.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Dan Ryan: It's like.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Tina Marie: Necessarily that they don't.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I don't know. I don't. I know that we get outcomes right? So it's like each lead gets an outcome.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Tina Marie: Do the work.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Dan Ryan: But. I mean the calls I listened to. I was like, Okay, you you're not. You're not.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Dan Ryan: Qualifying this call fast enough. Right? They. They weren't following script. So in that regard, yeah, just that alone. They all just did the same thing every time.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Dan Ryan: It would certainly free up time that could probably. And then, that time being spent, spent somewhere else like. Getting retainers back in, or whatever would certainly.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Dan Ryan: Be beneficial.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so. Um.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Tina Marie: I think. Okay, let let me ask you this, Mark, when you listen to intake calls, what is your process. What are you looking for? What do you do after that?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
mark sweet: So 1st thing I do is I just I listen to it all the way through.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Tina Marie: How do you do it?

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
mark sweet: Like before I start. Digging into it, no matter how frustrating it is.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
mark sweet: Then we start again. So it's how do they greet the person.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
mark sweet: Do they go through the checklist of what they need to get. Um? Do they check in with the person.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.000
mark sweet: And then, if they didn't close the client, I'm assuming it's not a closed case, because. Yeah. Um.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000
mark sweet: What did they not do? Right. What was the objection?

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
mark sweet: And then, after all that, then we sit down and we talk about it.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Tina Marie: So do you document any of this.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
mark sweet: I mean. I write down the notes.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Tina Marie: Can you share any of that with me.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Tina Marie: Cause. What I would like to look for is the patterns number one in. You doing that? How frequently are you doing it? How good are your notes? How many calls are you listening to.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: What did you coach on.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
mark sweet: Not enough. I'll tell you that much.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Tina Marie: Who did you, coach? How did you coach them? What was the results of the coaching? That kind of stuff. If we start focusing on that and drilling down on that, here, on, on these meetings, a little bit more.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Tina Marie: Um, you know, incremental improvements, but then they compound over time. So. Since we've got a lot of things.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Tina Marie: Going um. And being worked on with.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Tina Marie: With not a lot of gaps, you know, just. Kind of slow and steady. This would be a really great lever to be working on.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, yeah, totally. I'm like, Okay, who's my 1st thing would be, I listen to everyone like who's following the script. Period, end of story.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Dan Ryan: Cause. Yes, it's the 1st optimization point.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Dan Ryan: After the acquisition of a lead. Right? So it's like, that's the one you. It's almost like after the click you do the landing page.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Dan Ryan: After the call after the form. Submit, you do intake. Whether it's them speaking on the phone. And yeah, I would do that.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no, that's that's. Definitely something that we've got to keep pushing on um, without a doubt. So we kind of do one on ones instead of group, because I don't want someone to feel like they're called out in front of other people or freaked out or not responsive because everyone's a delicate flower.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Phrase in public coach, in private.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Tina Marie: Looking for that unless you're. It's not. What's his name, Ray Dalio.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Tina Marie: What extreme. What is it called honesty?

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Tina Marie: Something transparency, something like that. Looking for the notes you take on coaching.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Tina Marie: Into after.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
mark sweet: But I'm hopeful that. Dan with the Csv file, will help a little bit.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Dan Ryan: What?

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Tina Marie: 7.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
mark sweet: And then Csv file.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Dan Ryan: I didn't get it. Did you get it?

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
mark sweet: Yeah, you're sent to you.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Dan Ryan: Good. Send it to me.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
mark sweet: No, you're literally CC'd on it.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Dan Ryan: I did not get it. Oh, no, there it is!

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
mark sweet: I will forward it again to you.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, no, there it is. I guess I got a shitload of emails.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
mark sweet: Okay, well, you're getting it one more time. Okay.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Tina Marie: All right. Anything else before we wrap up.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000
mark sweet: Uh, we might have one more big case. That's gonna settle by April 8.th So I'm excited for that.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Tina Marie: Big, how.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
mark sweet: 35 million dollars.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Dan Ryan: No, I did not get it. You got it just now.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:38.000
mark sweet: No, I forwarded it to you again. Do you have it? Do you see my email.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Dan Ryan: I don't.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
mark sweet: Dan.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Dan Ryan: I'm telling you. No one wants this more than me.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Dan Ryan: I just got Tina's. Did you share your notes? Thing. Or please share your notes.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
mark sweet: You're Dan at Basis rocks, right?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Dan Ryan: Ah, send it to D and D. Company, Dan A. D. And D Company.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Dan Ryan: Just in case that one usually always shows up.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Dan Ryan: It should show up the other one, but it is not.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
mark sweet: Hold on. I wanna mention you guys before we end. I wanna make sure you actually have this.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Dan Ryan: Me. Oh, this explains things I've been like, I am not getting emails.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Dan Ryan: I am not getting emails. That's why it's disconnected. I bet.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Tina Marie: Is that one? An alias.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Dan Ryan: No, but it it for some reason.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
mark sweet: Okay, I sent to the Dang company. Do you see it now?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Dan Ryan: Hold on! Refreshing. Nope.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Dan Ryan: Whatever. I'll get it from me. I'll get it on this other call.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Dan Ryan: Good use.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Tina Marie: Bye, Dan. Ah, Mark, do you have anything else.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000
mark sweet: Not really. I just we're we're on a good path. They just need to make sure everything just keeps moving the way it should. Colorado be good. I just wanted.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
mark sweet: To get going already.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tina Marie: Well, just a reminder. And you know this, you're at the center of all of it. So um.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Tina Marie: Speaking of that, you know what we haven't done in a while. So I was looking at this.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
mark sweet: Pick a nap.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tina Marie: Are you sleepy?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Tina Marie: Um. Alright. Well, I won't bug you about it, but we can talk about it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
mark sweet: That's okay.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Tina Marie: Next week is. The crew. There, hold on! Where did I have mine?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Notes, mm. Your. So when we started, your your salary for yourself was 200,000.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tina Marie: And then the last update I had, I feel like was. A couple years ago was 300,000, but what we I didn't ever.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Tina Marie: Write down was what. Like your bonus payments were, and what your total.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Take home was because for me. One of the things I want to look at. There's.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Tina Marie: A few components. Number one. Is that right? What? What do you get out of your business? You personally, not the just, the profit margins and the profits for the company, but.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Tina Marie: You, my, my person, that I'm working with. How much time is it taking you compared to what you want it to take you, which.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Tina Marie: You're different than almost everybody, because you just. Love it, apparently, or when you don't, I don't know.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Tina Marie: Back and forth, but little workaholic. And then the other thing would be just stress factor. Um.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Tina Marie: And then it's scalability, right? How, how we're doing on that. But I don't have. I don't have the financial. Growth to look at, and I like to track.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Tina Marie: How we're doing with that. So if that's something that you can, will share.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Tina Marie: And not just like current, but. Where was it when we started? Because I had only written down salary, not.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Tina Marie: Total after bonuses, but I remember it was not a ton. And I think you're doing better now.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Tina Marie: But I want to be able to track that growth.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it part of it is my business itself.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
mark sweet: And what I mean by that is, there's just a lot of ups and downs in what I do.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
mark sweet: And so like, there's definitely years where you don't have as much, or there's years like how we're starting this year, where you know 4 big cases, all settled.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Tina Marie: Right outliers. And then you had a a couple of years where you're basically breaking even. But.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
mark sweet: So, yeah.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Tina Marie: Because of the salaries, you know. That's 1 thing. So I would like to see that whether it's, you know.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
mark sweet: Look last year, we basically we broke even except for the large case. Large case of what made money last year.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
mark sweet: At the same time, I mean, I'm putting everything I possibly can through the business. Legally speaking.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000
mark sweet: Um, and it still buys Jonah plenty of her men's crap. So you know, it's working. But no, this year, I mean.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:03.000
mark sweet: So far this year taken more from the company than I've taken over the last 5 years. Like.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
mark sweet: Taken out of the company.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
mark sweet: Because we're now in a position to do that. We weren't before.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Well, okay, can you think about. What you can share and how you can share, so that I can see.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Tina Marie: How it's growing. Then then there will be other questions from that, because.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Tina Marie: Your. You have more going on than I have anywhere else, and we still only talk an hour a week. So.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tina Marie: There's a lot more to be dug into that I'm not digging into. And I really want to. Wrap my head around it more so when I have, for example, right.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Tina Marie: So when we have the conversation about intake, and we talk about more, I don't like. Nonspecifics. More is ambiguous.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Tina Marie: Um, you know. So, for example, second point.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
mark sweet: You have to get to 150 signed retainers a month consistently before the end of year.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean, there are those Kpis, and that's been enough, really, just looking at how much we're getting. But if.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
mark sweet: Because all of it's working backwards right? If we can consistently get there.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Tina Marie: I mean, yeah, that's still through intake.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
mark sweet: We know, generally speaking, what our average attorney fee is per case. Right. And so, whatever financial goals we have all starts with our upfront.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
mark sweet: Of course, our drop in sub-out rate is important.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:37.000
mark sweet: And I told you at the beginning of this year my 2 main focuses are, how can I increase our average attorney fee. And reduce time on desk.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
mark sweet: And so far this year. Our average training fee is higher than what I want it to be, which is great.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000
mark sweet: The goal is 18,000. We've been on average. Like 19, plus almost 20,000 a month, or 20,000 in case which is huge.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:05.000
mark sweet: If we can keep that going. Are you still there? Okay.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I was writing it down. Sorry. Um! I feel like I thought I thought you could hear the clicking on my.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:22.000
mark sweet: Yeah, so. No, no, no, no! Like our lowest month was 18 9, 9, 7, our highest month, and an average of 24,000, and the number of cases relatively the same. So we're averaging well over $20,000 a month, or 20,000. Sorry, not a month, $20,000 a case.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.000
mark sweet: Which again fantastic. So the goal is, how can we make sure that that continues on.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
mark sweet: Because if we can add an extra. Literally at this pace. $5,000 per case.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
mark sweet: Even over, you know the 100 cases, although that's not how many are. Finishing out every month, even if it's over 80.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah, 5,000 times 80 is, how much? 440,000.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, uh 5 times, 8, yeah. Um, okay, so.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Tina Marie: Focusing, then then.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
mark sweet: That's $400,000 difference like that's huge.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
mark sweet: Just unto itself, um.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Tina Marie: All the more reason like if you spent all of your little extra time of like, I don't know what I could do. Go, listen and take calls. Go, coach your intake team.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Tina Marie: Just keep working with them, because that's going to be huge. And then the other thing is making sure your attorneys are getting everything on the table. That second voice is huge. So.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Tina Marie: Is there anybody who is not using second voice as often as they should.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
mark sweet: Welcome!

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
mark sweet: Samantha.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, and um. I want to go back and solidify, because oh, wait! It didn't get updated.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
mark sweet: Lorez is pretty open about it. I mean, he's seen it. It's worked.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:52.000
mark sweet: Um, Tyler doesn't have a huge ego about it. It's just timeframe wise Patrick knows he doesn't know everything, so he doesn't have a problem with it, either.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Tina Marie: Well, and Lorenz has learned that he gets paid more still if if somebody get voices so.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It literally doesn't cost you anything.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Tina Marie: Oh, not only does it not cost you anything it gets you paid more like everybody should want to do this. Um. Let me share my screen real quick.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Tina Marie: Sure. Um if John.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Tina Marie: And I will. Just so, you know. I know I'm swapping topics, but. Do what I can to.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Tina Marie: Still move things forward. It'll just not be on a scheduled call. I'll still be working. I'm just not committing to. Calendar dates other than.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
mark sweet: Oh, no! I get it!

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Tina Marie: Thursday. Okay, but I get to go to Phoenix. I got a house with a huge pool. It's private, just.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
mark sweet: Hey, Phoenix.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tina Marie: Sunshine and water.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
mark sweet: There you go!

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Tina Marie: That's what I need. Okay. Um. Okay. So I was looking at this, and I sent you a message about it. But Lorenz said, This can't be right.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Tina Marie: Cause. He 1st of all, all, the um. Sub outs you guys get approvals for. And anything that was this is what I don't know is, what is this other.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Tina Marie: So this is for the quarter, this quarter.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
mark sweet: I don't know whether it would be in.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Tina Marie: Um.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
mark sweet: Oh, the uh I do want to do one with the other. Uh referred out.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:25.000
mark sweet: Which are very, very, very few cases that's usually in litigation where we refer to like a punish or someone else. And that's not very many cases.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so this is wrong. But I'm looking at it. So this is a thing that I need to talk to Josh about.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
mark sweet: Can you expand that one? Because I wonder what they're including in other. Posting into it.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Expand it like click on it, mhm.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
mark sweet: Uh, yeah. And then if we go into edit.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Tina Marie: You want to filter. Drops of that.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
mark sweet: Cause my team drops about. Do you see what I mean? Where he's got the drops about part? Um, but I don't know.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, this.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:04.000
mark sweet: Yeah, because it's including like close cases which doesn't make sense. Um. I don't know if we can dig into that without killing it.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:17.000
mark sweet: I guess it won't matter as long as we don't save it. If you double, click it. Hmm.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Tina Marie: Unbucketed values.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
mark sweet: So the unbucket values everything else like it's close cases and whatnot. So it doesn't make sense. Why, that would be included in that.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. These aren't checked.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
mark sweet: Right, and there's nothing checked in there. So go back real quick.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
mark sweet: Like just hit, cancel, and hit, run.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Tina Marie: To.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
mark sweet: Not saving, but just run, just in case we screwed anything up.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Tina Marie: I know I wasn't good like. No, Nancy.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
mark sweet: Um, because. See this other sets. We have close, close negotiations close. Those are just the cases that he's working on.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
mark sweet: They're not subbed out in any way, shape or form, so. Someone didn't build this right.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Tina Marie: That would be Josh or Isaac, I guess.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah, so, Justin, I don't know who built it. But this is not right.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay, alright. So. Uh.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
mark sweet: If we go, we could probably fix it. If we need to.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Tina Marie: Oops! Sorry.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.000
mark sweet: Are we going to edit. Cause. I think it's probably trying to show how many sub outs versus their Caseload.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:36.000
mark sweet: Um, cause we're going to filters. If we add, add filter.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Tina Marie: This.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
mark sweet: No, no, that's fine. It just means like.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
mark sweet: And then we added in status.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
mark sweet: So case status up on top.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Tina Marie: Just that.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
mark sweet: Yeah. And then we pick.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
mark sweet: Sub out or drop, so equals.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Tina Marie: Oh, sorry! Ah! Crack! Sorry status.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
mark sweet: It's okay.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Tina Marie: Key status um. Sub.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Tina Marie: Out!

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
mark sweet: And then go back and. Also, add drop.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Tina Marie: So do I apply, or.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
mark sweet: No no no just go delete delete delete. And then hit, drop or type in, drop.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
mark sweet: And then check that, and now hit. Apply.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
mark sweet: And now hit, run.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Tina Marie: Um, can I look at this? Wait where? Where? Okay, there it is. Case status. Run.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
mark sweet: Cause we can always save and run it later. But.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Tina Marie: Right no results.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:44.000
mark sweet: Ah, that didn't work. Okay. Go back in the filters.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
mark sweet: Back in the case status.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Tina Marie: Uh do what.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:06.000
mark sweet: The 3rd one from the bottom, not 3rd one from the bottom, the one we just made. Up, up, up! There you go!

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Tina Marie: Oh, sorry! Delete it, or.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000
mark sweet: Uh no, just click it. On the operator and take out equals.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Operator equals, okay.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:40.000
mark sweet: No, it's not gonna do it. Damn. Oh, I know why, this is really stupid reason. Uh, it's not case status. It's just status.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
mark sweet: So the last thing on the bottom. And then we're gonna have to select.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
mark sweet: It's about drop.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And now run!

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Huh!

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
mark sweet: Not sure but it's definitely clean things they shouldn't be including. So it's probably a Josh question. Or has a question.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay? Or Josh's boy.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
mark sweet: Or Josh's boy, but that's not giving you accurate. Helpful information.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I didn't mean to stop sharing actually hold on. Um. Okay, so let's go back to.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Tina Marie: This. Gross attorney, fees.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Tina Marie: Where's the average. Attorney, fee by team.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Tina Marie: This is. This quarter 3 days ago.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Tina Marie: Can refresh it, but.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.000
mark sweet: Cause. We've only had like 2 sub outs this year. So far, so not a lot. We have had. More than that in jobs.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Tina Marie: Once about Sam. Once sub out for Patrick.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Tina Marie: No subbed out, but it shows purple. That's weird. Oh, yeah, there it is. Once about.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Tina Marie: So. That's 3 sub outs.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Tina Marie: For this quarter. Um! How does this look to you? Gross attorney fees.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Tina Marie: Average attorney fees. In terms of accuracy.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
mark sweet: Sorry, can you scroll? I don't know what dates these are over.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Tina Marie: This is this quarter.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
mark sweet: Okay, so this year, basically.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
mark sweet: Um. Which one you want me to look over.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Tina Marie: Average fee.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000
mark sweet: Um. I don't track it by person well enough, but it looks. The gross attorney fee is gonna be off.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
mark sweet: Um. Cases close, looks about right resolutions, looks roughly right.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Tina Marie: Come in! One. Sec. Mark. Sorry.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Tina Marie: And sit down. You go go drop Wyatt off muffin. Okay, say his name, and then I'll be right.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Tina Marie: Okay, Babe. Thank you. Bye. Uh sorry. What'd you say?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
mark sweet: Um close by teams. Looks a. About right.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Tina Marie: So one of the things I keep looking at with Lorenz. This. This fluctuates a lot, so I always go and look at it like last year, and then, year before.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah, because there's 1 or 2 cases that can take forever. And just. Throws everything way off.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Tina Marie: And the numbers update as soon as the case closes. So if it's been open for 2 years. And it was really long, and it was before we started working together, and they were doing a better job.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Tina Marie: Then it just totally messes up his stats, so. It's hard to be able to figure that out.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Tina Marie: Um like this is crazy. That. Can't be right.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Tina Marie: Oh, wait! Litigation! Right? This is litigation.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah, litigation, that that. That I take out of the equation. Um, because litigation is the zone.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
mark sweet: Beast.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. All right.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Tina Marie: And this was something that I was trying to get Josh to work on.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
mark sweet: Yeah, the 44 cents stuff.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Tina Marie: Alright. Well, I don't have any.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:49.000
mark sweet: I mean, we're making good progress. Everything's moving the way it should. Uh, which is good. I just gotta. Keep pushing it the way that we're pushing it. But I mean, it's it's working. The new intake person will definitely help.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:58.000
mark sweet: Um. The new space should be ready by the end of April, so that'll also help. Give us a little more room and bring everyone back together, so that'll be nice.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
mark sweet: And yeah.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Tina Marie: Good, and. How are you feeling like this? Is not a normal time? So asking these questions.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Tina Marie: Is not super like indicative of where we're going.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
mark sweet: Are you talking about physically, or with the company, or what.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Tina Marie: Well, both. Okay. So it was. What I was gonna be asking is, how much time are you working? Where do you want to be going, but you're kind of stuck in this limbo with your back a little bit.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:37.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know it's annoying as shit. Um. It's just it. It's gonna be what's gonna be. And I've gotta really wait till.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:54.000
mark sweet: Mid April until I can get another. Mr. I see where it's going, and it's like, you know, there's flare ups and on, flare ups and like, I'm just trying to be overly careful. But it's definitely hindering me from doing a lot of things that I want to go and do. Um, which is super frustrating for me, because it's not how I generally am.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:05.000
mark sweet: But it is what it is, and I've got to take it seriously. Otherwise, you know, if I'm the new surgery after you surgery, it's not the end of the world. It's just not what I would. Like to do um.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Tina Marie: Well, it's something to take into account, though, is when we're forced to operate differently. We have a tendency. Well, we have an opportunity, not a tendency. To find out.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Tina Marie: What really has to be done, and doesn't have to be done. For example, you know all the traveling and going and meeting doctors. Now, there's also kind of like a ripple effect for better or for worse. Right? So things don't.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Tina Marie: Necessarily have an immediate um. Result where you can say that this is different, but.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Tina Marie: I'll give you an example. The whole world shut down during Covid right? And then we figured out all these things that were possible from home.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
mark sweet: Mhm. Right.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Tina Marie: So you know, kind of just think about. Is there anything that you.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Tina Marie: There's 2 aspects to why you do what you do right. There's the. It's necessary because it makes money, and we need to make money. Or it's useful, and I like it.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Tina Marie: Where it's necessary, and you like it. But kind of categorizing. The things that you do want to do can't do.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Tina Marie: Have done just kind of. What I would love. It is if you just write down some of the things like.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Tina Marie: You feel frustrated because you can't do that. But what? Why do you want to do it? Because you enjoy it? Because. This is the specific result that you anticipate getting out of it. That type of thing.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Tina Marie: And just kind of evaluating. Where your time goes and also where it will go. So the other thing I'm anticipating is.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Tina Marie: Maybe a drop in. The way that you're managing things. Once you feel once you're safe and you can travel and do things, are you gonna just kind of.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Tina Marie: Need to go. Make up for our lost time, and take your eye off of this for a little while, and. If so.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:11.000
mark sweet: Well, like with Colorado, right where we're launching it. Traditionally, it's okay. I need to go visit. Probably, you know, once a month, or once every other month to go start meeting some of these doctors making the connections because it's.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
mark sweet: Kind of physically need to go do in some of these new States.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Tina Marie: Gotcha.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:22.000
mark sweet: Um, which again, it's not a terribly far flight. So I should be okay to do it. But uh.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
mark sweet: I think it'll be okay.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I'm sure it'll be okay. What I'm wondering is like, so if we were anticipating you, wanting to just. Not do so much work for a while, because you can finally go do activities.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
mark sweet: I don't know everything. Kind of mixes with each other. The only like. Vacation ish and.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:50.000
mark sweet: Realistically, I can't go take a vacation well, kind of by myself. But you know, with Jonah realistically right now, while she's got her chaos going on.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
mark sweet: Because it just it. It won't work.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Tina Marie: Nope.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
mark sweet: Um, and so. My goal is end of the year. Do another like 2 week somewhere.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
mark sweet: It seems to work pretty well. Christmas is not super super busy.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:13.000
mark sweet: Um. So it makes sense. And that's really what I'm targeting. But. You know, beyond that like this week I got invited to go to Vegas to go do some stuff didn't go because didn't feel up to it.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:22.000
mark sweet: So things like that, you know. It's frustrating, but it's not the end of the world, and the way I look at it is, you know I'm looking for the next 2030 years, not the next 2030 days.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Tina Marie: Good. Um.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:33.000
mark sweet: And then sold one of my cars today because it just it was just sitting there wasn't using it didn't really enjoy it that much. And yeah.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Tina Marie: That's good. So just something else, especially now, to be thinking about. I asked you, what is your.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Tina Marie: Primary goal. And it was that, you know, thinking about mortality, that.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Tina Marie: When you, when you're when you leave right. You want to make sure everybody's taken care of. And the thing that I asked you was, What does it look like for.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Tina Marie: Everybody to be taken care of, and you gave me. A little bit of an answer, but we really didn't define it.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Tina Marie: In a way that was super clear, like. Um amounts of money or.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Tina Marie: Structure, or any of that, for. Specific people specific groups.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Tina Marie: And that specificity. Gives us our targets and our targets, gives us our.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Tina Marie: Path. There's always multiple paths, right? But of course, um. There'll be one that falls more into alignment with what we're already doing, and.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Tina Marie: Your values. So. Have you given any more thought to those specifics.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000
mark sweet: Some of them. Yeah, some of them know. I mean the overall, like money amounts and trying to make sure Jonah is taken care of is. A heavier President than everything else.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000
mark sweet: Um, although I can't get great answers out of her over what she expects, because probably I think she has no clue. What she actually needs.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:10.000
mark sweet: Um sad part is. Looking at where money goes, you know, historically, in terms of inflation.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:22.000
mark sweet: I I realistically needed to set aside in some form or fashion between, you know, life insurance and. Stocks, bonds, houses, you know, altogether probably 2025,000,000, which.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
mark sweet: It's not a small number.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Tina Marie: And also a trust and a trust manager to help protect her from.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
mark sweet: Herself. Yeah.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Tina Marie: Or decisions.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
mark sweet: That's extremely true.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Which means you don't need as much money if the trust um manager. Is also good at investing and making that money grow.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
mark sweet: I mean, it's a minimum of 10.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Tina Marie: Or. Yeah.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.000
mark sweet: Um, but it's probably closer to 2025. Um, but it's a minimum of 10, and that's. It. It's an achievable number, without a doubt. I mean, I'm.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
mark sweet: If you include the house, I'm more than half the way there. Like 60% of the way there, which is good.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
mark sweet: But you know.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Tina Marie: What about what happens to the company? If you have an you know, untimely demise.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
mark sweet: Um! It! It basically wraps up. And that's the easiest way to do it.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So cause. And I'm asking, because you said you wanted to make sure, like everybody that works for you is taken care of. So what what does that mean when you say it wraps up.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Tina Marie: Just.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
mark sweet: Uh, you just work down the cases, basically.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Tina Marie: And then people are gone, and they go take care of themselves.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
mark sweet: Yeah, and they get bonus doubt like you give them retention bonuses or whatnot. But yeah.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay? And that's satisfactory to you. Right?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
mark sweet: It realistically, trying to control something from beyond the grave is.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
mark sweet: Unnecessarily complicated, and not. What I want to spend a lot of my time and energy on.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Tina Marie: And yeah, well, that's the the whole point of this is not to. Inject what I think is right or wrong, or whatever, because I have no idea.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Tina Marie: But just making sure that it's defined.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Tina Marie: So that you've got peace of mind, knowing that that the things that you do care about. Are taken care of, but if you haven't defined what that is.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Tina Marie: Then, you know, let's say you're sick and in the hospital, and it could go either way. The stress in you the conflict will be like, well, now you're going to start to try to define it. And now, if there's a gap between what you've defined now and and what there wasn't really specified then.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Tina Marie: And that can cause conflict, but. Anyway, it's just because.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Tina Marie: The growing, the business so. Some people like in the beginning you wanted to sell it.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Tina Marie: And so that's a specific type of path. That has to be done. And now we're more evolved into just.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
mark sweet: Yep.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Tina Marie: Not necessarily like. I'm sure you could be offers right. That kind of thing come up. But.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah. If the offer made sense, it's just.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Tina Marie: This is this is your world, these are your people. This is kind of your your kingdom. Um, which is a little bit different.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Tina Marie: Then then it felt like. Um in the beginning, like there's there. I think you enjoy this work more and.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Tina Marie: The people. And and what you're doing is that a fair assumption.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no. I mean, I like to be cool. I like. What we're doing, where we're growing, how we're doing things.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000
mark sweet: Um, without a doubt. But you know, at the end of the day this is still just a business.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
mark sweet: And if for some reason this business stops, or whatever happens. Um. There's gonna be something else out there.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:57.000
mark sweet: And yeah, I mean, no matter what I'm doing, I'm always going to be doing some form of work. I'm not a sit on the beach and read a book, kind of person.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's not about that. It's more about. Trying to figure out how much time should we consider diverting.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Tina Marie: Anywhere else. Um, so. Like.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
mark sweet: Unfortunately, a lot more of the time now spent on. Okay, what can we do to do tax mitigation strategies? What can we do to make sure.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000
mark sweet: This money that we're working so hard for is. Properly stretched as far as we can.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um well, but but then there's also.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Tina Marie: There's okay. So when I started asking this question, one of the things I was thinking about is. Is there is. Is this a time where we can start looking for.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Tina Marie: A real, actual kind of. Not not partner, but more right hand person. So.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Tina Marie: Mary's role. Has. I don't know if it's shrunk a little bit. There is a gap between what you do, what she does and other things that need to be done in the business.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Tina Marie: In terms of um training and efficiency. You, you have started to take over a lot of that. But it could be done by someone else if we paid for it. I don't know if you want to, but that's the that was. That's where my brain started to go right. But that's a it's a bigger investment financially.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Tina Marie: Um but what it could free up for you in time. If you wanted to go, say work on some other project, and it was about docs. So that's.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Tina Marie: It's really difficult to have a linear conversation about these tons of things that are popping up in my brain all at once. At the same time. But that was kind of the gist of it is, are you.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Tina Marie: Approaching a phase where you might want to start. Working on other things, and, if so like, in the next year, 2 years, 5 years, you know.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Tina Marie: What does that look like, and what would need to happen to give you enough time to really be able to. Participate in that? Or is it a project that you just start.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Tina Marie: Very slowly, and it grows as it grows. That kind of thing.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
mark sweet: It's gonna be one of those slow growth things.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
mark sweet: And yeah, more than anything, it's a tax play plus a passion play together.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well, they're good things, I mean.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000
mark sweet: So until that point, I gotta just grow this thing as big as I can, so we can support that. And we're on our way.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Tina Marie: Yes. That that gives me what I was looking for. So then, really.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Tina Marie: What I think you can do. Other than all the things we're doing, because I've got a stack of.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Tina Marie: Was this like? I don't know. 20 different. Kind of ongoing tasks.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Tina Marie: But it it really, really, really, really is intake. So, starting to be more strategic about it in your documentation. In your listening, in your coaching, and then measuring.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Tina Marie: The results of those efforts. As a really key focus.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Tina Marie: With consistent. Um and strategic effort.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Tina Marie: In a way that it's just never happened. There's been. Blips of, let's focus on intake.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Tina Marie: Um, but. To the point of getting more out of so a bigger return on your your effort, not just your money, but the time that goes into getting new leads.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Tina Marie: Right, and then. Also um.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
mark sweet: A lot of failure with it. Unfortunately.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But how much of that is also just kind of bled out, because intake doesn't know how to. Close a case and um, or just efficiently.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Tina Marie: Get a person to. Yes, we're signing up with you right now. Let's go. Kind of thing. I have no concept of that.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Tina Marie: Because I don't listen to them. Um. I don't even know what I would be listening for a little bit. Right. I can listen to a call and go. You're all over the place. That kind of thing.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Tina Marie: But for you to listen to it and know. Um, yeah, you could have said this. You should have done this, that type of thing. Anyway. Dead horse just beating it.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Tina Marie: You know what I'm getting at. But the. What I do like, though.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Tina Marie: And I think it's because of all these other things that you're doing. To take care of yourself.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't know what the. The what is the program that you're doing with the business consulting? And then.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Tina Marie: You're flying at. Plane simulator and ropes, course and all that.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Tina Marie: How long have you been in that.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:54.000
mark sweet: Not too long. Um. I met this guy through the Vegas guy that I know, and so his things not really about like.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
mark sweet: It's super different from what we're doing here. It's more like executive presence and things like that.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
mark sweet: So we're we're talking more about the business itself. Does that make sense.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Tina Marie: There, you're talking about the business itself.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:21.000
mark sweet: No, here we're talking more about the business itself, and like the nitty gritty there, we're talking more about like executive presence and some vision stuff, but more about.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:28.000
mark sweet: You know what are my natural tendencies versus. Where's my blindsides in terms of leadership type skills.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Tina Marie: Yes, things that we never get a chance to get into, that I do with pretty much everybody else. But that's okay.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000
mark sweet: So really, different. Okay.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Tina Marie: Because we've got. We've got this, and I can't do all of those things. It's not a like. Competing thing. But my point is that.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Tina Marie: You're evolving. You keep doing all of these other things like ropes, courses. And the 1st time I saw one. Was, wow.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Tina Marie: 33 years ago I was in Texas, anyway. The the trust. Um exercise the reliance, the leadership that like that's life changing stuff. And if you're doing it with.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Tina Marie: Other high level people. Um that could be really powerful. The the point of where this started was, you know, in the beginning.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Tina Marie: And joked, and called you Eeyore. You're evolving so much because of all these different things that you're doing all of the resources you're investing in. You had your counselor.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Tina Marie: You're doing this, you're constantly talking to people. And it.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Tina Marie: All of those things make an impact on. What's happening here. You have a pretty large organization that doesn't have.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Tina Marie: A. A lot of strategic.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Tina Marie: Confinement in the leadership, right.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Tina Marie: Um. You're not in the office a lot. You don't have somebody.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
mark sweet: No, I'm in the office a lot.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
mark sweet: I'm in the office a lot.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Tina Marie: Well, you weren't. You didn't used to be.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
mark sweet: No, I always was. Just unless I was traveling.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:17.000
mark sweet: But if days I'm not traveling, I mean I'm in the office usually by. 9 at the latest, maybe 10, if it's an off day, and then say that 6 or 7.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Tina Marie: 5 days a week.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
mark sweet: I feel weird if I go more than a couple of days without being in the office.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay? Well, that was my incorrect perception. Then.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, no. They see me in the office a lot.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Tina Marie: That's good. I think I I heard Dan say that Salko says that you're never there and never working. And that probably stuck in my head, listening to.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000
mark sweet: Oh, no! He listen to the joke because we're doing stupid things half the time like, take, you know, the attorneys out to lunch or something, and so he likes to give us crap for that.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Tina Marie: Well, morale boosting is pretty powerful, so.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
mark sweet: You know.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Tina Marie: But you know that I don't have to tell you that, anyway. Just the point is that um.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Tina Marie: Making sure that you're in a good place. Is not something I spend a lot of time on with. You do everywhere else.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Tina Marie: But because you're doing that in other ways. That that's the key. This none of this works. Well, if you're not in a good place. But you, you're doing that work.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Tina Marie: So that being said, then, then all we have left is these. These strategies, and then.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Tina Marie: If you get to a point where. You're looking at the time going. I don't want to spend so much time doing this, but I still need these results.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Tina Marie: Then that's when we talk about hiring somebody who can do. The. And it's not necessarily.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Tina Marie: One person for all the things.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I wish it was that easy. Um, never mind.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Tina Marie: Um right? It's generally not that. Right. So if we had, and and the other option is consultancy right rather than.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Tina Marie: Just, and a person who comes in. And works in house? Is it a consulting agency that comes in quarterly.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Tina Marie: And reviews your team and Um takes the feedback and says, Okay, this is what we can do with your intake team or. Whatever. Um, it just depends on.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all measurable return. Because we can. We can see the results of the work that we're doing is getting returns. But that's not necessarily.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Tina Marie: True of everything that that comes in. Um. Yeah. Anyway.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Tina Marie: Feel like my blood. Sugar is like crashing right now. My brain's going.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
mark sweet: That's not good.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Tina Marie: It's every freaking day. The only time it goes high is when I'm trying to.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Tina Marie: To undo it, going low. I really do need to get Hudson like what do you call it?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Tina Marie: Certified so he can tell me, because even with the continuous glucose monitor, it doesn't tell me, hey? You know you drops like 50 points in the last 10 min.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
mark sweet: Oh, you would think it would! That'd be nice for you to know.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Happens. Multiple times a day.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
mark sweet: Good. That's that's good.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's been really awesome trying to manage. And it's getting worse. Anyway. So yeah.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Tina Marie: Brain brain go bye bye um, but intake, intake, intake.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Tina Marie: Get more of that money and that closing. Um! Send me the notes. How do you track it? Is it a spreadsheet?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
mark sweet: Which thing.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Tina Marie: Notes. Um, you say when you listen to intake. Calls and then coach them. You said you took notes.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
mark sweet: Oh, just on like word.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay, yeah. So send me whatever you have. How long have you been doing that?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.000
mark sweet: Um, not like not let me think about. I've not been diligent on keeping to a schedule.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:57.000
mark sweet: Uh, it's been going on for a number of months. I don't have old ones. I probably I don't know why I didn't save them.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:05.000
mark sweet: Um. Because usually once you have the conversation, then it's just gone, like, I'm just kind of writing a stream of consciousness. We go listen to it. We go through it.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, okay, so let's get.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
mark sweet: So I need to start saving them or adding them into a specific place.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Tina Marie: We'll just create a folder and take, and you can, if it's something that you can share the whole folder so we can.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Tina Marie: However, you want to come uh track it but once I look at it, then um. Let me see if there's a way to organize it and structure it better that I can help create for you.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Tina Marie: And then we'll go from there, and I'm gonna go get some sugar.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
mark sweet: Okay, have fun.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay, take care. I will talk to you. Maybe later this week, depending on Shauna. But if not, then Monday.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
mark sweet: It better be okay. Bye.
