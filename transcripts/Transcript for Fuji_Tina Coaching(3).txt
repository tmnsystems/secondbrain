00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in the notes, I really didn't do anything on the homework front.
00:01:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did make a couple balls. I don't know if there was one. I don't know which one it was, but I tried to do your thing and I got to step two, which was I asked, hey, you have a second for me to ask questions? And they said, yeah. And then I asked them, you know, our listed questions. Like, oh, what difficulties do you have? You know, with doctors and, you know, what challenges do you face with their notes or getting my records? Interestingly, I found that my competitor named Elite Medical, they're pretty big at urgent care. They do what I do. But yeah, they're pretty on top of their game, all the cases I had to say. So when they responded to that question, they're like, well, we have this other urgent care that we use to a pretty efficient.
00:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like dang it?
00:01:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But the case manager, that haven't used my clinic yet, I reached out to like one or two. The conversations, you know, after I asked the question, they're like, oh yeah, know, sometimes it's hard to get the doctors to get us the note, sometimes it's hard to schedule. Then I was trying to transition to closing them, so I'd say, well, hey, can I explain what my clinic does? And they're like, yeah, And then so I kind of reiterate like the points that they brought up like, oh yeah, you know, it's frustrating to get the notes. But I haven't really gotten any new business from them yet, so I think I have to keep working on my clothes, how to close people.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the assignments was for you to record 10 of those calls.
00:02:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, I did not do that. I recorded two, I think.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's some things. Do you want to send those over to me to analyze?
00:02:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, let's see. Okay, well, honestly, I haven't listened to these recordings, but I'm just... All right, they're supposed to be recorded. Cool. To my clinic? Oh, yeah. Yeah, three hits, I'm just following up to see how we can improve, what is behind your experience, what is my schedule here? Okay, on the phone. Yeah. Well, good. Everything's available. Thank you. Oh, please. trying again. Yeah, perfect. can't it. Yeah. Oh, I have more people. Oh, yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's awesome. it's awesome. I'll send you a follow-up email. Yeah, they're fine. Alright, cool.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Alright, I will send these to you. Okay.
00:04:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How do I share this? Do I just do it to your text maybe? Oh, yeah. Okay, here it is.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did you record them?
00:04:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Uh, I started paying $8 a month for this call record service on my iPhone. And it's like adding a call. Have you added a call? Oh, yeah.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the call recorder app. It looks like a record button, basically, a big red circle.
00:04:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, how much is yours?
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mine's $7 a month. Um, I haven't used it for a while. It's probably something like that. Like $6.99.
00:04:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Okay.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, does it have a transcription option?
00:04:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you send me the transcription also?
00:04:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. So. I'm not tape a call, that's what I used tape a call tape a call Mine is just called call recorder.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I say with a green icon.
00:05:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah Okay, so this didn't even record and there's nothing here Okay, so maybe that didn't work I Honestly didn't even check to see if this is here. Okay. Well, I'll try sending it to you. Oh That's why yeah, he hung up on me. Okay.
00:05:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on you.
00:05:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh Yeah, she is like, okay No, they said I'm having phone trouble. Can I call you back? Okay, all right, well, I guess I only have that one not three. Oh, yeah, this week was my QME week. So I didn't have any days. Today's my first kind of day. I didn't have work. So after this call with you, I will, I'm gonna, I will do my 10 calls.
00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I will move this to the notes in real time. Let's see.
00:06:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Maybe I'll just do all figure I'll do my homework. The other homework I'm supposed to do is I have to talk to my manager Paul and figure out a way how we can get the the monthly data for him to give it to me weekly because we want to start tracking it by week, I think.
00:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:06:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so I will do that after this call. I will actually do it. My hesitancy, I think I voiced this last time was that like, um, I just don't know if one week is too quick in our cycle because each week you. with how many referrals we get. But maybe that's just an irrational fear until I have the numbers.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My explanation is the more data points we have, the better we are at figuring out what kind of patterns there might be. And because we don't know what we don't know, the more data points will. Maybe we find that it's not helpful, but if we do it for two to three months, we can figure that out. But to assume that it's not helpful is not a good practice.
00:07:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So maybe I'll have Paul do this on Friday. So I don't want to disturb Paul's work on Monday because that's when we have like a flood of emails that I want him to go through in the morning. So maybe I'll have him do this on like Friday. Yeah. little wrapping up, they're slower. The case managers don't send us much on Friday.
00:07:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:07:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so I'll have him try to send me a Friday update each week.
00:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would really like to commit to doing this at least through the end of February.
00:08:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so we'll at least do it for two months. I'll tell Paul at least two months. Not helpful. I told him like a monthly ones are just extremely helpful. So he knows and he's been doing those for us.
00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that what it's going to do is help us be able to just kind of drill down a little bit into nuances that we might not notice. That's generally what happens. So I don't imagine the time is wasted and something will reveal itself what it is. And generally, even if all it is, it helps us ask a question we haven't asked before, then it's worth the effort.
00:08:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. And then the other thing I was supposed to talk to Paul about doing is figure it out which case managers we've sent lunch on the date that we sent them lunch. And then we wanted to figure out if we could, if there was a bump in the number of referrals they've sent us. Yeah, so what I guess I'll have him also do is yeah We'll just create just a simple spreadsheet of the people we sent lunches to and the date that we sent them and then just ask him That hey, how many referrals have they sent us? I don't know how you keep track because it needs to be kind of a rolling list.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe just track it by week or something Yeah, I would do it weekly For the same reason because we we just want to see so if we track it weekly Then we'll find out is there an immediate uptick or the month so my my Promise is that it will have an immediate uptick and then it will Atrophy kind of and until like the next time and it's just human nature. It's top of mind You want to be top of mind, but when you're a top of mind in a good way like hey, they get me food Oh, yeah, here's a case would be perfect for Fuji boom send it over Right, so I'm gonna send you this homework And since we're two weeks in, I think you need to commit to at least two of them accountability wise because accountability wise, like we've kind of been slacking off the last couple months. And I'll put this in perspective though, you moved, there was sickness, there was all kinds of things. So it really needs to be how you feel about your accountability. Do you feel like you've just been making life adjustments and you're satisfied with how things have been going? Or do you feel like you have let yourself make any excuses?
00:10:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I think it's the excuses. After Emmy goes to sleep at eight o'clock at night, I definitely have like an hour or two where I just hang out or with Esther, we're just talking. So that's time in the day that I really could be working like an extra hour.
00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so do you and Esther have time together other than that time, just you two?
00:10:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, on other weeks, but like this week, I've been gone. like 730, I leave about 730 on the weeks I work and then as soon as my QMEs are done, pick up Emmy from school, take her to, you know, practice. And then so when I get home, I get home for about five, we eat with her, I give her a bath, and then put her to sleep by eight. So not really, you know, like today we had a, today I didn't have any work, so Esther and I went out to lunch. So I took her, we went to have a lunch together.
00:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe tonight would be a good night, but generally speaking, I would say, just because you can doesn't mean you should. And I don't think because having an hour a day together as a couple is probably really healthy and really good. It's really good for stress levels. the thing is, when you manage your relationships, your stress, your sleep, your energy will all be improved. And so your productivity for the other hours that you work will be increased. in pacing in life is really, really important. There's no such thing as like perfect balance. some perfect harmony. Meaning like, I think when people say that, they think that like, you know, everything gets done equally well all the time. And that's not it. It's something gets done really, really, really well. And everything else kind of goes to crap. And then, you know, something else gets done really well. Like that's what the rail balance is. It's like, you're spinning all these plates and ones going really fast and other ones are losing momentum. And then you tap the other one and so on.
00:12:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, um, I guess that, you know, like I've been listening to like, you know, when I, when I'm driving to work, like this week, every week I'm driving to work, I'm like listening to like a YouTube video or a podcast. And like one of them, the people were saying like, try to get under interrupt the time to work every day, even if it means getting up early. So, I was thinking like, I probably could get up, you know, like five, 30 or so, you know, and then get two hours of working at seven, 30, I wake up, get Emmy up, theater, then I leave for work. So, I was trying to figure out if there's like a way I could. do that where I wake up like five, essentially go to bed, make sure I look at the eight hours of sleep somehow, right? So it's like, I'd have to go to sleep that I can't math now. I'd have to go to sleep like nine or 10, yeah, get up about five, 30, but then I would have two hours and like the little stuff like this, like, you know, constantly, know, emailing Paul, telling them exactly what I want to do per week, setting up a spreadsheet that we could track casemers, all these like little tasks, you know, if I had an extra two hours a day, I could probably get those, you know, nailed in.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's understanding your rhythm. So like for me, planning, I do better at night. I do solving better in the morning. So they're not necessarily the same kind of thing. So in the morning, like I want to learn and I want to build and create and at night, the planning is more like Okay, when I was building and creating today, what were the things that I realized, okay, I got to work on this, I got to work on that and kind of prioritize. And I'm much more aware of the energy of the day because I just went through it. so anyway, just planning activity seems to work better for me in the evening. So it's the types of tasks that you want to do and noticing when they work better. For sure, carving out those types of tasks. problem solving and creating is one kind of step for me. And the other one would just be planning. And that includes sending emails that, you know, plan with other people, any kind of elaborating types of conversations. I do in when my brain is not at its peak, but also not just complete fried so yeah usually after a little period of rest that's why evening is good because I've had a dinner I've usually had some game time with the girls or something or take one for a drive because I've got a my baby the baby the tiniest one is youngest one is she just got her permit okay we're driving a lot so but it's always something kind of like family related so I feel like I filled up the family cup and for me also because I get energy from that but everybody else is kind of in their own like unwind mode but you've got little ones so anyway just taking all those things to account and just kind of notice what do you feel feel pulled to most consistently at certain times a day what does your brain tend to work for and then what you do is you try to create times in those zones and in those areas that you can protect and it can be anywhere from 30 minutes I would say to about 90 depends some people do better into our blocks Um, but for me, my peaks are roughly 30 minutes to 90 minutes, depending on the intensity level or how much time I have, because what I don't do is start something I don't have time to finish. It drives me nuts. Um, I will go over and if I can't go over, then it then it causes me stress, uh, because I my my brain needs to close the loop. So, um, but some people can pick it up and drop it off. So recognizing those things about yourself and making sure that you set the target, not based off of what other people add of eyes, but what you notice is your rhythm. At about 90 minutes, I start to feel mentally fatigued. Even if I'm hanging out with friends, like last night we had a church kind of planning meeting for activities and I was having a great time and about 90 minutes in, I'm going, my brain is shutting down my ability to, you know, just feel relaxed in this and, and, and everything was starting to fade. By two hours, I was starting to get anxious and it does not matter what the activity is almost every time That's like almost an internal clock for me.
00:17:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That works Yeah, maybe after I get me to sleep I'll just really commit to doing maybe 30 minutes because You know part of it is I want to I need it. There's still tasks. have to do for the business like not Like working in the business because I have to check the notes That usually takes me about 20 20 minutes. So maybe what I'll just do is start working on those for 20 30 minutes You know finishing my those tasks for a July medical and then Seeing that there's a way that I could Yeah, find another couple hours, you know each or an hour a day to make the business building things like calling or things That'll you know actually drive Sales and revenue which is essentially just calling people.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:17:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah Yeah, it would be wonderful if I could get up like these people are talking about like get up at five o'clock or four o'clock and have a couple hundred of hours, but man, I'm awful in the mornings, but it's just a terrible cycle because I stay up at night and then I'm tired the next day and then I'm not on it and like I'm just terrible waking up in the morning.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so if you're not hearing these people talk about how great their family life is and how much quality time they're spending with their kids, and I'm very, really careful who you're modeling after. Because that's a very incomplete picture and it could be really seductive, but they would, they're, what is it that like cognitive dissonance too, they like want to be like, I'm good, I'm often in order for them to meet that true, they have to draw that picture when they talk about it because otherwise they're acknowledging the fact that this actually not really good. Because I can tell you how many people like have these kind of schedules, generally speaking, it's not very compatible with It's not compatible with young children. I've never seen anybody do it. That doesn't mean that there aren't exceptions. There's always exceptions, but not when somebody went against their own internal clock so strongly really, really have to prioritize your own internal rhythm. It just is what it is. Like we can want it to be a particular thing as much as, but you, how old are you? not a your body is really, it's it. It's what you live in. Now we can train ourselves to a certain extent, but at what cost? So let's look at professional athletes. Well, let's look at, are you a runner?
00:19:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You run, right? No.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so, almost every person I know that was a runner in high school has had a hip surgery replacement by now and a replacement by now. And so there's a there's a cost. There's there's a lot of things that they do really great. But there's also a correlation between fast twitch and slow twitch people. So the sprinters, generally speaking, they are more like ADHD people. They don't have a long attention span. They can't sit still for a long time and but they're also great sprinters and muscle builders and slow twitch fiber people. Like you actually look at their tissues, right? Slow twitch fibers, more more twitch than fast twitch is what they're comprised of. And they tend to be runners, marathoners, able to sit for long periods of times, oftentimes their teachers. There's a real correlation between the way that we work operationally, mentally, energetically, and our physical composition down to the type of tissue we have. Isn't that fascinating? You can't control it. You cannot go control your physical makeup. So yes, we can work with what we have and we can train ourselves to a certain extent, but sometimes that training comes at a cost that you can't even anticipate. So that's where intuition and really paying attention to trade offs makes the most sense. You are not always going to have little children. This is a very short, relatively speaking season in your life. know, depending on how long you live, maybe it's one eighth of your life to have small children. Maybe it's one sixth, maybe it's one seventh, but even still, it's a fraction of a time and I think you're doing a great job, but you're also growing your business. Like we just did your numbers last week. You guys did your numbers, we looked at it, right? And the growth that you had is amazing, but you've been doing that. at while also getting your dream house, you've got two kids, you take M-A-T-G-Gitsu, the kind of relationship that you have and the kind of time you spend with her is not average for fathers. So I think that you're doing exceptional across all fronts and that's not to pacify or to tell you you shouldn't work any hard or whatever, but what you should do is always look at what are the trade-offs. If you try to get up in the morning and force your brain to do things, you're going to find that you're going to have to make it up by napping at some point during the day or you're going to be grumpier and eventually sucking your cognitive function the rest of the day will suffer, almost guaranteed, your body needs what it needs. you can try it, but pay attention to what it costs you and if your gain is worth it.
00:23:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
the cost. That's fair. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, that's very fair. We started taking Emmy to swimming lessons. that's another day on Tuesday. So now Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, we're going to be my two two 30 to eight o'clock is spent with Emmy.
00:23:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But her self confidence and her autonomy is going to in her sense of industry is going to be so strong and so powerful because she's doing things that scare people for sure. For sure. Even even maybe not necessarily compared to other people, although I'm sure it will be. But there's no way those skills don't improve what she is because she's overcoming like her body. She's she's doing things that scare a lot of people. And and she's getting quality time with you like all of those things. There is no replacement for it. There's no success out of the home that can make up for failure in the home.
00:24:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair, that is fair.
00:24:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, you play around with things, but what I would do is try to find little chunks, like start with a particular type of activity that you feel like you should be doing more often.
00:24:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All in people.
00:24:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out the minimum time block that you could do something effectively, whether it's 10 to 30 minutes, right? And then carve that out and then make that a consistent part of your routine. And then what you can do is either trade that block out with another activity you want to do consistently, and you rotate between the two types of activities, maintaining the same block and rhythm, or you add an additional block and you rotate it in, and maybe it's a daily thing. Maybe it's a weekly thing. Maybe it's a bi-weekly thing, but all all that you do Fuji is one thing and you bring it into your routine consistently so that it now just becomes part of your habit. And then you make a new tiny habit.
00:25:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I like that. I think I could live with like a 30 minute July block. Grammy goes to sleep. That wouldn't be too disruptive to me in Esther's time, you know, because she's putting Mari down usually about eight o'clock too. So that 30 minutes.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One thing though is this is the great thing about it is when you're doing it consistently and you know you are, it makes it easy to make occasional exceptions. So let's say you guys really just want to watch a movie. movie came out and you need 90 minutes, but you want to keep your sleep schedule pretty well and the girls were able to go down easily. And so you're just like, you know what, July tonight, just you and me babe, let's just cuddle and watch the movie, right? Or maybe it's tonight and the girls need extra time and you don't really get any time together. But Esther's like, you know, I just need some alone time like just me just I want to go be in the bath or something Like you know what? I'll do some July stuff so There there will be times when it just doesn't work out But and that's the great thing about it is when you have it consistently you can be like I can afford not to do tonight You know or Whatever does that make sense?
00:26:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's fair. like that. I do like routines if I can establish one so yeah Let's look quick 30-minute clock That should be that should be that should be pretty straightforward to add and yeah Yeah, and yeah, there's some nights that I yeah if I don't do the July stuff Then I'm like that should I'm behind on my notes my team can't send out the reports now.
00:26:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can't bill out the reports though Oh and one more modification for that is so let's say And and this works out pretty well for me. I don't really track the time religiously, but just kind of the productivity and and more the consistency week over week, but let's say, you know, there's a couple of days I don't do anything then generally on the third day I'm going to be like, you know what deep dive I'm going go catch up and do some stuff because then it takes that monkey off my back I don't feel stressed out about it and I get reenergized for the next day because I meet up for it now it's not because I like I've obsessed with a certain thing right so it's all um more about what I'm aware of and what I know that I need to do so you can kind of add that into it so the routine is specific types of activities get done on a daily weekly monthly basis yeah what is not specified is the start time and the end time and the detail of everything that's in there so because you just have to allow for the the humanity yeah I mean that's what that if I said I wanted to commit with you the 10
00:28:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
calls a week, was like, that should be attainable for me. And like, I haven't even been upholding that, the frustrating to me because like, I hear what you're saying. And that's why I think I committed, I wanted to commit to 10 calls a week because I was like, I could do that 10, know, take me, you know, two minutes, there are six minutes to call if someone answers, usually people don't.
00:28:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
do you think it didn't happen? Because you started, I mean, you could do 10 calls like all in one sitting.
00:28:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, like, when I'm when I'm when I'm sitting there and like, I have like a couple minutes to to make a call, sometimes like, I just, I don't know who to call. And so I know that when I have to pick someone call, I have to go to my email, I have to look through the last referrals, I have to see, oh, yeah, this guy wasn't. And then I have to put their name into HubSpot.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:28:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What I think I was actually making Paul and I share that HubSpot and then asking here, because sometimes Almost say, hey, food, can you call this case manager? They want to talk to you and I'm like, oh, yeah. So then when I have time, I just go like click and then I call them, right? It's easy. But then the other thing is like I know that with like what I'm trying to do with 10 is I want to record the call. I want to transcribe it. I want to put the message in HubSpot. So then when I only have a couple minutes and like, god, I got to find someone. got to do this. I got to put this into my thing like I just don't want to do it. And then I don't.
00:29:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a huge part of why we organize data the way that we do. And what I've been talking about like mental lag time in between different types of things. So the best thing for you to do is create a system that is prep work. And it is identifying, like you just said, those people ahead of time.
00:29:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So you just immediately know who you're going to and why you're going to.
00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then so you rotate between prep work and then call it because there are two different modalities. You could probably do the organization work multiple times during the day. to be late at night, first thing in the morning, all kinds of different times. Whereas you can only make those phone calls certain times a day. So you want to make sure prep work is always done so that whenever the time is is right and you've got the food, the energy and the opportunity, you've got stuff to go to.
00:30:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. What do you think about asking Paul? I don't want to keep loading things on a pause plate.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ask him how he's feeling. But look, the more valuable you can make him pay him. You know, if you want to compensate and be like, you know what?
00:30:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I'm here with ten.
00:30:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I told you I bought $2,000, Yeah. so look, it's hard for anybody to find a job that they really like to do, that they feel respected, that they feel challenged and they feel paid well. It sounds to me like Paul has that in you and that he was seeking it. So at the very least, you can just say, how are you feeling about this stuff?
00:30:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm really leaning on you and I think you can handle it. But how do you feel about it? That's for. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Don't don't let assumptions and fears Prevent you from doing things find out the truth.
00:31:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes. I like that. I am very straightforward So yeah, that's that should I should have no trouble with that Well, the other thing is you want to work with people who are compatible with who you are So you need straight for people and the only way to know if they're that is to test them be like What's up, you know?
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, because then you have potentially a long-term Situation and most people with employee mindsets want to stay employees Even if they want to grow and they want to evolve and they want to be challenged You still don't want to do that in their own business. Most people don't want the risk. They don't want the responsibility They don't want the accountability. They just want a steady thing They can show up for and turn off at the end of the day. That is what people I not that person. You're not that person, but a lot of people and thankfully, right, blessedly, there are plenty of them because we can hire them.
00:32:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
right.
00:32:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really, we can go over anything that you would like to, but we need to stay focused.
00:32:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It isn't about the power.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it is to me, if you have something you want to go over, I would rather you spend the time on the work that needs to be done. So we can do some of these tasks together.
00:32:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, just I do want to talk about the other couple of things. So if we pull up our, that spreadsheet that you had me make.
00:32:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one to world them all or?
00:32:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, the Fuji goals plus schedule we made. So that local infusion, I started breaking it up because remember the recruitment column was, it was like, it was all lumped together.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
this recruitment number. I started in November, column L, I started breaking the recruitment up into these component parts, which is truly recruitment, which is, yeah, I make about 20,000 a month from that.
00:33:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Then I found out that this medical director role where I signed charts that was accidentally put in the recruitment. Other services like when I do reports for Med Legal, so I just got to this other service. But this 7,000 is what I want to talk about. So I will be seeing four nurse practitioners in a clinic in Connecticut that infuses IVs, like people have cancer medications, or they have musculoskeletal like MS, they basically come in and we infuse them, we infuse the drug. And they're seen about 700 patients a month, which means that at 7,000, I didn't hate 7,000, but I'm essentially making $10 a patient. And there's just a lot of risk inherent with overseeing NPs, like if one of them misses an allergy and we give the patient a medication, they're allergic to the patient dies. That's the way all the other income that I make can go away if I lose my license. And so I guess I wanted to talk through, is this even worth it? of course, I think everything there's there's a price. That's what kind of wanted to talk through.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how much time, how much time of month do you think you spend on that?
00:34:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have to review. So the rules and regulations are I have to review one chart for every 10 that the nurse does. So each month it takes me like three hours, two hours, nine to two hours, maybe two hours to review the charts.
00:34:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it falls within your effective hourly rate, but the risk is multiplied how many times over?
00:35:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
700. Well, I don't know like a good.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's huge. So 700 patients that could potentially, you know, have something bad happen to them each other. So that that two to three hours, if you spent that time calling lead sources for July, you know, ultimately you could get that money back without the risk.
00:35:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:35:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It really is has to be a combination of looking at the risk factor and the earning factor.
00:35:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Effective hourly rate, it's right in there.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, what you might want to do is get some statistics on on issues, you know, and how many incidents happen here and what kind of incidents are there, what were the consequences and what are the odds that one of those happens to you with foreign MPs throughout the year across let's say five years. I would imagine that that's not a number that's worth this. And also because for you to grow it, that means you grow your risk factor also.
00:36:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's right.
00:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. It's not a it's not a proportionate. Well, it is a proportionate risk factor, but that's the issue, right? If you could grow more money without increasing the risk factor and somehow there's this tipping point that's just like perfect because you're making tons of money. risk has been reduced, but that's not a possibility.
00:36:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So as a medical director, I could hire a physician to only check the nurse practitioners. Like as a medical director, I can hire a sub-doctor to be the overseer.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But did that doctor then own accountability? Yeah. Liability? We'll see then.
00:36:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Then there's always a thing because technically as medical director, you're like the last butt. But yeah, of course, if it's a simple. Miss right then it falls on the doctor that missed it not the medical director because you know I set up the I set up the policies And if the doctor doesn't follow it, then that's their problem But right now I'm acting like the person. I'm my own police right I have to make sure that the nurses are Checking the boxes and certifying the patients Well, so that's $84,000 a year um That could potentially cost you millions Is something goes bad exactly that's what i'm talking about Yeah, I guess the other thing is like well how much like at some point it does become worth it right like at some pay level and We're just struggling to figure out like what that Pay is like I came up with Okay, so what took a job is like a an online doctor certifying biagra like It's a very simple job right like I give biagra out to men that job I know pays $20 and you know, there's a risk
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you give , makes all the blood risks, you could Right. Vascular issue.
00:38:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Vascular issue. Right. Stroke.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For stroke in men. Yeah.
00:38:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
uh, so that risk is rewarded on the free market. It's about $20 a visit. So I told Esther, you know, if I think if I was getting closer to $20 a visit, I think that's something where I'd be like, okay, now I am, I feel like I'm more fairly compensated for the risk. But $10 a patient doesn't seem worth it to me.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
taking like, if there was a way to even maybe combine those two, where you insert another doctor so that now you've got volume to offset his cost, but where you make sure that your policy is so airtight that the liability is almost 100% squarely on his shoulders. So now you've mitigated the risk and you're basically just taking a little off the top for connecting the dots that seems more ideal.
00:39:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. That's interesting. You know, I actually think I know what to do that.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And keep in mind that even doctors fall into the entrepreneur slash employee mindset people. Many, if not most, are going to be employee type people.
00:39:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure. Yeah. I've seen that with all my colleagues.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So taking that into account, they're gonna love a marketing genius who connects the dots for them and makes the income really easily and also has given them such a clear outline of liability because the odds are that maybe they're not very smart at making sure that they have good libel procedures, make sure that they've covered, know, that they've made sure that they operate in such a way that they don't get themselves in trouble. Because not all of that stuff is not in med school, right? Unless you get an amazing teacher who's like, watch out for this and that type of thing. And you get really lucky. That's not gonna happen. but you're looking at things strategically rather than textbook, there are going to be most of the doctors are textbook doctors. That's why I don't go to them because they don't think and they don't continue to study, they don't want the logic or reason. just employ people that want to show up, tick the box, go home.
00:40:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's most people period in any industry.
00:40:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't matter what it is. It's just that when we're younger, we think that there are people who earn certain amounts and choose certain careers that they're different because they got there, but the truth is most people just really aren't operating at that level. As long as you can make the numbers, so what I would do would be one line that is amount of patience and visits. One line spreadsheet that's amount that you earn per visit. One line that is maybe a risk percentage or something like that. Another would be what it would cost you to have somebody else do it. And what we're going to do is play with those numbers so we get to a point where having another doctor is still making you a significant amount of profit margin has completely almost completely eliminated your risk. And so all you have to do is basically fill the slots, fill the patients, the nurse practitioners, fill the the doctor and connect those dots for the amount of money that makes you feel like it's worth it.
00:41:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's fair.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's Business 101 to diversify and also you are young so it's being able to make this leverage this young in life. And you want to be able to make as much money as you can as early as possible. because you're not guaranteed, you know, cognitive function throughout your life, body, stress, anxiety, all these things, anything could happen. So you want to maximize your earning potential now within the realm of you only have little children for one little season in life, you know, and balancing it out. So leveraging other people's skills and taking maybe smaller profit margins, but also higher effective hourly rates, like that should be your ideal target with everything.
00:42:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That makes sense. Yeah, like a risk-adjusted reward.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Absolutely. So if we can drop the risk down to like 5% and the profit margin is only 5% but you don't do hardly anything, everybody else is taking care of it and it's 5% of a million dollars a year or 5% of 2 million dollars or 10 million dollars then, know, numbers, who would turn that away, why would you turn that away?
00:43:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. That's fair. Yeah. I think the problem with that, the medical director role right now, like now that you bring it up, it's the fact that it doesn't, it doesn't proportionally increase or you don't have a proportional increase when the patients clean it up. Like if that number went up to a thousand patients a month, there's no, nothing built into my contract that would kick me out to 10,000 or a thousand, the 10,000, right? My contract's just 7,000 a month.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it possible to create a tiered contract?
00:43:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So give you an example. Anything's possible. I just, I would need to know how to, yeah, essentially how to write it. That's why I came up with the $20 number. I thought, okay, well, how about if I just $20 a patient?
00:43:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And here's your pitch to it. So we do this in affiliate marketing and I have a multi tiered affiliate program. I want to reward the people that bring me the most business consistent. That your nurse practitioners are supported and they're overseen by an excellent doctor You know, this is what I bring to the table, but when I add the volume I Want loyalty rewards, you know, I want an extra increase over this threshold Yes, or no, and if you say no, okay taking it to the next person.
00:45:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, think that's that's a reasonable way to come out. know the owner, right? That's that's who hired me to do this Yeah, I think I think it's fair and I don't the percentage I just don't know if he would be willing to do that anyway But you know a price fixed on a per patient You know as he grows right if he wants to keep everything stable and I do a pretty good I don't assault a job right so if you wants to keep it stable and not rock the boat then yeah The cost is just gonna go up proportionally to how many patients he's having me oversee And I think I think that's fair. Yeah, I mean the percentage would be a lot Is it right? Because the more revenue they make, the more I make, but I don't know if that I could ask her to ask.
00:46:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So just make sure that your language demonstrates the value and where it's not, it would cost him more to not have you keep serving him and going with him and taking care of everybody than it would to, you know, give you whether it's offsetting the, you know, the cost of hiring new people or it's just rewarding you for a volume. Either way, if you're having to earn a certain level of status by performing the way that you are, you know, it's just that's the nature of light period, it's performance rewards, right? You get high performers, if you want them to stay with you, you pay up.
00:46:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I wish I knew how much other medical directors get paid. I don't know, like, like I don't know the proportion number of patients they're seeing. for how much to gain pay, like, I just...
00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe who should do that research very well because it will change your confidence in your pitch and maybe you'll find out you're actually doing better than average, so, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep trying, but it can potentially give you something, you know, to add to your arsenal.
00:47:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, okay. I will look into that. think that's a good way to start, so I'll start there and make sure the pitch is kind of centered around, like, yeah, if you want to keep the band together and, you know, it's smooth as it has been. I've been in this medical room for like a year and a half now, it's smooth how I do it, but...
00:47:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and so if you're not asking more for the existing, you're only saying, look, I want to grow you, but it doesn't benefit me unless I get an increase also. So, this is my pitch to you, you know, we can maintain the status quo and just be satisfied with... That's where we could both grow and it's going to reward you, but I want to also get compensated a little bit more for my little bit more extra effort. But in terms of like, I could try to risk, right?
00:48:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because any doctor he hires is going to be wary of this risk.
00:48:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:48:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
could just frame it as, yeah, I want to be compensated for the extra risk. then it keeps moving.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm saying about, like, make sure the words that you use, like, don't want to go off half-cocked, which I know you wouldn't, but you want to make sure that you choose the most powerful words, right? And then in terms of all of these things, anytime you're making a pitch to anyone, you want to understand the market. Do the market research. what your competitors are doing. Know where you fall within that. Not just in what you're earning, but how you're performing. So when you found out that other doctor's offices are getting notes back pretty quickly and doing a good job, that's important to know. Because if you took the approach. and you came off kind of like arrogant about it, like, hey, I do a great job with notes. They'll like, yeah, everybody does. What's your point? Like, you just got deflated, you know? So you really need to know how you rank in the market and what the status quo is. So you can be like, I'm above that. What you get when you do business with me, but you really want to have something to match that against with data wise.
00:49:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like it. And the other one is it's not even a number on here because there's a number. I'm a medical director of the surgery center. I sold. So when I sold the surgery center, I agreed to take on the medical director role, you know, and then I've continued to be their medical director, but there's no pay for it. And I'm an hourly employee, right? So if they need me to check their, you know, their, their logs for surgical patients, they'll pay me, you know, $100 an hour or something. not much. But anyway, haven't even they haven't even had me do that like the last quarter. So my name is everywhere on the surgery. It's just all risk to me right because anyone that goes under surgery, I'm the medical director. They're not paying me hourly because they're not having me really do tasks except maybe once a quarter. So that's another role that I was going to have a talk with them and just be like look if you know I will be your medical director and keep you know keep all the policies and procedures under my name. But I want to I want to I want to flat rate not an hourly rate.
00:50:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:50:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay so I think it really would be you move me to figure out how much medical director to get paid.
00:50:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:50:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have no idea. Maybe I'll just give you a T and ask.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. If you get nothing else from me which it won't be but in the year that we're working together I would like it to be longer but in that year data data data data it does the selling for you. It tells you what you should be doing. It tells you you what you shouldn't be doing. It tells you how to do things better. So, you know, it's, it can always be annoying to go and set up yet another spreadsheet. But everything should create more leverage for you because it creates more clarity. And it helps you get the most leveraged, the highest earning potential out of all the things that you're doing.
00:51:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:51:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even when it's just, you know, researching what other people are getting paid, it's, it's all relative data. I can't wait for your December members to pop up in there, man. You like, for sure, break in that three million. What are the, I hope so, you know, you will, you can't like, you have to make 55,000 not quite to get over that. So, That's happening folks.
00:52:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I hope so.
00:52:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, Vodie Yes, it will but let's see how far you can get past it.
00:52:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's what you can you can be both Yeah, so um what would be really awesome as if you got this number that you did this for 2023 I know I I I was thinking about how I could get the 2023 numbers. I literally have no idea I will but I guess I can go back through my my bank statement That was I was thinking I could do like the monthlies on that Yeah, it might be interesting to see it.
00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it will it will I think it will massively energize you Okay, it will also give you an idea about what your pace was and how it evolved Which will help us to set some More realistic targets for next year while still being like really competitive, but probably bigger than what maybe you had before Uh, you should Like if you can get, I know you said Esther has a bookkeeper or something like that, somebody that helps you guys Just get whatever you can delegated ask for all the help that you can And then do what you have to do separately, but you really really I think you would be really happy If you did that activity once it's done. I think you'll hate doing it.
00:53:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But once it's done, I think I'm really glad Yeah, that's fair So here's uh, I'm sorry to cut you up Here's what chat GPT said it's like they pulled it from zip recruiter I don't know what this company is. What is this? Oh, nurse practitioner salary. Oh medical director salary. Okay Good job. Chatsuvidi. Anyway, they're so they're saying the surgery center The median is 155 25th is 133 Um, you know, I know that the surgery center that I sold to them is really slow. They only operate twice a week So if I'm figuring like this is, you know 155 is five days a week. I mean
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're in that range.
00:54:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so you get paid 31,000. So I think if I ask for something like, you know, 5,000 a month, I think that would be fair for the risk. Because this, these numbers here for a full surgery center, but if you're only doing it twice a week, then, you know, one-fifth of this number or, you know, 20% of this, or I guess 40% of that number would probably be fair.
00:54:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, 5,000 a month, like, in November, you got 7,000.
00:54:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, there's two different companies. Oh, surgery, they're not even paying me anything. It's an hourly pay, and they haven't used me in this last quarter.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So you were just talking about that one. Okay. Yes. That's why I say, like, I want at least a base salary. Yes. Yes. Because, you know, like, probably next week, they're going to send me, Hey, these are all the surgeries we did. For the last quarter, can you double check them? then I check them for like two hours, right? And then they pay me, you know, $1,000, but it's really not worth to have my name on the surgery center, the rest of the quarter. It's just, yeah.
00:55:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would tell them that. I'd be like, here's my pitch, here's why? Take it or leave it?
00:55:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how much I should say is like maybe just say, hey, know, because it's, you know, I know you're only doing two days a week, but this is the median salary for a medical director of surgery center. So I want, you know, I went essentially 40% of that number, which is 60,000 a year, 5,000 a month.
00:55:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's fair. Yeah, yes, I do too.
00:55:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then for the other one, like they're kind of showing that it's right in this range, right? Because I was saying I want $20 a patient. Well, the chat GPT says essentially, most medical directors are getting paid about 27 a patient. So, you know, asking for 20, I don't think. is crazy either.
00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, why would you not like use this and try to go be a little bit more competitive or at least go for like, oh, yeah.
00:56:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. then be like, okay, I'll take 20 instead.
00:56:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Now, say with the average is about 30, but I, you know, I'll do 25.
00:56:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, good point.
00:56:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like why let them try to negotiate you down to 20? Yeah. but then I would say, you know, okay, well, we'll work with that, but I might be, you know, looking for other people, but I don't know. You have to, you have to figure it out. Like you have to know how much you want to play in the negotiation game. One of the reasons I don't, I don't negotiate hard period. I just don't, first of all, it's exhausting. Second of all, like if I find the people, if I like who I'm working with, if they're really happy with the price and I'm pretty happy with the price, I don't care that I could get more somewhere else. I'm happy with the price. happy with the people. I just don't want to compete that hard. I want to be happy. That's it. just want to be happy with what's happening. So if I feel I'm underpaid, I'm not happy. might be happy getting overpaid, but what happens then is I feel like I feel like somebody might come in and try to that because they're willing to get paid less and still doing okay job. And I don't even want to think about it. I just want to be like, you know what, they're really happy with their results. I'm really happy with my money. This is a medium. I'm really cool with this.
00:57:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and I like that. I don't want to compete either, which is why I was telling Esther, I think we just need to be comfortable that if the guy's like, okay, I really don't want to pay that. I was like, okay, find someone else. I have to be okay with no way. And I think now that I've seen this number, like 84,000 divided by two, we'll say three million if it hits that. Right. 84,000 divided by three million. It's not. Even it's 2% of my overall aid for the risk of 7. Well, actually, Dr. Beatty says that's going to be 8,400 patients a year I'm responsible for, right? that level of risk, 8,000 patients that could get out.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, ask one more thing. Out of 8,000, okay, what is the percentage of lawsuits for that type of patient? So then you figure out what are the odds that you're going to have one of those in the next year or two, three, four, whatever. Let's see if we can, let's see we can That's pretty small, with one to five percent patients, but then down here in the affected lawsuits.
00:59:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's really what you care about, right?

Is less than one percent, like, point zero, one to point zero, three percent, pretty low. Mild and moderate reactions, 84 to 420.
00:59:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And this is like, oh, I feel nauseous, this is kind of , but this is the one that serious adverse events are like, anaphylaxis, so yeah, I think that's actually what we quote anesthesia. So, I don't think it's 42 cases a year, last year we had one out of, we did, I think, 3,000 patients last year.
00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, had one. Well, it says less than. Oh, yeah. Last year. year.
00:59:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So. So.
00:59:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, one percent. That's. That's what I think I would look at more than anything, because those severe cases that didn't result in lawsuits were probably like, you know, they were extenuating circumstances that we couldn't control or it's acceptable risk type of thing, you know what I mean?
01:00:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
01:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because the lawsuit, that doesn't even say that had to go to litigation. It's a lawsuit. So a lot of those could have just settled out of court. So that's a very, very tiny risk, I Okay.
01:00:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's about that. Yeah, maybe.
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost the direct correlation to that. But again, we're talking about a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of your income in that time and that time and income could be replaced with something else that has less risk and equal reward.
01:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it just comes down to like, am I okay to lose this job if the guy is like, go, you know, F off.
01:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% should be okay. And I'll almost think of that as like natural selection.
01:01:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. If he doesn't want to work with me, like, you know, yeah, then go find someone else.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The thing about data is stuff will show up on your radar. And then you, you, you want to take that and make. It's just it's part of the printing process and when you can't make a decision and then you like Say this or that is my decision and then somebody else gets to make a decision.
01:02:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It just makes that so much easier Okay, that makes the last sense. I like it. All right. Thank you, Tina I'll let you get some brain rest after your test.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
