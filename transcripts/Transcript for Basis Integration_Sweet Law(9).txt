Hello.
00:00:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Hey.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey. Let's. Apparently not a great day.
00:00:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's going on? One year, deaf anniversary here. So I can't tell you how a lot better.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Damn, has it been that long? Sorry. Okay. Well, I'm hoping that I can get into. I'm let it fly so we can look at these reports so we can stop. Going back and forth with Josh everything. He. So I sent a thorough bunch of questions over. He sent thorough response back. And now it's just a matter of. Looking into it, but. Lidified. Did the force password reset. So I'm waiting for Isaac.
00:00:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is Isaac not on potential. And I think we right now yet, right? Correct. When does he go?
00:01:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, let's see if we're just in future. I'll probably be in December.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, what did I text you? something I didn't want to forget. Oh, Roman. Sorry, I got distracted again.
00:01:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's adorable.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Jonah. She's adorable too. Kind of keeps crawling. Okay, where was the thing? The crap. I did send it to you. Did I email it or did I send it? I must have emailed it. Do you remember what it is? Hey, it doesn't know. I want to. That's what it was. Talk to you about workflow automation for an ideal or untapped. Okay, so let me find the dog we were working in. I was actually really impressed that Lauren's had this idea. I'm going to share my screen. Are you good for talking and meeting now and digging into everything?
00:02:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm sure I also finished one as season.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, because this won't work really well if you're not really paying attention. And I'm not being a jerk. I'm okay. So I think I showed this to you, but what I had done to you.
00:03:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You made your screen bagger.
00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, okay, it was just something I was like, it was almost like squinting, so I just went to the other Alright, so I had both Lorenz and Patrick, I think Lorenz ended up going with Patrick's stuff and then adding some stuff, but I had them break down the processes of the case so that I could know who does what on the team. And I just kind of wanted the anatomy of the case, and then roughly how much time it takes doing this so I could kind of get an idea of where time goes without necessarily having everybody track time so I know that that's not going to happen. And then the other thing that we did is we started looking at how often they review cases, which in the beginning for sure was not nearly enough. And now Lorenz. The reds probably took almost two months to review all of his cases before and at first by himself and now he does it with his team and now he gets them all reviewed twice a month each. So that should be making some improvement and one of the things that we found was like somebody hadn't been reached out to for even like five or six weeks and he's like well yeah but they're in treatment. I said so I understand that but are they going to treatment are they getting it or you know is there any issues with it but here's the other thing from a review standpoint and just the the sentiment of the brand people want to hear and they need to be heard from so even if all you guys are doing is saying okay once a week we just wanted to let you know we're still thinking about you it's like a quick text you could pretty much automate. Most of it in terms of like a few versions of canned messages But just so that people know he were still there. just want to make sure nothing's wrong. I'm also No, no new issue showed up that we're not aware of sometimes any kind of treatment medical treatment, whatever things can flare up cause issues So they even a text message is an option to touch base. Yes, that's what I told them So but there was no anything was happening. like there's no that it does it make any sense to you that You guys should with the amount of cases that you have I realize in a way like it's a lot But when you break it all down and what can actually be done each day, it's not a ton and and Especially if you have some canned responses that you can just kind of rotate through where you can just copy and piece and check on them Like it's not a lot especially because a lot of times people don't even reply so Anyways, so they're working on that and so but as we Every week as we do something, the guys are thinking about it and it's percolating slowly, but steadily there's always something that they bring back the next week of like, what was thinking about this and maybe we could do this and whatever. So after we did this, Lorenz was trying to think about, you know, how to follow up and make sure that all of these things are being done by the team for each of the cases so that he's not physically having to go in and ping everybody every single time because it's all manual labor. And scalable-wise, that becomes not only very tedious, but also it takes you out of a higher level kind of management flow. your attorneys become and remain operators rather than being able to be strategic leaders because of that, especially with volume. So, I like that this was his idea and he was wondering what could be, well anyway, he just brought up the word workflow, but he didn't really know how to do that. And so, there are automations that would work with Slack. I can't remember if we found it with Lidify and Zapier to go back and look at that, but I'm not going to do that just yet. But we did find, oh, yeah, we went to chat TPT and got some suggestions about it, but basically some triggers of here's a new case or this came in, you know, case came in x days ago, we should be roughly at this particular phase of the case right now, check for who it's assigned to. And just to basically, the automations is about reminders and follow up and then also reporting or something. So this is a sample workflow that we got, okay, so Slack, which I could screen share, but Slack has workflow builders in them now, did you know that?
00:08:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it has Canvas and it has a few different things that can basically create some project management function inside of it, and it could probably help with status and reporting, but it's new. first thing I just wanted to know is, are you open to us exploring this and trying it out, knowing that the first few iterations are probably not going to work really well, but that you've got a couple of attorneys that are looking for optimizing and leveraging how they spend their time and keeping better track of all the things that are happening.
00:09:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm fine with it. Also Salesforce can do a lot of these same things too. That's part of why we spend so much on Salesforce.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't have enough understanding of that and how much training does your team have on using workflows and automations?
00:09:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Probably not enough.
00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would say 100% not enough.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It doesn't make the case quite frankly in both situations, but yeah.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean situations?
00:09:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think they have anywhere near enough training on Slack.
00:09:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh for sure. But at least Slack, I could dig into it with them and we could learn it together through screen sharing. They could set it up and we could just plow our way through it. It would definitely be a lot more efficient if we organized some training and spearheaded it and it was executed across all the sweet lot. Because the way that I'm looking at it, and just the calculations of mental lag time and task switching, there's no way that even just having some kind of workflow automation doesn't save hours, if not tens of hours, a month per pod. Which has got to boost productivity. So, knowing that, or at least having that as a theory, what approach would you rather take? So, Lidify is already built into the system, but so is Slack, because that's where everybody communicates. So, I think what would be a great starting point would be talking, and I'd be happy to have a conversation like this with you and a person on Lidify who could explain it to us, screen record it. so that I can learn and watch and have questions and they can show me so that I can train Lorenz and Patrick and knowing that my and I think Lorenz's brain is probably actually works pretty well for this also. I don't know about Patrick but and between him, you and whatever help we can get with Lidify and hopefully somebody there understands an integration with Slack well enough and you can preface that before we get on a call and say look I need somebody who understands this really well and who's good at explaining it so that we can get on there and figure out our first version of a system that will work. This is going to be I mean think about how long it's taken us to even figure out how to get the data we want out of Lidify. It's not a fast process but it's your best chance of getting more products out of the existing people that you have, and even as new people come in, everybody will hit the ground at a faster and more optimized version without paying them more money, without really investing any more money into any other system because you already have slack and let a buy. So, is that something that you could facilitate and make happen, or would?
00:12:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, we can't. mean, again, we're paying for the systems. have the systems.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Okay. will you do that? Yeah. And when will you do that? So, let me open up an email, send this to you, Mark. That's all caps.
00:12:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
gonna CC Dan, just as an FYI. You know, this is going to get a little out of control.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what can go?
00:13:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, as we normally when taking more than two or three days, but just knowing what about coming up, I just, I know, I'm going to try, but I don't feel comfortable telling you that.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I would rather have a realistic time frame, but anytime, I mean, and also how many times I say like we are human beings, you can always do so much. What do you have going on this week?
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, today's completely tomorrow. Got basically meetings from 8 a.m. Until I come to mother in law at 7.45 p.m. Can't really meet with them after that. I'm traveling Thursday. We have Mary's birthday thing. There's a four p.m. Friday, I'm probably going to honestly be a bit hungover from our Thursday night stuff, but then I'm gone Friday evening till Monday morning.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're traveling this weekend. Okay. Let's see, subject. Okay. We'll let me be on that call. Any anyone that has to do with this, if I'm facilitating teaching them, me wrapping my hand around it. Okay. Alright, two, rows, workflows, two, understand, just lock into it. Okay, let's see, I have not, oh, there's, I think, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, This email should be correct, pause for a little bit if I can go back here. Nope. Up to you. Why did you go away? Yes, update. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. I actually need to change the way that I'm sharing my screen because I need you to be able to see the email that. This is it. Zoom's menus just are annoying. Give it all the time. Um, start with it. How could we both stop share and start share? Of course, everything. Oh, there it is. Okay, sharp. So, you should be able to see everything on my screen, yeah? I can't pick on you for being quiet today. you. you know what? going to send you a picture. Hold on. I would, I would breathe these to you if I could. These are, this is, this is what I do. It doesn't, the pictures probably don't look as good as they actually taste, but.
00:17:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to make sure we understand. I'm what Shawsh is not where the disconnect is.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll show you that. These are around.
00:18:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Even something we can even connect because I know some of these things we just. Unfortunately, you know, we're going to get pretty close, but we know people to get.
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so one of the things was we were, hold on a second. Let me know. I don't know what this part is splitting buckets record count about dropped out other. Okay. So yeah, what is subed out and what is dropped out? So dropped out is subbed out means they, um, they replaced us. They fired us, right? And dropped out means their case wasn't either qualified or. Mm hmm.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We were talking about the reason we drop it is there's no insurance or no one or nothing to go after.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what what would referred out um fall under once it's a matter. Yeah um generally that's a higher value case so usually those referred outs are going to like a panache or an alder so like a much more complex higher level case but we don't want to track that as a dropped right that because that right okay so first note is um let's see um this is going to be tedious but it's necessary so please just bear with me and I'll call your attention when I need it so feel free while I'm typing in a go do whatever which is reports need um so y'all out And we tried out, which was different. We started on down. It wasn't easier. It It was awesome. Wherever. To partner. So. There's a word signal. I don't really know. I just about I'm just going to deal with each of these items one at a time, but I hate when I do this. Okay. Okay, so I was talking to you about wanting to see if we could signify how a client preferred to be communicated with. And he said, he added the field communication preference to the intake and party objects, and he created a small automation that will update the party's communication preference field when it is changed on the intake. And then he asked, do you know if they're intake agents use questionnaires?
00:21:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If so, he should add the question to their questionnaires. We don't use the questionnaires. We did at one point. We got away from it because it was. Not allowing them to go I don't to say off script. It's not the right term, but it was forcing them to Have to answer one question before being able to even get to the next one and you know, okay, personally don't Go on straight lines always.
00:22:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It didn't allow for the natural flow conversation No, and so they were writing a lot of things just on the side and then trying to make it go through.
00:22:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah Slowing things down with that would like I'm not against the questionnaires. think the question was definitely a good thing. just it didn't Worked away. wanted to then the follow-up question is Where is this being presented on the matters page it's great. taking an intake or is this the matters because? That's where we may need to update or something else is going on Okay, yeah So let me let me handle that and you can okay, I'm sure it's just moving over it I doubt it's a huge thing, but we should only get that You
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, also, we do want client communication preference to be displayed anywhere on the matter where in the matter would you want it.
00:25:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because people can change over time, but I think as long as it's a one spot, you're okay.
00:25:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So anywhere in the matter, as long as it stays there consistently.
00:25:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So in the on the main page of matter would be where we need to be.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then also he asked when we're tracking communication preference by state. I don't know why we would do that by state. What you want to know in terms of which state that like there's no reason to want to know by state. That's not a reporting thing.
00:25:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Do you? I mean, I'm not going to say no.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I guess I could be knowing how differently people behave in states.
00:25:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but we'll be able to pull it based on matter state. and whether they're where their thing is so it's pretty easy to pull together so he the question is what we want to know about where the accident happened or the state the client resides in and we would want to know by state client resides in right if we're profiling people in the graphics i got the issue yeah especially on death cases where they may be you know it came up on one where it showed up as Walker florida but it really wasn't a florida thing yeah i'd rather be based on where the incident happened i know neither was me perfect um but i think i look with the best um so just so i understand if like if you wanted to know this in terms of like a trend or a report or why where it happened rather than where the person lives you didn't want to write it wrong I get what you're saying like I might mean more terms where they live because it's how people in that state like to communicate first where it happened because if they happen in Arizona live in California it's like counting on that a little bit well more as in what value what corollary value would there even be and where the incident resides as far as communication preference like what what what kind of information does that give because I would imagine most of the accidents happen close to where the person lives anyway and so now that just creates this outlier and no way to die is not bad
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm asking because I don't understand the logic and I'm not saying that there isn't logic behind it. I'm just trying to understand it.
00:28:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So I think on 90 like 5 98 percent of the cases where it happened and where they live are going to be the same state. There's going to be some more that's not the case because either move or they move afterwards or we've got the death cases where the people live in a different state than the person who died.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I'm just saying is I don't I don't understand where there would be value and putting it in the in the state where the incident happened for like I can imagine where there's a lot of things that are important in the state where the incident happened but their communication preference I don't understand the correlation and why we would we would want to make that the thing and I would like to understand it if I don't think there's a
00:29:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
a huge difference between the two what i'm trying to avoid is on like the death cases where we have people who live in different states because it's going to show up just weird wacky things with that that's really where my bigger concern is and then people definitely move post-collision not where they were originally and so we update the address this as we go that's what my worry is oh is that that it that they're okay so like we had one who they're accident happened in california and then they moved to vaguess but it's going to show it as Nevada it really isn't Nevada yeah that's where my concern is and but that's got to happen even less than incidences happening somewhere else than where they live and but since they're there no that would happen probably i think more often incidences where they don't live that state okay so Oh, I think either one's fine. I don't think either of them are probably less than 2%. So yeah, I can deal with that kind of margin of error. I'm okay either way and not in love with one over the other. Either one is fine. I think either one is going to give us kind of information that we.
00:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:30:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You can run both and we can see there's really anything different. I severely doubt it. But yeah.
00:30:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I would want to see if more people in, say, Arizona, prefer telephonic communication versus California would more prefer texting.
00:31:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then, which is what we're trying to figure out. Right, so that's the residence.
00:31:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm saying it's probably going to be exactly the same.
00:31:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we'd like to.
00:31:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But we can run to, then, if they're looking basically the same, we can just get rid of one. All right. And again, I don't have strong opinion on which one to do. OK, I've got that.
00:31:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need a number for OK. You were saying, so when we looked at this report, you were saying that it didn't look right. And I just want to make sure that this is what's happening. So if you. See, the notes in black, this was my notes, and the blue is what he wrote, and then we'd have to go look at the report to confirm. But when I looked at it with the guys last week, it looked like it was correct roughly.
00:32:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of our issues were some of the cases that are at 25 or out of third because of the contractual language.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how does that impact on the report? Because all the report is telling us is did they hit that 40% not was the 40% not even the target.
00:32:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But is it fair to say did you hit 40% when you were never even physically capable?
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so what would be more useful is did we hit target? Did we not hit target? at what percentage was target and target be specified on a matter-by-matter basis.
00:33:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, I deal with this. Let's keep it 40%. Let's also do a 33 and 1-third. But make sure that we exclude any of that as minor.
00:33:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, give me that all.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Between those two, I think that'll give us a much more idea for anything. looking to see if we have policy on this basically. And that'll give us a much, much better idea.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, tell me that again, please.
00:33:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So if we have a 40%, then we'll have another one that's about 33 and 1-third percent. But it needs to exclude minors.
00:33:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's some.
00:34:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, the miners are less than a third. So, as long as we exclude them, they'll give us better data.
00:34:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To, um, let me do this. So, ideally, we would have the most amount of data. Does that make sense? Mostly, I think, a specified target, a turning theme. Sometimes it's more than some, and sometimes it is approximately lower, which is 33.33%. This report is trying to be how often a train hits their target so we can move to market if it's not 40% worth space. Alright, let's go back to this. Alright, that was it. So I will get that stuff to Stacy for the reports. And then. You All right, that's good. Start. You want to get them or you did okay, but it was late.
00:37:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there you go.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the 21st? Always put it on the top.
00:37:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We got four hours, the only thing I didn't put. Okay, so now that Walker's getting broken down my state.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
after I guess this month it'll be a little bit different okay we're just still better yeah yeah 17 I mean saving us it's crazy too when you really break it down and look at like where we were at three years ago Walker didn't even exist and then yes they're really expensive but if you're still making profit on it even if Barrie it's still profit and keep it perfect I gotta feed the machine too yeah and that but back to the point of like diversification and fact that they all cycle and unpredictably and for different reasons sometimes just because they take on a new freakin client we're like yeah triage okay yeah really disappointed but monkeys really not Yeah, well, keep having conversations and do the best you can to figure out what's what's possible. I understand the game. understand that there's not, they don't care, whatever, but squeaky wheel gets the oil and effort is rewarded and maybe not. Sometimes, sometimes, in ways we don't expect, so just keep trying. Valiant, what's up with that?
00:39:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He was doing so good. Yeah, not sure. The leads are there. Give him an update. I mean, he's a little, not massively off.
00:39:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I also want to see a report on leads. Now I was talking about We got a report from that. It's not in our dashboards. It would probably be recent. Now it converted and taped by source by state in May. That person is frantic. I need this in a dashboard.
00:41:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. There's definitely way to do it, but I agree that needs to in a dashboard. Okay. You And I can try to make one right now if you want, but I figure if he would dashboard, it would be far better.
00:43:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Let's just do this because it would be a very use of his time.
00:43:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Got it.
00:43:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also it makes him a more valuable asset in the future, understanding what our targets are. I mean, it makes him more valuable to other people as well. But that scares me mindset taking over and we don't need to worry about that. But in terms of like being able to have another brain and a high level operator that knows what we're doing so that we can move faster when we need a new report or new function or whatever, it would be better to massage that, I think. He's a type of personality that I don't imagine will go anywhere when he works with somebody that makes him smarter.
00:43:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yep.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got what you're saying. Yes. So I would like you to reach out to Valian and see like if he has observed anything that he's aware of anything. I can't his name. Never remember his name. No, it's Mary's husband.
00:44:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, that's fine. think you would also write this on video.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Monkey also needs to talk to monkeys. So Felipe, mean, to get enough for Felipe, we're not like super reliant on them and they're Felipe. Okay, so Chona stopped in terms of creating a workflow system for her. But also, I understand understand your strategy in trying to show Dr. E what's on the table. But what I was talking to her about a Friday, I think I just sent her lots of messages is that the overarching thing right now is timing and massaging egos. The data and the numbers are a huge part of it but how you present it and when you present it makes a huge difference and to the point that you said you know you only get a first chance to make a first impression and additionally you've got the dominant females under here. The thing I told Chona is the likelihood that Dr. E would choose keeping Cheryl happy over having 400 new patients is actually pretty high. He's generally when people have a right hand person, even if that's not actually, even if they are replaceable, but they don't want to deal with training, somebody else up and inserting them. I'm pretty sure you understand exactly what I'm talking about. It would be easier for him to think, you know what, I don't need that money as much as I need peace of mind and having the stability in my current practice. I can make the money any other time later with other people, like that's the story that they tell themselves, rather than disrupting person who is running everything. So that being said, knowing that he will prioritize her energy and how she feels, that timing matters first. So everything that we can do to get Cheryl on board or to get Dr. E to be able to understand it so that he can get. Cheryl on board, but figuring out not just the pecking order, but the structure. And again, how the opportunity is presented, that is first because that's the bottleneck. If you don't bust that open, nothing's going to happen and flow through it. It doesn't matter how good it is, because Cheryl will block it. So, and potentially Dr. E block it, if he's like, this is going to be more of a pain in the than it's for us. That will always be the thing that we have to get through. anyway, that the you getting the numbers and the visuals that I was asking both of you for last week, I'm telling you over and over and over again, once people see things, their perspective shifts. So, as Cheryl needs to see is how she's not threatened, and also how something is coming in that wouldn't come in without Jonah, without you, right? So, she doesn't really own it, they're coexisting in the same house, but that wouldn't exist without Chona, so it helps to, you know, help her not ruffle her feathers because this isn't something she's had taken away from her because it wasn't there to begin with. But creating that visual structure of how things work and even with notating it on there, you know, didn't exist before, we'll finesse all of that. And then do that in conjunction with what the numbers are. And then another way that I just thought about that we could possibly tie it together is it's, let's say there's something Cheryl wanted, like maybe it's a software and maybe it's, but something for her office, something that maybe was cost prohibitive, where this new source of money, maybe Dr. E, like say, hey, Dr. E, when we hit this goal, there's this amount of money. You know, maybe Cheryl can use it for benefiting the The office and illustrating like this money's not coming any other way So let's try to do this. You know what I'm saying.
00:49:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll issue what told you you're saying. I don't based on our conversations it does not seem like Dr. E wants Cheryl to know what he's getting from Okay So It's really hard to do second hand But we thought is this is I'm sure you're like someone like a married position where Right anything else they want to be kept in the loop They want to feel like they've got some sort of control the worst thing you possibly do is That they think you're trying to go around Yeah That's to my experience and so
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was back to you. Sorry, go ahead.
00:50:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
For right now, the only way she could really approach this is I want to keep everyone. We have a lot going on and almost blaming me to some level of why she needs to come in for front of some of communication in that, you know, these are my recommendations, whatever else. And so, you know, she needs to be able to deliver, you know, a certain level of customer service so that I don't look bad because that way it's a third party that's forcing this to happen, right? It's not her.
00:50:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not.
00:50:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. It's on the bad guy in this, if you want.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I will go back to what I said last week and then I clarified a little bit more with Jonah, which is I would not have any unnecessary conversation because I told Jonah I think she jumped the gun by asking for the number and the call. It's and everything last week, because that's an immediate threat that this is definitely perceived threat by sure. It wasn't, but if we had framed it with like an org chart and a what's coming without the numbers, right, and a structure, and it's hard for me to explain without actually doing it, so I need show it as rough draft of it so I can show you, but the other thing is it's potentially a no-go because of his dependency on her and requirement to keep her happy. our first job is to figure out how do we deal with the prison guard, basically without letting them know about the operations, but the documentation and the visualization will be the first thing. So, and then figuring out can we pitch it, like not pitch it, but represent it in a way that and use a psychological approach of You know, so almost require Cheryl to acknowledge she's in the way of something she has no business being in the way of. Now that's a finessing type thing, right? You don't just do that. You figure out the way that you do that is you ask a question that requires an answer and the only answer is, yeah, there's no reason I should not be doing this or there's no reason I should be getting in the way or whatever, like, and that the language for that isn't even available to me or I don't think anybody right now until we see it laid out like that. Just, I know I keep beating a dead horse, but that is the power of the visual representation. you getting your numbers, even though Cheryl won't see them, will help me to be able to formulate the offer, so not the offer, but the situation so that you have something to present Dr. E so that he can help us formulate the way that we present it to Cheryl so that he can have his compartmentalization and keep her happy without her feeling so threatened that she sabotages or that you guys just go this isn't worth it or he goes it's not worth it whatever. It will all come down to especially now that you've got this ego but the other thing is I would imagine you would want to replicate this system one way or another even if you're not using chona potentially and or if it fails but everything that you learn here makes it something that you could do better somewhere else either way it's a great learning experience and it and a great way of learning how to position when you're entering or you're building something under somebody else's roof which is really what the biggest issue is right now.
00:53:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't just hear any of your signs.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a little sate. What would you do if I wasn't? I have. All right. Well, that's really all I have right now. It's a slow and steady kind of thing with the attorneys. It's good. Because everything that we learned there, going back to leverage and tiny percentages of lift and improvement and optimization, whether you just want to make this more profitable or potentially have something that's sellable or whatever. That's the track that we're on. The other thing is everything that we're doing is increasing the amount of data that we have in terms of operations. And all of that. And you know how it happens is one day you just have an epiphany or Dan has an epiphany. or I have an epiphany, either way, the more that we keep feeding and getting clearer and more specific data, different containers of data, all of that kind of reveals itself. the other thing that happens is sometimes you just get clearer on values or opportunities show up or whatever. So that's where we're going with that, and the other thing is it allows for human life pace, you know, so days like today and some of the rough weeks that come along where we're paying attention to so many things on such a consistent basis that even if you stopped showing up for a few weeks, it would still go well, you've got leaders in place, you've got maybe they're not excellent, but Lorenz and Patrick are thinking about things as leaders now, you've got me thinking about it, Josh is thinking about it, and Dan just thinking about it. So all the things that you're doing are definitely building building this around here and and that's good. Anyway, I would love to be kept in the loop as much as possible about the automations process that you're working on building with a high level and follow up, especially because the more that I understand it, the more that I can help train it and support it with Chona, but also knowing that you and Dan are definitely not the operator types to use the systems, whereas that's the type of thing that it's not the role I serve now, but I'm the type. So yeah, so being able to understand it from that perspective and help create it correctly from the first place would be useful. And I'm making myself available to help with that process. mean, I don't need to have more work.
00:56:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I get paid the same regardless, but...
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I'm volunteering, huh?
00:57:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The last headaches.
00:57:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was. It's not really a headache for me because I can just compartmentalize and be like, my hour is up, but it's not really how they work.
00:57:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I do kind of care. Yeah, so I'm going to need some help with guiding through how to do this earloping. She's just really trying to push this up through and I understand why. Just some of these things take a little more time than.
00:57:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's, I honestly mark, I think that it's she is anticipating your energy and this is, women want to please their guys. And it doesn't, you know, like you, you have, it's hard to explain because like, I'm the same way my kids perceive, you know, my fierceness and other like, mom, you're scared. You're this, you're that. I'm when's last time anybody in the. that house ever was spanked. I'm like, it was 2015. I'll tell you what happened. And blah, it's like, it's in my journal. you guys don't get spanked, you don't get threatened, you don't get grounded, whatever, but they'll still like, mom's terrifying, right? But what they also know is, if they need anything, it's their, if their friends ask for anything, they're like, you can tell my mom, she is safe, she will take care of you. If you're hungry, my mom will feed you. If you need anything, my mom will take care of it. Like, it's weird that they know that, but they see me as this heart all the time. And that's the dominant perception, even though all the other things are actually what's more present. So like, Chona and even the runs and pads are like, mark his life, get his right, right? But then they sit there and think about it, was like, will help me anytime with anything and he's never threatened me and whatever. So you're bottling this perception of you that, I don't even know if you can overcome it, because I haven't been able to. I don't know what my kids anyway, I think the dynamic matters. so she's going to want to go at it aggressively and that also might be something in her nature. I'm not sure of competitiveness, but for sure. She she wants to please do and not disappoint you and not make you look bad. And so being successful and getting things done quickly is something that is definitely driving her. So she needs help with being told the pacing conversation, which you did too. And so that's what I'm doing is helping her understand that and also that you know that and you understand that. But we all have different perspectives and experiences when we're building it and building anything and experience really is the. the only truth, like everything's theoretical until we've actually gone through it. And we can think what we think about anybody. But until we've been tested, and until that person has been tested, again, it's just all theory. So that's where she's at right now. And right now, everything is new, like back to that driving analogy. She's processing everything constantly. And it's overwhelming. So like, even when I started working with you, like, you'd been doing this for three years. None of it was brand new to you. And before that, you were in a turning, anyway, working inside of offices just not as the owner, but a lot more experience because you were still working with, you were still having the conversation understanding how the business was working, right? she just has so much more to absorb. And on top of it, at the position of she doesn't really have power but needs power in order to be successful. And so she does have power but she feels like she doesn't because Dr. E really is the boss and Cheryl is, but she's starting to realize that she does have it. Anyway, it's a lot and most of the biggest issue is the learning curve and the experience that validates, okay well I think this is how it is and then you go and you act upon it and they're like okay, that is how it is or okay no I was wrong. So there's no shortcut for that. That just is a fire that has to be walked through and she's walking through it. But I keep sending her messages to just encourage her and to try to support her and also tell her she can vent to me anytime and yeah anyway. She's really smart. though and she is she's very smart she's going at it like I didn't think at first no she is mark she is you okay you're looking at it from your perspective I have worked with so many people even in the corporate world before I got here I mean I hired and fired hundreds and trained them I've worked with so many different people in different capacities all the way up and women especially don't want to go in and make waves and you're in the culture that she's from makes it even more like impressive the speed that she's going at it she is doing better than I think that you know and I'm not even saying that about just Chona I think that sometimes that's a perspective that you have sometimes for for the team and then I also think it's the opposite like Mary I think You gave her way too much credit. Just think it depends on perspective, but either way, huh?
01:03:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It does.
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it does. And there's no right or wrong. mean, just because I have an opinion that I have it strongly doesn't mean, like, I think that I'm right or that I am right. It's just it is what it is. But she is pushing through her fears and limitations every week. While also absorbing and learning so many new things. I don't think that you remember, and I don't even know when you would have done this other than just being a brand new attorney. How overwhelming that is. But even then you did it as a man and it's just not the same. It has nothing like I am not a man here or dealt with dynamic. It's just. psychological dynamic. That's professional dynamic.
01:04:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's just the reality of it. It's a little different.
01:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is.
01:04:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But you know, like I see her, she still doesn't finish her P.I. News. She said, why didn't I finish them? And then, you know, she wants me to review them, which I understand. I don't really love reviewing notes at like midnight when I'm trying to go to sleep.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. She definitely has to get better. And I think that that will happen.
01:04:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
it will de-stress her if yes.
01:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I 100% agree with that. But the one thing that you should take into account is that the mental load and the emotional load of everything else that she is doing is robbing her of the ability to just. Okay. Did I have you read the book switch? Yes. Okay. Do you remember the concept of finite willpower? Yes. Okay. This is where this is incredibly relative. How many times a day does she have to not tell Cheryl a off? Yeah. and I will power. So if it takes willpower to also do the notes, okay, where is she spending her willpower? My point is that she exhausting, she's exhausting her willpower every day. So what is the priority? Well, nobody else can create the business and nobody else can do the notes either, but you can't do all the things all the time and there is a certain level and it's different by person and it's different by day but there is a certain amount of willpower a person has each day to do the that they don't want to do and once it's exhausted, it's exhausted and to the point of talking and being sweet, you can increase willpower. So Stephen Covey talked about emotional bank accounts and I think it was seven habits. He definitely talked about it in the eighth habit. And what he said is that you can't make a withdrawal from an emotional bank account that you haven't been making deposits into. And as much as people get excited over shiny, pretty expensive things, that actually doesn't really fill up the emotional bank account as much as words of affirmation, even if that's not their love language. Telling people, especially who are going through hard things, that they're doing a good job, and being specific about it. I saw you do this, this is good. I saw you do this, this is good. I know that this is hard, and yet you did it anyway, that's amazing. And I'm proud of you and that kind of thing. You can not just increase the bank and the wealth in the emotional bank account by doing that, but it also has an impact on willpower. So, and I'll tell you how you can know that's true. The study said that it wasn't just as far as I'm concerned. The absence of not having to not eat the donuts and the baked goods in that experiment, it was that they got to have them. They got the pleasure. They got that. Oops, I missed a call. Um, oh, well, it was that they got the reward and they got those dopamine hits, um, that probably also benefited what their emotional willpower is. Because just think about like, if you were taking a hard test and maybe had some pizza and something good and you're like, I'm in good mood. I can knock out some more of this. It wasn't just that not eating pizza was hard and that drained your willpower. It was that eating pizza made you feel good. So you had more of it. So take this from a psychological approach and separate, know, and think about it from a leadership perspective. How do you put more into her so that you can get more out of her and I don't mean that financially. mean, because you want it for her. her. How do you help her get more out of herself? You, you put more into her. It can be done. There's value, you know, you have to decide if you want to do that, and you can apply that to anybody. But there is a lot to be said about what you can do and help somebody produce when you just put good words into them. True words, specific words about things you've actually observed. Good for thought. You know what, I know it's about you, Mark. You always keep growing. You will catch yourself in like you're always fighting that natural tendency to like, I want to have this. And then asking. self. Okay, but am I going about it the right way? Is this good? Is this great? And then instead of surrounding yourself by yes, people, you surround yourself with people who challenge you, and then you allow that challenging. And but you also don't take anybody else's word as that's the gospel truth, you have your own thoughts, you have your own values, and you're only following the dictate of your own conscience, but you're constantly making sure that you're checked and being checked so that you can be the best version of yourself. most people are not like that. And I think it's amazing, especially that you do it, no matter what happens to you, no matter how hard life gets. So that's why I'm a phantom work. Just thought I would leave you with that. Yeah. All right, I will go. I gotta get to I don't have to actually Fuji's moving today.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
so I don't have a food you call. I know I'm excited for you.
