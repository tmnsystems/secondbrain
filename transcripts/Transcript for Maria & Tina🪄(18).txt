Hey, hey, how are you?
00:00:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good. me just grab a glass of water. just realized I don't have that for saw my desk.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have a fabulous weekend?
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed it.
00:00:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good. All right, my water.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm already looking at flight for next time.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Alexa, stop. Okay. So I was hoping we can just open up a Google Doc and just knock out details of the offer. Yeah. And then, um, I don't want show your screen or my screen, but I didn't want to show you one quick thing. I just put together. they're like over the weekend just finalizing it now. This is what I put together. She had this is one of the two gay clients. And she sells ADHD stuff for kids, but also this child custody binder, that's why she was taking a long time to decide what niche to go after. So we're starting to after this one and the whole parenting niche. But I'm really proud of this.
00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks awesome. Very good.
00:01:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyhoozy. So yeah, so pretty proud of that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. That's awesome.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
she happy? Oh yeah, she she's I'm very careful with her what she spends because she's like really been through a lot and doesn't have a lot of money. So I'm always helping her above and beyond. Without a doubt. But yeah, she's happy with everything. Whenever she gets on a call of me, or if I help her something on her Shopify e-commerce store, she makes money. And unfortunately, one time she had someone else help her for ads, and then the ads went tagged after that. So, but literally, she's someone who only has like a budget to spend like $25 then ads. Like, that's it. That's why I'm saying I go slow with her.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but yeah, she's, she's happy.
00:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My biggest issues, I really don't want her to spend a lot of money on tech stack. So I'm probably going to transfer this. That's what's been taking me the long time. I think I'm just going to transfer this to system I owe for her because it's so much cheaper than anything else. And has email, everything. But I'm just going to tell her, I thought I would do it. screw it. Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list.
00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What was her domain?
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen again. I don't know what her domain is for selling the 900. I could probably find out if I dig or into it.
00:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've been trying to say to be different digital wealth, like academies and- Yeah. It's digital growth academy, but- growth.
00:04:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is only the 47 a month, right? This isn't selling the 900 thing. So, um, I don't know where in here, like I'm in the community in the classroom. That's the only thing that's weird. And like, she'll has Texas sport calls. Anyone who buys the $900 gets free access to this, I think membership. So, so everything that's in here, um, and she does this, you know, like 90 day success sprints day one day. Like, it's, it's really good. I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, you and I would create with full value transparency, giving value to people. Um, or we could just become, I was even thinking, just become a damn good affiliate for her because a lot of people are pursuing early, like she's gotten all these wins, like all these people making sales. She's got, look at all the pages of sales. What's that? sorry. I just had a funny message. She was like 18,000 and 32 pages of wins.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rosie, do you think it would be helpful if I join and pay for that? So that we're studying the same thing because here's the thing either we're creating our own path and just using it or That it will be what I do and we do it always should be but I Love modeling after somebody who's doing something similar to what we want to do and making a couple tweaks and I feel like if we're Number one it doesn't work with school to share logins or whatever and for the price. It's nominal Anyway, I'm just kind of study that and be on the same page Because it's low ticket because so you think that she's you know Telling the truth not really the bro marketer club.
00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Just kind of She's definitely a bro marketer and you know who she hires in their dual mindset coaching is the same female mindset coach from LA That was on sunset that Netflix show sunset and I watched a little blurb of the mindset coaching. It's pretty good I think what amazes me to two things to you. What amazes me is Um, her, I'm just going to give this link to you. She's only been in this for two or three years and she was, I think, in network marketing and then she switched to this and one of her friends or colleagues, just like how you and I are connecting, one of her friends colleagues, it was a really good web funnels and tech stuff. So that's why they decided to create this because they figured that's what was missing. So I think she had a big boost from the start of all of her MLM people because this is so good for MLM people, right? To eat up and find another revenue source.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if we want to focus on such beginners. So that's my only thought process.
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, so here's her Instagram thing that this is what her real thing is. So she calls it the free daily pay blueprint PDF, zero six, three or six months coming to here. So this is what she gives you. If you were to pay $900, you get this whole system as well. So you enter your email and then sends me the blueprint and then she's got this legacy build program and I think it goes into a webinar. And of course, she's, this is all in school, like, She just started the school community not long ago either, but she's just growing fast.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're probably one of those ones I kill it in network marketing and really, you got to talk to people a lot and you got to work a lot to do that. Oh yeah, I think is.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Go ahead, sorry.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's one of the things that is a big something I always want to pay attention to when I look at somebody and look out, why are they successful if they're successful because they're working constantly. It doesn't mean that I can't take what does work and then figure out how to make it work well or just set different goals. you know, maybe she's got 70,000, I don't need 70,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, like, you know what I mean? It's a whole different level and also, I mean, how many people does she have to have to support the team? What kind of margins does she have?
00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What kind of headache is all of that management?
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, they look good. All the different things and it gives It's exciting, you know, when you see these big platforms and these big numbers, but it's it's really easy to not take into account the cost of that and I'm sure you've done this as well. Worked with a lot of these people in the back end and they're just burnt out, they're happy on the outside and on the inside, everything else is falling apart, their health, they don't see their kids, they don't see their sweethearts, they, you know, there's a lot that you don't see and and the other thing is the difference between like extraverts, introverts and amberverts. I'm an ambervert, so, you know, like I can only spend so much time with a lot of people. I light up, I get energized, but then I'm super drained and I have to recover so I can't do that all the time and I'm not seeking out opportunities to be in front of people, but also if I spend too much time alone, I get depressed, introverts are like, let me be alone. Yes, I'm right there. I'm right there in the middle. Now, you have to take that into account with the business model. I would say I would think you lean more towards extrovert, but probably in the like, but so if here's a spectrum, here's introvert, here's ambivert. I mean, here's extrovert. Here's ambivert. would say Tina is probably right around here. Maria's maybe just a little bit over here, slightly more extroverted, but still probably doesn't need to be with all the people all the time. Yeah. Well, am I right or wrong?
00:10:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, totally. Totally. know, and I don't want to be a me too product. I'm going to be honest. Like, I think what we've been talking about, thinking about is really powerful and, and, you know, it was solidified even in my mind today when I saw Alan's post today about how in a nutshell, he just said all the people that he's helping. in his fast forward scale to like $100,000 months or whatever, $1,000,000 months, there's no more messaging of here's how to get five to five more clients, here's how to make more money. It's the messaging that really works is just having like that work, like work life balance, right? Which is what we've been talking about, right? And I believe in it, like a simple, anyways, we don't need to go into all details of that, but yeah, so don't buy it yet, you know, because we may not want to go that direction because sometimes what beginners deflates me because it's hard when someone comes back to you and says I only have like $20 a day to spend on ads.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And actually, I think that that's not a bad budget for, for trying things down starts even our seven and eight figure clients with a dollar a day or to $5 a day at budgets and does well. But there's so many things that are an uphill battle for beginners. They don't have perspective and I don't I don't have the energy to want to impart low-level perspective, like the getting started perspective. I can give you impart the perspective of, all right, you've got all these great things, and you're doing all these great things, don't get psyched out and play smaller than you can be, but I don't want to be teaching the basics. I want to teach and offer that as a done for you, like just self-paced do it yourself. I want to teach it because I think that the way that I teach it is different than everybody else, and we'll resonate with the small group of people, and I just want to offer it and let God bring the people who need that, and it's its own thing. if I'm going to work one-on-one or in a group or anything else like that, I need it to be high-level, or at least mid-level, so for doing hybrid coaching, needs to be mid-level. We're experienced, we know a lot, We don't know it all, and we need some hand holding, but the group can kind of hand hold also, you know what I mean, that's that mid level. High level is, I just need you to catch me when I'm screwing up. Tell me the things that I don't know, and then I'm going to go off and do my thing, and I'm going come back and report, and then we're going to do this again.
00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's high level.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't need a lot of hand holding. I love those people. I barely talk to them. They're my favorite, and they adore me, and likewise, so for us, I think getting started really targeting that mid level person, where we can get some exponential kind of like results, some like raving fans of like, holy crap, you know, this was just, I've been here, here, here, here, here forever, and I just went, whoosh, but I did this without getting really stressed or trying to follow somebody else's thing that doesn't fit me. And that's what I want to deliver to people. And then what I want to do. as while we're doing this for people and making the money that we need to and want to, is figure out what did we do consistently with every single person?
00:14:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What was the process?
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the fundamental questions we asked? Which I mostly have out mapped out in my course that I started. But how could we improve that and so give that to people and then maybe we scale it up and we do a few more of these. Maybe we train some, because there's not enough of these people in the world, there's not enough high level coaches that are really good that can actually serve and take care of people. And so maybe we can train junior coaches or something like that who are really good at walking through this process that we've taught and completely outlined. And then maybe once we have a team meeting where we meet with all of our junior coaches and they say, here's the issue, here's where I'm getting stuck, or this is my plan. And what do you guys think, run it by us? Like, we could have a whole kind of school of ourselves. I've literally never thought this thought before ever. Yeah. So this is all just, it evolves, it evolves. It just keeps evolving. Because I'll tell you what happens. If we weren't talking, I would talk myself out of all of it. It was starting to do it.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, no, that's why that's why I forced myself to launch a member of what it is. I said Tuesday at 6 p.m. So that's like girl in like five hours.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like, I don't really have much to launch.
00:15:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I'm very good, I don't know you noticed this about me. I'm very good at teasing people and getting them excited. I've got people already saying, I marked my calendar for 6 p.m. But the thing is, here it is, go buy it for $100. This is going to be like, this is the price, take or leave it. But I have been torn between something that Josh Gavin actually said, because I'm in his little community, because he just called me in. And he's interviewed me about the success of how to float ticket offers. Hasn't be able to take it offers and I respect him, but he sometimes in his group. He's so cute He puts out somebody should do this offer and he'll just list out offers that you should do right like he says I'm too busy to do this. Someone should do this because I would buy this right or and so his latest one He says he says whether one or all of you do this go for it I thought that actually is brilliant He says someone should offer a pocket cmo offer Where for like whether it be 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month or whatever a month You are the pocket cmo where they could twice a week or something Send an illume video to you about what their needs are like what they're stuck on and then you within like say a two day turnaround or 24 hour turnaround send a loom video back to them, right? he said for instance for him He would pay that for someone he doesn't want to hire someone like we're an agency for 5,000 months to run his ads or anything But he would love to if he's ever stuck or what to do share a screen and show someone something and then get the tips from someone else Um And I know my friend Cara who runs all the ads for like soon with Claire and she like paid herself I'm like, why did you do this? really good at what you do. I remember she paid $1,000 for one hour or one guy Who who proposed to be a Facebook ad scaling expert? And she said oh it like I knew more than him I'm like, what did you pay for the point is I thought that was interesting with our skill sets as well pocket CMO, you know And when I started I remember do you know who my kill is do you remember internet marketing? Super friends.
00:17:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so Somebody people would always try to ask me to describe what I did and it was really hard because no role that I had found ever described it and then Matt Gill was a good friend. I don't know if you know him from nitro marketing Not that well, but I know him. He has a name Yeah, so he's like Ops you do operation. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. So then I was like Okay, I'm COO for hire. now they have fractional COO. And I was like, yeah, that's that's definitely there. But that doesn't make enough money. I would not do it for anybody because they don't. It's not positioned and valued right for for the level that I do and brain. But I wish if like if you have that post, I'd love to see it because I'd love to send it to a client of mine who would be that that would be a great offer for him pocket CMO. He does the fractional CMO but I like the pocket CMO.
00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like that level of access because it's more leveraged.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to need this. I got to remember I got homework to do now schools in session. Um yeah anyway okay so let's see screen sharing our offer.
00:18:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which you want me to share it or do you know yeah however yeah yeah. Okay.
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, was it the Maria Tina partnership one?
00:19:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what? We have stuff in there, but I just created a new doc and it's not good. I don't even think I've shared it with you. So I'll just put it in the comments here now in the chat. And I will share screen right now. I have the other ones open too. Done. love it. But, you know, obviously starting to work less, have fun and have a life. And then do we just want to say one on one mentorship?
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Opportunity? Yeah. I love that. 20 plus year business veterans like, you know, how long have you been doing this? before I I did it online, which is 22 years. It was six years in corporate. And it was for a call center, but I was still managing metrics. And it was basically a business within a business, the call centers work. Because I did my own hiring. I did my own staffing. I did meet my metrics. I had to meet my contractual agreements. So in all of that actually prepared me for what I do. So I would say I'm closer to 28 years with business experience.
00:20:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I quit the big six consulting firms in 1999, 2000. So I guess 24 years.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're close. I would say nearly 50-year combines or we'll say 25 plus whatever. However you want to do that, it's close. Because if you want to be real about it, I also and you did too a paper route for a couple years and all the other things. So if you out of my business years, I've got 30 years under my belt for sure.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that makes me old.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ha. ha ha And this is a mouse. Oops.
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's that that let's break down full stock.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Okay, for this. I just wanted to put this in before. Forget. Yeah, yeah. Because the feedback I'm getting from people that I did do some one in one calls with, by the way, I do have one in 15 minutes, so, but I get back on with you after that.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just, just, okay, this was only scheduled off till one 30 my time. So that's why someone snuck in and booked.
00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's yeah. Yeah, but I'll be available in an hour after that two, three, my time.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm but anyway, you are not looking for money this meeting an hour long because that Tuesday.
00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have gone the whole weekend.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they have it.
00:22:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Action. I don't know. So yeah, we can go back to the full staff. Yeah. So this is what resonated with people when we were talking just back and forth about so many things to build on the business that you feel called to serve this component, but it'll give you emotional support, support, support, support. really, I think, resonated with people in the PS of the email that I sent a couple days ago, and then you saw some of my Facebook posts that are resonating with people. Maybe it's just cutting out what's in my Facebook post that I wrote on the weekend or Friday.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one I tagged you with. I don't know if you saw that one. I didn't even so.
00:23:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I quoted you in it too.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was off. I was like, I'm not online at all.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so this one, timeless principles for building a business and it's kind of summary of what we do and it says, what are my good friends to? Marie says, I take you on it. And it said, the offer match to the audience Trump's brand power all day, branding, just sports, organic traffic, so it was your words there because I wanted to slowly bring in you. But, yeah, so it's a long post, but I was talking about, you know, there's so much crap out there. And maybe I just can't pace this because people love this post. Yeah, you know.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me, oh, go away. I've missed a lot, like apparently the swarms are terrible, and just...
00:24:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want stop share?
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I just want to... I have my settings so that things that I'm tagged in don't... have to be approved to get on my wall, and like I'll still show up, but I wanted to do that. Go check this for you. Yeah, and then I can go... Wait, wait, that's not it. Oh yeah, no, sorry.
00:24:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no words, no.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Yeah, I see... I'll read it from here real quick so I can see all your... What do you call it? Words? please, but can I just get to my own profile? There, okay. Absolutely brilliant post. Nice job. thing you say, video or write means everything to me. Oh, good. So that's like, I may have heard a version of some of it when I when I hear it from me, it downloads directly from my brain, can't get enough. You have got to keep that as a testimonial and use that, Maria, because that's the thing. That's the type of comments and things that people say to me. This is what makes us most unique.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you talk about?
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a comment on here from Colleen held Ladwaib and she says, everything you say, video or write means everything to me. I totally get it, absorb it. And it's like, I may have heard a version of some of it. But when I hear it from you, it downloads directly to my brain, can't get enough. That is a skill that I have as well too. I that is so unique. I don't I don't know that that I've ever read read anybody say that about somebody else. I'm sure that it's there. I think like Alan and like there are certain types of people, we have, we connect with other ones. So you and I both do a little storytelling and correlating of a technical and tactical concept and put it into life in a way that people can just like go wait a minute, I get that now. You've got a, you are the class from the pulpit side. What we the teacher saw was someone without their ego, I'm gonna cry, getting in their way. You were there to learn all the questions they came at the right time. You followed instructions were first to finish the exercise, give me time to dig deeper. Those are really pioneering days of internet marketing.
00:26:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that's my software friend. That's interesting too, but just he'll always couch it with edifying him. He'll never fully me. Oh yeah.
00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm, that reminds me of Seth Laraby. Like he, You did a lot to lift people up, but you'd always be like, my student, my this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, even teach what you're talking about. Like, he did that with me a couple of times. I'm like, you understand that this was not because of you.
00:27:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but yeah, okay, you know, I've been walking just you do such a good job of, I mean, even the emojis, the number emojis, I've never think of the number emojis.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because sometimes it takes like two, three hours to write one post. So that's why I've been warming everyone up for the last 14 days too, to video post.
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So, okay, what? Man, you've got to go soon.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sucks.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is the best way to use this time to support where your brain has already been going because my brain can go off of on a whole different ten right now.
