Pain Management: And then Dr. E. Is trying to renovate The office beside the office

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Pain Management: The main office in Huntington Beach So I feel a lot more pressure

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000
mark sweet: Sorry. Let me expand on that. She's gonna have her own space in the Huntington Beach office. That's just for pi leans. So it's like its own office.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
mark sweet: Which is good.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Pain Management: It's right across um And right across Cheryl's

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Pain Management: I love this

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
mark sweet: Well, no, it's in its own separate space, like he's knocking on the wall between it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Pain Management: No, there's a it's its own separate, you know. Yeah, it's a separate office. It's not in one, but right across, like

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Tina Marie: Like a parking lot or a hallway

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Pain Management: A hallway.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
mark sweet: No, it's like 2 suites next to each other, like suite, 303, 10

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
mark sweet: Which makes logical sense

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Pain Management: You know he's trying to offer me like forest, which is where I'm at now, because I just saw a patient Lake Forrest But Mark said, this is not central doesn't matter how nice the office is, but

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
mark sweet: It's not where your clients are coming from.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Pain Management: But I think it's good to just maybe have a very small space there, too. Right? Hon.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
mark sweet: Whatever you want. Just you gotta look at where your patients are coming from, and I don't think very many are coming from South County

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Pain Management: No.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
mark sweet: They're all coming from La Anaheim, Inland Empire. Honestly, Long Beach would be better

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Pain Management: Oh! And

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Pain Management: I think so.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000

Tina Marie: Really.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah. That the one year ended

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
mark sweet: I just got the email from it

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I didn't realize it was a year That's good.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Tina Marie: I mean, I mean, like I I guess I thought it was indefinitely or longer period, or something like that. But

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
mark sweet: Well, it was one year of don't get in trouble. If you get in trouble, it's gonna be like 10 times worse, and we're bringing this back. It It's still theoretically like

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
mark sweet: Of Kind of a theoretical sort of issue. But just means we're gonna relaunch. Death blogs out there

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
mark sweet: That We'll uh get the ethics turn to give us a thumbs up 1st

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Tina Marie: Get that. Oh, ethics, attorney! I was like I didn't hear something

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah, she's all into AI and everything else. So she's actually she gets this stuff, which is good

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Tina Marie: Well, whatever she is doing. She should make sure that she double checks everything that AI comes up with, because Chat Gpt goes through cycles of really bad hallucinations, and it's doing it again this week

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:54.000
mark sweet: I meant AI, for, like lawyers and law firms like she understands that We use it like there's places you're like. Oh, no, you should not use any technology. We should all just be in the yellow pages

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Gotcha

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So that's the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
mark sweet: Conditions, yeah.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Tina Marie: So. Because we haven't really been. We haven't been taking any cases in Nevada

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
mark sweet: No um. If something came through organically, we refer it out But we haven't been pushing them at all. But Patrick took the bar in February, so he should find out. May

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
mark sweet: Whether he passed or not. Um. So if he passes, then we'll be able to to get that going

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Tina Marie: Nice How is the search? Are you? You're still trying to find somebody in Arizona right

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Tina Marie: Or wait. What's Samantha? Somebody is expanding. Do you have a couple of people? I don't have sweet loss stuff open right now.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So Sam's in uh New Mexico, Idaho, Colorado and Oregon and California.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tina Marie: Oh, um!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
mark sweet: I have no idea how organ works. Um

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: Uh, it's gonna be very similar, probably to California and Washington, because All of our legislation follows. Our governors all hang out together.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
mark sweet: Um

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Tina Marie: Almost everything that California does If it can be applicable to Oregon in any way, we end up rolling out something very similar

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
mark sweet: Yep, it

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Tina Marie: Liberals.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
mark sweet: There's a couple of things that are totally different. Um, which is, they go on a fee schedule which no other state does

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Tina Marie: I hate Oregon. I can't wait to see them

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
mark sweet: And then it's a modified uh liability. So it's gonna be 50% or less, which is more like Texas, not like California or Washington.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. That's good, though. Right

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tina Marie: Or no

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
mark sweet: Uh, no, it's bad cause I like the super bad injury. 1% fault. Mark's gotta get super creative to make arguments

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tina Marie: I feel like I need more information, because I don't understand everything that you do enough

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
mark sweet: Uh homeless drug in the middle of the road, who gets hit by a truck We'll get money on those in like California or Washington.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
mark sweet: I wouldn't be able to in Oregon based on my law.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay, got it?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
mark sweet: So. Can't get super fun, creative

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Organs.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Pain Management: Right now. The conversation is For that new person to manage all Sweet James email and phone call

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Pain Management: Like as um scheduling the patients Um

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Pain Management: Majority of the patient is sweet. James So her goal is to make sure to answer email on Sweet James. Only I I don't. I don't know

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Pain Management: Um or schedule that appointment, and I really need her to be um On top of the procedures

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Pain Management: Like, for example, on Friday. Like right now we have

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Pain Management: Um Friday. Procedures.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Pain Management: I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 in Huntington Beach, so I really want her. When there are procedure days to be there, make sure that they are seen on time by Dr. E. And they have a follow up appointment

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Pain Management: So which she's aware, and she's willing to do that to travel to wherever the procedures are Um

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Pain Management: And then Maria will handle the non. Sweet James Cases, which is 20% of at the moment. But she'll be in charge of

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Pain Management: All patients on our schedule, meaning, if I have a 2 o'clock today, zoom, she will do the pre assessment. She'll prepare the chart. She'll prepare the patient And make sure that

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Pain Management: That is the flow of our daily schedule she's managing. I don't know if that's fair. I told Maria. This will be We have to be all flexible.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Pain Management: On whatever the need is because we don't want double work, but also at the same time, how do we know If an email comes in, how do we know it's an it's a email from Sweet James

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Pain Management: Or not. Of course, now we know we know who's the case, manager, but And also the idea is, what if a patient calls

00:12:45.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Pain Management: And then she, the other person, talked to that patient, and then they call back in the afternoon, and then Maria answered like they don't know what the conversation is, so We need to have a system where we're inputting the messages like call patient to schedule an appointment. So we're thinking, my, I talked to mark about it, and

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Pain Management: We're thinking, maybe just on the excel sheet that's our conf will be our conversation like Tried calling no response. So that way. We know that if they, the 2 of them, know that if they call is that, or should I just have Kenya, this new person in charge of all emails or phones? I I

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Pain Management: Not sure Like.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Tina Marie: Well. So.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Tina Marie: One of the issues, right is that you've got 2 Tebra accounts For managing everything.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Pain Management: It's the same

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Tina Marie: So you've got some patience in both

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Pain Management: It. It's when we log in. It's just It shows 2 where you you can only click one, and that's the thing. She's new, and Maria already knows

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Pain Management: That to navigate, where To put the patient mhm

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: Um There's lots of things to think about. So it's not necessary

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Tina Marie: A linear approach this conversation that we're gonna have right

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tina Marie: But At the end of the day

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Tina Marie: You want the simplest system possible that gets The work done as quickly as possible with the least amount of errors. So sometimes the least amount of errors means that the Comp. That the system is a little bit complicated, or there's double work

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Tina Marie: Or rework, because it's most important that we don't make mistakes, and that the system is created to prevent mistakes So.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Tina Marie: Um The thing that I like about a single spreadsheet where everyone lives is that you need to, regardless of whether it's a spreadsheet or anything else. You need a central location

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Tina Marie: Where every patient that you're responsible for That your team is responsible for exist in one location where you and each of your team members can literally be on the same page, because a 1 page

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Tina Marie: Or one spreadsheet, or one source

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Tina Marie: Exists for you all to be there, because if you're not all on the same page, all at the same time, there will be mistakes that will cause issues for your patients, your your case managers, Dr. E. Whatever and that could be detrimental to your business So.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Tina Marie: Mitigating those types of issues has to be the 1st priority, making sure that the job is done. Well, what I mean is like, there's always trade offs right

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes the work that we do is tedious, but sometimes The nature of the work is that it's tedious, and we don't get to just dismiss it now. So what we want to do is meet the primary goal which is, make sure that we do a great job, and we mitigate any issues and errors

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Tina Marie: The second one is, make the system as easy to use as possible, so that it isn't draining, and that it removes friction for the users? Does that make sense

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Pain Management: Yes, so I think that excel spreadsheet would be. We will. We'll have to form M,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Pain Management: A line, I guess, for Communication. Um

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Tina Marie: So. Uh. One of the things that you can do is you can have

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Tina Marie: A page that pulls from other pages. So let's say that you've got one sheet that is, everybody from Sweet James and the other one right, that is all the other people But you could have a all client list

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Tina Marie: That automatically pulls from, you know, through rows, one through 100, whatever sweet James, and rows 101 through whatever pulls from the other spreadsheet, so that they're all in one page, and that you're not manually manually copying pasting, and that the data stays appended To its original source.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Tina Marie: And then where we could put notes. I'd have to kind of like I think what we should do basically is mock

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Tina Marie: Go through a couple of scenarios with your spreadsheet and say, Okay, how would we do this? And I think Finding your best solution is going to be a matter of some mock exercises

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Tina Marie: How would this work? And then, if you find that there's an issue, then you resolve it through more mock exercises. And then when you've got something good, then you roll it out and you test it. Live

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Tina Marie: Do you know what I mean?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Pain Management: Um So like right now we

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Pain Management: We go to Our current um system. You know, where we have the patient's phone number and birthday, like

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Pain Management: Maybe Maybe we don't have to put it here. Maybe we should just. I don't know

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Pain Management: Maybe we should just put it on Tebra. But this is like easy access. There's a phone number there, an email, because we use the email because of the zoom link But

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Pain Management: I don't know like right now, I'm sure you have access to that one. Where can we put it? Like.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Tina Marie: Just the Chona lean cases, right?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Pain Management: Yes. To like

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Pain Management: I wonder if this eat line for email? Just put it on. Tempera is kind of to like. Have less

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tina Marie: Well, what if? So, going back to the priority of

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Tina Marie: Getting the thing done without mistakes. So, the thing being Scheduling appointments and

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tina Marie: Um whether it's telemed or procedures. Now, liens are all in person. No, some of them are telemed also, right

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Pain Management: Majority are Taliban

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, okay, so anyway. Um

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Tina Marie: If the day to day thing that Maria and The Americas, or Kenya

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Pain Management: Can you Mhm.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Tina Marie: Um have to do is make sure that patients are taken care of. We could have A tab that is scheduled

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Tina Marie: Right? And there's a couple ways. Yeah. Uh

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Tina Marie: So basically just starting with today's date And um. You could freeze the pain

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Tina Marie: So that the the top row, the header row, is always at the top. So when you're scrolling down because

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Tina Marie: We're gonna go through

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Pain Management: I don't know how to do that

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Tina Marie: I can do all of that. We can do that right now. Let me just create a tab and um. We'll just. We'll just work through this and see how it works.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Tina Marie: One second rename. Schedule.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Pain Management: Also I just realized it.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Pain Management: If someone made a mistake, and these are these are all like erase Like.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Tina Marie: You know that you can go to file and um version history and restore

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Pain Management: How. Okay. I I don't know.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Tina Marie: Let me screen, share and show you stuff

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: I got you, girl If anything happens and

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Tina Marie: You have what I would call a fire, you know, in business, which is Your business is in dire

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Tina Marie: Need Right. You can't serve your clients, or something really bad happened. You can call me, and I will help you with anything

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Tina Marie: I don't want you to have fires, but if you have them I've got your back. I'm I'm serious

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Pain Management: Thank you.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tina Marie: Uh, especially if it's these technical things that are overwhelming. So I'm gonna do everything we can to create situations where you're not going to have them

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Tina Marie: But if you have them. Then let me know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Tina Marie: So. I'm just gonna

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: Uh I don't want to copy formatting. We'll format it later and make it look good. So

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tina Marie: The 1st thing that we're going to have here is Dates.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Tina Marie: We'll figure out what the date is. Patient name.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Tina Marie: Um Source.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Tina Marie: So sweet, James, or whoever right

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Pain Management: Oh, I are we gonna like, do it like this now. Rather than them.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Tina Marie: No. But this is scheduling

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Tina Marie: We're talking about making a scheduling page What? What? Uh! I must have missed something. What's going on

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Tina Marie: Because schedule this is is this, you don't have this scheduled here right? Well, you do actually

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Pain Management: These are Yeah, we do. That is just get I I was just thinking of. Should we add, like a a row there where we all communicate like we were saying. For example, Erica

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Pain Management: Pm. Um

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Pain Management: What's it called that um? Uh kenya call

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Pain Management: So it's like. Call patient, awaiting for

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Pain Management: Response or pending schedule. Things like that like for Maria to see That way. If she answers the phone

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Pain Management: Cause. I I mean either that or signal. But we're gonna drown, get drowned on signal messages

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Tina Marie: So this could just be a um. Today's notes kind of tab, right? So maybe this is just a working schedule of Um a date and time. But it's always just today, date and time

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Tina Marie: Because anything that is long lasting is going to go here right

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Pain Management: I'm sorry. So this we have a new. They have a new tab to what to put New patients, so

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Tina Marie: Now So almost everything that you need to have done

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Tina Marie: Is done here right. But you want

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Tina Marie: Not lose track of the conversations that are happening today, and the updates Um

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Tina Marie: That are. Ah! So that

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Tina Marie: You look at it, you know. What do I need to do right now? Is that the goal? Is that

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Pain Management: It's more of our our comfort. A a place for all 3 of us. It's mostly them That

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Pain Management: They know what's going on I just don't. I'm I'm worried that they're gonna have to chart on 2 places. I just again trying to avoid too many work for them and trying to. So if we use just, for example, Sweet James, which is the majority, for example, this Jacqueline

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Pain Management: Hernandez Maybe

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Pain Management: The message board should just be right beside it. The 1st BI don't know, and then say, call the patient Left a message, they can erase it. The goal is for us to just erase it. If the task is complete.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Pain Management: Or if they I don't know if that makes sense

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Tina Marie: That that it does. And basically, that's what I was saying is, we could use another tab for. So it's basically a working on right now, kind of thing or working on today

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Pain Management: Yes.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Tina Marie: Board.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Pain Management: Yeah, but not that diff. Oh, but it's gonna be a different tab, though. So they will have It's not on one place.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Tina Marie: Right. But that's because there's already a lot of data. And this isn't by um, the date, right? So You've got a lot of names in here, a lot of things going on

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Tina Marie: That aren't necessarily all happening today

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Pain Management: But will it So, for example, all the names here will be copied directly to this new tab

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Tina Marie: No, only the ones you're working on today And then

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Pain Management: Oh! I feel like there's gonna be more work for them

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Tina Marie: Well, so this, this is what we're going back to. There. There is going to be work. What you have to figure out is the balance between what makes sure everything gets done without mistakes. And then the second priority is

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Tina Marie: What's the easiest to do? You can't start with what's the easiest to do

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Pain Management: Can we do? If ever can? We just do a row here, and then they'll just remove it. The message

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tina Marie: Good job. Have you guys considered slack.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Pain Management: No, we haven't we just using signal. So what is the slack

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
mark sweet: Slack, and Google sheets could talk to each other

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Pain Management: I know my So? Isn't that the same as

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Tina Marie: Stuck, and Deborah might be able to talk to each other too.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Pain Management: Signal

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Pain Management: Isn't that what signal is

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Tina Marie: No. Slack has way, more features. It has channels so you can have channels based off of sweet James channels based on working on today like one of the things I've always done in creating

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Pain Management: Oh! Duke.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Pain Management: So then maybe so. Then another channel for conversation for us instead of signal. We're just getting slack. Then

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Tina Marie: Yes, instead of, but it integrates with lots of things it may integrate with Tebra. I wouldn't be surprised if it does And with um.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Tina Marie: With Google Spreadsheet, where you could have um Bidirectional communication happening. So

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Tina Marie: Slack has something called a slack bot, and I don't want to overwhelm you with the technical stuff. So I'm going to try to give you kind of an overview of it. But inside of slack there are automations and tools that can be used where, if you write something a particular way, it can update the spreadsheet or the spreadsheet pings slack channel where you are and says, Hey, uh! You have an appointment coming up today

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Pain Management: I mean, if this is gonna make it easier for us like So every conversation, or, for example.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Pain Management: How do we? How does slack I'm just trying to understand how it's gonna

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Pain Management: Make it easier for all of us to talk in terms of So every conversation they have they will have to put it in there, just like, for example, I call. I left a message for the patient. If it

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Pain Management: I don't know. I just Trying to see, not to work too much, but at the same time

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Pain Management: Having um place where we all can

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
mark sweet: I haven't I Do you have? Trina wants to stick with what she's

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000
mark sweet: Doing, making it work right now We can pull over all the names automatically.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
mark sweet: To this schedule sheet.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
mark sweet: Uh We're just kind of working through this as we're talking about it.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.000
mark sweet: So put the data loss in their name. I can also add in their phone number Cause they'll automatically have who it is. And then we could do this

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
mark sweet: The worst. And then we could put a note and then have the note automatically. Go back in under the sweet James or other liens

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Pain Management: Do not understand.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
mark sweet: Is that what you want

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Pain Management: Cause like right now, for example, this original one that actually, you know, Cheryl did this There is a part on here that says on row. S.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Pain Management: It says Chona notes. Maria notes So this is like our notes.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Pain Management: For. The this particular patient

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Pain Management: Which we're not using because we just it's just the 2 of us We're just using signal

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Pain Management: Everything is in signal, in terms of You know. But Maria posed the right question yesterday. What if

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Pain Management: I answered the call, and I don't know what the conversation was That Kenya

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Tina Marie: Signal is not a good way to run the business It, it.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Pain Management: I'm sorry.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Tina Marie: Sig signal was a way to get started with communication. It's not a great communication channel for running a business

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Pain Management: So then where do we? That's why I thought Just on the excel. We have a note area where one person

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Pain Management: Wrote something in it.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Tina Marie: So the one issue with Excel is, it's very difficult to access from um, a phone And you're if you want to check things and get an update and make sure it's accurate

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Pain Management: You're right

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Tina Marie: And you're trying to open that on your phone. That's an issue. So what slack can do

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Pain Management: You're right

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: Is, say that anytime something gets updated in a particular column. So let's say it's a schedule column Right. So we'll go to

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: Hang on. Let me move this so I can see Dang it!

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. My zoom window just got Dig.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: Little bit, smaller And that won't move at all.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my! Gosh! I don't know why it won't move at all.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Um

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Tina Marie: Seriously what just happened? Where's my

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Tina Marie: Phone only Oh, there it was!

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Tina Marie: So let's say procedure Anytime that there's a procedure

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: So anytime something is entered and column on. So there's multiple triggers right Anytime anything on the sweet James Tab that has procedure

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Tina Marie: Um Date

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Tina Marie: Or Let's see.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Tina Marie: Basically anything that's going to require you Or one of the team members to show up so procedure or consult right

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Tina Marie: That it automatically goes to slack channel and um Pings the channel, and says.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Tina Marie: Procedure scheduled for this date So.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Tina Marie: Um You're only staying in here, but you're able to read what needs to be done.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Tina Marie: With slack. And then you guys can have follow up, back and forth conversations on it, and it creates a thread

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Pain Management: Sorry, Tina.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Tina Marie: Kind of like in mountain.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Pain Management: And Dr. Is just calling me. I'm letting him know. I'm just gonna let him know I'm in the meeting

00:30:43.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Mark, do you see this

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
mark sweet: It was gonna get funky, but I could probably try to figure out a way where it could pull the source over

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um it it uh

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: Do you see what I'm doing?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, I know yours is Are you talking about with um slack

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Tina Marie: Slack in the Google Spreadsheet

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I mean, slack is I you know I like slack

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
mark sweet: I'm just trying to think of what we can Keep.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
mark sweet: And The sheet for the moment. But yeah, long term

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Tina Marie: I think you can keep everything there. So this would code it so What I'm saying is slack updates for specific columns on specific sheets. Within a workbook, for example, procedure date when the date equals today

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's say so additionally. I would need slack to tell me what

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Tina Marie: Shoot, the Um

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: Data Came from

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Tina Marie: And what column. Um the name, and what row?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Tina Marie: That's their patient. Patient name.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Tina Marie: And what uh Leave. Let what let's see.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Tina Marie: Adjacent. Do that

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Tina Marie: Why? Example.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Tina Marie: Oh, no. Yeah. What? If it was procedure

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Tina Marie: Go away! It's wild

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Tina Marie: 2, 1, 3,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: I can determine On!

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Tina Marie: Other advantage. Under title

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Tina Marie: So it should be able to be Included in the

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Pain Management: So this is the problem, the honey patient and procedure. That's why I need Kenya Um procedure. So patient is scheduled at 11

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Pain Management: He came in at 1128, And he's not seen. He left at 12

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
mark sweet: I'm good

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Pain Management: Mhm so it doesn't matter. It's it's and I was in Lake Forest because I have a patient there. And so

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Pain Management: It was not good

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
mark sweet: Nope.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Pain Management: And it doesn't matter how I appease to staff Like it's not. That's why I need someone there. Physically

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Tina Marie: Imposed. This work week.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Tina Marie: It's Omni Channel On!

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Tina Marie: This week. Today

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Tina Marie: So you can get a link

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:26.000
mark sweet: And the big thing is, I'm just more than anything putting down notes and just communicating, because if it's not in the system, it's not written down. It didn't happen

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Tina Marie: Mark. Can you see this

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It's tough to read on the screen, but

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Tina Marie: I think we can do this, and I think it will create the least amount of extra work Oh, I don't even think it will

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Tina Marie: Create extra work. I think it will solve issues quickly. If we could do this We might just have to teach the ladies how to use slack

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh! But it works really well on your phone, which is what's really important, because these things that you're working in don't work on your phone very well. So you have to be able to get to your laptop. It's too easy to like

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Tina Marie: Let's say you're looking at the spreadsheet, and you're trying to go 3 or 4 columns over to get some data. You could look at the wrong row like there could be. There's too many chances for errors If you're working from your phone

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: If you're not working from your phone, that creates a bottleneck, because now you have to open up a laptop or a bigger device The other thing is, um

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Tina Marie: Slack. Has all the communication power. So

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Tina Marie: You can. You can use this data integration. But you can still use audio clips like, if you just want to leave a voice message You can do that with slack

00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Tina Marie: Slack will also, like signal, transcribe it immediately. So if the person who's receiving the message can't listen, but wants to get the message, they can read the Transcript Um. It also means that you've got

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Tina Marie: A great um Paper trail, basically of all the conversations that happening

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Tina Marie: You could if you wanted to. Add Dr. Ian to it, where he only has access to one specific channel, that you allow

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Tina Marie: If you needed to, at any point where he doesn't see everything just A communication with you if you, if you wanted or needed it.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Tina Marie: Because we're thinking about scaling signal is definitely not scalable. So the sooner you get a system implemented that can scale

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Tina Marie: And work well, the better. The learning curve should be relatively short, and I'm happy to help

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Tina Marie: And meet with your ladies and

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Pain Management: Yes, thank you.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Tina Marie: Help everybody through it.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Pain Management: So this, the this slack thing will be I I guess going back to

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Pain Management: What I was asking. I I get what you're saying. What? Oh, this is scheduled, this is not. But what about those conversations? Where

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Pain Management: Left a voicemail to the patient Um. So they have to message on the slack, too, or they have to do that on the excel, and it will be sent to the slack like I'm trying to understand. Like

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, um, so there's there's 2 types of communication that that we can look at this way right What communication needs to make sure that you're where you're at when you need to be there. That's 1 type, right

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Tina Marie: So managing you and your timer schedule. The other is Just a log

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Tina Marie: For what's happening with the patient, so that you know Um. That kind of stuff should be in here that makes the spreadsheet get really long. But

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Tina Marie: Um And that is actually why something like Hubspot is much better. Or Tebra

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Tina Marie: Over this.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Pain Management: So so right. Now, what? What's been what we're doing with um.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Pain Management: How do I say this? What we've been doing with Tebra, how they're doing it with Cheryl, and the insurance is, if a staff Do something. Call the patient. They put a memo in the notes

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Pain Management: It says, call the patient to schedule appointment. Patient States is not available. We'll call back

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Pain Management: So that's all. In the memo in the patient chart So is that a good way for us to also communicate? Um, you know I'm not entirely sure

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Let me let these guys out. Hold on!

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Tina Marie: Ouch! Done

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Pain Management: I'm calling by the hospital So annoying.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Tina Marie: The. We'll give you an example for

00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Tina Marie: Suite law. They have all the client. They have a list of cases that they're going to take care of. And everything has to get touched regularly. And so there's case review and looking at the notes. When was the last time it was touched. What's the next thing

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Tina Marie: Um You basically have the same type of situation. But they're patients

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Tina Marie: And Really, somebody needs to look at this top to bottom every day

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Tina Marie: Look at every line and say, Where are we at with this thing? Now, when somebody is

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Tina Marie: Closed right case closed Um, that we don't have to keep looking at that. But there's going to be a long list that somebody needs to take a look at.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Tina Marie: Every day and make sure that's being touched and looked at That's a little bit tedious, but it really is the nature of the business

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Tina Marie: Um Yeah, I don't. There's not really a better system

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Tina Marie: Uh to do than than having system uh Where you have the overall notes.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Tina Marie: But then there's basically something that's more of a task related. Which is, where does Tona need to be today? Where does Kenya need to be today for procedures Those types of things. So you've got

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Tina Marie: The overall log Right of what's happening

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Tina Marie: And then you've got the log of What you and your team need to do. Does that make sense

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Pain Management: I think I think that

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Pain Management: The only thing that really is Kind of

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Pain Management: I'm just looking short term. It's very hard for me to look at long term at this time, like my mind is just What is just needed.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Pain Management: That Maria pointed out, which makes sense is Who's gonna

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Pain Management: Answer a phone call like if someone, if Kenya answers a phone and she talked to this patient and she calls back I'm so sorry Maria is calling. It's probably about the patient

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
mark sweet: So, Tina, I think we just had Really simple.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:15.000
mark sweet: Note near where their name is, and then we can have just another column that just has initials Because they're all very different initials. And that way, you know, who wrote that note

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
mark sweet: We could just put a note in a timestamp

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so. The problem is

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
mark sweet: I don't love it, but

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Tina Marie: The problem is in a spreadsheet versus a database like Tabra is that You start to get lots of text, and then it gets difficult

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
mark sweet: Right.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Tina Marie: Get really huge, or if you don't wrap it right so that the rows stay the same. Then you've got to read it up here in the column, header. That begets that that becomes difficult. Um, I feel like that's going to create overwhelm really quickly, because it's not

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Tina Marie: Designed. Well, there's too much data For each patient

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Tina Marie: And it just gets Very big. Very quickly.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Tina Marie: Um And let's say that you did just put in a note

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Tina Marie: And and the person's name next to it. Let's say you

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: Left a message with the patient, patient, called back, tried to reschedule They weren't able to do it like, you know what I mean, like, it just gets longer and longer. So

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Tina Marie: I'm I don't know I think that uh

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Tina Marie: I think I think that slack is probably the best idea Or

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Tina Marie: Tebra. And somebody just looks at the notes, but I

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Tina Marie: I'm afraid that there's going to be a a gap, because I don't see how that's being used And then, and then

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Tina Marie: The conversations. I think there needs to be a channel in real time, and I don't think it should be signal Just because

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. You can't have really. Threads in there that work really? Well, you can't compartmentalize

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Tina Marie: Based off of maybe what's happening today. What's happening this week Maybe what's happening specifically by um.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Tina Marie: Sweet James, or whatever, because I think you do have to think about scale I don't think you can just think about today, cause you guys are growing too fast

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Tina Marie: What are your thoughts? Mark.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
mark sweet: I mean, there's a lot of things that we can do with this

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Tina Marie: You have an idea Yeah.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:47.000
mark sweet: Um Also, I mean, just even in the interim, just even using G. Chat could work if they just want something simple to try chatting back and forth with each other in a group

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Tina Marie: I've literally never used it so

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
mark sweet: Cause they're all in Gmail, and there's that chat function

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I know it's there. I've never used it And I don't know what you can append to it or not append to it. But

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Tina Marie: That stays within the suite, and is probably mobile, friendly.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
mark sweet: Uh, yeah, it's pretty mobile, friendly, and then you can search

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Pain Management: Sorry. I'm sorry I miss. I miss

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
mark sweet: You missed a lot. Um, it's okay. We'll we'll we're still trying to figure out a solution to this problem. That is easy for

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Pain Management: And and okay. In the meantime, is it better that only it? One person answer the phone because Mark is saying, the purpose most important is that it? They're all both. Their grasshopper will ring at the same time, and whoever answer but

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes, if you want to avoid issues and mistakes. And 1st of all, you have one person accountable. If that happens Um, and you can have kind of like a a chain of command. Right? So

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Pain Management: I'll have Maria be

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Pain Management: I'm thinking in my head. This is this is And Mark says the Internet is not good, is like, have blocks of time. For example.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Pain Management: Especially Maria, will be with me With all patients. Um, that is scheduled. She's gonna do the pre-assessment, the charting

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Pain Management: And sometimes she's on the phone with the patient and the phone rings So Kenya should answer, but

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Pain Management: Is it better to just have Kenya answer all call like I'm trying to see

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: I think it'd be. I think everything would look better if you have one person answering all the calls Unless it's medical, and they need to talk to Maria or or you

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Tina Marie: But as far as like processing calls, I think it would work best if you have one person to do it The theme that you need to plan for is what happens if Kenya's sick

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Tina Marie: What's your backup Then it probably goes to Maria. But you you want to have that plan in place ahead of time.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Pain Management: That's why the plan is to have both of them ring at the same time. There's no one person that will just get a both of them will ring, but The idea was

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Pain Management: I'm thinking, my head just the block of both. For example, whoever is in charge on the morning and then the afternoon will be Kenya. I don't know that's in my head. Maybe I'm

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Tina Marie: At the end of the day you just make a decision and see how it works, and then change it. If work

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Tina Marie: Really.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Pain Management: I feel like, maybe I'm just very much um. Fixated on the idea that Mark Maria asked me that she poses that question like, what if

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Pain Management: That um. Kenya had a conversation with a patient, and I don't know what they talk about. So I feel the the easy fix right now is just to send a message to our group chat and say, no, it's like I called this patient left a message just I don't know. I don't know what's the

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Tina Marie: Then That's what you wanna do, then do it. See if it works. If it doesn't work

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Tina Marie: Get a new system But whatever it is.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Tina Marie: Go ahead!

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
mark sweet: Try this right now, Hon. Can you open up your gmail

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Pain Management: Gmail.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Pain Management: In my phone, or

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
mark sweet: I prefer it on your laptop, but you can try it on your phone.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
mark sweet: Um See how it says like mail, chat, meet.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
mark sweet: I don't know

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Pain Management: Well, wait. Is it the lean side fast way, or might the

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
mark sweet: Yours, preferably

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Pain Management: Chon The chona

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Pain Management: I explained out, okay.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
mark sweet: Okay. Um. Do you see? Chat.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Pain Management: Oh, yes, we! This is what we use now at um Okay.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Pain Management: So.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.000
mark sweet: So um Let me try to share my screen. So

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Pain Management: Right. This is what we use right now, since we just know it's other

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
mark sweet: Uh Yeah, can I share? My, oh, I can. Yeah.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
mark sweet: Morning. That's cool So you can see

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Uh-huh.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Pain Management: So you know, on the spaces. This is what we use right now, for

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Tina Marie: Oh, well

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Pain Management: At the office, and then, you know. Just categorize

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
mark sweet: So.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Pain Management: And there's task

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So this is what I'm thinking in just the interim, we can Do. We can make this just suite teams. We can make this other like, we can make different spaces for different

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
mark sweet: Law firm, so things don't get as confused

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Pain Management: Law Firms. Uh-huh.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:10.000
mark sweet: Again. This is not elegant. So this is, I think, a temporary solution until we can find something better, because it's gonna drive you nuts, but you can do the

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Pain Management: The.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
mark sweet: Tasking, and then you can search whatever you want

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Pain Management: Yeah, this is what we use right now, it actually works in in the current practice With

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Pain Management: With the health insurance patient, so

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
mark sweet: You can task people. You can share things, and you can chat

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Pain Management: Right. Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Pain Management: That's that's what we use right now. We can chat there and

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Pain Management: Um So that means

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Pain Management: Cause. Right now, the liens and email is Maria, so

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Pain Management: Maria, the one

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
mark sweet: I think you both want them still using the same email right?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Pain Management: Hmm.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
mark sweet: Eileen's email So I think you just say, whoever it's

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
mark sweet: Oh, I get what you're saying. If you're trying to

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Pain Management: Yeah. So then it will be they can. Oh, 2 people can open the same email gmail once, and then they can just

00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Pain Management: But then the problem is We uh! Who the who's talking? Who

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Pain Management: Because they're they're logging on the same email account

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
mark sweet: I think you just have to do the name, or what's Maria's initials?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, initials will do it.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
mark sweet: What's her initials? Hon.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Pain Management: Um Laura, MM.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Then, if they

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Pain Management: This.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
mark sweet: Do that, and then you add it as a task It's there

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Tina Marie: Well. Okay, so is that

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Tina Marie: Am. I'm the one who left the notes, because I think what you should do is Have the um. The person who left the notes leave their initials

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Pain Management: Yeah, that's what I was trying to say is like

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Tina Marie: So. After pretty you go dash Ms

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.000
mark sweet: But

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Pain Management: So it it like right

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
mark sweet: They can delete it, and then you can also have date and time, so this will always help them be a little more organized

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Pain Management: Right? So it's like, for example, right now we put the title is the patient names. I'm writing it right now, for example, itinerary And then the details right? This is what we do right now in the clinics like

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Pain Management: Um cold, patient. Awaiting for call back

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Pain Management: And then this is Kenya Or Kenya

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Pain Management: Right that we they don't need to assign anything. And it's right right there. I just put on a Tess.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Pain Management: You see it? That's that's it.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Pain Management: And then that's where we. And then once it's done. For example, the patient called back, and we did it

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
mark sweet: You want them to add in the date that way. You know what day it was. I would have them do that

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Pain Management: Okay. Then, I guess today. And

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Pain Management: This is actually a good way for everyone to have um Cause. It's it's

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Tina Marie: You should open it on your phone and just see what that looks like there, too, because I I think it is important that whatever your solution is

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Pain Management: It's the same. I I you. You open it on. Gmail. Yeah, this is the. This is, I see the the images, I mean the info um. The notification that says this is created a task, and

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. This is awesome.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Pain Management: And then We basically, once it's done, and it's all in here

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Pain Management: Once it's done, and then we just click the tasks, and it's done like, see? It's gonna be gone Yeah.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Pain Management: I think that's what

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
mark sweet: But you can see it's completed, and you can see who completed it.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Pain Management: Yeah. And you see, who completed? Yeah.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
mark sweet: So I I don't think there's a great long term solution, but I think maybe short term this will work

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Pain Management: I think this is a good way for us to just Kind of have conversation on which, yeah, this makes sense

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
mark sweet: And you can see at the end of the day who didn't finish. What then? You can jump into whatever you might need to jump into

00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Tina Marie: Fuji has everything inside of Google. He he did finally start moving to Hubspot. But like they were doing everything with Google, they've got some different add ons Um that they use in their calendar. I don't necessarily think that it's great, but

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Tina Marie: Um, there might be some ideas that he has for you. I think this this I I think it covers everything because you've got your spreadsheet and your dashboard

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Tina Marie: This allows for the communications. It's mobile, friendly. It stays in your suite I don't like you're talking about not being scalable, mark

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Tina Marie: Or maybe long term I don't know why it wouldn't

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
mark sweet: If you've got 4 or 500 people The task. It just can get a lot

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
mark sweet: Oh!

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Pain Management: No, that. That's why you you uh complete it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Tina Marie: You. Right? Yeah. So it clears the deck. It's not really about the people. It's about the day, like, how many are you doing in one day. You're not doing 400 people in a day.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Pain Management: I mean not yet. But no.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Pain Management: Done And I,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Pain Management: Um So.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Pain Management: Okay. I I'm I forgot about to say um. You think it's good to just have people like um. Them

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Pain Management: Have separate emails like Kenya and Maria. But the problem is I want them to have

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Pain Management: One email just coming from leans I don't want like coming from Kenya or coming from Maria

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Pain Management: Right. So we shouldn't have a separate email for them.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Tina Marie: Um Not that I can see. It depends on like, why would you want separate ones

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Pain Management: No, no, it's just that It's just specifically for that purpose of uh the the task, because right now, like

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Pain Management: Uh, for example, at Maria.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Pain Management: You know.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Tina Marie: Well, so In in terms of like extra level work

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Tina Marie: If you wanted to have them communicate in here, they could have separate accounts, so like Maria at Fast paying, Doc. And then all that would have to happen is that profile picture up there on the top right. They would just click switch accounts

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Tina Marie: Which is actually really quick and really easy, very fast Um so they could switch accounts to do the communicating

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Tina Marie: And then switch back. And they would just need to make sure that they're they're sending an email that they're in the right account But it does create an opportunity

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Pain Management: Create

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Tina Marie: B, for m

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Pain Management: Yeah, you're you're right. I don't want that

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
mark sweet: Also there's a cost associated with it, too.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Pain Management: Yeah, no, that's fine on the task. They can just put their initial at the end, like K

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Pain Management: Mc. The good thing is, we're all like Different initials that we can just do that

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, unique.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Pain Management: So that it's just gonna be 3 of us. Obviously, when we get bigger we'll figure it out But right now it's definitely, I think this is, this is okay. The task I I forgot about this

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and I've never seen it. So I don't

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Pain Management: So I guess it's better instead of signal. We can just chat here, too, cause on that on that task, for sweet James, like

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
mark sweet: That

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Pain Management: We can just write. Stuff there.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
mark sweet: Right, and then you'll just make another space for the other Law Firms.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Pain Management: Well, yeah, I think.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
mark sweet: You want me to do that, or you know how to do that.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Pain Management: Um I I can figure it out

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Pain Management: Browse space. I know How do I do that

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Tina Marie: Right there.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Pain Management: I know.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I was gonna say something, and I forgot what it was. Oh, the other thing is um, just as you're doing this Nomenclature. Right? So

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Tina Marie: Using things like maybe in the tasks title like urgent today. Or um.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean, like different prefacing messages in a particular way. So that let's say you do get really busy. You're really big Um! How do you make sure to look at the most important thing

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Tina Marie: Now like urgent this morning. Urgent this afternoon, urgent this week or not urgent, whatever you know what I mean, like a few different things that as soon as you look at it, you know, do I have to look at this right, this second, or instead of having to read the entire message. Do I need to look at it right this second, or let's say you've got 20 messages Which one do I need to read right now

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Pain Management: Can we just like use this signal as the urgent So that way, we just have 2 plates

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Pain Management: I don't know

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Tina Marie: That will cause you too many problems. As you scale I honestly, seriously, just having a few different phrases

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Tina Marie: And you'll discover them As as you go through it, and as you get bigger you don't necessarily need to think about it. Now.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Tina Marie: But if the messages get long and overwhelming, then, using a simple system of Um, framing each message with a couple of words that you know. Look at this 1st

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Tina Marie: This can wait a little bit. That type of thing It. It will just help you be able to work faster and with less errors

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Pain Management: I was more thinking, more of. They have to treat Everything is

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Pain Management: They need to respond right away Is. That's what I was trying to

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Tina Marie: I meant for you really.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Pain Management: Ah, for me. Okay.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Tina Marie: So. So you, yeah. So your team needs to respond to everything right away. You don't necessarily need to, right because you're paying for them to do that for you

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Tina Marie: So. Um! If it's a message for you to respond to, then they could Let you know this is the one that you need to get to right now. This is the one that's later this afternoon, or something like that.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Pain Management: So I'm going to

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Tina Marie: I mean, it's a good point

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Um. She's gonna start Monday, and Maria

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Pain Management: We are all gonna be together on a Tuesday. So do you, are you This is what I'm gonna talk to them about. Is this task

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Pain Management: Um, that we need to do in terms of the phone call. Everyone agreed that both of them should just get the calls, because the point is, everyone should answer the call or text as soon as possible.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Pain Management: Right.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Tina Marie: I, I say, try it and see if it works that way, and if it doesn't, then make an adjustment, because there, there is really no way of knowing what the best thing is until you do it. You know

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Mhm.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Tina Marie: So whatever you feel most pulled to start there And iterate, if need be.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Pain Management: Okay. Oh, yeah, see, that's what I remember. Sorry.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Pain Management: I just feel like my mind right now is kind of all over The place.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Tina Marie: Do you remember the learning to drive metaphor? We talked about Where.

00:59:48.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Tina Marie: When you 1st learn to drive, you have to process everything constantly, and it's all just lots of information. All at once But then after a while it becomes reflex, and it doesn't stress you out so much because you just know what to do reflexively

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Tina Marie: You're still in the learning mode, because you're still building everything. There's a lot of new information to process You can't get to a point where you're in maintenance, and

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Tina Marie: And just being able to relax a little bit. Everything is mentally exhausting By nature of the business you're you're building, and you're creating

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Tina Marie: But it won't always be like this. So taking, you know. Just doing what you can to

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Tina Marie: Um Not be mentally fatigued. So building the system that prevents errors

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Tina Marie: Like we're talking about here Um in the way that you communicate, and the way that you organize things will help

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Tina Marie: But it is going to be mentally taxing for a while It gets better

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Pain Management: And also I don't Once.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Pain Management: And I cannot control. I think Maria is doing okay. Maria is definitely doing good. I find myself

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Pain Management: I'm trying not to multitask. But it's like, make sure that this email. Yes, I already take care of that, like she's on top of it. But I just feel like worry that we're gonna miss something Um

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Tina Marie: So are you micromanaging

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Pain Management: I feel like I am At the end of the night at night time. I look at the emails

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
mark sweet: Hey? So I've got to jump because I've got a 1 o'clock. I'm already late for so

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Pain Management: Bye, bye, Han, thank you so much. I know we have to go

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Pain Management: But

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tina Marie: So here's what you can do if I mean she seems really smart

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Pain Management: He is.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Um You have to make a decision and decide what would be worse for you. Long term

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Tina Marie: Would it be worse For a mistake to happen, and then you correct it, and

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Tina Marie: And learn and decide if Maria can Be corrected and it fix things, or would it be worse for you to face burnout because you're doing your job and her job, even though you've hired her to do her job.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Tina Marie: I would say that the burnout is more dangerous to your business Because when you're burnt out you're more likely to make mistakes yourself.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Pain Management: Mhm. I agree.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Tina Marie: And the reality is, Chona, that everybody that you work with works with human beings. So everybody has dealing with mistakes And human error from time to time especially newly established people. So for the sake of your business, I would say

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Tina Marie: Stop. Micromanaging. Let yourself have a little bit more mental rest

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tina Marie: And you know, maybe once a week, just go evaluate things or as needed, but not on a daily basis. Not at the end of the day, when you're exhausted

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Tina Marie: And then just know that she is going to make mistakes. You're going to make mistakes Fix them as they happen, improve the system.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Tina Marie: But Do what you can to avoid. Burnout, which means not doing other people's jobs.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Because If you have to, then you hire the wrong person

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Pain Management: Yeah, yeah, no, you're right, cause I I did not hire the wrong person. I hired the right person, and

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you're right?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Pain Management: I'm just um. I'm very grateful. And I I you know I that's why I'm grateful yet again that we found one miraculously That everything seemed to happen. Um!

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Pain Management: I asked for help from one of the director she's actually calling me. I'll call her soon. She helped me

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Pain Management: You know she's helping me. Remember the other director, Cheryl doesn't like She manages the cell phone

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Pain Management: Yeah. The talk. She talked shit, too, but she's managing here in in the South County like for us, where Dr. E. Just acquired a big location

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Pain Management: And that's where Dr. E. Wanted me to, because it's nicer. It looks nice, but It's not centralized. So now. And also with this

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Pain Management: There's a lot of pressure like it's getting You know, like the self sabotage, you know the

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Pain Management: I'm worried that what if I failed, and what you know? The what if sick having that doctor is like? Let's fix this one like this is, gonna be the lean department, and we have 2 patient rooms that we're doing

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Pain Management: It's it feels like it's getting really real. Not that it's not already. But right now I'm just so focused on seeing cause I'm I'm the one seeing the patient. I'm the one doing Demos. I'm the one making sure and trying to build connection which I am But

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Pain Management: I don't know. I just feel There is excitement. But there's more worry because I I worry that I'm gonna not be able to

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Pain Management: You know. To do good and shareable

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Pain Management: Doesn't matter What she said it. It doesn't, and it does, but it

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Tina Marie: He does not matter.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Pain Management: It shouldn't matter, because

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Tina Marie: Right, right. Um

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't As much as it's hard to believe it

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Tina Marie: Giving energy and power to other people's judgment is a choice that we make it. It feels like it's not because it feels like We just feel that

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Tina Marie: But we can train ourselves to let that go. It's a practice of self-talk Just

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't matter. I'm doing the best I can. It'll be what it's going to be And

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Tina Marie: All you can ever do is the best you can do. But But when again, when you worry, you just borrow trouble from the future, and most of the time none of those things even come to fruition

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Tina Marie: So you're giving yourself real pain. Over an unreal

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Tina Marie: Situation.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Tina Marie: And the reality is You get amazing feedback

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Tina Marie: You from your patients, from the people that you're working with From the the people that you're hiring. I think Maria probably loves you. You

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Pain Management: I wanted to

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Tina Marie: There's so much good happening you like, lean into that and trust that There is way more good than bad. So really.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Tina Marie: What is there to be afraid of? And then the other thing is is that all good things come with the price And there is a pain in that price. But if you already know, you're willing to pay that price because the good is so good and worth it

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Tina Marie: Then just be like, Okay, well, if pain comes. It's worth it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Pain Management: You're actually you nail it like when you said I feel like everything is coming along very nice. And Mark's like, well, because you have me. That's why it's like, Yeah, I know. But

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Pain Management: My point is, I feel like there's a shoe that's waiting to drop because I'm pessimistic. I'm worried that Something is gonna happen because everything is in line, like perfectly, even

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Pain Management: Like Javier, the one who's gonna do the the room I mean the renovations, like I have 2 weeks free before I go through, and it's like everything is coming along so fast And Dr. E. Is putting a lot of

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Pain Management: Trust. In me.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Pain Management: And I I'm I think I'm doing good. I'm just worried that I'm I'm I'm gonna make a huge mistake that I won't be able to fix

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Pain Management: Um, or

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Tina Marie: That's not very likely. It. The fact that you'll make a mistake is likely and probable.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Tina Marie: That it will be detrimentally big, is highly unlikely You're meticulous. You hired meticulous people, you built a good system, you communicate. You put the effort in

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Tina Marie: It's highly unlikely that anything that big would ever happen

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I definitely feel very stressed out. And this is the 1st time in my Life, that I have this much pimple

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Pain Management: I don't know. It sounded very shallow. I've never had this much before. Like

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Tina Marie: No uh no. Yes, our skin. That's a big deal. Skin hair, whatever, all of it. It's yeah

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Pain Management: Like. I I was like I never had. I was like, Oh, my mom, and my mom is very typical Asian mom, like would tell me. I'm gaining weight. You lose weight with all the very

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Pain Management: Physical, and he's like, why you have so many pimples. It's like, I know

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Pain Management: But it's all good. I am very um, and I find myself Talking, louder.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Pain Management: And you know, and to me that just means I'm getting more confident

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Tina Marie: And assertive

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Pain Management: And getting more comfortable

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Pain Management: But at the same time I find myself getting irritated very easily, like Like this procedure didn't have. My doctor is like Dr. Is telling me like I know this patient left, and then I know

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Tina Marie: Let me tell you I I do have to go soon. But let me tell you something that happened to me is I over corrected, and this is my experience with all women who have been holding back

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Pain Management: Oh, sorry!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Tina Marie: So when we finally find our voice and our strength, and our confidence and assertiveness. We almost always overcorrect. I haven't seen anybody who did not overcorrect

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Tina Marie: So you go from being kind of mousy to overbearing But I didn't have anybody to teach me that I didn't have anybody that I

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Tina Marie: That would that could approach me, that understood it, that recognized that who could guide me through it? So be aware of it, and choose the kind of person that you want to be. So there's a difference between being

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Tina Marie: Assertive and confident and overpowering But you don't want to become the person that was dominating you.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Tina Marie: Right. So.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Tina Marie: It's a very fine line, and most of it is internal Most of it is not how you speak.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Tina Marie: It's what you feel If you feel like I'm talking to you, and I hear you saying all your things. I don't give a fuck. What you say I'm going to do what I'm going to do

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Tina Marie: I don't have to be loud about it. I don't even have to acknowledge you. I'll just look at you like Okay.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Tina Marie: Buy or, okay. Um. You're fired or okay, we're not doing business together like whatever you don't. You don't have to raise your voice. You don't have to talk over people and just say, Look.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Tina Marie: Um. I heard you This is what I'm responsible for. This is how this is going to be, or I heard you

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Tina Marie: I'm willing to concede to this and this, and this, or I heard you and I have questions, but Just be aware of who you want to be and who you don't want to be.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Tina Marie: So you want to be strong and confident and not overpowered. But you also don't want to be somebody Who overpowers other people, especially when those people are ones you brought in, because you respect them and honor them, and want to hear from them, so encourage them, and

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Tina Marie: It's hard to learn all that But most people aren't talking about that and teaching you about the transition

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Tina Marie: From being small to going big and the over correcting. I've never heard anybody talk about it So.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Tina Marie: What are we supposed to do right there? We're just told. Be yourself, woman, I am woman! Hear me roar! Blah! Blah! Blah! Okay. Well, but I don't want to be a Browbeater. You know what I mean.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Tina Marie: So it's good that you're being self-aware. And

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Tina Marie: You're growing, but you're also going with. But maybe, am I going where I want to go? That was all. You

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Tina Marie: So just keep thinking about that, and be like All right. How do I want to be? Some of it comes around to

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Tina Marie: Just choosing not to have certain people in your life And not doing business with certain ones

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Tina Marie: Or Speaking to them in a particular way, and being mindful of speaking to other people in other way. If that makes sense, you know what I mean.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Pain Management: Uh-huh.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Tina Marie: So showing up. In relationship to who you're talking to.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Tina Marie: In the way that you need to right, because I talk to children differently than I talk to adults. And I talk to Um

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Tina Marie: Strangers differently than I talked to my friends You know what I mean. So we all have

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Tina Marie: Different. Versions of how we communicate

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Tina Marie: And even though it may all be business We're all different. They're they're all different um types of relationships. So

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Tina Marie: Maybe something to

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Tina Marie: To think about. And just Just how you want to show up, but you're growing so fast. There's a lot to process all the time.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Pain Management: I know.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Tina Marie: So you're going to make mistakes in all kinds of ways, because you're growing so fast So give yourself grace, but then also be like, okay. But what? What do I need to

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Tina Marie: Fix, now And then focus on that thing

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Tina Marie: Get it under control, then go to the next thing. That's all you can do

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Pain Management: Okay. Will do.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Tina Marie: I'm excited for you, Ben, to have both of these ladies. If Kenya works out, and America is so awesome, so

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Pain Management: Yeah. That's

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Pain Management: Um I really, I'm I'm I need to set aside something this weekend I need to prepare for this pamphlet

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Pain Management: For Dr. EI know we kind of started it. And now we have a lot more time to prepare and make it better, because it's gonna be um. What do you call that? I don't know. I forgot the term

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Pain Management: Um after this with James, I'm gonna have to do back to back with other law firms. So that's I'm starting big, and then

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, as you have ideas about what you want to do, I can make changes if you tell me what you want to do.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Pain Management: Right. I will. I need to sit on it and Just to be honest on the weekend. I just want to rest. I want to do my ikebana, and I just want to rest like

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Pain Management: That's what I wanted to But thank you so much

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, um, I don't really know how to give better feedback on that, so I guess it's kind of. But but Mark might be able to help if you can tap other people's brains to make it less work on you Like one of your other case, managers, if it's a friend

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Pain Management: Mark. Mark has so many ideas. That's the thing with Mark. You've known him already, and he's like, I have an idea it's like, I'm what is it this time like

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Tina Marie: The other thing is, Tona, there's no such thing as perfect. And what works for one of those people is not gonna work for another, so don't overthink it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Pain Management: Yes, I'm overthinking it.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Tina Marie: You've got everything. You've got, everything there that needs to be there. If you made no changes it would work great

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Pain Management: Right.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Tina Marie: It's not perfect.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Pain Management: Right.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Tina Marie: But you can't have it, because it's going to be relative to the person looking at it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Pain Management: Right.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Tina Marie: So. If all you did was just roll out with what's there? It'll be fine

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Pain Management: I think so, too. I think we're. I'm just definitely overthinking at the end of the day. It's not how pretty our pamphlet, or what we give away. But make sure that I'm actually feeling a little bit more confident that majority of the people that we will meet that day. I'm we're already working with. They already know me. They already know us, but I know they rolling us to the entire depart, the entire company basically with the 60 People. That's a lie!

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Pain Management: So. Yeah, I'm excited. Um.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Pain Management: I'm I'm just wanna make sure that I I just need to

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Pain Management: Just keep on. Consistency is my flaw, and I know this. I am aware of it

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Tina Marie: I want you to do one thing. That, I think is going to help you a lot

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Tina Marie: I want you to have, whether it's a Google drive folder or an app. I think I told you I like the day one journal app But

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Tina Marie: A place where you store all of your compliments, and I just want you to read them every day Because

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Tina Marie: I need you to understand that Everything that you do so, your personality.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Tina Marie: Your work ethic the way that you serve your clients, the team that you um Acquire.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Tina Marie: All of these things Shona People love working with you.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Tina Marie: That's that's reality. There is so much more good than bad

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Tina Marie: There will be issues. But if you could learn to trust that if you just be you and do the things that you do People enjoy that not everyone will be. There will be Cheryl's. There will be some other people, but they will be exception, not the rule.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Pain Management: Right. Mhm.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Tina Marie: And so if you really just if you store those compliments, maybe you'll start to believe that sooner And you can stop worrying so much, and then when you do make mistakes, you can be like Ah.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't feel good. I'll do better, and then you let it go, and you just do better Or not, because we're humans. You know what I mean, like

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Pain Management: Yes, exactly. I'm generally I'm generally good like I, despite I have a confidence boost. I know you have to go. It's like really quickly. I have a confidence boost the other day

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Pain Management: She's like Um

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Pain Management: Is, you know, my pimples and everything I feel, you know. And then she

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Tina Marie: I I get it. I had really bad acne. So yeah.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Pain Management: And And then he's, and then he's like

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Pain Management: Oh, yeah, no. You helped me with this. Um. I'm so sorry, my

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Pain Management: I'm just in a meeting real quick. I'll be right with you She's like

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Pain Management: Pointing. She's talking to my brother. He's in Kentucky. And anyways

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Pain Management: And then, anyway, he's like Oh, you're so pretty! I talked to you on the phone. I was like, Oh.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Pain Management: Oh, that feels good! I'm like, Okay, and it's like my pimples

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Tina Marie: I gotta tell you what I tell my daughter because she's been breaking up is I I hope you can hear this sincerely. Your beauty supersedes that

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Pain Management: Right, right, right. And I know

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Tina Marie: You it. It cannot keep you from being beautiful. There are some people

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Pain Management: It's okay.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Tina Marie: Who, unfortunately. Like, that's all. You see.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Tina Marie: And they don't have aesthetically pleasing features on top of it.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Pain Management: Right.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Tina Marie: And so it compounds You. Not only you physically, are beautiful, but your energy is very attractive.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Pain Management: Right. I think it's the energy, because, you know, we feed off of each other's energy. But anyways, I know you have to go. Thank you so much. I I'm sure it's palpable. My, I don't want to get burnout. I really need to have. It's Mark's birthday next week. We're probably going to go to Vegas and have a massage

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Pain Management: Mark's birthday to 16, I know so

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I gotta write this down. It's

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Tina Marie: Let me write this down. You guys are special to me. I want to know birthdays. I feel like

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Pain Management: And uh If he's

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Pain Management: It's it's the 16, th and we might go to Vegas. Um, that weekend. But We'll see

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Tina Marie: All right. Well. Take care of yourself

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Tina Marie: Just practice letting go of the worry because you're doing the work

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Tina Marie: Don't add to the work with the worry, and then also don't micromanage Trust Maria.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Tina Marie: And be okay with paying the price of mistakes, because The price that you're paying right now is worry and overwork. And that's actually more expensive

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Tina Marie: Than what it will be just to have an actual mistake and then correct it. As it happens

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Pain Management: Right.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Tina Marie: You're costing yourself way more this way.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Pain Management: Right. Thank you so much

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Pain Management: You know. Hope you're doing okay. By the way, with Esther.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Tina Marie: Ah, you both of you ladies! I don't want to cry

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Pain Management: I know I talked to her for a long time. She she's very, I think. I think, when she was asking just the fact that she is. That's why I'm more like, Oh, you're gonna it's gonna work very well with her, because just by she wants to ask questions

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Tina Marie: He's amazing and so beautiful inside out, and it is a joy. So when I get to talk to you ladies like, I feel filled up and grateful, and just

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Pain Management: I think there is um A friend of ours. I don't know if Mark told you, he told me, but

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Pain Management: That I think I don't know if she he asked you already, like I think he's gonna gift you to one of them

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Tina Marie: Oh, for her birthday. Yeah. But then he got quiet. So I was like, I don't know what happened, but I thought maybe he was in

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Pain Management: I think we he's just so busy. He's gonna leave for tomorrow for the San Diego Conference. But

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Pain Management: There. He's a chiropractor, and she, the wife who's actually very good friends with, is the manager of that. So I hope that they I

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Tina Marie: I want all the beautiful smart ladies

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Pain Management: I know. I think they're gonna it's better if the 2 of them, you know, like to do it, but I think she will benefit, but it's for his birthday, but you know

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Pain Management: But I don't know when. But I know Mark told me so. Yeah.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome. I gotta go see my girl. It's Pageant week. Her pageant is on Saturday

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Pain Management: Think. Good luck!

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Tina Marie: I'm so excited

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Pain Management: Here. It's okay.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Okay, big, gigantic hugs, you squishy little panda bear. I love you. Okay.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
