Find my zoom button. Well, I guess you found it.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I found it.
00:00:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I found a puppy too.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't send you pictures.
00:00:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it on your house?
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have it? He is at my house. He has a little cough, but he is the chillest, happiest, sweetest, doggy, and he loves to be held, which is what his job is, is to be a snuggle buddy. And we, we had just got back from a six, well, let's see. I don't know, we left the house at 10 o'clock. We got back at five. So seven at our trip. And he flew from Chicago to Phoenix and Phoenix to here. So he had quite the trip. And as soon as we got home, my daughter had a choir concert that had been rescheduled because of now. And I'm like, I don't want to leave him home right now with these two dogs, even pinned away. I don't want any of them filling that. So Mike, can I just take them to the concert? So I zipped him up in my vest and he went to concert.
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
thus and he was just quiet and happy. How old is he?
00:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All weeks.
00:01:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hey, he's what what concert? It was a choir concert, but there was that's not loud. No, when I was a man. It was the palyca. Oh, but when the band played, I definitely walked out.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, that's too much. Hold on. trying to find because I took like a billion pictures and my daughters would not appreciate it if I send all the ones with them in them. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, that one's cute. Oh my gosh. He's so stinking cute and I can't even keep track. I probably already took like a hundred pictures down.
00:01:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh sure.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
specific one I was looking for. Oh, that one. Okay, done. Dan Ryan. This is on them TV yesterday, actually yesterday was long.
00:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, good.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. He's good. And he's left right by my face all night long. And he did not potty anywhere except for outside until this morning. And it was only poop and it wasn't like the Yigaki kind. But he's on the train. So he didn't even pee in his crate, pee or poop in his crate, the whole trip. He out of the airport immediately would took him for a walk. And he went potty, he didn't go in the car, didn't go on the carpet anywhere.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It was awesome. Nice.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:02:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can't ask for more than that.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, huh? All right. Back to you. How is Dan Ryan today?
00:02:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm at the office. Gonna edit the book for the 19th billionth time, I think. At least $1 billion. God, that dog is cute.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's so cute.
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
everybody's like he looks like a toy he doesn't look real he really does look like a stuffed animal I know what's crazy is my my push on Aphrodite the poodle be song yeah you look exactly like her except with the black how much bigger will this dog get not much he's at three pounds he could be six to eight pounds he only he only weighs three pounds yeah god he must just like he must look so crazy wet oh yeah he's definitely tiny he is puffy then yeah looks I mean whoever's laughing he looks not big her hand is rather large compared to the dog not other good well and that's perspective because her closer to the camera yeah oh he's cute oh but he he fits like if I hold him with it like in the crook of my arm other photo with someone holding in, you can see the hand is very large. His face compared to this thumb, unless this person has a large thumb.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His whole head, that's my daughter. So is his whole head, and we're five, well, she's five four, I'm five two. His whole head, like I could wrap my hand all the way around his skull almost. Speaking of, he has no issues with the car or anything he was just relaxed. passed out and he loves being nestled in the crook of the neck. Like so much, he kept like choking himself out, bearing his nose and the skin. Oh my gosh, Dan. He's so sweet. But he's not like neurotic scary. with the other dogs, he's submissive. Like he crouches down and he rolls over, but he doesn't shake and he doesn't run away. from them, he like goes to them. So he's got the perfect disposition.
00:05:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, we'll see if that changes. It can change, but can change. And hopefully, this cough is just like, maybe from flying and compression, but not like, if he has allergies or something, I'll be pissed off. Okay, well, choose, like, don't want to support puppy mills. I have like a whole long process and everything's worked out pretty well. So anyway, okay, now that I distracted us with doggies, Japan pictures, I was, you know what's so funny is, I don't know why that I thought that was you texting.
00:05:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I didn't look if turn out like, the is that building? Where is she? And I was like, in my head, go, this looks like
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I go oh I think the first place Dexter wants to go when we like don't have to deal with kids and insane exes and everything else is Africa oh boy you love Africa there's a lot of places but Africa is one of his favorites there's a there's this place where animals just come up to the hotel window like giraffes and stuff yeah you just feed them out where you're dining it's crazy um okay is uh Evelyn home yet from school oh yeah she got home on uh Thursday Friday last week Thursday yeah so is she bored out of her mind yet like I'm ready to travel no not at all she she uh she uh occupies herself like she
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm without a car. So there's that.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is she taking Mary with her or is she like on?
00:07:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, Mary was still in school.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:07:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, she has a half a day today and then half a day tomorrow, but then her break starts tomorrow.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see how they do like. Maybe they want to hang out more or not. I already tell you the answer to that. You don't know. No, I know.
00:07:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're they're cordial with each other, but they don't. They bond over making fun of me.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's pretty typical psychological behaviors, though, you know. Oh, speaking of psychology, I got a hundred and one this time.
00:07:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm pretty happy with that. That.
00:07:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. credit. And I'm always about that extra credit.
00:07:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Um, so let's see a book. Iteration do you. I'm. is if you have tried Chad GPT Pro.
00:08:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's fun. Oh, no, Pro, the $200 one? yeah, regular Chad GPT is kind of hell. So I wrote the book with Chad GPT, which I thought was good. And then I tried to get it to edit it and it just kept choking on it. And like, it was really crazy. It was like referencing a copy of the book. I didn't give it. And I'm like, that is not the copy. I just uploaded referencing like what was in its memory, I think.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, forget your memory.
00:08:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Use the PDF. It constantly refers to the book as this is what's crazy. It's been doing this the last two days. I modeled the book after another book and it constantly references that title. And I'm like, that is not the book. Why are you referencing that?
00:08:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, that's from you gone to the memory to look at. Okay, have you gone? Memory to edit the memory.
00:09:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's not in there like it's I went and cleared out a bunch of memory because I remember he got full Right, I don't know how it's remembering this because it's literally from four months ago And I'm like that should not even be in its memory at this point the rate that I use it anyway Then I I was uploading the PDF and it couldn't it wasn't reading it And then it kept throwing all these errors and then it would I would start talking to it about it and then Three prompts ain't it would forget it'd be like I don't have I don't know what you're talking about like I don't have that Then I switched to Claude Couple days ago or a week ago and then I started editing it with so I took the prompts Where the plan that chat TPT had and I gave it to cloud and I said I want to do this to this book And it was like okay, and then we started rewriting it and it fur but it went like very bullet-lifty and I was like this is a book like we need to make like yes it's a lot of information so bullet lists do make sense but like we got to mix it up with like narrative and and bullet points so I think I got through like the first chapter and got it sort of to a place where it is that and then I was today I was just trying to just crank through the other well there are chapters they're like steps so I think there are seven steps together altogether and then but I've since added some stuff to the book and every time I say I'm done okay I'm done although I do actually think I'm done now like I just added a bunch of stuff about audience today so anyway I'm gonna try to get it at least get it one pass to cloud and see what it ends up looking like in its entirety and then I found like I have a subscription to designer the PDF thing so I found someone on Upwork that knows how to use that and they were like oh this is all you need to do like go in there like see if you can find a pre-made layout that you like yeah and we can use that as a jumping off point or I can just run the things through that it's like oh okay so I haven't done that yet so I found her and I said I will hire you when I'm ready because I'm not ready hey uh yeah I hope we get that done today today tomorrow this Thursday okay so let me um let's see I want to put it here or here and mark robert it's like who the stuff that you added to the book is all all right let's give feedback It's very thorough, it's very complete.
00:12:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it Turkey?
00:12:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Say what?
00:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you're eating.
00:12:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, eating. What does it come? Oh, because for the ever like, you would, you would be Jim Dan. were eating Turkey. That was at 11.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Where's my. I can't. I. My document. Okay. what I want. And I want mom. Where's the book? Oh. Well, I'm. You got any. Well, I'm. sorry. So what I was going to tell you is that just because I like to test everything myself. So do you remember I told you that in the summer like chat GPT all of a sudden just started going backwards? So like things that it used to do really well, it just dumped down. And so we have the conversation that they're probably like kind of downgrading it. So to force people to do the upgrade and pay. So actually that's the test I need to run and see how it does on that one test that it used to do well. And then started doing crap on. But I didn't try it in 10. The preview that you get access with the 21 I upgraded because I wanted to see Sora unlimited. I wanted to see everything unlimited for one month at least. I thought I would try it out. But I'm going to also get a $20 account and compare the two. So like apples to apples like have it do the same exact tasks. And then also compare it to climb. The other thing that I'm doing now that I'm done with school, the kids are just everything, so I've got extra time and I'm going to create some AI agents through Python on my computer because I think the instructions are so much easier now and the integrations are easier now and I may try it on two different computers and two different types of agents. I mean two different stacks basically but I do want one of them to be a writing agent and see if we could handle like bigger things so that memory isn't an issue and if I can get it to go through my course which is really long and remember everything and do a really good job maybe we could run your stuff through it and just like on a call or something. thing if you have it all whatever you have organized in the PDF or if you could like zip up your project because Claude will let you zip up a project. I kind of try to put multiple things together anyway we could try it with like a local agent and see how that does. I think that learning how to like if we could understand how to use mini agents you know like local agents and get better with AI I think that there's a lot of things that we could leverage a little bit more but I also think that whatever we're doing because everything's changing so much the market's changing so much whether it be you know leveraging things for another 71 and just making an AI integration make the sale that much better right because you have something leveraged that maybe it processes data at best and it does. good analytics, maybe it can create a great split test for you. I don't know, maybe it can suggest different ways to package things or teach or whatever. have no idea what it would do specific for another 71. But what I do know is that we're all better off understanding how to use these things better than average at the very least for maximum leverage. And so that's what I want to do. Like, I'm not like obsessed with it or anything. I think some people just spend entirely too much time and are losing years of their life. But I do also think that I don't know. Everything is so volatile because we don't know what we don't know. I'd rather know what I can without being obsessed to kind of not get sucker punch when something drastically changes because drastic changes for sure on the horizon and I don't it's not necessarily bad. I think it's less bad for those that are informed and prepared and able to understand it. I also think we're less prone to being scared although you're not scared. I'm not I'm not like the pandemic came and I'm like okay whatever like I didn't dismiss it. I avoided it but I wasn't like terrified and I knew so many people were terrified. Anyway just balanced right but I think that we're just it's easier to stay balanced for doing that. So that's what I'll be working on and when I've got some of them built which I think will be next week even though we're not meeting next week so the week after we might have something that we could run it through if you're still not getting satisfactory results and also if you wanted to if you were able to get it to combine everything that you have. and all of your logic and reasoning. if there are cross multiple chats and you just go and copy and paste it all into like one chat and one PDF with the instructions, then I could run it through a pro and see if you get any better results.
00:18:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it's like I'm so I'm so close to the book right now. like, I don't know if this is making any sense anymore. I That's how I get I have to I'm in the right order. Am I and it like what was interesting Claude? Picked up on yeah, you're you're just sort of like the way that you're mentioning floe is like not right. It should be more what I can't remember the words that I use and I was like, yes It should be because it wasn't afterthought like I started I wrote them into the book and then I was like, oh, I should You know star-pug mofan flow, but I want it to be I don't want it to be a sales letter for flowy, right? And it picked up on that. So this version will do it more like that, like fan flow and mom. So I'm interested to see what it looks like at the end, because it definitely, it's longer, the organization changed slightly. We'll see. And then I'm like, I don't know who the could read this. That would be like, yeah, man, like they can read it go, yeah, makes sense. But like, does it truly make sense to the avatar? Because it's one thing to just have someone go, oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. But you don't really know. How could you possibly know? it can't be Sean and Mark. So I'm like, I don't know we should give it to the current clients and be like, Hey, I need, we need to read this. I'm like, is that just to answer bunch of bands with breed?
00:19:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it's funny because Patrick, um, on Mark's team, he's 28 and he does not read period.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's kind of a joke.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause like, I'll be like, okay, this book, I'm like, well, never mind Patrick. I know he's not going to read. Um, yeah. Anyway, some people just know he won't even listen to audio books or anything. What?
00:20:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:20:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, not podcast. He's a, he goes to the gym. He does his work. And I'm like, there's a ceiling there somewhere. He's very young. So I'm hoping that maybe he'll realize something else, but also. So he's a person that has like natural talent, natural intelligence, a lot of natural bliss. Um, and I think that he just kind of skates by on them. He's like super driven, but he is competitive. Like he wants to be better than Samantha and he's good. So, don't know, I think he might get to a point where he realizes that there's some apathy, and then it's not serving him well, but he is very young, he doesn't have kids, he's single. And I think he's an only child. I don't know. Anyway, profiling, know, that's all I'm doing. But music isn't also, I mean, they'd rather be making music than listening to somebody else's words or reading, there's just certain most right there's average, which you're not of any type, any kind of person average. So it's hard to kind of like, I don't know, compare, but yeah, books. I wonder what they would do though, like what if, what if you could use like Sora to make the content into videos that they'd engage with.
00:21:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I think I use that carefully. He almost every day now, between Descript, I put it into Descript, and then I export the transcript, and then I give it a tag TPT, and I go analyze this, and then it gives me, it's analyzing and summarize sometimes I use and then it gives me an analysis summary, and then I look it over, and then I start asking questions, and then so like today I did that with a bunch of things about Audius. I took content from their site, I took a video that someone did on Audius that they mentioned a bunch of things that I didn't consider, and then I gave it all to TPT, and then I was like, okay, now that you know all this, here's the second on Audius in the book, I would you change it, and it wrote a whole new thing, and I was like, dope. And then I didn't have to watch the 12 minute video, I didn't have to read the web, like I didn't read the web page, I scanned it, I scanned the video, and then I did all that, I also had like, KV, like, Katie had to go download videos out of courses that I buy, and then she uploads them in a series into the description, and then runs the transcription, and then tells me that it's done, and then I go dump the transcription, put it into Chatsy, but he didn't throw out any questions. I watch your 10-hour course? Nope. That's quite interesting.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in your subscription, you have access to Sora, and you only get like a thousand credits, I don't know how Yeah, I already used them all. Oh, what did you make?
00:23:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I know. I used all the credits for the other thing. What's the other thing? The 4.0 version? Apparently, you know that.
00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one is the new version?
00:23:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I just, I think I just updated it yesterday.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:23:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
used the desktop app all the time. I never used the browser, and yesterday I updated. So I just call it yesterday.
00:24:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it'd be interesting to see how that goes. So I know you really want to get the book done, and I know you're working on it today. guess you already told me that. So it'll be done when it's done. Um, Spotify is still waiting for approval?
00:24:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got rejected yesterday.
00:24:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh no, rejected with the potential to do more or what?
00:24:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They give you like nothing to work with. So they said, you can't take an app for a business. And I was like, in what way do you think I made this for a business? So I turned to my friend, Ted TPT. And I said, I gave it their developer docs, and I gave it their other doc that they mentioned as like, hey, go review these docs. I said, OK, we just got rejected for this reason. Can you tell me why you think that would be? And chat GPT wrote the fan flowy description for the Spotify submission last time I submitted it. And it was like, it's probably because you mentioned that a label might use it. And I was like, , that's probably right. So I just re-resubmitted it right literally right before I got on this one. So it'll be my guess is it's from what I can tell. The first time they rejected it just by looking at the URL. So they never even looked at the app. This time they rejected it just by looking at the description, which are literally the first two things you would see when you start reviewing an application. So it's not like they went, this is what's such . Not like they went through the whole app and then were like, oh, but this one little thing is wrong if you fix it. I think what they did was up and up. rejected. Then this time they got past the URL, they got to the script rejected. So they've never even gotten into the meat of what it does and what scopes were using. So my guess is that this time they will. And then we're going to get rejected on scope use of some variety. I don't know what. And then that we can fix and then it will get approved.
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I can grant you one more time. Tell that to chat TPT to see if you can proactively run in front of it, even though it still probably can happen, but at least minimize it.
00:26:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, because I don't know. I had chat TPT write the intent of scope why we were using the scopes. But I think they might reject us because our intent isn't correct. don't know, man. Today the that the URL thing And oh yeah, there's just two And then we might have them build I thought that was already alive the URL thing It was done, but it wasn't live none of this was live because Norio has like a Doesn't let them push live So they work in like dev branch Oh, and then when they when he did let them push it live Last night they crashed all the tools I was like, hey, this is dumb Um, okay, so the back catalog is live Yeah, that's life And the latest release app Yeah Okay So But The whole fan flowy stack Without the spotify app.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you even try to sell it?
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They want to.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is their like, what's the pitch if you don't have it?
00:29:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Everything else.
00:29:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, I get that. But do they think that it's something people will pay for? Will they pay the same amount?
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, they're doing it right now. Right. Their argument is we can we're selling what we're selling it without that right now. So like the spotify is a nice to have, which it is. And then it's another thing that you can say, hey, did replaces this. It replaces your new for this, but. They just brought on. Oh, what's that in? I can't remember the name. I think it's something. Vegas and they've tried like three other platforms and they wrote a testimonial not even testimony. They texted Mark or Sean. forget who and we're like Straight up like I thought this is gonna be another thing where I had to go in and watch hours of useless videos that teach me nothing And get me nowhere. This is the best thing I've ever bought like I'm all it's already working But that's the testimonial you need to have like front and center and all the ads.
00:30:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's super funny No, seriously though Someone else was like, this is the best thing I've ever used it actually but but they're speaking to the objections that other people have so Really got to highlight that.
00:30:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right I guess It sounds like doc trees going to start using it. So the dot tree guitar player is super into it. Like he knows those guys and he's looked at, he's like, I got to get us on this. So I think they're going to start they're going to pick it up.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that's awesome. And that's, I mean, that that alone should be able to be a great marketing campaign campaign. But what is what is the offer? What is the product name like? How do you identify? Like what is there in a brand? Any kind of branding about this?
00:31:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, fan flowy.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's just called fan flowy.
00:31:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then the Spotify thing is just a part of it, right? It's a function called pre-safe plus. Um, but then the pitch is fan flowy, like website, integrate with shopping or funnels, pre-made funnels, pre-made nurture funnels, like, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then we also teach them like how it turned followers into fans, into streams, basically. That's, I have a headline that I wrote somewhere. I'm getting like tons of feedback from these bands that are filling out to submit their song. And I analyzed it a little, but I'll analyze it again. Like we're now getting like, I don't know, we were getting like 20 leads a day at one point. So every one of them has to go through, if there's one thing that you could ask us to bow one thing about helping with your music career, would it be? And the overwhelming answer is to get more streams or get more listeners. So I'll feed that into chat GPT at some point. I had chat GPT build, I gave it the Fletcher method yesterday. So I had all of Aaron's videos downloaded about Making your product roadmap That it into chappy chat GPT. I said, what is this about? So I always make sure it knows And I was like now looking at the book build me the whatever how whenever however it Spitted back to me and it did it built Nine steps for three stages nine steps three actions per step. I was like god damn dude. That's actually pretty good And then I just was like oh move this this should be here blah blah blah And then I had it right then I fed it a million dollar message video. It was like what is this? Okay, great now write some headlines for a fan flowy and it I don't remember them But it wrote like five or six and I was like dude, they're all good I was looking it up so
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, if you look at fan flowy as two words, there's no relationship at all fan flowy one word. They do a good job. the first one is lands down, second one is their Instagram, then we're at 13, then Instagram again. Then everybody ws.com and then a Facebook post of marks, then oh no octopus. And then fan label, but you guys, are you doing anything to collect reviews yet and start with reviews because that is a big thing that people do when they want to buy something.
00:34:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we've got them just from people commenting, but we haven't solicited an actual ad actually have not solicited a review from anybody, a review from anyone.
00:34:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you have reviews. What I would do is see if there's a way that you could just at least SEO fan flowy of reviews and like maybe it's on a. two or something like that, and then hopefully start establishing them through our review process. But just knowing that people would do that, I would at least SEO fan flow in reviews.
00:35:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I we don't even have site. So, like, there's like a single page site that says coming soon.
00:35:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No site. Okay, so what is the ETA for that?
00:35:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I don't know. It's like the, I think the book has to be done. So, the question is like, like today, Mark was saying, hey, so they've converted some of these to make your song people to clients. I don't know how many. It's like two or three. All right. So, of course, you know, Fran Slam is like, we gotta get more. Okay, well, you could just work that funnel better. or that's an option, those leads are 50 cents. it's like, what? should just try to convert that one more, which I will do, which I've already done a little of. And then so today he's like, maybe we should just maybe instead of like getting people and sifting them and figuring out if they're the right fit, maybe we should just go right for the right fit and like do a front facing and like help you grow your music. What do you think? And I said, I think you could do that. But I'm like, you know, he wants to do it through the same mechanism, which is this radio station. Like what does this radio station have to do with growing artists would be my first question. Like why would anyone go, oh yeah, that makes sense. Of course they're gonna grow in bands like every radio station like no, nobody, that's not what I thought people have. So I was like, yeah, you can do it, go for it. I don't care, like I could be wrong, but I do not. think it's going to work. So I said, if you do that, just reuse the exact same funnel and change the call to action on the song, submit form slightly, because it is an alignment that you would want to hear a band that is interested in being promoted. So like for all intent, you can use the exact same funnel, maybe change some of the wording, and then you have like a nearly direct comparison. So then you're running a B, right? Because he's like, we get a B test and I'm like, okay, you're using a word you don't understand, because that would not be B test. That would be a totally new funnel. And you're starting from zero. But if you did it like this, it is more than a B test. But there's zero doubt in my mind that will fail. And it's going to fail on your cost per lead is probably going to be stick seven eight act. So if you're getting a lead, for 50 cents now, the lead for a band is going to be five bucks. right, so then it would come down to, okay, well, what's your qualified lead from that funnel then? Your qualified lead over here actually don't know about hand, but it's low. I mean, it's a low conversion rate. It's like one out of 30, so it's like 15 bucks, maybe 10 bucks. So I'm like, you at least have like comparative data, so you could not go too deep, and you can look at, well, what's my cost per lead? Okay, great. What's my cost per quality? Okay, great. What's my cost per book, Paul? You can do that, then you know, and then, you know, if you get a conversion, it's my conversion, but I just don't think it will work coming from a radio station, but maybe one.
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:39:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Whereas, I'm like, we got to finish the book and then run, my whole thing is to run the whole Alan Sultanate, automatic customer, Maria , like, how do we run, you know, the free plus shipping book, self liquidating funnel, and then you sell it into fan floating on the back end periods.
00:39:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, don't you think though, with the way that the guys like to create content sometimes, I know it's not consistent, but like their Instagram, there's one video, but they do have, you know, like a little bit of a network and a little bit of a falling that, and then who knows what the artists are doing and just the conversations they're having with people they know, would it be. worthwhile to just do basic like SEO stuff for people who might be might have some brand awareness that might be looking but don't necessarily want by the book they're not getting sucked into a marketing funnel they're just sucked into that my friend told me about this.
00:40:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah I mean I don't know what that offer would be like do you know like that would be like a free trial offer maybe and it's like who is like is that going to work right do you do you take time to go nurture free trial people or not?
00:40:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wouldn't qualify them and oh my gosh somebody built an app with AI in two hours and it was just a quiz it was just a super simple like are you this or this are you looking for this or this and it was it was elegant enough
00:41:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so like if you're not qualified you're not qualified and if you don't want to nurture people and ascend them over years of potential right and waste any money and don't but you could at least be like are you here all right if not but I don't know what that is that's the problem we don't know the avatar the people that are on the app right now don't count because none of them bought it that way now so then it becomes and I do have a list of these people so I've thought about this I'm like I should go to shot in the market say where did this person come from like where are the customers coming from right now and how do you go do more of that if they're all network and referral then that's that's a quasi affiliate model so then I go okay well how do we go deeper into that I don't want to do I do not want to do like a full blown affiliate You know what I would do? I would do the IP affiliates.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that guy sent three bands?
00:42:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Great. Tell him he can send more and we'll do this. Oh, this guy wants to refer people great. Let's give him an affiliate thing and then just build that. Like, I literally was going to do this yesterday and I didn't. I want to query the high level group and say, who's done this well? I don't want to just do like, oh, turn on the affiliate thing and run it. Like, who's actually constructed this well? I mean, I'll pay you a thousand bucks to show me how to do it. And then I can go to Darryl and say, hey, buddy, let's make some money together. Like, you're great. You're with a band.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is your third F-bomb today.
00:42:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But I mean, that's the thing. We've got Darryl. We've got like, they're these producers. do we go create a producer and engineer network? They're on the ground. They've got their making a product. And then, Not necessary and then the book thing comes later. I mean, I think you could I think book and That stuff like you can do that to build the community, right? So we set up circle like two days ago So you could use Lee makes and all that stuff and then bring them into the community And then the community would be a mix up people that are on the platform people that are not And you just keep You know Douncing them with value and we like here. Here's this value And then you're just always pointing at fan flow like this is this is what makes the world wheel go round Right like you can go do these things But if you have this it's gonna work better so instead of just trying to Like straight sell someone you put him in this community and then they See it in at they see it in action or they see other people actually like yeah, I want that Okay, great. Well, here's here's the cells. Yeah, exactly
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, a couple of things. The first one was, what if you were able to do some kind of survey that would ask enough diverse questions to allow you to make a great business, artist, and psychological for the point of buying reasoning, right, profile of the existing clients? So, even if they all came because they're friends, right, is there still a commonality between them or are there like multiple avatars that might reveal themselves that show that, you know, whether or not it's an affiliate introduction or they stumbled across something or whatever, the likelihood that they fit one of these avatars is significant enough that we can build a nurture sequence around that, that we might have, let's say you have a single community But let's say that you have maybe forum groups, or topic, discussion, or boards that are specific to the avatar, so that they'll meet meander in and they'll come in and they'll be like, this isn't just generic stuff, this is really, this is who I am, this is where I am. so they're joining the conversation in the community that is specific to them and they can, you know, meander through the other ones and meet other people, whatever, but there would be something that's like laser targeted to who they are and where they are as a conversation, so not a separate community, right? So it's everything's housed under one roof and you can have deputized, you know, people that are already members of the community who are like, I don't really have lives and want to be so full and things like that and be like, hey, we'll give you access to fan flowy if you do this, like, helpless, moderate or, you know, whatever, some kind of bonus instead them rewarding them for helping manage the community because they already want to do it.
00:46:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think you could build the community. I'm trying to sort of have everything be sort of have the hierarchy or the structure of the book, right? So the book has seven steps. Well, step one is, you know, getting your head right, essentially, right? So I'm like, do you just take the community and you create seven, like you have your general discussion area, obviously, then you have your steps, one, two, seven. Maybe you don't, maybe you don't, maybe you just pull them straight from the book and use the exact same title. And then it's like, okay, so that one first area is about getting your head on, right? whatever. And then the next one is like all the copyright and blah, blah, blah, which we I know people are interested in the next one is this the next one's that right? And then maybe there's subs. don't know if you can go sub and circle. And then for each step, there's at least one handout. So you can then go generate which I've already done this. I've already generated leave for under a dollar for how to release us all. The problem was I didn't have a community to put them right? So you could go start generating leads. Get to get the thing. You have to join the community and download the thing. It's like, okay, great. So then you're getting the lead. They're getting the thing and then they're in the community and you've got the email and all that crap. So and then you would know that they came in on royalties or you would know they came in on song release or you would know they came in on band engagement, whatever the hell doing. I figured out the first half to add to run thing to give away getting them in high level, but I have not...
00:48:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know that chat TBT is familiar with high level?
00:48:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, I use a little tab.
00:48:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay.
00:48:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just checking.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I figured you'd do that.
00:48:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, quick aside. I explained the touchpot to Stacy and Eric.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
said, how it's going to work.
00:48:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I thought I could keep him work. And I used, I was only thinking about it in high level terms. And then I said, Stacy, I wanted to take this transcript when I started talking about this and when I ended and give it a chat TBT and see what it does. And she did, and she sent it to me and she goes, it says it can do it. I go, it says all kinds of things. I said, that's great. She goes, what do you think? I'm like, give it to Eric. She thought I read it. I didn't. I'm like, I'm not going to read it. I believe that the first version was so good. The summary that it gave was on point. And then I don't know if she I guess she created a Google dog from it and she gave from gave it to Eric and then Eric yesterday was like, it's done. And I was like, really? I go, does it do this? Does it do this and this? And it didn't do a couple things, but he's like, it can do that. I go, okay, go make it do those things. But yeah, it's done. So chat GPT is chat GPT gets me.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, long left. I thought it drops because I like, holy crap.
00:49:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, now it's kind of perfect. I don't know. But it's the bones of it or there. And it is exactly how I thought it would work. And then the little nuances of what I got weren't in place yesterday, Eric was like, oh, no, but it can do that. He's like, yeah, it'll do that. So, okay, go make it do that. And then then we'll look at it.
00:49:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I won't see this for you because you got your. fashion project, which is music, and then you've got your money project, another 71, and eventually the music one will be that. I don't have those yet, but I, it's in here, and it's with AI, my, because regardless of what greatness I don't have, I have way more than the average person in terms of like, systematic approach, like something like that, right, mapping out these things. And it doesn't matter that there are other people doing it, it's a huge market, nobody's going to capture all of the market. There's a few things where like, for example, another 71 is 11% of the market, money it makes. So that's one of the things I'm going to focus on, because again, volatility and knowing what's there, like, I want to tap into this era that we're in, at the ground level where I think I could probably leverage it to make a lot of money. that then I just use for, you know, offline investments and small things and just set my family and everybody else up for life. But yeah, it's not like giddy love exciting or anything, but it's exciting because I love leverage and also I'm just the cautious, the grounded, excited. But I wear it out right now. I think there's going to be like always a few people who actually see the real potential and understand the pace and are intimidated and will actually like take advantage of it. I think the corporations will, but I also think sometimes corporations get bogged down by just bloat unless it's a tech corporation, basically. And the small business owner, there just aren't enough of the brains to like really dominate everything. There's huge opportunity in what it can do as long as you can find like just a few people. who can help with the implementation.
00:52:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, yeah, can't believe it happened that fast though.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really like to see a video demo of what what was able to be created in like two days.
00:52:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, what's crazy is that like if Mark doesn't jump in, it will have a conversation with the person. If they start responding to it, it will respond back. It's like, well, that's interesting. Yeah, but but the minute Mark jumps in, it breaks on purpose. So if he responded, he'll he gets the response. I guess we could delay that. I don't know. It's like, so I go, now we're going to use it, right? Because then you can then you can find the flaws, right? There are no flaws when you're laying out the idea.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, oh, going to be great. That's it.
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
like the code they released last night. This morning, these guys are like, oh. It's doing whatever and I was like this is this is called developing life Ellis. This is how it goes It was all it was all great on paper and then once you it's on the screen. You're like .
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna change that That's wild. Um, so we're keeping our meeting on Monday, right?
00:53:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
With Mark yeah, yeah Okay, I know he's in he never wants to cancel pretty much Have All the other ones for the most part, right Think we're doing another 71 because Jeff's them out of Jeff was out of town and Then I just sent Bobby some edits on the new sales page So that'll probably be the last one for the year Actually, I don't know we might meet again because we are willing this thing out on January 2nd
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I watch the clock too, because I have an appointment right after this I got to go to. So, I would be like, I'm excited to see what you can do, whatever happens by the time that we talk on Monday, what you did, like, if nothing changes by then, like, to be able to, if there was a way that we could show Mark what's already created, I just think that's good energy to end with the year with like, you know, these are, you can touch people.
00:54:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Look now.
00:54:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my God. Oh my my God.
00:54:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
see though. Eric called the touchpot.
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you please just send a group message to a touchpot version on his live with us, me and Mark.
00:54:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I haven't seen it yet. So I'll probably see it today or tomorrow.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Eric says touchpot version one. Yeah. Yeah.
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Touchpot's reaching out.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God. Two Okay. months.
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
time watching big pink okay i also have the look at the time i mean it's good so let me is there anything to quickly to report about another 71 whether it's books found or stuff launching anything um no we just got the sales page edits everything else like we met with the infusion so peeps they figured out how to do like the other um potential unlock but i don't want to do that one but they figured i figured it out well they started having figured out and was like well you can't do this you can look at that whatever but they got some traction there but we're definitely shelving and i think they look we're just going to do the one that's similar to the other one and then we'll see if people want to unlock the full course because i don't think they will but who am i and if we need to make that code happen, then we are part of the way there.
00:56:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they do with logical things.
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. So I was like, it's just too difficult right now.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, we're not doing it.
00:56:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't mean to interrupt you.
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My brain and my mouth aren't always in agreement. Have you read the book by Richard Thaler called Misbehaving? That is a really good thing to read because it just points out, you know that people are dumb and they do dumb things. And but when it comes to like the logic for what we build, when you're like, but that doesn't make any sense. gives different examples of different companies that made things that didn't make sense or companies that died and didn't do things because it didn't make sense to them. And somebody else did that. And then they beat them out like Kodak and Netflix and things like that. But it would just be a good idea for or reminding us why we need to remember that people don't think like we do. Bikers don't think like we do. They do not do the logical things and so it's important to do tests. If somebody comes up with an idea like if there's any kind of valid process to it like even just ask chat GPT. This makes no sense to me but is there a group of people that's within my customer avatar that it might make sense to it like what is your calculations on percentage of people who potentially might be interested in it and is it enough to like create a split test like maybe we just start thinking differently even more than we have been because I bet we're leaving money on the table by being too logical with what anything like anything I just think I think that we can run through these processes way faster than we ever did before by using AI to help us go like our Are we being too logical? actually like do the majority people actually behave this way? Is it possible that they would you know spend all this money they don't need to spend that makes no sense because they will in some instances. So you know um anyway that's just a thought. I totally have to go. I will probably send you more doggy pictures if you want them. know Mark wants them he's like nine o'clock at night.
00:58:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's like um puppy update. Oh god.
00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what Mark is like half dog in his blood probably like lives for them.
00:58:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably he's like the shaggy da. Shaggy the eye lawyer.
00:58:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. All right well um I will talk to you before Christmas so later but enjoy if you can.
00:58:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Having a house full of women again and make lots of music and have fun.
