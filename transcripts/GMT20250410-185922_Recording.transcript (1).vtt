00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.090
Tina Marie: I know I saw that, but

2
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.760
Tina Marie: I wasn't sure if you took it anywhere from there.

3
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.389
Tina Marie: or if you had seen it.

4
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.915
Dan: Hello!

5
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.650
Tina Marie: Hello!

6
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.559
Tina Marie: Are you there? Can you hear me?

7
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.890
Dan: I can. Can you hear me?

8
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.959
Tina Marie: Yes, but you're muffled.

9
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.740
Dan: Well, it's the best you're gonna get.

10
00:03:58.313 --> 00:03:59.779
Tina Marie: That's terrible.

11
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.390
Dan: This is the same damn headset that worked worked last week. I don't get it.

12
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.037
Tina Marie: I wish I could let you hear what you sound like.

13
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.400
Dan: Alright!

14
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.850
Dan: Right! Hold on.

15
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.699
Dan: speaker, it is.

16
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.099
Tina Marie: That's better.

17
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.163
Dan: No, it's not. No, I can't hear you.

18
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.755
Tina Marie: Oh!

19
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.570
Dan: Somewhat. Hold on!

20
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.390
Dan: Come on, Paul.

21
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.639
Tina Marie: You can do it.

22
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.430
Dan: Oh, it won't let me switch to.

23
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.809
Dan: Why won't we switch the speaker?

24
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.860
Dan: Boom.

25
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.940
Tina Marie: Alright. Oh, now we're all.

26
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.020
Dan: Now we're all copathetic.

27
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.939
Tina Marie: Copacetic. That was not a word you hear very often.

28
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.130
Tina Marie: Actually, I bet you I probably heard it from less than 3 people ever.

29
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.760
Dan: Oh, really.

30
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.159
Tina Marie: Yes, and they're all nerds.

31
00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.820
Tina Marie: I think I'm funny.

32
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.600
Tina Marie: No, but in a good way, though smart, like, very different than everybody else.

33
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.400
Tina Marie: Walk to the beat of their own drums. Yeah, it is not a common word.

34
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.880
Dan: No, no, not at all.

35
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.139
Tina Marie: The trying to. I won't want my desktop to be snapped to grid. Show you options. Hold on a second.

36
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.240
Tina Marie: You're not to grid and automatically organized. So why can't I move this folder that's dumb

37
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.669
Tina Marie: needed to be moved? Oh, sort by none. That's what it is. Okay.

38
00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:52.959
Tina Marie: So what's new this week?

39
00:05:54.781 --> 00:06:01.740
Dan: So the they accepted all the terms, or whatever changes

40
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.770
Dan: of the distro flowy contract yesterday. So

41
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.628
Dan: I don't know. Probably tomorrow, maybe today.

42
00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:22.640
Dan: Got on the worksheets over to Greg.

43
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.580
Dan: so that will finish the book for real Z.

44
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.709
Dan: Once once we add them to the book.

45
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:41.030
Dan: I've been working on a modeling out this whole catalog thing like

46
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.020
Dan: signing that band, the oxymorons, or whatever that shit ain't gonna work.

47
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.689
Dan: It's like sorry, Sean.

48
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.890
Dan: Sorry guys, you know, it would be cool. Not doing this.

49
00:06:54.886 --> 00:06:59.760
Dan: It. It will not make money. So I'm like, what's the point.

50
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.280
Dan: But I gotta finish it. See how bad it is.

51
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.749
Dan: So there's this this idea of like

52
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.360
Dan: I can. Well, I don't think we really talked about this, but the original concept was.

53
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.250
Dan: hey, there are these bands that have a catalog all their songs right? And then

54
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.340
Dan: the I'll give you the the sort of I think this is sort of where the genesis of it came from.

55
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.860
Dan: Is there a band? There's a band called Taproot

56
00:07:30.996 --> 00:07:39.909
Dan: and they are on. I'm gonna say, Atlantic records. I forget who and Atlantic records is like.

57
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.510
Dan: yeah, we don't give a shit about you.

58
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.370
Dan: We're never going to give you another dime.

59
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.019
Dan: You could do whatever the hell you want? So I think

60
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:57.369
Dan: there they will not be released from the label. But then the label also will not support them essentially.

61
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.609
Dan: And so that band's like stuck in limbo, but they get

62
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:07.399
Dan: so, and they own nothing right? So the label owns the entire their entire catalog.

63
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:14.430
Dan: So if they get 1 million streams on spotify, they get $0, and

64
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:27.540
Dan: so the only way they can make money is to play live shows which they get nothing of sell merch whatever. I don't even think they're releasing songs, probably because they're still on the label. I might be wrong about that.

65
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.410
Dan: So they're kind of stuck.

66
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.589
Dan: So either they're releasing. They're not releasing songs because they're stuck in label, or they're not releasing songs because they can't afford to play paper, whatever. There's a reason

67
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.370
Dan: so

68
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:49.170
Dan: so you could go in and buy that catalog from Atlantic. Say, Hey, I want to buy this off of you. I'll give you Xyz.

69
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.909
Dan: and then you would go to the band and say, Okay.

70
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.450
Dan: I now own it, Van Ploy, mom, whatever you want to call it.

71
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:05.900
Dan: And now we're going to put out. We're gonna I'm gonna this is the deal you're gonna earn from your catalog now.

72
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:13.889
Dan: and we're going to start putting out new music. And we're going to start promoting your old catalog building a fan list like do the whole thing.

73
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:20.590
Dan: So in that respect that catalog

74
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.780
Dan: is currently a cash flowing asset.

75
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:34.400
Dan: It's getting, however, many streams a month on spotify, and that is equaling dollars. So there's a value to that asset that you can kind of figure out.

76
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:44.059
Dan: And then there's a value in well, what happens if I purposefully tried to grow this asset right now? Nobody's marketing it right? So it's a distressed asset.

77
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:59.469
Dan: So almost like private equity. You come in and say, Hey, I'm going to buy this thing, and I'm going to put the shit that I'm good at behind it, because I know it's going to make more money. And then in a private equity scenario, you'd be like, and I'm selling this in 7 years. Right? They come in fix, grow, sell.

78
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.340
Dan: Here you come in.

79
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.119
Dan: Oh, sorry, acquire, fix, grow cell.

80
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.150
Dan: Here you come in, you say, acquire, fix, grow, stay

81
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.869
Dan: so you're like you just keep supporting this band

82
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:21.919
Dan: in, you know, in perpetuity. But the music pays off forever, right? Unlike private equity. It's like, yeah. That business

83
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.790
Dan: doesn't have a lifetime of forever. But this mute does right, or it has a much more

84
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:30.709
Dan: certainly a longer life than 7 years.

85
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.420
Dan: So

86
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:42.459
Dan: Haprood wanted us to buy their catalog right? They want to do this they want. So Mark was like, Oh.

87
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.109
Dan: I was like, all right, whatever. But nobody modeled that out. I'm like, Well, what? What do you buy it for?

88
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:55.759
Dan: So then Sean ended up in a situation where his label came to him, and they said, Hey, yeah.

89
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.900
Dan: we don't want you guys anymore.

90
00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:04.800
Dan: We're not going to support you. We do not want to pay for any more music. Your your deal with us is up.

91
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.100
Dan: PS.

92
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.999
Dan: We own a hundred percent of your catalog because you sold it to us.

93
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:19.179
Dan: So that then Sean found himself in a similar situation except those guys are touring. They do put out. They want to put out music whatever.

94
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:27.890
Dan: So Sean needed to by his catalog or want wanted to.

95
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.374
Dan: And this is months ago.

96
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:49.129
Dan: So one morning, like I was laying in bed, and I was like, Oh, he was texting me, and I started devising like, well, how would you, you know, value this like you? There's a fixed rate that you get for a song stream. It's like point 0 0 4. It's like super ridiculously low.

97
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.459
Dan: So, anyway, I came up with a formula, and then I factored in like.

98
00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:07.960
Dan: well, you can't say that that's true, because spotify if spotify is the leading thing right now, and they're leading. I think they have 30, something percent of the market. But they're so they're the market leader. But they drive most of the revenue.

99
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.970
Dan: And it's like, yeah, but that's not gonna be true forever.

100
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:16.019
Dan: So I need to depreciate what revenue would come from that.

101
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:26.699
Dan: So I came up with an idea around that, and I like depreciated the payouts of times. So anyway, I ended up with a number of, and then I. And then I

102
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.859
Dan: put some variable on it, right? So like a

103
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.770
Dan: I forget, like a 2 x or a 4 x, and and I, you know.

104
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:50.270
Dan: justify that. So I forget somehow. And anyway, the number I came up with, I think, was like 200 grand. I was like, yeah dude. This shit's legitimately worth 200 grand. You should go offer them 200 grand as an owner, finance deal.

105
00:12:50.470 --> 00:13:04.150
Dan: And Sean was like, What's that I was like? Just tell them you'll give them like 50 grand, 40 grand down. Then you'll pay the rest over X period of time. But you start collecting all the revenue immediately. So you're gonna basically pay them off with the revenue that already exists.

106
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.600
Dan: And I don't.

107
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.530
Dan: I don't think he really picked up what I was laying down to be honest, and I

108
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:26.090
Dan: be also honest, like I didn't really fucking care. I was like, this is what I get. I gave him. The this is what I would do. I would do this. So he ended up taking all that to them, and he changed the number to 1, 60,

109
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.109
Dan: and they said yes.

110
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:36.860
Dan: and then I don't know why he did this. I wasn't involved. Then he went out. Guess

111
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.329
Dan: you know they didn't have a hundred 60 grand, obviously.

112
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:49.859
Dan: So he went to a 3rd party and said, Hey, I've got this deal over here. If you give me 1 60, I can buy the whole catalog.

113
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.109
Dan: What do you want for that?

114
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.510
Dan: Basically.

115
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:04.270
Dan: So or no, he's he went to them and said, basically, he sold 50%

116
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:11.909
Dan: of the catalog, which was worth 200 in my estimation, or 200, as it's at right now, right? Whatever

117
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.069
Dan: he sold 50% of the catalog for.

118
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.710
Dan: I think he might have sold it for 200 grand, but forever.

119
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:29.070
Dan: So he basically, yeah. So I think that's what he did. He sold 200 grand of 50% forever.

120
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.820
Dan: They gave.

121
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.400
Tina Marie: That's great!

122
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.010
Dan: And yeah of his.

123
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.060
Tina Marie: Or.

124
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.580
Dan: Or.

125
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.760
Tina Marie: Lands down right.

126
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.280
Dan: Yeah, this is about to go down. It may be done already.

127
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:44.949
Dan: Yeah, Lansdowne. So he gets 200 grand. He goes, buys at 1 60 they pocket 40.

128
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.300
Dan: And now I mean, whereas it stands right now, Lansdowne. Same thing. They don't make any money.

129
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.069
Dan: but they'd instantly start making. I think his. I think his catalog does 4 grand a month.

130
00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:02.300
Dan: so the band will instantly start making 2 grand a month. Their plan is to plow the 2 grand back into marketing

131
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.320
Dan: and grow the catalog, and then going forward. They own everything.

132
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:14.250
Dan: but he's also trying to do a deal with another company which I don't understand this, either.

133
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.572
Dan: and I didn't know you could do this.

134
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.210
Dan: So it's almost like a label. In a way.

135
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:28.290
Dan: it's less onerous than a label. Right a label gets, you know, the whales amount 80, 20, right?

136
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:37.329
Dan: He's selling the futures of Lansdowne, hey? With the next song we release you get 50%.

137
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:50.899
Dan: So he's selling the futures. I don't know if it's the next 10 songs, the next 20, the next everything. But he has another deal going, 50% of futures. And it's like a couple. It's like a hundred grand or more.

138
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.999
Dan: So I was like, Oh, okay. But none of those deals make sense to me. I'm like Bro.

139
00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:02.709
Dan: You should have just sold me. I would have sold me 10% of Lansdowne forever for 160 grand.

140
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.080
Dan: and I would have bought it.

141
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.590
Tina Marie: And okay.

142
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.569
Tina Marie: Tell him that. What did he say?

143
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.669
Dan: I think I did, I think. Well, I didn't say me, but I was like, you know, you could do it like this.

144
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.520
Dan: I did the math like it was a 15% return.

145
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.980
Dan: What I had figured out was like for it to be interesting to any investor.

146
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.719
Dan: it would need to be between 15 and 20, because it's a 2015 to 20% return.

147
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:37.129
Dan: because it's just such. A. It's such a weird sort of niche thing, and you gotta beat the market. But whatever so.

148
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.290
Dan: anyway.

149
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:49.399
Dan: I am. So then what happened was this. This low, level band appeared. They met them on the the ship cruise thing that Sean and those guys played at.

150
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.790
Dan: It's this band called oxymorons.

151
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.889
Dan: And they're like, Come, they're like up and coming.

152
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:04.660
Dan: They're you know. They're they're not huge on spotify by any means. But they they were on this

153
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.720
Dan: tour thing on the boat.

154
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.979
Dan: and they met Sean and Mark and them. And then those guys were talking about Fan Flowy.

155
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.410
Dan: and these dudes were all into it. They were like, Oh, my God! This sounds amazing like we need that.

156
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:27.600
Dan: but they were also like talking to labels, and they're like, we don't really want to sign with the label, because they had already signed with the label, I guess, at some point. So they didn't want to sign with the label.

157
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:35.669
Dan: So then Sean and Mark were like, we can do the catalog thing with them, except they don't have a catalog, so we'll just buy into their current

158
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:49.089
Dan: the current streams that they have, and then they have an unreleased album. So they have a whole album that's in the can. So you would get that you'd get your percent of royalties on that Yada Yada Yada.

159
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.760
Dan: you know what would be cool.

160
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.149
Dan: So they're like pressuring me now. It will only be 15 grand. And

161
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.119
Dan: but I'm like modeling it out based on their current.

162
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.720
Dan: So then I was like, though. So then Sean modeled it out. And I was like, dude. These are all just guesses

163
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.310
Dan: like, you're just guessing these these numbers aren't real

164
00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:22.869
Dan: and then I realized yesterday or 2 days ago, whatever one of the bands that we work with presently called Anaria.

165
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.829
Dan: they've been on the platform like from very early on.

166
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.750
Dan: And it's like pre launch. They were around.

167
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:39.640
Dan: So those guys have been running ads and stuff for them since December of 23.

168
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.660
Dan: And the software.

169
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:50.190
Dan: actually, they were using lead flowy. So we 1st started building this out on Lead Flowy. So those guys were on lead flowy quote unquote fan flowy

170
00:18:50.760 --> 00:19:00.079
Dan: like then. And then. So we've been running ads for them, and then they're they've been like, they really. I gotta hand it to them. They've really adopted, like all of it.

171
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:06.899
Dan: Hey? We're releasing songs consistently. Hey, we're going to use all these fan promotions, hey? We're going to run ads to build the fan list.

172
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.620
Dan: And then Mark has been tracking data associated with them.

173
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.390
Dan: And I realized, Oh, wait a minute. If I just treat them as if they were that thing.

174
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.209
Dan: what does the math look like?

175
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.110
Dan: Let me sum it up for you. Horrible! That's what the math looks like.

176
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:34.509
Dan: It's like. You would never make any money. You make more money being their coach than you do, being their partner, or whatever the hell you want to call it.

177
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.700
Tina Marie: Of the of the musicians.

178
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:49.099
Dan: Yeah. So like, there, if you were to be like, if we were to have signed them and invested money and time

179
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:57.079
Dan: into the ad like. So instead of them paying for ad management, we were doing it as part of being the label for lack of a better term

180
00:19:57.926 --> 00:20:03.340
Dan: and then we were getting 50% of their stream revenue, you'd lose money.

181
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:10.659
Dan: You'd lose a lot. Those guys don't believe that I was like, well, I'm not the one saying it.

182
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.780
Dan: or I'm not going to be the one saying it. Once I finish the spreadsheet, so

183
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.770
Dan: I just don't think so. I'm trying to come up with like an intake.

184
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:29.949
Dan: So the early intake is, hey? If a band has less than X amount of streams per month, it's just a no go

185
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.649
Dan: like you could get them on the platform. Get them working.

186
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:44.900
Dan: show them a good time, and then if they catch fire like they're going to be, you know they're going to feel indebted to you, and you're going to have helped them get to that next level. Then you approach them with that deal. But

187
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.899
Dan: there's no point in like

188
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:53.869
Dan: I, the oxymoron guys get like 3,000 streams a month or something. I'm like, it's just too upside down

189
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:04.270
Dan: also. Well, yeah. And then my argument to them is, I'd rather go fucking, sell 3 people on fanflowy

190
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.510
Dan: period like leverage.

191
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.780
Dan: I'd rather spend time generating leads.

192
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:22.299
Tina Marie: Yeah, they're still in the shiny object phase, and also feeling like they've got to

193
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.830
Tina Marie: hustle and make money a particular way, which is making the music.

194
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.569
Tina Marie: but it's not really the most the easiest way to make the money.

195
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:39.899
Dan: It ties more into the the big, the you know, the we want to be a global name, I was like.

196
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.329
Dan: but you don't know how to do it.

197
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.789
Dan: You don't know how to do that. You think this is the way to do it. I'm telling you it's not.

198
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.359
Tina Marie: That really is still their focus.

199
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.669
Dan: I mean they said it 3 years ago. I don't. I doubt it.

200
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.889
Tina Marie: Okay, so you you well, I I would say

201
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:08.479
Tina Marie: 3 years ago, if I asked you any of you what was your main goal? That's what it is. Do you still feel like that is now? And before you answer.

202
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.940
Dan: What's my?

203
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.859
Dan: Their, their main goal or mine?

204
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.600
Tina Marie: There's.

205
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.439
Dan: Yeah, I think that.

206
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.530
Dan: And tell them before you answer.

207
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.660
Dan: It's marks.

208
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.720
Tina Marie: No, it was Sean's. It was Jim's.

209
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:22.800
Tina Marie: I don't know.

210
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.660
Dan: No, I know, but I think Mark is like.

211
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.230
Tina Marie: Oh!

212
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.849
Dan: You know, I guess really.

213
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.140
Tina Marie: It was theirs, because it was Mark's is what you're saying.

214
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.815
Dan: Yes.

215
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:41.320
Dan: I mean, I think they but all except Johnny. I think Johnny's really. I mean, I think Johnny's just along for the ride to a degree.

216
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:54.569
Dan: Yeah, I think that they it's just. It's the ultimate, you know, what would be cool. And I'm like, no, I mean, yeah, it would be cool. I'm not disagreeing with you. But would it be cool at the expense of

217
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.508
Dan: not making any money?

218
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.660
Dan: It's like, but I think they think that those things go hand in hand. I'm like they really don't.

219
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:10.240
Tina Marie: You know what is cool, is having regular money coming in that allows you the freedom to live your life and do whatever you want to.

220
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.720
Tina Marie: including the cool things, but you don't have to. That's cool.

221
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.019
Dan: Well, and if you build this other thing, I'm convinced.

222
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.400
Dan: I mean, I literally like feel it in my bones. So I'm like, I know I'm not wrong.

223
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:35.679
Dan: If you build this other thing those things will happen. They will just be a natural extension of it, except they'll happen in the right way

224
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.450
Dan: doing it early, just because you can

225
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.999
Dan: almost guarantees it happens the wrong way.

226
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.539
Dan: And I'm like we just. It's just a distraction like

227
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:55.999
Dan: it's too early. I'd rather get a thousand people on Fanflow, because then what happens when you don't have?

228
00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:02.400
Dan: I mean, I know what happens when you don't have this worry about making money

229
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.729
Dan: and having to hustle. And this space opens up.

230
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.400
Dan: and then, you know, they're all so different, and then they can all just sort of

231
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.770
Dan: be in their. You know the proverbial zone of genius.

232
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:26.390
Dan: Only good things can happen from that. But when when you're just trying to hustle and make money like you're not working at your most optimal

233
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.520
Dan: blah blah, and then they can all start like injecting methylene blue, and it'll be great.

234
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.080
Tina Marie: Alrighty, then.

235
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.680
Tina Marie: So

236
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:49.319
Tina Marie: you finished the book? You were making some modifications last week working on the worksheets. How did that come about?

237
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:57.250
Dan: So they're all defined and text, or at least the current draft of the texts

238
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:02.300
Dan: are done. I think there were 5. I sent them all to Greg yesterday

239
00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.780
Dan: one was kind of already done.

240
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.116
Dan: Oh, actually

241
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:12.360
Dan: 2, 2 became one. So I was like, Hey, I think you can just blend those 2 together.

242
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:24.232
Dan: Then there's going to be like an extra one that I decided we're not going to do, I said. Just keep that. Keep that in the figma. So then he has to basically design or build whatever both.

243
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.380
Dan: 4.

244
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.640
Dan: So I sent those to him last night, and then him and I did like the

245
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.729
Dan: solution map already. So that's done. So the back of the book will be the solution map

246
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.520
Dan: in like 5 5 worksheets.

247
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:50.899
Dan: and then the worksheets are directly tied to onboarding like I talked about last week. So it's like one, is your royalty checklist. So it'll be like, hey? When we do the royalty call. Make sure you have this filled out.

248
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.889
Dan: But also, if you're not a coaching client.

249
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.560
Dan: here's your checklist. You should do all the things on this checklist.

250
00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:03.790
Tina Marie: I like that

251
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:10.170
Tina Marie: a lot. Do you have it? Can we look at it? I'm just curious. It's not important.

252
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.219
Dan: It's not, it's not done.

253
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.689
Dan: I just sent him a bunch of text.

254
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.910
Tina Marie: Hold on. I gotta go back to my notes.

255
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.059
Tina Marie: Nope, that's not right.

256
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:32.340
Tina Marie: Second product.

257
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.770
Tina Marie: is this it? No?

258
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.239
Tina Marie: Okay, so that's with that. Oh, anything with.

259
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.649
Tina Marie: There's a few things that I want to ask about. So

260
00:26:52.096 --> 00:27:02.999
Tina Marie: I kind of also want to ask about David like I'm trying to remember the conversation that you were having with him last. I'm just curious like that evolution.

261
00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.070
Tina Marie: I was working on, by the way.

262
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.510
Tina Marie: So this is so annoying. What do you call it? Chat? Gpt.

263
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:21.170
Tina Marie: I think we talked about this last week, but like it goes in cycles of retardation, basically.

264
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.096
Dan: Oh, yeah.

265
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.460
Tina Marie: And it's in one of those, and it's just

266
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:31.179
Tina Marie: I'm like, Are you drunk? What the hell is wrong with you? So like I'm having a conversation with it, and it's pulling in

267
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.380
Tina Marie: stuff from other conversations.

268
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:39.286
Dan: Oh, yeah, totally. That would be. I was like, why didn't you say that.

269
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.609
Tina Marie: I mean, we're not even talking about that right now.

270
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.520
Tina Marie: So.

271
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:51.510
Dan: Using a word like it wasn't even a word, but it kept inserting this non word

272
00:27:51.900 --> 00:28:04.249
Dan: at like the end of a sentence. And I'm like, what is that? Why do you keep doing that? And it's like, Oh, my! I'm sorry. That's from our blah blah conversation. I got confused. I got mixed up, and I go. Yeah, but that's not a word.

273
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.540
Dan: It was so weird.

274
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.080
Tina Marie: Yeah. So it's been wrong.

275
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.929
Dan: Answer for that.

276
00:28:13.922 --> 00:28:29.980
Tina Marie: So I cause I it's weird, though. So one thing it actually did really good today was actually, tell me, you misunderstand, that you shouldn't be focusing on that. You should do this because normally what it does is kiss. Ass!

277
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:38.810
Tina Marie: I'm like that's not useful to me. I don't need you to do that. I don't want you to do that. You're here to help me think better not to tell me how great I am.

278
00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:40.260
Dan: Right.

279
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:48.459
Tina Marie: So it it did that today. And I was like, that's awesome. And then everything was downhill from there. I'm like that was completely retarded.

280
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.290
Tina Marie: So Claude

281
00:28:51.930 --> 00:29:01.940
Tina Marie: finally came out with their upgrade of like, Hey, we heard you. You're running into limitations. Here's the upgrade option. I'm like, all right. We'll see.

282
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:12.140
Tina Marie: Get the upgrade was working in a project. The project was, let's, you know, put these client stuff all together right, and work with this data. Better.

283
00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:36.139
Tina Marie: So there's 2, 3 ways. Anyway, I'll get to the other thing. I don't wanna get off track. But so upgraded. And immediately limitation limitation limitation at the same exact thing when it was supposed to be 20 times longer. So I don't know if it's supposed to. It's not conversation specific like where the hell is this extra? Or you know what, I wonder is if I need to just quit and then

284
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:41.020
Tina Marie: try it again or update it, or something. But either way that was an issue.

285
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:48.360
Tina Marie: But the other thing and the original plan was, build it through like

286
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:57.920
Tina Marie: Pinecone and taking advantage of Mcp with with the programming and custom doing that. But

287
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:06.860
Tina Marie: as great as everything is, size, limitations and continuity across

288
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:14.890
Tina Marie: large amounts of data is the hard thing. And it just takes a lot of time.

289
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:35.959
Tina Marie: But as I do like, get into it and be like, Oh, well, what if we go this way? And it's mostly because I get annoyed because it it will do something stupid, and I'm like your stupidity annoys me, and I can't fire you, and I can't threaten you and I can't go hire somebody else, anyway.

290
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.529
Dan: It's annoying.

291
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:48.300
Tina Marie: But I would say that of the tools right now. My favorite way to organize this probably will be clawed even with the limitations, because of

292
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:57.680
Tina Marie: the artifacts. So you remember that one website like that? It put together for band flowy. Just kind of doing some calculations with it.

293
00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.490
Dan: Yep.

294
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:14.964
Tina Marie: I think that like creating a a client tracker with that same kind of thing, and then it'll probably just, you know. Take a few hours is all, which is nothing. Really consider the visual that I'll get out of it, and the tracking that I can do. But

295
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:29.440
Tina Marie: Chat Gpt can't do that. I don't want to touch anything, Elon, the dude has data from the ground and data from the sky, like, I know, I don't mean anything, but I definitely like, just don't want to participate in it at all. You know what I mean

296
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.579
Tina Marie: like I just I don't.

297
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.439
Dan: My favorite. It's my favorite sorry, so.

298
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:33.920
Tina Marie: Is he?

299
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.470
Dan: It's so good.

300
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.660
Tina Marie: What is? Oh, Brock.

301
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.220
Dan: Yeah, it's so good. It's it's the best one

302
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.960
Dan: period like, I give it a spreadsheet. And I'm like, son of a bitch. This thing actually works.

303
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.210
Tina Marie: What? So what did you use it for? Cause I nobody else is talking about it, so I don't know.

304
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.959
Dan: So I talked to it about building the model. So I talked to it about

305
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.300
Dan: I have like multiple threads going. But one of them was about.

306
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.719
Dan: So you would have with Mom. You would have

307
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:19.480
Dan: for sure 2 entities. I think so. One entity would be all the software distro flowey fan, flowy follower, flow, whatever all those.

308
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:33.919
Dan: and then to protect it from the liability of potentially doing a label thing right? So on the label side, you have the you have like the tap root that one can work like that. PPE.

309
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.919
Dan: Style catalog can work because

310
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:46.070
Dan: it's a cash flowing asset. And you can actually do the math on how it should be acquired, and you can project out what it's going to make. But if it's if it's making

311
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.640
Dan: sub $1,000 like anaria. And these other guys like it does work.

312
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:57.049
Dan: So I had a I designed like 3 different funds for lack of a better term.

313
00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:13.159
Dan: One was like this sort of legacy thing, which would be a tap root. Another one would be something more like Sean's, which is I forget I had a name for that. And then the 3rd one was this idea. It's like a cow.

314
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:24.280
Dan: a list fund. So it's like, Oh, yeah, they're, you know, they catch fire, but that's the one that I don't think is gonna work. But I've been using Grock to be like, hey? What would? What would I want to track?

315
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:34.279
Dan: What would I want to know doing this like while I'm doing it before, like I think, I started out saying, how would I intake a band based on this idea?

316
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.789
Dan: Okay, I want to look at and using spotify as like the main source. And then we'll just

317
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:53.530
Dan: we'll just project out what we think it makes from apple or whatever based on their market share. So it's like, all right, you want to track this, this, this, this and this. And so this is over the course of days. I fed it

318
00:33:53.780 --> 00:34:02.119
Dan: tracking data that Mark had that I didn't know about. I was like, okay, we're tracking this. And it's like, Oh, yeah, that's all good. And you, wanna you want to do this, you want to do that.

319
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:10.300
Dan: And then at the end I said, All right, I want you to give me a spreadsheet based on what you're talking about, and then I'm going to go fill it in.

320
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:18.149
Dan: And it was like, Okay, here you go. Here's the Csv, and I was like, put dummy data in it. So I know what I'm doing. It's like, here you go. So I've been filling that in.

321
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:25.310
Dan: And I was like, hot. Damn, this is gonna work I'm gonna have to take it back in, because now I'm looking at it. But it was like I couldn't even

322
00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:31.010
Dan: a I didn't want to sit there and start building all the column right trying to figure it out. I was like, I, just, I need like a

323
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:56.659
Dan: an 80% start. So it gave me like an 80% start. And I was like, all right. And then when I got in there, I'd start moving columns around. And I was like, Okay, yeah, yeah, all right, I'm seeing it. And then I'm like, Okay, I'd add a column here. And all right, this is, I think this is gonna work, or it's gonna get me closer. And then I realized, today I was like, Oh, I'll bet we can project out in the future now what the streams would be, because I've got

324
00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:01.209
Dan: like a year's worth of data, which is not enough.

325
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.849
Dan: But I'm like, Okay, but

326
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:13.469
Dan: quarterly, I'm like, Okay, if I look at the quarterly at growth of streams. And I and I'm like tracking where we did promotions and what promotions they were.

327
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:22.390
Dan: And then I also realized which. I will go back to it with that you really should not use

328
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:30.209
Dan: the I don't think you should not use the total streams, which is what we're using right now.

329
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:37.849
Dan: So you're looking at the monthly total streams, which yes, that times point 0 0 4 is the revenue.

330
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:43.619
Dan: But we are operating from a singles perspective.

331
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:49.530
Dan: So I would want to see. We're never promoting the catalog. We're promoting a song.

332
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:58.819
Dan: So it's like, Okay, I need to be tracking every song by stream and then rolling that up into the total, like the total is comprised of

333
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.539
Dan: 60 songs or whatever.

334
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.110
Dan: And then, when a song comes out, I'm promoting that song.

335
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.620
Dan: so I need to know what happens when I promote that specific song.

336
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:28.070
Dan: And then, yeah, I know that goes towards the total. But what what's happening with that song. And then how does that song affect other songs in the catalog? So when I start juicing that song, do we see another song? Other songs start picking up? I know the answer is, yes, but I can't see it.

337
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.280
Dan: but I'd be able to in the future.

338
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.079
Dan: So it's building like a model. And then.

339
00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:41.549
Dan: sadly, it's like software. I was like, Oh, we nobody's doing this. I'm like, we, we need to probably build this thing.

340
00:36:44.194 --> 00:36:47.119
Tina Marie: Yeah. So what would it take to do that?

341
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:53.470
Dan: I've been talking to the spotify developer. What it would take is the model like, build the model.

342
00:36:53.890 --> 00:37:00.169
Dan: So this is the data that we need. Okay. Great, how do we get? How do we get that piece? That piece? That piece, that piece?

343
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.989
Dan: It looks pretty straightforward. It would just be

344
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.510
Dan: Well, data.

345
00:37:12.802 --> 00:37:14.559
Dan: Oh, I think we've like cut.

346
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.310
Dan: Not for a second.

347
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.400
Tina Marie: Said it would just be, and then you were gone.

348
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:25.240
Dan: With spotify. You cannot pull old data, which is bizarre.

349
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:32.520
Dan: but they don't let you do it via their Api. So if you wanted the streams for a song.

350
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:39.559
Dan: If you wanted the data that I'm talking about, you would have to start tracking it like right now today

351
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.620
Dan: and forward.

352
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:46.099
Dan: So in order to backfill the data

353
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:53.979
Dan: you can go to. There's a 3rd party company called Chart Chart Metric or chart metrics.

354
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:59.820
Dan: and depending on the band, and

355
00:38:05.128 --> 00:38:09.090
Dan: they may or may not have that data. They may or may not have it for all the songs.

356
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.159
Dan: What to tell you? I'm not even fucking, moving.

357
00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:20.930
Dan: So I'm not sure you can go backwards to the degree that you would need to. But you can always go forwards.

358
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.129
Dan: So it's like, Okay, so I don't know. I don't know.

359
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.730
Dan: I think I think it's possible, but I don't know yet, so if I can build the model.

360
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.780
Dan: then maybe.

361
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.840
Tina Marie: Like.

362
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.720
Tina Marie: What level of interest do you have in that.

363
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.370
Dan: So it would.

364
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.890
Dan: It would answer the question on whether or not I mean I'm doing it.

365
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:51.550
Tina Marie: Yes.

366
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.619
Dan: It would answer. In theory. When I build this.

367
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.150
Dan: it becomes sort of which was my whole goal.

368
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:10.700
Dan: I'm going to build it around a band that we are not working with, but they fit all the pieces. So then, if I then zeroed this thing out and said, Okay, now, this is about

369
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.680
Dan: Tina Band, and I go populate with Tina Band's data

370
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.990
Dan: to me. It's like an intake thing. So

371
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.320
Dan: the next band I would do it with would be with Lansdowne.

372
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.629
Dan: because I have all or one of the other bands that we're close to.

373
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:36.580
Dan: So if if you or taproot, if we could get their data. But, Lansdowne, we can get.

374
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:41.360
Dan: So then I if I stuck in Lansdowne. And I said, Okay, well, I know Lansdowne.

375
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:54.660
Dan: It just sold for whatever, but I also know I put a $200,000 price tag on it. What would be the deal that we would do with them? How much money would we spend on it? How much money we spend on promotion like I can model out acquiring Lansdown.

376
00:39:55.310 --> 00:40:01.540
Dan: And then I think, then you come to the deal right? So the deal that Sean.

377
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.650
Dan: you know, Sean, did 50 50,

378
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:10.000
Dan: I would hope 50 50 works like 50 50 doesn't work.

379
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:18.280
Dan: you know. I think part of the goal, at least in my mind, is, you don't want to be onerous like you don't want to be like a label.

380
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:30.549
Dan: Well, if you don't want to be like a label, 50, 50 sounds less labely than 80, 20. And then it's like, Okay, if it doesn't work at 50, 50. Maybe this just isn't possible

381
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:41.311
Dan: to do, you know, or or if if it has to go, 60, 40, and you want to be artist, friendly and give them more. Can you do that? Yes or no?

382
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:48.800
Dan: So it'll just be a matter of like the data is, gonna tell you I do think it will work with these higher level

383
00:40:49.100 --> 00:41:00.050
Dan: catalogs. I don't think it will ever work with the band band like an oxymoron's. So then the deal with the oxymorons becomes more label like

384
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.210
Dan: meaning. It has to start at 80, 20,

385
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:12.349
Dan: and then it can shift over time or like a label back in the day, you're saying, Hey, I'm going to lay out this money.

386
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:19.779
Dan: and I need to recoup it all like it. It suddenly becomes more like a label, except you can

387
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:27.230
Dan: design it over time where you're giving up shares back to the band so that they stay, and something like that

388
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.568
Dan: would be, you know. I don't know.

389
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.530
Tina Marie: Say that last sentence one more time. Please.

390
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.420
Dan: It's so that that, like, you might have to start out with where it skews towards

391
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:59.970
Dan: the employer, mom heavier in order to make it work. But then over time, you're shifting the percentages. So you're okay. And then in year 3, you you get 10% back in year 4. So then in year 7 or 8, it's 50 50. So it has to start

392
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:07.150
Dan: with, or we have to know. Hey? No, we're gonna go 40 grand in the hole.

393
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:20.149
Dan: but it's gonna come back this year. If this deals like Sean, had it at 4 years, it'll never work 4 years. But if we put a 10 year horizon on it. And you say, Okay, if we do it at this, and it's a 10 year deal.

394
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:30.569
Dan: provided spotify doesn't go out of business, right? That's sort of one of the calculations you have to make. Then it works. So then it's like, Okay, well, that's fine, like you sunk cost

395
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.959
Dan: makes it up in 10 years. Great but sunk cost. Trying to get whole again in 4 years.

396
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:43.020
Dan: probably is never going to work on that type of deal, so we'll see.

397
00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:54.349
Tina Marie: Could you build like a really simple, simple kind of calculator with the formula that

398
00:42:54.730 --> 00:43:05.779
Tina Marie: I mean, you're not going to know certain things. But you, you could probably identify specific types of patterns that you know, within a set parameter of

399
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.199
Tina Marie: possibility versus probability. And you know, those guys especially

400
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:37.849
Tina Marie: need to understand the difference between the 2 right? Just because something's possible doesn't mean it's probable and and we probably have enough information to at least say that, like it's super improbable that this is going to be profitable within a year. 2, 3, 4, 5. Whatever you know what I mean, like, what are the parameters where you could create a formula to at least immediately go absolutely not. Or

401
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.619
Tina Marie: this is potentially something that we could work with. Here's why.

402
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.750
Dan: When this spreadsheet is done I will have that.

403
00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.210
Dan: So it's like

404
00:43:51.140 --> 00:44:02.430
Dan: other section was like, Oh, if they work with us, we'll increase it? 10%. I'm like, based on what? Like, what are you talking about? Like? Yeah, that sounds great. But is that true? And if it's not true.

405
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:06.479
Dan: then what? And then is 10% enough, do we? How do you even know?

406
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:17.560
Dan: So his math was like, kind of all over the place. It was like Rose. It was super rosy, and it was not very detailed. And whereas you know me, I'm like my sheets already, like way too long. And I'm like it's gonna get even longer.

407
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.659
Dan: But mine will be

408
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:34.739
Dan: correct it. And it's just gonna it's gonna tell. So, for instance, anaria, for all intent, they've they're paying for coaching every month. They are this deal, except

409
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.699
Dan: we didn't sign them to a deal, but they're investing the money in themselves.

410
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:55.549
Dan: using all the strategies that we're telling that we would use on an artist that we signed. So what happened? Did they get 10% growth, yes or no? Well, then, how can we say someone else is going to get it when they're doing the exact same thing? They're doing what we tell them to do. They're doing the thing?

411
00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:02.429
Dan: And does the thing make money? Does the thing create 10%? Does the thing create fans?

412
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.209
Dan: And I'm telling you, the answer is, no.

413
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.670
Tina Marie: Like.

414
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.370
Dan: But on on that level band.

415
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.629
Dan: for sure, bigger level band, different story.

416
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.740
Dan: So I think that's that. But that was my thing. It's like, but there's a

417
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.572
Dan: it. It'll tell me the avatar of these funds. It's like, okay.

418
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.430
Dan: you know, like Sean's 300,000 streams a month.

419
00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:31.160
Dan: So is he that middle tier, and if he is.

420
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:43.549
Dan: I build the model and say, Okay, well, then, this is this is the deal you would do with a band like that. Our taproot, this even higher level. They're they're 4 times as big as Lansdown.

421
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:48.920
Dan: Okay, great. Let's plug in their numbers. Or maybe they're, you know I don't know.

422
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.810
Dan: At the end of the day I don't know until I know.

423
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.270
Tina Marie: Yeah.

424
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.500
Dan: And then there's the idea of, like

425
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:02.109
Dan: the the super low end idea which I've

426
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.060
Dan: I'm like. This idea probably actually works better.

427
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:18.589
Dan: is you go find the person on Tiktok that's got their acoustic in the bedroom, and they got 100,000 views. And you say, hey, I'll pay 1,500 bucks to make that song with you, put you on fanflowy, release it. And I get 50% for life

428
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.740
Dan: like that probably would work better.

429
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:30.050
Dan: So that's like, that's like the total Vc move. So you're like, I'm just gonna go drop a thousand 1,500 bucks on these people over and over and over and over again

430
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.859
Dan: until I find unicorns.

431
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.740
Tina Marie: I'm just visualizing unicorns.

432
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:41.545
Dan: Yeah.

433
00:46:45.315 --> 00:46:47.625
Tina Marie: Okay, sorry.

434
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.159
Tina Marie: Another 71 you guys just got

435
00:46:53.816 --> 00:46:56.930
Tina Marie: what do you call it? Releases score releases right?

436
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.939
Dan: It's happening right now.

437
00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.699
Tina Marie: Right? Okay, how long does that go on.

438
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.360
Dan: It's typically 3 days.

439
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.299
Tina Marie: Oh, I thought that was last week, though.

440
00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.160
Dan: Nope

441
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:22.429
Dan: the yesterday. Well, it's officially yesterday's, but it actually starts the day before, like because of time zones, or whatever. So technically, price started Tuesday, for as far as

442
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.260
Dan: people were getting scores early, but the bulk of them came out yesterday.

443
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:33.489
Dan: And then today. So it's usually like, you know, it's like 3 to 4 days.

444
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.800
Dan: but the the big day would be yesterday.

445
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.720
Tina Marie: So.

446
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:52.899
Tina Marie: 1st of all, when will you know how to compare it to previous score releases.

447
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.470
Dan: What do you mean? I mean, we we have. We have all that.

448
00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:08.480
Dan: So we track weekly sales all the way back to 2,018. So every on Monday

449
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:20.729
Dan: we'll have a chart, or we have a chart that goes back to 2,018. It's not Updated, so Bobby will send all. He'll commit all the updates on Saturday, probably, and then

450
00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:30.350
Dan: on Monday, when we get on the call, he sends out, he sends out the same thing every Monday, and it's like leads from last week sales from last week.

451
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:37.780
Dan: upgrades from last everything from last week, and then there's a comparative quarterly that shows every quarter going back

452
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.939
Dan: 6 years.

453
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:53.520
Dan: so you can see like, oh, in this quarter. And last year we were doing 40 sales, 22 sales a day this quarter this year. We're doing this way. Last week we did exactly. You know, this many sales per day the week prior. It was

454
00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:01.800
Dan: so you can see, like, okay, this is how it changed from week to week. This is how it changed from month to month. This is how it changed year over year.

455
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:06.530
Dan: and then at the bottom of that text or or chat, whatever

456
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.000
Dan: is, he takes a screenshot of this chart that.

457
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.710
Tina Marie: Did you keep cutting out for chunks.

458
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:20.990
Dan: And it shows sales and cancellation. It's a gigantic.

459
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:32.440
Dan: What we'll see on Monday is a gigantic green spike of sales, and then you just go. You look left, and you can see it. It's so interesting you can see every other score release forever.

460
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.079
Dan: And that's how you compare.

461
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.490
Tina Marie: Yeah, so

462
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:47.010
Dan: So this score release should be bigger, I would say, because it's

463
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.980
Dan: the first.st

464
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.550
Dan: No, it's the second one, just

465
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.630
Dan: purely based on the customer base is larger.

466
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:11.090
Dan: but it's like score releases don't factor into the model. Really. I mean, we just know that they happen

467
00:50:12.043 --> 00:50:19.479
Dan: and it's like it's still just about the daily customers. The daily subscribers like that's the number that

468
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.940
Dan: that's the primary Kpi.

469
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.090
Dan: And then you just know, when score release comes, that you'll you're gonna get some crazy amount of sales. But

470
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:32.399
Dan: we don't promote score release or anything like that.

471
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.840
Dan: I guess we do send emails. But nothing crazy.

472
00:50:42.815 --> 00:50:47.119
Tina Marie: So with with Mark and the whale stuff.

473
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:54.779
Tina Marie: Yeah, he, whatever he's gonna be busy this whole weekend, he's at a brain something conference.

474
00:50:55.210 --> 00:51:15.540
Tina Marie: and he didn't ask. Answer the question that I asked, which is, what did you get out of this last year? Because it's like 4 days, and he's like, I'm here for the nuggets. But basically, it's a bunch of inflated egos. And all these things that he doesn't like. And I'm like, Okay, what could you quantify, say that you got out of it last year? That was worth even going.

475
00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.309
Dan: It's like a brain injury thing.

476
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:25.359
Tina Marie: I don't know something brain related about the brain. I don't know.

477
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.510
Dan: But like your brain, like to make you smarter, or is it attorneys and brains.

478
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:32.770
Tina Marie: No, yeah. I think.

479
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.570
Dan: These are brains. It's brain injury.

480
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.710
Tina Marie: Yeah, probably.

481
00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.440
Dan: Yeah, which is dumb. He doesn't need to go to that.

482
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.190
Dan: How many, how many brain injury clients does he get.

483
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.790
Tina Marie: Let me ask him this.

484
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.630
Dan: And if he does get one he he refers it out.

485
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:57.460
Tina Marie: Channel

486
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.040
Tina Marie: brain injuries.

487
00:52:06.825 --> 00:52:07.420
Tina Marie: Related.

488
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.080
Tina Marie: 2 PI.

489
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.160
Tina Marie: Okay.

490
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.590
Tina Marie: let's see.

491
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.490
Tina Marie: going back over notes from our stuff.

492
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:39.890
Tina Marie: So for the spotify alternative that you are working on.

493
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.190
Tina Marie: Is that live now, like, where's that at.

494
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.769
Dan: Wait what there, what no.

495
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:48.280
Tina Marie: So do you spotify.

496
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.270
Dan: Alternative.

497
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.390
Tina Marie: Yes, you were gonna build this.

498
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.770
Dan: Bye, bye.

499
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.720
Tina Marie: And it was.

500
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.650
Dan: No.

501
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:59.010
Tina Marie: You are working around that with love.

502
00:52:59.010 --> 00:52:59.600
Dan: Mine, that one.

503
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.340
Tina Marie: No. Okay.

504
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.662
Dan: That is, it's not. It's a

505
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:13.429
Dan: That's the 1st thing I mentioned. It's not spotify. It's like Distro Kid or CD baby. It's a distribution white label. So that

506
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.510
Dan: I'm probably gonna sign that tomorrow.

507
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:26.340
Dan: So that we negotiated. Yeah, we negotiate points back and forth. They agreed to everything basically because I'm 99%. Sure they don't have a lawyer.

508
00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:34.950
Tina Marie: Meaning that that's not gonna slow it down because they have to put it through. A lawyer.

509
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:46.937
Dan: Meaning. They sent over the contract thinking we're gonna sign it. And I sent it to Reno or Warren Stacy's, another who is a contract lawyer, and he went ham on it.

510
00:53:49.300 --> 00:54:11.299
Dan: He's like redlining all this shit I was like, Oh, God! And then we sent it back, and they're like, oh, you guys like, okay, let me run it by the team. So they and then they sent it back. They accepted everything, all the changes and and right I was like this is actually isn't a bad contract. But he pointed out a couple of things and helped make some some clarifications. Then they sent it back.

511
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:16.290
Dan: and they had maybe 4 things. And then he changed those.

512
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:22.499
Dan: And and then they had a software licensing agreement that

513
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:38.370
Dan: I told Rena I was like, Hey, look! I've white labeled ship before, and these are the issues. So we ran those by them, and they're made assurances. And then we just memorialize those into the agreement. We're like, all right. This is what you said. So we put it in there.

514
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:43.810
Dan: and I sent that back on Tuesday, and then he came back yesterday and said, All right, we're good.

515
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:45.330
Dan: I was like, Okay.

516
00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:49.850
Dan: and I'm like they definitely are not running this by a lawyer because their turnaround was way too fast.

517
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.670
Tina Marie: But okay.

518
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.550
Dan: Contract.

519
00:54:54.550 --> 00:55:00.580
Tina Marie: But but that's not the same thing as like the spotify thing, because I thought that that's you.

520
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.350
Dan: Oh, no, no. So we have

521
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:08.679
Dan: no, no, no! So we have our spotify app that I have not resubmitted because I'm

522
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:15.410
Dan: like they're just gonna deny us again all the feedback I'm getting from other developers like you cannot get approved.

523
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:24.560
Dan: So I need to like strip it down to do next to nothing. And then, in the interim we set up an account with a 3rd party

524
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:35.289
Dan: provider. But it's not a white label. Actually, we haven't set that up. But we decided that on Monday I was like, Hey, I think we could just go use these guys for the one function.

525
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:41.700
Dan: So I actually actually might set that account up today. And then our spotify app.

526
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:48.089
Dan: I don't know. I mean, I'll maybe I'll work. I probably won't even work on it next week, but I'll get back to it and then

527
00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.789
Dan: have sod strip it down to

528
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:58.220
Dan: just do a single thing. And I'm like, maybe we if we get approved for the single thing. I think we're good.

529
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.480
Tina Marie: You basically just trying to get your foot in the door of approval.

530
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.280
Dan: We don't need the other stuff, right? So it was like.

531
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:24.269
Dan: There, there's a there's another competitor. This might be where you're referring to. There's this other competitor that I keep meaning to go like sign up for their thing and go through. They do have all the functions that we have. So I'm like they got approved.

532
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:34.670
Dan: So maybe if I look at their shit I can figure out what we're doing wrong. I mean, I figured I figured out one thing that we're doing wrong, that we just have to get rid of.

533
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.039
Dan: But those guys have some of the additional functionality that we are

534
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:53.550
Dan: on, that they were approved for. So I'm like, maybe they have a disclaimer. I do honestly think it's like their pop-up window is right, and our pop up window is wrong and spotify. Won't tell me what's wrong.

535
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.400
Tina Marie: Right.

536
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:54.930
Dan: It out!

537
00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.520
Tina Marie: Okay.

538
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:02.690
Dan: Of course I don't remember the name of the company, so I need to find it again.

539
00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:05.580
Dan: Sorry.

540
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:14.059
Tina Marie: I'm not even asleep. It's just stupid oxygen. Because, you know, everything's blooming allergies choke you.

541
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:15.249
Dan: I don't know.

542
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.399
Tina Marie: Mark, you were talking about

543
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:30.909
Tina Marie: how he used cold dms to fill his calendar like you said it was like, Okay, I don't know if these notes are right, but I remember it's crazy. But the notes say 22 calls booked in 2 h.

544
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:32.240
Dan: Yep.

545
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.390
Dan: That is right.

546
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:37.330
Tina Marie: And

547
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:47.110
Tina Marie: but then I was trying to remember, like what he was selling them into, and I think the conversion rate was not that high, but it was a few.

548
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:48.960
Tina Marie: anyway.

549
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.653
Tina Marie: Is there?

550
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.080
Tina Marie: What.

551
00:57:57.028 --> 00:57:58.460
Dan: You cut out that.

552
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.300
Tina Marie: Oh, weird!

553
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:05.489
Dan: He's selling them into the $2,000 thing or the $2,500 thing.

554
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:12.439
Dan: I don't know what the conversion rate is on those 22, specifically, because

555
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.989
Dan: I actually highly doubt we flag those as like

556
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.679
Dan: other right like, oh, cold outreach. DM.

557
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:27.369
Tina Marie: Well, it's a small enough number that Mark should be able to manually identify them.

558
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.640
Dan: Oh, there we go!

559
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.549
Dan: He definitely closed some of them, for sure. I just don't know how many of him.

560
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:47.270
Tina Marie: I mean, that's a system right there. And that's definitely a, you know, in a pinch, if they needed it. Kind of thing. But there's something to be learned from that. So like, 1st of all, what was his DM. Approach?

561
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:56.570
Tina Marie: Who did he target? What did that conversation look like? Who said, Yes, what are their avatars? What are you laughing at?

562
00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:01.780
Dan: Because I love that you think there's a depth of knowledge, depth of anything to this.

563
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.290
Tina Marie: Yes.

564
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.029
Dan: He just did it, and I'm like, Wait, what did you do?

565
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:11.419
Dan: So what he did was he? Just he just redmed everybody that was ever qualified at once.

566
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.100
Dan: That's it. And I was like, Oh, we could. We could! We could automate that.

567
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.790
Tina Marie: Well, that's at least still something from the same thing.

568
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:21.890
Tina Marie: Where do you know the DM. Say.

569
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:27.660
Dan: I have a copy of it. I forget what it said. But I was like, we're just gonna use that. And how many.

570
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.950
Tina Marie: To go out to.

571
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:32.590
Dan: Like to whatever I said. 200 200 and something.

572
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:35.200
Tina Marie: Okay, so like 10% response.

573
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:35.930
Dan: Yeah.

574
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.830
Dan: Well, actually, it might have gone out to I think he got.

575
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:48.900
Dan: I think he got capped, because that account hadn't. There's there's SMS thresholds in

576
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:50.710
Dan: high level that you have to

577
00:59:50.870 --> 01:00:02.090
Dan: kind of breakthrough. So it's like, if you've never sent 200 dms in a day. Well, that's 1 of the ceilings. So I think that was part of the issue that he ran into is like he tried to DM.

578
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:07.349
Dan: 400 people or whatever, so I don't know if he ever went back and did the rest, but

579
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:12.749
Dan: he hit the 200 threshold, so it it sent out 200, and then all the other ones I've heard just fail

580
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.769
Dan: because they won't send them for you. But and then the next day your new ceiling opens.

581
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:31.880
Dan: and let's say, that's 5, 300. I don't know what it is. I mean, they're posted somewhere, but you started out at like 20 a day, and then you've once you hit 20, then it opens up the next level, and there's no way to

582
01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:43.280
Dan: advance through that or get them to unlock it for you. The only way to go advance through it is to hit the threshold that that the threshold that you're in at that time, and then

583
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:53.299
Dan: it unlocks the next level the next day, so he at least sent 200. It might have been more if he sent more, but I kind of am not sure he did.

584
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.729
Dan: I'll have to ask.

585
01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:04.430
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean, I I would love to know everything around that, because that seems like he.

586
01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:13.339
Tina Marie: there's data in there to help your funnel system whatever for acquisition. Basically, there's a there's a mini acquisition system there.

587
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.419
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, I already built it.

588
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:15.960
Tina Marie: Got it.

589
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.029
Dan: I built it.

590
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.779
Tina Marie: Around. What he did that worked is what I'm saying.

591
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:25.900
Dan: Yes, yeah, yeah. I was like, Oh, we should just make this a thing. Right? So it's like.

592
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:31.370
Dan: we just, I'm I just. I didn't activate it, but it's I just have to pick.

593
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:37.569
Dan: I mean, I guess I should go look at her. I guess we do. I just didn't know what

594
01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.650
Dan: coldness to set

595
01:01:40.790 --> 01:02:00.760
Dan: right. So I'm like, Well, who booked a call? Were they people from 4 months ago, or were they more recent people? So if you got a bunch of people that were only 45 days cold. Well, then, I'm gonna set the coldness to 45, so that in 45 days. Every qualified lead that did not book a call is, gonna Get that? DM,

596
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.809
Dan: so. But I have not figured that out yet.

597
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:09.809
Dan: but I built so it's like one step in the automation that's not filled out.

598
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:29.210
Tina Marie: Okay, we can't get there now. But I would love just because of the visualizing and also because well, multiple reasons. But this is your fun thing, but it also needs to pay the bills. And did you ever figure out how much they owe you?

599
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.599
Tina Marie: I know, Mark.

600
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:48.560
Dan: That is, that is a work in progress. I am figuring it out. I actually just did a dump of a bunch of fees yesterday, and then Stacy and I I've been maintaining a list like every day. I'll go. Oh, yep, there's another one. I forgot. I paid those guys. Stacy started pulling some upwork data.

601
01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.730
Dan: I pulled the high level fees yesterday.

602
01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.910
Dan: Stacy pulled the

603
01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:14.849
Dan: wise right? So we pay all the not all. Whatever. Some people we pay through wise. Some people we pay through upwork right? Most of the Devs are through wise other off one officer through upwork. So she started compiling all that.

604
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.369
Dan: And then I have a list of like

605
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:31.530
Dan: all these other things that we have to go look up. So it'd be like, Okay, I paid, for instance, this company apex was the software that we tested for managing Facebook ads through high level.

606
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.200
Dan: I paid them.

607
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.619
Dan: Did I pay him a month? Did I pay him 3 months I have no idea.

608
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:43.290
Dan: but if I go into the credit card and I search for apex, I can get that.

609
01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:48.630
Tina Marie: Bye, apex, not apex apex. What is that?

610
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.439
Dan: Yeah, it's like the, it's like a white label.

611
01:03:53.350 --> 01:04:00.389
Dan: It's not just Facebook. It's like a white label ads management thing that you can iframe into high, level.

612
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:07.759
Tina Marie: Oh, it's like, okay. So what I would like to.

613
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.850
Dan: Oh, I just thought him another one. What

614
01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.929
Dan: another one that I'm paying for! I'm gonna go add it to the list.

615
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.910
Tina Marie: Okay.

616
01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:28.530
Tina Marie: So anyway, next week I'm gonna check with you on your bill just to make sure you're getting to that number. And then I'd love to touch bases more on, like what you're building in terms of

617
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.230
Tina Marie: the funnel

618
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:40.350
Tina Marie: to the visual point that I can wrap my head around it, because that's where my questions come from. If I can't visualize it, I can't ask you questions that are useful. I mean, there's.

619
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:41.539
Dan: Which one puddle.

620
01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:46.985
Tina Marie: For No, no, no, no

621
01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:54.579
Tina Marie: Fan flowy, I guess what you're doing with the guys. Mom, but it's fan flowing right.

622
01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.519
Dan: Yeah, yeah. But like a specific funnel, the one that's.

623
01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:07.850
Tina Marie: Basically specifically around like what Mark did and how you can automate that. But basic any way that you can get people into the community and have what you're doing with those guys make you money.

624
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.070
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. So the only one running right now is the song, submission funnel. Yeah.

625
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.430
Tina Marie: Yeah, anyway.

626
01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:22.190
Tina Marie: Just sorry. My brain is like really shutting down right now.

627
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:29.384
Tina Marie: yeah, that's that's what I want to ask you more about. But what I'm gonna do is also work on this

628
01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:41.819
Tina Marie: cloud version. I wanna know where the hell all my extra stuff is. It's supposed to be 20 times extra. There wasn't even like 2 times extra. But whatever it's the the technology.

629
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:47.510
Tina Marie: whatever you know it is, it's good, it's bad, it's frustrating, and then blah blah!

630
01:05:48.999 --> 01:05:57.539
Tina Marie: Anything just like new on the horizon, or good bad, whatever that I didn't even know to ask about.

631
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.579
Dan: Well, since I am not allowing anything new. No.

632
01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:03.979
Tina Marie: Good.

633
01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.610
Tina Marie: Oh, Evelyn, how's how like you were talking about hiring her.

634
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.041
Dan: She's hired. She's she's working on the song submission funnel.

635
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.290
Dan: So like, what happens is people.

636
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.430
Dan: Somehow they screw it up because they're people.

637
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.880
Dan: So what happens is they'll end up with 2 records.

638
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:32.710
Dan: One is the song, and one is the lead, and then Evelyn goes through and merges them. If she can't figure out who it is.

639
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.690
Dan: There's an automation set up, and I'm like, add this tag. It'll email them

640
01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.180
Dan: if they respond, merge them. If they don't respond.

641
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.499
Dan: I don't care.

642
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:53.740
Dan: So she's working on that. And then I put together a 90 day sort of community launch plan. And then I put together a community management document.

643
01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:58.979
Dan: So, and I sent her the book I was like, All right. You got to look at this book.

644
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.829
Dan: Here's how we're going to run the community. She's in the community.

645
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:13.289
Dan: So as soon as the book is done, which will be sometime next week, my thought was to

646
01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:20.000
Dan: reach out to everybody that some chunk of the leads

647
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.490
Dan: and just give them the book

648
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.360
Dan: like, Here you go. We're launching this book.

649
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.939
Dan: We're giving it away to you. We're giving away the 1st 500 copies for free

650
01:07:30.753 --> 01:07:35.089
Dan: here's where you can get it and then invite them to the community.

651
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.764
Dan: And Yada Yada Yada, maybe maybe do a webinar or some shit. I don't know

652
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:48.050
Dan: and then get start getting people in the community that have the book and see what happens.

653
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.299
Dan: And then the book funnel

654
01:07:51.620 --> 01:08:04.099
Dan: I have to map. I realized I left 2 pages off I don't know how, but I went to send it to Greg. No, I'm sorry I went to send it to the developers yesterday, and I was like, Wait a minute. There's 2 pages missing, so I have to go.

655
01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:15.500
Dan: show Greg with those. But I have one. And then I was like, I don't know if that's right. So anyway, I'm gonna that's my thing. I'm gonna do this afternoon. Figure out the 2 pages, send them to Greg, have him design it, then kick it over to

656
01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.760
Dan: the developers and have them build it.

657
01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:28.619
Tina Marie: Okay. One other thing I think that maybe would be beneficial to do is create an org chart for mom.

658
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.350
Dan: Have you been talking to Bobby.

659
01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:32.169
Tina Marie: No.

660
01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:33.859
Dan: What's go? What the hell's going on

661
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.440
Dan: that came up on that came up on Monday.

662
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.240
Dan: he said. You know what would be helpful for me just like you.

663
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.700
Dan: We had a chart that said so. He was

664
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:59.709
Dan: touching on 2 things well, and then that sparked my thing because we were laying out the rocks. So Bobby was like, we need like, who's doing, what? What does this look like? And I said, Okay, well, then, that it's like a

665
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.170
Dan: accountability chart. But I'm like

666
01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:11.589
Dan: we're going to define the roles. And who's in the roles right now, and like what the roles are, gonna be because right now, people are in multiple roles.

667
01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:12.859
Dan: So

668
01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:17.599
Dan: yeah, I don't know if he's starting that I don't know who got that. Somebody got that. It might be me.

669
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:23.660
Dan: But I I weirdly started working on it on the side and didn't tell anybody.

670
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:44.239
Tina Marie: Well to the conversation that we had last week. We were talking about segmentation and keeping guys in their genius zones. You brought Evelyn in like, it's really starting to shape up into an actual business. And so the structure is important. The role should be defined so that we're not, you know, overlapping, but also so that

671
01:09:44.724 --> 01:09:50.060
Tina Marie: you know, like, like we were talking about Johnny being top Jack, of all trades, kind of thing. We know that.

672
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.319
Dan: This is a rock.

673
01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:52.209
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. Great.

674
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:55.460
Dan: So Monday, yeah, this became a rock. It was the last rock, I added.

675
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:58.532
Tina Marie: It doesn't suck that Bobby and I are on the same page. There.

676
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:06.800
Dan: It's called strategic delegation. That's what I came up with. So part of it is laying it out. And then the other part is

677
01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.049
Dan: looking at okay, like Sean and Johnny. So I didn't.

678
01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:19.390
Dan: I guess Sean and Johnny both do onboarding. But Shawn does it more. And I was like, okay, how much more?

679
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.330
Dan: How long does it take? So we got to start gathering that stuff.

680
01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.060
Dan: But to your point, onboarding is a role for sure.

681
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.930
Dan: at least as long as we're selling the $2,000 thing.

682
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.360
Tina Marie: Yeah.

683
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:46.449
Tina Marie: okay, I will hold the rest of the questions then, and work on formulating some of this a little bit more. But

684
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.700
Tina Marie: yeah, mostly because my brain just went bloop.

685
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.520
Dan: That's okay. I'm starving all of a sudden. So.

686
01:10:52.660 --> 01:11:07.639
Tina Marie: I think that's my issue. I think my sugar just like it crashed, and then I can't even formulate a sentence very well like I think it. And then, like, Wait, was that right? It's really annoying. But yeah, bodies are fun.

687
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.860
Tina Marie: anyway. Okay, that's it. You.

688
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.350
Dan: Okay.

689
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.309
Tina Marie: Have a good weekend. What day is it? It's Thursday, yeah.

690
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:16.710
Dan: It's Thursday.

691
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:18.990
Tina Marie: Oh, it's tax time, too. That's fun!

692
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:20.829
Tina Marie: Did that already.

693
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:21.940
Tina Marie: Never mind.

694
01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.239
Dan: We have to email the bookkeeper. I'm gonna do that right now.

695
01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:31.590
Tina Marie: I'm a bookkeeper. Alright, sir, I will talk to you on Monday. You have a great day bye.

696
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.660
Dan: Bupa.
