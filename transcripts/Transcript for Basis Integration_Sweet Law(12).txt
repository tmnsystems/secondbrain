00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how are you?
00:00:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. felt that.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Let's turn this up because you won't talk, it's all the way up, Mark.
00:01:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'm E-work, we know.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you're on video, hi, I was looking in on my browsers, um, oh I need to message China too, so like, ugh, just a lot to going on, not bad, it wasn't bad until my baby was crying.
00:01:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It happens.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to go beat a boy up, but it also happens, I got friends in all places, so.
00:01:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Did you know that you can order buzz from Amazon, you get delivered in 24 hours?
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:01:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You can send an elephant who, you.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What did you say? Oh yeah, I'm meeting with the friends right after this. Oh, did Patrick cancel on me to meet with you, rude?
00:02:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We're taking the lunch for his birthday today because I wasn't going to make it for yesterday.
00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. We're going to fly.
00:02:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. So when I talk to the Rams, one thing. Talk about efficiency. Colby will talk to him about it, and he doesn't do one thing that every other attorney does that's just more efficient because I know he's trying to delegate things to some level. When we settle the case as an attorney, we know very heavily what. Medical bills are. That's how we kind of what the case is worth. Right. We send. Once we settle case, we directly send to the lien department, what the reduction requests are. He doesn't do that. He has his team do that. I don't know why. He has this little thing down by a dare to, and he already should know what to reduce down by.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think he does know or do you think he delegates because he does know?
00:02:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. Mary brought it up to me today. And I was like, I'm not sure if he knows this or not. But I just triggered, if you're meeting with him today, that he'd be a way that he'd be more efficient and take a little bit off of his team.
00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long has Lorenz been working for you?
00:03:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know, too long.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, for you to not know if that's an issue, like just to be discovering that issue?
00:03:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to him about it like four or five times.
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not to the extent that you actually know and have asked the question, can you do it? Let me see you do it. How would you do it? And take it to it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So now this goes back to, though, having the specific type of model that you want. Every business can be way more optimized. And you can be militant about things. And it gets a particular type of result, including the negative ones. right? You have a specific priority of you don't want to be there when you don't want to be there and that is okay that works but as you can see things fall through the gaps if nobody's watching there's a certain level of oversight that needs to happen for at least for maximum efficiency as well as a certain level of efficiency so the things that we need to look at and of course also we cannot forget how difficult it is even to get a person into sweet law to get an attorney in here right so that is a bigger issue than the ineptitude because you just can't even take that business if you don't have somebody to fulfill it if you don't have a business yeah um so that being said it would be who was to have an evaluation process that really works well and this is and I think that we're getting on this line and me talking to them and then talking to you and being able to look into it more but this is also a slow process especially because now it would be faster if it was in person it would be faster if we had more meetings more often that's not really compatible with your schedule either so that has to be taken to account that it is a pace issue the improvement isn't going to happen really quickly unless the oversight and the engagement and interaction happens really quickly makes sense okay so um so I took that one I let the highlighter what do you call it Adam take note but let me write this down for myself Oh, okay, let's see. More. So the Rens. Explain it to me. One more time. What is he not doing? Yeah, just one more time.
00:06:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So after selling the case. Generally, the attorneys will send the lean reduction selling department.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, what they will do what. I didn't hear. We'll email. We'll email. To the department. The lean department. Okay.
00:06:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And said it seems like he's having his team do that.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who does it really well? Tyler. really?
00:07:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, most of them do because it's not this is not complicated and it's what we turn all them when they start like it just it makes total common sense and he was doing that at some point I just don't know when he stopped or why he stopped and you were saying that it's happening like a couple days after instead of immediately that I don't know Mary was saying that she thinks there maybe delay because that but regardless it's putting more pressure on her on his team because now John or Jessica whoever else has to now go look at the file and then they have to think what they want to offer Or he's already deep in the file because he's negotiating on it. Unless he's not actually negotiating on it, which case that's a whole other discussion.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, as in doing distributions.
00:08:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
As in if he's not negotiating on the case is meaning. He's sending or someone else is writing this demand still. And if he's not negotiating on it, then I don't know what he's doing all the day. I don't think that's the case.
00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, when you say negotiating so that I understand where that. Okay, with the insurance company, because. Um, distribution is also kind of a negotiation process to it.
00:08:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, well, you say sure that doesn't sound like a.
00:08:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's not clear.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can be. Okay. They have made it sound like that's what it is. So. I don't know because. Do that. Um. When you talk about training people, and I know that they come in and they watch other attorneys for a little while, Lorenzo, he did go out there, did he need a little bit?
00:09:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He did. we've gone there and we've had a lot of meetings and everything else as well.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what else do you know of that is not being done right like in specifics?
00:09:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's the warning I know of in specifics.
00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm going to look at what if I. Come on. Better not change the password. right, good. How's Chona doing this week?
00:10:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I am, as they haven't seen a lot of her. She's still a bit overwhelmed with everything going on and, you know, the doctor has put a lot on her, so I'm still trying to, like, she's still asking for lot of help with the reports, which she should be, because they're not near where it needs to be, but it's just, I mean, personally, it's difficult, like, I literally just walked through the door and it's like, I need this right now. I haven't eaten in 24 hours and I would like, minutes to go to the bathroom and eat some food.
00:10:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me do this right now. Mark, what did you get me into?
00:11:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Man, it's fine, it is what it is. And then she was working on one last night and sent it to me, but it was clear that she didn't spend the time reading through before sending it to me because there was contradictions within it. And so for me, personally, I don't mind showing her how to make things better or here's the differences. when there's a direct contradiction in what she's writing, it just shows lack of detail and focus and it kind of always be.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing that she told me is that writing is not something like culturally they even do in the Philippines and she's procrastinated writing and I had asked her, I say, can you just give it six months of your best effort? And she said that she would commit to getting all of her charting done the same day.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's getting better at it. She's getting better at it and from tenses, she's going to always kind of have something to a problem with as like ESL. It's like half verse has like she'll make it in that, you know, I'm not gonna beat her up over But when you say like they don't have pain it's non-ridicular pain and you say they have radicular pain That's how we're doing it in the same paragraph like That's not grammar.
00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's you not paying attention because you're writing this at midnight because you spent hours on Facebook Okay, so the next time we have a conversation together Yeah That needs to come up so that you can help her with full like either She's in or she's out. You can't be halfway in and so just full open like you'll tell on yourself.
00:12:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Don't know if Jonah will The other part of it too is you know what I'm hoping is as we get these better. She starts making these into templates Okay Okay, fast from the future and then I'll talk to her about yet because she's still just going through the process and a lot of it's just cleaning up She's looking at these reports that Dr. E wrote and they're very clearly dictated like there's words in there that don't make sense for what it is, like underscores. It's like that's not but no like it doesn't fit and so it's just cleaning up some of that stuff and you know as long as she's taking more from scratch I think it'll be better moving forward but the goal is hey how can we make some of these into templates where you're just changing around the he's and the she's and like that's what was hoping for too but I don't have nearly enough understanding of what she's doing to even get to that conversation yet.
00:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think that so let me look at the calendar real quick because I know we're not meeting with you this week but can we next week.
00:13:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The next server both in Louisville on Thursday Friday.
00:13:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh.
00:13:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Is the one you guys meeting? You meeting with someone called right?
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah wait what's today? Hold on now we're meeting Thursday. and a third.
00:14:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
My people didn't make the third word.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really this, but with your traveling schedule stuff?
00:14:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Maybe. Still shooting from out of top room.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think if you can, even just for a little bit, and just be like, OK, here's what I have to contribute. And then we can work with that. I think that'll be great. I'm going to check in with her today anyway. I don't see that my calendar, so they go by to find it. It says that you have said yes to it.
00:14:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She didn't, but you did. Cool. Oh, yeah, there it is.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
6 p.m. OK. So anyway, wait, where was I? Oh, lot of fire was in a lot of fire. OK, so. Last 90 days, what do you feel like is the best kind of snapshot to look at relative performance stats?
00:15:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think 90 days gives you a pretty good indication when it's a quarter, 180 days, maybe it's a little better, think 90 day kind of segments gives you a pretty good idea, 30 days, there's unfortunately a little bit too much potential sway.
00:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because we have, we can ask Josh for 180 days, I think that's a Yeah.
00:15:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was like monkeys, just all over the and choose the leads. So that's why I think putting quarter to quarter makes the most sense because there's going to be some ups and downs. Obviously, part of bonus plan is to try to even out those. Waves, if you will.
00:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, like, what if I... One thing I have been looking at... Also, turning keys, not to stuff. Because in my mind, Tyler is a slacker in Kennesox and then I look at him compared to like Lauren, who is slow and my Tyler's beaten him in a lot of things. it's not everything right so but that's why i'm saying what is the best way to look at it so i'm looking at 90 days the other issues are you looking at settlements or money or i'm going to i'm going to screen so i have like one very large case which moves off so yeah so gross so this is 90 days yeah oh one of the other things i wanted to have is oh i guess we do have record counting here and then oh dropped out and subbed out and other what is other i don't know
00:18:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, I have no clue that could actually mean unless I just comparing it to the rest of their cases, but that wouldn't make sense to include that.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will ask that also. So this is what I've been trying to get shrunk, but it obviously takes a If I go last quarter. That should be.
00:19:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, of course, if I can do the same data.
00:19:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because we're right at the end of it. And I can't do. I can do this here. So it was 345 days. So that has been consistent, although I think hers is less now also. How does resolution speed? So close and resolve is closed, settled.
00:19:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, closed is pale.
00:19:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I meant. Sorry. So this right here. So resolved is settled. So and close this paid.
00:20:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But you would. I think, settle, settle should be shorter than paid.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is.
00:20:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Now, then we'll be like, Tyler, it's 309 for 94.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, and Samantha's the other way around too. Okay, so something's wrong here.
00:20:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Something's off on it.
00:20:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me get this to you. Okay, so I'm going to go actually even correct. Yeah, like so Tyler and Lorenz for this year, and like Tyler's a slacker and he's barely just showing up for a paycheck and Lorenz is given it his best and you've got the same level of performance but not really because Tyler gets paid sooner according to this. And then let's see that's gross but let's see average. Fee by team Lorenz is higher for the year but not a lot and Samantha is like 33% higher than Lorenz and more than Tyler going. The record count 99, so 2, 42, one ninety nine percent. I mean, he's got more 218 or something, yeah. Volume-wise, some app is clearly doing more, but so, but looking at this, I don't see anything where, and I want to know how you're evaluating things, could it be better, should it be better, should we be doing things, make it better? Yes. I don't see where there's a, you should definitely fire Lauren's kind of thing.
00:22:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, it's not, you know, it's not here. He has the largest team, like the most important structure. Yeah. He also uses the most amount of resources.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, how would I look at that? It's not going to be unmodified, but how could I look at that? I would love to see what the cost of each pod is.
00:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or I'm once I've had anyone that we're putting that together because I'm trying to now get the pods to be about 18% of what they bring in.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So we are quickly working on that.
00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then, is your strategy like, okay, Lorenz, these are the amount of people you get sink or swim. No.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, we have to begin with first, we have to know what we're dealing with, Set more. Set the expectation. If you want to continue to have x, y, z, then you need to be at y.
00:23:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You can't be at y, then we need to start taking y, x and z.
00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if we take it and then. So we'll spell all of that out, right?
00:23:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, because we have to. I mean, it's going to make sense.
00:23:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what is.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the timeline that you're looking at for having finishing putting it together. hoping the lead month will have what they each cost the team was. And then from there, just putting it into how much they do for months.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So theoretically, if Lorenz's pod can't handle it, and you're like, I want you gone, but you don't have anybody to replace them, do you take the existing caseload and put it on the rest of your team and just say, and we keep the leads going at the pace or risk pulling back, you have to play that out in your mind.
00:24:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What do those scenarios look like? I mean, number one is always setting an expectation.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure.
00:24:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If they continue to not be able to meet the expectation, then we have to figure out why. If they come down to its personnel issue. And so we have, we have hang, we have a Yuri, we have additional people who can put substitute, and because the interns are paid on a percentage is what it is.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's just how can we make this more efficient and without being able to tie numbers together.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. We're just shooting the dog.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's good.
00:25:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because I can see specific cases that I know could move faster with someone who is here every single day working 60 hours.
00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would you want somebody working 60 hours a week? You have quoted scrum. You know what that does.
00:25:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're an attorney. If you want to make $400,000 a year, yeah, you need to put in some quick in time.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. But the premise of that is that quality suffers after. a roughly 20 hours a week that productivity goes down, the output goes down, and that the quality of the output goes down. Now, I don't believe that that's true for all people, all things, all markets everywhere. don't. I never do. I believe that there are outliers. I also believe that, you know, there's relativity, everything's relevant. That being said, there's a lot of science behind it. Google has built their entire business model around it. There are seasons where people can hustle and grind, and going back to the culture that you want to have, that's a whole big conversation to talk about. you want people working 60 hours a week? Is that, is that something you want to be seeing? And, and you could say, yes, because This is the incentive plan, right? This is who it's geared for. I'm paying this amount of money. I want butts and seats for this amount of time, roughly. And if that doesn't work, then or do you bring new people in under a different incentive program and be like, which is really the biggest issue that that was formulated incorrectly and wisely, got something done, so not necessarily unwisely at the time, but really not working very well right now.
00:27:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They worked with a smaller scale that just don't work on bigger scale. Like, Grins' percentages are okay. Just one person's is all black.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just Samantha? Yeah. So, do you have a model, or do you have variations of the model that you can put pods into? Let's say, look, if you want to work here, this is the model that you get to have. So you've got four kids, you don't want to be working 60 hours a week. This is what I'm willing to pay you under these particular circumstances, and this is what you have to put out in order to make this arrangement work, and to take it or leave it. And so instead of saying this is how everything happens at Sweet Law, it can be like every pod is basically a business and a country unto itself, barring there are certain rules and principles. So let's say maybe there are states instead of countries into itself, right? We've got the federal rules, but then we've got state-level government. And rather than thinking on a typical company thing, which is everybody gets the same rules, you can break away and split up and say, no, every pod's going to be like its own state, which they kind of are anyway, but with a unique incentive program. So if you've got people who are not your high performers, and they're all kind of, know, because that will Patrick has Cynthia, you know, like there's different people that perform at different levels at different like case managers and assistants and whatnot. So if you put them in a place where the incentive program works for them, they're making you a prophet. It's not the exciting thing you wanted to have, but they are part of the moat system, part of the financial leverage that keeps sweet law afloat. They are the steady robots, they come in, they're never going to be exceptional, but they're also never going to really disappear because they need the job. You know what I mean? Whereas you've got the hustlers and grinders, and the problem with that, like you've experienced with the Samantha's, something goes wrong in their lives and they're like screwed up for a little while, like a couple months, and you feel it in the business, but that's don't want them to maximize the value of the case.
00:29:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have an incentive to try to maximize the value. Would you take 14,000, 715,000 it doesn't really impact you.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but so it does, because if you consistently fail to meet these metrics, you no longer have a job. Like there's all kinds of different ways to put the incentive program. The incentive is you get to keep working here. That's a big deal, especially when the culture is not one of constant stress and threat compared to what the rest of the industry is. Like markets that you want these seem to be like this. And then I asked them to think about stuff and feel like, well, well, actually, he's also really helpful. Like he'll answer any question 10 o'clock at night. If I have a question, he'll help me out. Like he's always really helpful. He just really wants us to do well. I'm like, okay, that make him angry or bad or whatever? They're like, no. And then Lorenz had the epiphany where he's like, well, if I saw this stuff was going wrong, I get pretty upset with it too. So, and he goes like, I'm not. bad guy. So it's just interesting how people have to process things and see it. But anyway, I'm definitely intense. I'm telling you, like people are terrified of me. I've had total strangers be like, don't mess with her. She'll kick your . I'm like, I don't know where you get that from. But there's energy and people perceive it. And even if you've never made threatening language, whatever, when you are potent inside of yourself, it is perceptible to people who are not. And they are intimidated, whether you're intimidating or not. So and also, when you don't mince words and you just say, these are the expectations like, what's going on? And you ask like accountability questions, and you don't have the gall to dance around it and sugar code it, they're like, what the? This is scary. So, you know, that's all that is. But the other thing is, We're doing it directly whereas somebody else might see that kind of stuff and they're like they've already been thinking I'm gonna fire this dude, and I'm just now coming at him kind of thing, so It's it's trying to understand all of that. I think that there are that we Should always be looking at this non stereotypically Starting with the fact that you want a business that makes a lot of money and You want to do the things that you want to do and don't want to do the things that you don't want to do and you're honest enough to say that right most people will want that and Then never actually try to create that for themselves or try to create it for themselves and then call it something else So that nobody judges them for that or they feel like they belong or whatever so That in and of itself is unique and it's it's great actually because Because they're you're doing it's not cognitive business. You're not just say one thing do another blah, blah, I think that thinking about the pods as having access to maybe different incentive programs and that maybe there is an eligibility clause, right? become eligible for this type of incentive program upon this criteria. You lose eligibility to this incentive program upon this criteria. So it's not a once you get here, you get to keep it type of thing. Now, you can't, you can, but it's not wise to pull back and reduce what a person can earn, right? So you can't lose eligibility by being too good, but what you can do is unlock a whole new level of expectation where much is given, much is required. So, yes, you're getting all this extra bonus pay, but here's what else I expected you now, because you've gotten this. Which, They might take as a penalty. Yeah, I can't, I can't win. I've done this good and now this is what's happening. You could say, no, it's not. But as long as I'm paying this level of an incentive, I am going to ask you for more because you're getting so much more. And you can't like, you pay the marketing fees, you meet with the vendors, you do all of this. Like they can't just go out and bring themselves more money. Cases don't magically just show up. There's a lot of investment you make to bring that here to them to even fulfill. They could go open their own business. Do you think they're just going to like half cases, land in the lab? That's not how that works. You think you can just go to another law firm and get this kind of incentive program? That's not going to work. Maybe, I don't actually know. So anyway, maybe it's time that we think about instead of, yes, we have this plan, period. How do we make it work? Maybe it's we have this plan for this pod under this criteria and Maybe we tweak the level of expectations Is there anything that we could ask above and beyond other specific financial thresholds? Let's say if you make $12,000 a month You also get to do this or this like Maybe you're double checking other people's cases or I don't know and that doesn't even sound fair. I'm literally just spitballing things But I'm doing it so that you can trigger a thought of well Is there a threshold if I pay you X amount of money? I want you to show up some extra and do something else. I don't know if that makes sense or that just saptons But I'm trying to get us to think outside the box I'm supposed to meet with Lorenz in an hour There's lots we didn't get into but just Honestly, I think that's the biggest thing. You creating structure, understanding the numbers, every time, and it's usually every few months, you go and dive deep and you get some specific numbers that we didn't have before. Every time you do that, something shifts significantly. And I know you always want bigger, faster, better immediately. But the trajectory speaks for itself. You can look at it. Maybe not with profit margins and net profits, which is not something we look at enough and I would definitely like to look at that. But with gross margins, you know, it's definitely impacting. So some things working, and every time you do this, it gets better. So keep doing that. Okay, better go. Let's see. It sucks, though, because I'm not, I can't wrap up. Oh, tell Patrick, I'll be working for me, do something really embarrassing, then you can tell me about it later to embarrass them for a birthday. uh, you're awesome. Thank you. Sounds good. Bye.
