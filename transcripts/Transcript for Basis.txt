00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm in there. Okay, let's see. Where's my o'clock? So we were kind of mapping out a little bit about like what the offer would be or what it would look like for mom.
00:00:17 - Dan Ryan
Meanwhile.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:19 - Dan Ryan
Mark already went and sold one.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:00:23 - Dan Ryan
Yesterday. Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you sell it for?
00:00:26 - Dan Ryan
2,500 bucks. So we came up with 97 a month is you got to pay that. It was 500. They were charging people 500 month. Oh, I said, okay, you can you can do that. But my question was, I think everyone right now should be done with you and we downgrade them to to do yourself unless they want to keep going. So I said, what does that look like? Is it are you what what what what does an intel right so those guys are like all right we would do the onboarding like we're doing we would run the ads for them for the while they're in this sort of I don't know we have to come up with a name for it. Things like okay how long is this phase it's not 30 days it's got to be 60 or 90 and they all unanimously mean unanimously we're like 60 like everyone's good to go after 60 days then they decide hey yeah I'd like you to keep running the ads or or hey I would like to have some direct support which is going to be downsell and a new subscription into maybe we don't do that maybe we make them pay no I think we'll make them pay for that then so as the handoff of like hey you can get into the paid community which is it's only $20 a month right and then it keeps you in with us, or you can just use the free community, but just know that like we're not gonna we don't answer as many questions there just because we can. But you paid 20 bucks, then you're in the paid community, or if you want to continue with a coaching arrangement, it just switches to monthly. So what Mark came up with was, all right, I'm gonna get him to pay 2,500 bucks a for it includes all the stuff that I was talking about.
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He sold that?
00:02:34 - Dan Ryan
He sold the yesterday, he like drafted it up before the phone call and then got on the phone call and sold it.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I need to plug that into Claude. So are you on your phone?
00:02:45 - Dan Ryan
I am not.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay. Can you see my screen?
00:02:51 - Dan Ryan
I can't.
00:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is crazy because Claude made this.
00:02:56 - Dan Ryan
I know, I thought it was nuts when I looked at it.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, that's what I was This looks like basic basis type design does. So I'll show you. The whole chat that we had. It's not even that long. Can you help me create a product map flow chart? That's how we started who it's for. I attached the transcript from the two calls that we had about it, the two most recent ones, and then gave it that spreadsheet that I had where I'd written down some of the things. I copied and pasted that. And then so it gave me this first version. And then I made a little bit of clarification. And can you use more words so people have a clear understanding? And then it did this. And I said, can you so like to see more? them and have them be twice as I met big twice as big anyway I was trying to give it to adjust the oh okay so where's the okay so here's the first version of what it looked like is that the first version no here's the first version this is the first version this is the second version and and that's the last one oh wait no this is the last one so it took like no time like maybe 10 minutes yeah it's not I'm like dude now of course it's not perfect but it's HTML so you can like easily customize it with a person who knows HTML and that whole like just blanks late starting over but finding the icon And getting the icons to match like this whole section, I was wilded to me.
00:05:06 - Dan Ryan
I know, but it looks good, like these legit. Yeah, I mean, but you didn't even give it like design direction really, right?
00:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did not.
00:05:22 - Dan Ryan
And that's what's crazy. It does look like what Greg does.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So I don't know where it gets it from, but this is definitely like if you look in Canva, people that use Figma, obviously, there's some of the more modern designing elements that use this type of stuff. So it makes sense that it's on trend, yeah, for sure. Right, exactly. So, then like parallax and breaking things up with just color box, this is in parallax, but that was this is like parallax part two. me. It's like a not a whole line of color, but it's still breaking sections up by color. And then, um, and then at some point, I told it, hold on. No, I didn't. I did it with something else. I want to say like copyright or marketing, hold on. Nope. Um, ah shoot. No, I guess I didn't tell it. Normally, I'm like, you're a world-class copywriter or marketer. Um, but I didn't do that with this one. I thought I did. Hold on. Yeah. Anyway, so 10 minutes worth of work, we clocked. So then what I would want to do is go make any of the adjustments, like anything that we can clear on in terms of what we're offering. And you could have like split testing pages, different versions, a page for, um, you know, maybe there's an invite only and they do get extra stuff. don't know what you want to do. We know that, um, yeah, it's going to be invite only.
00:07:25 - Dan Ryan
So I, I separately from, you know, when you and I were talking, then I started doing the copy for the page. It's going to be invite only. So I got those guys, they were like, yeah, let's do that. Let's do this. Let's just do more of. So I wrote that copy, sent it to Greg. sent back a draft draft yesterday, which needs some tweaks. But overall, those guys were into it. But there's some stuff, I guess I put the wrong. X in the dock or I repeated sections by accident. So I'll go in and edit that just stuff. I got to get some stats from Mark for like, I got to get, oh they sent me this actually, I got to send it to Greg. So there's a bunch of companies that are like related to using fan flow so we're going get like the logo bar going. So those Sean sent me we'll have like how many bands we have on there right now, how many followers we've generated, how many fans we've generated, and then get those on the site. I'll get those in the design and then I will give that, oh and then I got to get those and from those guys but I can do that and hand shots. And then I'll send that to Ahmed and Saad or whatever and get those guys to just build it's a one page website. Just get them, get them to build that and then we can put that live. Because I kind of get a feeling that like there's got to be people probably going to the site right now from word to mouth and we just don't know it.
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, do you not have Google Analytics?
00:09:19 - Dan Ryan
No, because it's on high level. So I'm like, I don't think I've ever set up Google Analytics on anything high level. Actually, I didn't let me let me be even more detached. I had nothing to do with the site that's there at all. Those guys built it and I was like, yeah, that's fine. It's just like coming soon. So no, there's nothing there. That's interesting. I don't I don't think they have like a I guess you must just have to paste code. They don't have like a we're gonna we're gonna need to make that. There's no like plug your Google ID in here thing.
00:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm, it's interesting.
00:09:59 - Dan Ryan
I never thought about that. I mean,
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are happening.
00:11:01 - Dan Ryan
I mean, is there any reason why it wasn't a high priority? Yes, because I don't know if this 's gonna work, which is my typical M.O.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's true.
00:11:12 - Dan Ryan
It's working. Maybe we should start.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I mean, don't analytics help you determine if it works?
00:11:19 - Dan Ryan
No, no, not if, not if, and this is the case, like, I'm not going to make the mistake of going, let's go build a funnel.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I want to build a funnel and try it and see if it works.
00:11:32 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, but I think the way that a funnel is going to work is it's just going to be a self liquidating funnel that puts people into the community and they're going to upgrade through the community. That could take 30 days. That could take 60 days. I don't know how long it's going take. But as long as I'm not losing too much money or any money at all on that front end, like selling the book or whatever, that's fine. And it's just driving leads. Qualified leads into the community like I'll do that all day long and then just have them see You know if we have 50 or 60 bands in there that are celebrating wins and releasing singles and doing the things like we've got We've got one this band Nonpoint we got to get them to move their website which will hopefully the websites should be done I think by the end of next week or the templates though These auto populating templates should be ready to go I think mark said That the ads that we're running for nonpoint are generating $10,000 a month in merch sales Which is ludicrous um So we'll have them and then there's another band that's bigger than nonpoint that's that really wants to Work with us, but like they don't have any money so I do a deal with them where it's a so with record labels now they do these things there are 360 deals so if you sign with the label it's like hey we get royalties we get merch we get tour we get everything so these guys don't have their catalog it's owned by like Warner Brothers or Atlantic or something so they're making no money on their catalog they are touring so the only money they make is touring and then they have no their merch sales related to touring but they don't have like online merch sales and I don't think I'm not even sure they can release a song or they just haven't released a song I'm not sure what's going on with them as far as like are they locked up and oh Atlantic eight more tracks or another album I'm not sure about that because It seems like they're not putting out music, or maybe they just aren't putting out music because they can't get a producer, whatever. We can get them on and then do a deal with them and say, want 50% of your merch sales, that's, that's the deal. You don't pay us anything. Yeah, 50% in net. So I think Mark's pitching them that, but we just need the sites to work, which Eric was like, Eric had the, he's got one more thing that he needs to get working. I'll bet he finishes it today.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was that?
00:14:35 - Dan Ryan
To make certain elements on the page dynamic based on essentially their answer. So you use a custom variable or a custom value. So we have a website. We'll call it a builder. So basically they can fill out a form and then that form is populating values in the background. So that. when they choose their website template and they put it live, all the values populate into the template. the logo that they updated is in the logo bar. The image that they uploaded that they said was the band photo is the band photo location. So part of that page has touring and part of the page has store. So if they have a store, then the store section will appear. If they do not have a store, it will not be there. Same thing for tour. If they're touring, the section will appear. they're not touring, it will be hidden. Then in the future, they could be like, hey, I added a tour, we're going on tour. Or, hey, we're adding a store. They go into like a website updater form that will give them the ability to essentially toggle things on and off, but they'll be submitting a form that says, in the background, going to say make the yes or make the no a yes. And then boom, that section will appear on the site.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:16:01 - Dan Ryan
It will be if it works. I think it does work already.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the status of the book?
00:16:14 - Dan Ryan
I'm still editing it. I got sidetracked building the site and .
00:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You mean you can't do all the things all the time? I try to.
00:16:26 - Dan Ryan
And then everyone was back in town this week. everyone's like around all of a sudden. So there's like a myriad of people at the office. I was like, Oh God, I got so used to just going there. There's never anyone there. And I'm all by myself. And I'm like, all right, I'm just going to grind. But Tuesday, bunch of people there. Yesterday, a bunch of people there. Winds. don't think I went in Wednesday. Well, I mean, no, yeah, I did. On a Wednesday, I went, I actually worked on the song and then today I'll go I'll go in this afternoon. Oh, no, I might have to drive Mario somewhere. I'm not sure. But I might try to go in today. We'll see.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now she's 15, right?
00:17:17 - Dan Ryan
She's 16. No. Yeah, you're 16.
00:17:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, but she doesn't want to drive.
00:17:28 - Dan Ryan
Hasn't but it hasn't it. There was a one incident that I think has turned her off a little bit.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:17:36 - Dan Ryan
I'm going to work in progress.
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's there's a lot of kids that don't want to drive for lots of different reasons.
00:17:44 - Dan Ryan
think a lot of it is just anxiety. Well, it's more about anxiety. Like. She's nervous about doing it.
00:17:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know why. Yeah. Yeah.
00:17:58 - Dan Ryan
really tells you the reason why.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'll tell you later, but yeah, um, my, I'm really glad that my, the baby, right? She's 15. She turned 15 on November 19th. And we've probably already got close to 30 hours and driving every other child I have driven with, I've been like internally a wreck. Outwardly, you know, I'm Tina, so I'm loud, but it wasn't that bad. I really worked hard to keep everything in check and just kind of hold it in. But I would like, you know, clutching the sides and like trying to please, I don't want to die right now. Um, but this one stays in the middle of the road, watches airlights in front of her. So if the brake lights come on, she slows down, like all these little things that just would make me neurotic by the end of it. She's not doing, and I'm like, checked out. I'm like ordering food while she was driving. I'm halfway napping. like, I could do that.
00:20:00 - Dan Ryan
So I just got to look at that, but I don't, and if anything, it's really a reorganization, although now that I'm saying this out loud, there's Oh, well, I don't think we have anything about. Oh, no, I didn't know this. So also on Monday, Mark told me that I have to go look at this. Um, so apparently we built a fan pack funnel for one of the other bands and they are getting a few fan packs sales a month through fan flowy and they're like loving it.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's fan pack? Great question.
00:20:45 - Dan Ryan
Okay, it's basically like a swag thing for like, I think just Totally new fans like people that you came in off the ad and then it's like, hey, thanks, you know, we'll send you a tar pick and a you know scarf or what I don't know and so it's like a free plus shipping offer but whatever is in the fan pack I don't even know what's in it uh so they put that up for this one band and I'm sure it is I'm gonna swear but it's working so I'm like oh go look at that because I'm like if you guys put it up it means it definitely could be optimized so I'm glad that it's working uh that is I think that is in the book but the merch thing that we're doing is not in the book because it wasn't proven so I think we talk about selling merch but it's not it's not really in there so there's just a couple things in in that area of the is covers everything that we have. I think there's there's something else. I can't remember. think there's one more thing, I can't what it is. It's probably a much at GPT.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll find it later. Well, I was going to ask you, like, where do you track things that you know you want to put in the book to make sure you don't forget them.
00:22:31 - Dan Ryan
It's in chat GPT. I just have a thread going about the book. Or I have two threads. I have one that's where I'm writing the book, and then I have another one where I'm having marketing discussion only related to mom and acting. just found them on Monday, so I have not even. I've looked at this thing, so I got to go look at it and sort of, I know stuff in the book about it, but I have to make sure that what I'm talking about in the book lines up with what they did. It probably does when I just got to make sure.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I think is great?
00:23:15 - Dan Ryan
Oh, I am.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:16 - Dan Ryan
And now I can use that as a case study. When we put up this pan-packed thing for Anaria, that was the other thing that we were missing from the book that I wanted. But we can do both. I can do both, actually. I'm going to take a note for that.
00:23:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can know. What I think is awesome is that, you know, like three years ago, whatever those guys did, it would just be off the rails, right? they were trying to hustle. They're still doing the same things that they do, which is hustling and finding new ways to make money. But at least what they're doing now complements for the most part and fits in a lot in it with what you're doing together rather than just being completely out in left field. And I really don't think it's super different than what they were trying to do before other than the studio sessions and things like that. Now, they're really understanding the value of making it online based so it's not limited to physical presence and all the management that has to happen. I think that's the other part too. I don't know how much time goes into it. They also don't remember or don't know where they're using Johnny, but I imagine this is like this is perfect. A lot of this stuff is probably perfect for Johnny and his skill sets so that he's like the main high level guy now. I love that.
00:24:48 - Dan Ryan
It's like me and him and now Eric's coming in so Eric and Johnny just started sort of communicating and then I have to talk to Bob about this, but like now I'm like. Hey, we should start doing a Monday meeting with this like F all these right. I got rid of wafer. I just I planned on doing a via email. But Jamie was just being such a bit in this thing. I was like, I'm out. I can't I'm not putting up with this. So I was literally in slap. And just send the Jeff of a drop kick. No, I just said, Hey, I just want to, you know, let you guys know I'm out. And that's it. Those I'm like, we're going to Stacy's going to send over some subscriptions. And of course, Jamie's response. And then like, they're so passive aggressive, it's just so ridiculous. So I send that and then Heather's response is, well, had mentioned in the past that the woofer site was yours. but Stacy should send that to you. I'm like, Oh my God, really? you're going to start quibbling over just paying the 120 bucks a month for the whole business. Like, really? And then Jamie. That's back. Well, okay. No, she didn't agree to that. She writes back. Well, should we get timeline genius to invest in the $120 for the hosting for that? I'm like, for real? For real? You got to be kidding me.
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's a nice release. Oh, yeah.
00:26:20 - Dan Ryan
bye. Oh, yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. 20, 25. Let's go. Um, okay. Oh, anyway, so the, I'm glad for Johnny because he was just getting tapped left and right. It's like he, I don't know, was a orphan. It didn't really have a home, didn't have a specific job set title. How is Jim doing? Like, is Jim getting the support that he needs for whatever he does? He currently not involved at all.
00:26:54 - Dan Ryan
Jim's occasionally in the background and Jim's a what? only in the background on some of these calls. I think Jim's just grinding video work to make money and it's like I feel bad but I don't because I don't think he's hurt but like I make jokes occasionally when he's there and like or when breaks I'm like Jim. Oh my god right when I level breaks and then he'll like and we have a group text that he'll jump in on the text but so I think he's just sort of waiting like waiting for like when when's it Jim when's it Jim time when do we get to use Jim so and him and Mark are supposed to start recording a podcast together so they had been doing a little to your point earlier they put out the Mark and Jim podcast.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why?
00:28:00 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, like why are you doing this random podcast, but they're good together as as chatting They both have really good experience in the industry. Yeah, they came to me and said hey We want to start a podcast for mom. said great and I mapped out the whole thing. Here you go. Let's do it let's and so they're supposed to record couple episodes and See how it goes and then I mapped out a whole heroes journey thing and I said great Let's make a hit list of guests and let's get like how many of these bands will go on a podcast that we're working with and they're like all of them Okay, great Let's prioritize them and then let's let's start doing it.
00:28:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if there's an episode out this month They're gonna get yelled at I'm gonna ask them right now So yeah How are they doing like I would love to just know how that Numbers are I don't know you probably don't know all of that, but like are they doing well or any of them struggling right now.
00:29:07 - Dan Ryan
I Don't think so because I'm was just on vacation in the Bahamas With the family I believe so and Jim Jim's getting gigs, right? So Jim is I think Jim just did a video for Daughtry again Jim was out here. I didn't we didn't meet up, but he was out here recording a live event because maybe a concert or Something along those lines Because he asked me if if I could put him in touch with any camera operators and I put him in touch with my buddy who has a production company But It was like during comic-con or whatever. So he was out here from around comic-con and then he was out here again So he's getting his gigs doing whatever. And then I think they're making most of their money from these coaching things that they're doing with these bands. I never hear them talk about anything else at all. Like they're building some random website.
00:30:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like I never hear that . That is so like I'm sure that they don't see it. how scattered they were before and how it sounds like they're so much more streamlined now and focused and actually not starving and all these other things. And probably not at each other's throats as much. It's so weird.
00:30:42 - Dan Ryan
But they're also never together, which I don't the mothership.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if they keep doing what they're doing, they will buy the freedom to have that.
00:31:00 - Dan Ryan
Oh, yeah, you can go back to, you just did it in the wrong order. Yeah, because it was an existential conversation that we were having before, not actually technical and operations and stuff. And it was a different idea. The idea was we're going to build a recording studio and now the idea is.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan's idea. And when the stand right. Yeah. What happens?
00:31:21 - Dan Ryan
It's going to work.
00:31:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:31:23 - Dan Ryan
does.
00:31:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
work.
00:31:26 - Dan Ryan
We have like two, Sean took my offer and went to his label and said, Hey, here's an offer to buy the catalog.
00:31:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. I didn't get an update on that.
00:31:37 - Dan Ryan
Oh, I didn't either. Other than the offer went out, he actually lowered it.
00:31:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:31:43 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. And then Mark has an inquiry into, I don't know if it's, I want to say it's Warner Brothers, but I'm not entirely sure of Warner Brothers, but there's a band called Taproot and they are interested in. And coming on fan flowy doing that 50 50 merge deal, but then like, Mark's like, what if we went and bought your catalog and they're like, you could do that? Because they can't.
00:32:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:32:12 - Dan Ryan
And Mark believes that their catalog is more valuable than non points. So non point, there's this company called Amuse. Amuse bought nine points catalog. And the deal is, Hey, sign with us and then we're going to market you and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, how much of that is just BS? Whereas when we say it, it's real because we're doing it.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, BS versus real, the whole grad car down and Gary Bracka thinks.
00:32:44 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, it's like, I can't believe that Gary's working with him.
00:32:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not really because the egos match.
00:32:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, but I mean, I met Gary through Brad. Like six years ago. And, and I was like, and then I saw, he was, it became, it was no X. Now it's health X or whatever the hell it's called. Oh, but Gary's the one that fixed my, Gary's the one that diagnosed me over the phone. I was like, if this dude's right, I'm going to be floored and he was right. And he fixed my thyroid.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So good job, Gary. That's who did that?
00:33:23 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, we just told me that, but that's because he was nobody. He was just some dude. By the time I stopped working with him, because I was done, right? We did everything. I only talked to him twice. But he was the one that like, do you have untriggered anxiety? And I was like, wait, what? Why did you say that? He goes, do you? I go, what is it? tell me. And then he explained it. I go, yeah, I do. He's like, I'll bet you have the MTHFR mutation. And I'll bet it's this one. He's like, I bet my business on it. And I go. Okay. And in my head, I thought, if this dude's right, I'm gonna do whatever he says. And he was right. But he also said, go buy this supplement on Amazon right now. It'll go away. And it did. But then he was the one who got me to go. He was like, no, we have to go deeper on your thyroid. And he went deeper down to like T4 or whatever. then it showed up and he gave me the bioidentical hormones. And I think I only took one round of them, maybe two, maybe six months. And then my thyroid came back online. And it's been good ever since.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I know.
00:34:42 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. It's not my joke. I heard it from somebody else with that MT because I have that also. It's a .
00:34:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's fun. Yeah, anyway, $100 million lawsuit. Boy, you don't know what though. I don't. I don't care. Eagles aside, it's good when somebody realizes you can't with anybody. Like not with everybody, right? Eventually you're gonna mess with the wrong person, take advantage of the wrong person, and something's gonna happen. But I also think that amount of I don't know, with Trump, like no publicity is bad publicity. They'll find a way to get all that money back and new alignments and whatnot. The world is just weird. Yep. It's crazy. But since I can't do anything about the world, I'm just gonna go about my business. You know what mean?
00:35:38 - Dan Ryan
Oh, shizzle.
00:35:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, shizzle. Yeah, man, that's so good because especially those guys are growing up a little bit. Sean's got kids now. It's good that they have you. I don't know if they really understand existentially. How good you are for them, you know, for just the quality of their life. But I do, you do.
00:36:07 - Dan Ryan
It's good. I don't. But that's fine.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't know how good you were from?
00:36:13 - Dan Ryan
No, no. That's that was like someone. I think it was Eric or somebody. Multiple people have said this to me. And I don't know, maybe I should think about it more. But yeah, but Eric was like, dude, you changed people's lives. Like you actually changed people's lives. He's like, my life's totally different because of you. And I was like, I I guess you could look at it like that.
00:36:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I learned that that's what I do. And it isn't about ego, but it is about steadiness. It helps me choose people better and be okay when, you know, they want to go. But it really, the biggest thing I think about knowing it is that it just gives me more joy, at the end of this life, we're all going to sit there and measure things. But if you're not measuring the impact that you're really having, which I think is the most profound one, then I think that you don't get as much joy as you could have. And I'm not sure why you deflect it. I think that your whole grounded enthusiasm and just, I don't know, I would imagine that there's a little, probably bit of fear there. And is that your defense mechanism is just to not feel too big? But the reality is exactly that. You know that you're a rock, your stability, and it's funny because our strengths and our weaknesses are the exact same thing on just opposite sides of a coin. So the same thing that keeps you so grounded that blesses everybody else because you become. that anchor in their lives is the same thing that keeps you so grounded that you're like I don't even know it I don't even feel it whatever yeah I think it's just that I never had an intention and I don't have an intention of doing that so but it is a natural consequence of working with you like it's not really why it didn't really used to be my intention but now that I know it's a natural consequence I pay just a little bit more attention and the reason that I do is because it gives me just a little bit more courage when there's something that's kind of out of bounds to say but I know that it is the thing that should be said when I say out of bounds like it's not really my professional job to say x right but because I know that the secondary impact that I have is the things that I teach people go out and have a universal impact, like it applies to every other thing in their life. And if there's just this one little tweak, that's not necessarily about the business, but it's about them and how they operate. And it's going to change all these things. I'll say it. And of course, it doesn't mean that I'm right. I'm wrong about things sometimes. But anyway, it's just an extra knowing. It's not that it's my purpose and my intent, although, yeah, anyway, I do enjoy it.
00:39:28 - Dan Ryan
But what's funny is that I am that way with a stranger. That's the thing like people used to always I mean, they still do, but they're like, dude, you are brutally honest. And I'm like, OK, I'm like, I don't understand.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand. I would already know that about you. And also, that's the same way that I am. I think that's one of the reasons that we like I'm even five really well.
00:39:56 - Dan Ryan
And I've met you that way if there's. I think, you know, if it's not coming from a place of malice or whatever, right?
00:40:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, Oh, I will, not everybody knows it's not from malice. No.
00:40:12 - Dan Ryan
And I think the people that are offended by that, it's that's a you thing. Yeah, right.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not like we were met with a guy yesterday.
00:40:21 - Dan Ryan
And I try, you know, sometimes you, you know, you couch it in comedy, right? So, but this dude yesterday that we're meeting with, he basically wants to, he's on high level. He's on leaf flowing and he owns a event, event booths. I don't even know what to call it, right? they build the booths, they design and build the booth. So he'll build these crazy booths for, you know, Con or, or CES or whatever. Right. And then, but he's here in San Diego. It's a very interesting business, and he's doing like three million a year, and he wants to go start acquiring businesses like his out of San Diego, right? So it's still in the state or even out of the state. And his argument is they're like me. They're solopreneurs. They're only doing like two, three million a year. No private equity company's going to come by them. And I was like, you're right. It's not going to happen because they're solopreneurs, and they're not only knows what they're buying. And he's like, so I want to go, I that's all well and good. So he's going and it was funny because Eric complimented me after the guy left. He's like, dude, you just sat there and didn't say a word for like an hour. You just listened to the guy. And then at the end, you just unloaded the whole the whole thing on him. I was like, well, yeah, no, I just wanted to. you're what he was thinking. So at the end, right before the guy's leaving, I go, okay, here, here's what I'm hearing. Like, you want to go do this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here's what you need to do. You need to turn yourself into the model. You need to have a system. You can't go buy someone else's problem. You can go buy the problem if you can plug in a solution. But if you don't have a solution, don't go buy their problem. It's like, okay, and I go, and here's the thing, when you, these businesses that you're talking about, you need to understand this about them. None of them are going to know their numbers. They're not going to know how many leaves they get. They're not going to conversion rate. They're not going to know their average customer value. I go, so you need to be able to have system that is going to give you that feedback. Hey, when I plug in in a lead and it costs this, I should get this conversion rate. It should turn into this amount of money, blah, blah, blah. And he's like, okay, yeah, yeah, totally. and I go, then I go, right? But I'm like, you don't have that problem, right? You know all your numbers. right? You're not that guy. And then he just looks at me, I go, or are you that guy? And he was literally like, I'm that guy, I go, right? I know you are. You need to fix yourself first. Yeah, I go fix yourself first, then go fix somebody else. And he was he loved it, loved it. And then so I was like, all right, yeah, we'll see. But he could just be another dealer. Yeah, just pay me 300 bucks a month.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fun. It's good, though, like, I don't know, there to me, there's just a lot of peace in that knowing. like I said, Joy too, I think, I don't know, I think it's good to know that you you do that for people and that you have that impact.
00:43:46 - Dan Ryan
Well, and they're doing it for me in the cool people.
00:43:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're definitely ticketed. it's so symbiotic.
00:43:53 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, like more so than anybody. Glenn wasn't that Francesca wasn't. Uh, I missed that component of those people.
00:44:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
were not cool.
00:44:04 - Dan Ryan
They were nice enough, but they weren't.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:44:08 - Dan Ryan
And then these guys do the work, like you're saying, right?
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're actually doing it.
00:44:13 - Dan Ryan
The heather, those guys want you to do it. mean, it's like, no, it's, it's, they, those were not symbiotic. They were like parasitic.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. It's, and you know, it's crazy how long it takes us to learn these things, but some people never learn it. And I think it's a gift. Like it's just, I don't know, it's kind of amazing because like I knew like either way, yesterday, if we had a call and I was, my brain was blood and we had a call, like it'd still be okay. And if not, then I got to nap and it would be okay. Like there was a time when I would stress about anything I had to miss. And because of the people, that I work with now, I know that they're all the same way. if they need to reschedule, anybody, hey, can we move it later? Hey, whatever. Yeah, totally. there's so there's really not a lot of people like that. And they're all stressed out about it. But it like everything else, like the things that I do for people, the things that my people do for me is it applies to the rest of the world. So like finally somewhere else, no, I respect time. I'm generally punctual prepared, ready to go and everything, right? That is I am all, but when I can't be, that stuff used to drive me bonkers. Now I just be like, look, I did everything I could. It was the best I could do there. You can either take it or leave it because this is what I've got. And like you were saying, like what they give to you, like that's it. And I said it was symbiotic. Like these are the things like, anyway, it's just good. Cool things with cool people has a good life, cool life, good life. Um, okay, so, uh, Mark's ads, you, I remember those guys are, uh, Greg is designing a site for I forget the name, whatever, whatever I said the name was the accident report finder or whatever name I came up with. Uh huh, that's it.
00:46:24 - Dan Ryan
I got a, I need Greg to design the site, those guys got to build it, and then I can run ads. So that, I bet they could have it built by next week.
00:46:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how about touchpot? Did Mark get you answers?
00:46:40 - Dan Ryan
Uh, I don't think so.
00:46:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, they just fly to France yesterday. It's, he wasn't sure they were still gonna go, but it's his mom's birthday and she was really looking forward to that. So not going to go because of the robbery or whatever. They were thinking about not going, not only that, but Japan, um, Like so many things happened all at once. Mark has back problems. China got in the right way. They have had his plane got hit by lightning two days ago. Yeah, like everything has been stacking every week. Something really hard and crazy happened. And their door still isn't fixed. There's still a hole in their door right now because whatever they ordered, it was the wrong size. And so it's not getting fixed until today. So there's so many reasons why they would end up staying. But his, you know, his mom has lost her husband and Jonah's mom was going to. So she's really excited about it. She's from the Philippines. So like all this luxury is a whole new world for her. But yeah, so they're going and it will be hard and they won't keep up with everything. But the reason for going isn't Mark's visual, just like rompa room and forget everything. It's really intentional about giving and experience to his mom specifically, but also Chona and her mom and doing things. So anyway, I won't bug him about it too much about it right now, but he is super excited about that.
00:48:13 - Dan Ryan
About friends?
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fun.
00:48:16 - Dan Ryan
Uh oh, yeah, I don't get it. That's okay. That's the cool thing to him.
00:48:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like he, oh son of a gun that hurt. I almost ripped my nail off. Oh, I broke it.
00:48:29 - Dan Ryan
That's awesome. Oh, there you go.
00:48:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay, because I have a really good friend who fixes them and she's amazing. anyway, that's hard. So, um, well, anyway, we all have our interest, right? Your music music and I don't know if you love automation. I just think that they help you do what you want to do. Like, what do you love doing in work? It's all in the puzzle. Yeah, I know that, but it's there, you
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan
But they're just different puzzles, right? So like, like I just, I got Eric to make an automation. It's so funny. Like Stacey just is now taking it and putting it into chat GPT and then it spits out. Like it's so ridiculous how much better it is than my ramblings. Like it's really getting what I'm saying. So I had to try cloth.
00:49:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You I just as an experiment, you should try.
00:49:27 - Dan Ryan
No, I use it. I'm just not going to tell Stacey.
00:49:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use Club.
00:49:32 - Dan Ryan
She could use whatever she wants. Yeah. I so we I was looking at all the data for the leads coming from the radio station. And I saw that like some people will be qualified budget wise and then they they won't book a call and there's all kinds of stuff happening. But then I asked them all the question or like, Hey, if there's one thing you could ask about what what is it? So I took that and I gave it to GPT or whatever, and I'd go, hey, this is the people answering this question. If you could put these into categories, what would they be? And then it spits out whatever four or five categories, which are pretty on point. And they're all right. So the way that the funnel works right now is they come in, they answer the thing, they submit their song, they answer that question, and then they just instantly go to like, it's not even a, it's not even like a VSL, we'll just call it a VSL. They go to this single VSL and some people watch it, some people don't, and I'm like, okay, well, if they just answered question and that question, why can't I send them to a page that's in line with the question that they have in their head? But I'm not asking them to pick from a dropdown. and write their answer. So I go, okay, well, if I can send that answer to GPT, and in my prompt, I say, hey, most of them are around these categories, and this is the priority of these categories. if they talk about gaining fans and going on tour, gaining fans has higher priority. So then when it goes through GPT, it spits out, this is what this is what they're asking about, and then that's going to dynamically redirect them to a page that is in line with what they want to know about. So it'll be like, oh, you're looking for more info on touring, and it'll be a video of Mark talking about touring. I was like, okay. And then I was like, that'd be cool. And Eric built it. I was like, it works. He's like, it works. Holy .
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's great.
00:51:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. And then we just and then we instantly use that for something else. The same the same principle, like feet. and a thing to figure out what they're saying and then sending them somewhere based on that.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is so cool. And so to the point of like what I was talking about you being the rock for other people, but also just how much more stable you are without really making much change, but clarity in your intent and purpose. So like Eric was over the board, wasn't accountable for stuff. I'm not saying he's perfect now. We don't talk about him a lot, so I really don't know. But what I do know is that you've arrived at a point for over a year where you realize that he just saves you a lot of mental work and solves problems and goes and does complicated things. And so it's not a question of, you know, it's worth the money anymore, even with all the other things that might crop up throughout the year with him just being I don't know, going through different stuff, emotionally, not nearly as bad as Norio. And even with Norio, which I would love an update on that, getting to a place where the arrangements have kind of shifted or are shifting, but you still have this massive talent around you and they've been blessed, not just financially, but learning from you by the way that you ask questions, the way that you think and the way you put things together rather than like all over the board, but it's all, because I was asking you like, what do you love to do, you need solve puzzles, you don't like all the puzzles. You like specific types of puzzles and they're all around, to me, I think they're leverage and data, right? How do we get the data that we can then love? bridge for the maximum health of the business. Like to me, those are of all the puzzles that you saw that they have that similar kind of effect on them, which is, or how do you ensure viability, like if it's new, and then grow it. But all these people get to watch you do that. But in the same vein, they're coming with you. And so you get people that know what you want. So you're not wrestling with anybody. You're not wrestling with their egos. You're not wrestling with their agendas. And so for the most part, you don't have a lot of wrestle period. You just get to show up and play like there is some, but not compared to how it was several years ago. And then I'm sure previous businesses, I just think it's like, I love watching that evolution for me in my life. And just acknowledging that. happens, but that's been you making the decisions that you've been making and making them with specific people so that you're surrounded by people that are in alignment with that too.
00:55:16 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, totally. One of what's really interesting is how like fan flowy, again, I mean, obviously to some degree you could argue it's on purpose, but I would say it really isn't. But it is a result of this weird culmination of all these things I did with other people and solving other puzzles. And then it's almost like I had this puzzle solved and then I had to find a place where it belonged. And I was like, oh, it belongs over here. So like, if now for Francesca, I would have never used high level.
00:55:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Period.
00:55:59 - Dan Ryan
Wouldn't have happened. Um, there was no reason for me to do it. So I'm like, oh, I'm able to take these things and leverage them for myself, which I mean, I think I've always been doing, but I don't do it for that reason. It's like, it's good that you can, but I'm going in going, oh, I'm going to go learn this thing. I mean, I don't know, but it's now turned to this thing. And then you marry that with like, you know, I wouldn't have started working with those guys if I hadn't hired Rhonda to solve my problem.
00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:36 - Dan Ryan
And it's like, that was eight years ago, and it's like, it's all like led to this thing. it's like, okay, interesting, and our eight years will be up in May, and it's more than eight years.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was going to say, I thought you'd been working with Rhonda for a while, I don't really pay attention. So it's good. How many hours a week do you think you're working now?
00:57:04 - Dan Ryan
I mean, it depends on what your defined work is.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, for sure.
00:57:09 - Dan Ryan
I mean, I don't start until nine. Any day, right? I never am working before nine. Then it depends. Like, it depends on like, I'll give you per example. So the other day, you know, I'll probably I'll stay here and then 11. I'll like go to the office. Then I went to the office and then, you know, towards the end of the day, I was like, okay, I'm going to go demo this song. So I went in the other room and then I spent three hours demoing a song. And then Eric, so that was Monday. And then Tuesday, went into the office. Same thing, went in probably around 11. There's a bunch of people there went to lunch, right? I hadn't seen everyone in a while. So that was like, Or, but that wouldn't be wrong for this time of the year. Right. Summer's our peak. We had 50 one day. Initially, it was people buying the 67. So I thought. I believed based on our data that people weren't really buying 50, 50. they're they could only buy one thing, but we would ask them, Hey, are you using it as a supplement or you use it as a whatever and they give us an answer. the data said that people were doing that 50, 50, but I didn't believe it. Because I'm like, this isn't really accurate. Actually, we didn't even ask them that I use their path on the site to do that. So I'm like, uh, we don't really know that that's what's happening. It seems like that. So 50, 50. So my argument to those guys was it's not going to be 50, 50. It's going to be like 70, 30 supplement. So, we're going to get some increase of revenue through these 30% of buyers that opt to go for the 87. So, the first day it was like 60, 40 supplement versus course. And the next day that flipped, then the next day it flipped back and the next day it flipped. And I was like, damn dude, it might actually end up being 50, 50. So, right now it's 51, 48, over 67. And I'm like, all right, that is not what I thought was going to happen, which is great. now it's like, okay. And then this morning I realized, so I'm trying to calculate, if I use that number, what factoring in the 22% churn rate, the fact that we already have 4,100 customers, bop, bop, right. And I think I did it at one point, and it's like 17%, so it'd be 70% of 3 million, so you know, it's a couple hundred grand. What I didn't do that I was talking to chat TPT. And what I didn't do, and I didn't consider, and I haven't quite figured out how to do, was like, wait a minute. If it's 5050, right, which it is. What are we setting up for when all the 67 people drain out? When our 4100 becomes 5050 of that, what is that number? Chat TPT spit out 7 million, and I was like, I don't know if that's right or wrong. It's like, I need to figure that out. Then jumped and called David, and then we jumped on this call. I'm like, I gotta, I gotta figure So you gotta get back to that question. I got to figure out how to do that math and like, how do I figure out because I tried to do it before where like I said, hey, all the another 71 customers are going to drain out by this date and I was wrong. They're still in there. So there's a aspect of it where like, there are people that just blow the average. So you can't say everyone's kind of six months because it's not true. So I'm like, how do I figure out? But what I can do is say, I could just say, hey, what if I started cold? What is the yearly revenue? If I suffer right now and I gave, I'm going to do that. And then you know that that's possible, however, getting there could take years, but it's going to be a higher number.
01:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a fun puzzle though.
01:02:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I did not. I never dawned on me until this morning. I said, Oh, wait a minute. I haven't thought about that.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's the cool thing though about and the compounding effect right of being in something for so long but also the compounding effect of continuing to ask questions rather than just hey this is our thing we do what we do because we do what we do instead of what would happen if yeah and there's so much power in the what would happen if and then just being willing to test it and of course the comp compounding effect of recurring revenue I mean yeah that was such a battle to get just be like now no he was skittish about doing this like a couple weeks ago he's like I don't know like we're doing it I'm not wrong I'm not wrong I'll tell you I'm not wrong you were not wrong but you what you didn't know is how right you would be
01:04:00 - Dan Ryan
Data will ultimately tell us. Right? I don't know. I did not think it would be 5050. Definitely did not think that. So I'm like, Oh, this is a pleasant surprise.
01:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that.
01:04:13 - Dan Ryan
That's that's what's so funny. Like, I don't think I told you this, but Three weeks ago, I was like, when I decided I was going to get rid of the wolf or get whatever. I literally thought to myself, you know what, if I could just If I just focus on another 71 and I figure out how to make enough money to like pay for Norio and Eric again, like I did this once before, I'm just going to use that project. I go, how do I figure out? do I make more money there so that like it's a wash? And I it's done already. It's done. I just did it. We're seven days in like, Oh, my God, what would happen if Well, I'll tell you what now that I'm waiting three weeks. So I told Jeff Moggie this we're letting this for a month. We're not changing anything. And then wherever we are there, then we set up, we set up the target. I'm like, I think the target's 35, but if we're at 33, then the target's going to be 37. But I don't know where we're going to land. That's going to be the big thing. I'm going to be bummed if we don't get new customers from solving this frickin' get rid of this confusion. But we'll see.
01:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I have hope, but also you've taught me to be grounded. And also, I found there's a little puppy outside who's an escape artist, and he's not supposed to be out.
01:05:40 - Dan Ryan
Oh, dude. Before you go, I'll tell you the story. So, Bill, like we put her in the crate, right? She's the airline crate.
01:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
01:05:51 - Dan Ryan
I don't know how she did it. She must just bang on the door, and she bang on the door, and somehow the door unlocks, and she gets out. And it, I don't know, you know,
01:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you squeeze the thing so the rod has come up and done? He goes in his every night.
01:06:05 - Dan Ryan
OK, so she somehow broke that. And I'm like, how the hell did she break that? So I still can put like one in, the one that goes down. She can't she still get out. She like bangs it and somehow makes it pop up and out. Like, but I don't hear her doing it, whatever. So when Evelyn was here, she was doing it. And she go, Evelyn's like, oh, you should just take a bungee cord and bungee cord the door closed. And I was like, oh, that's actually not a bad idea. So yesterday, I'm getting ready to go. I get like a calm with peanut butter, which she runs into the crate for that. And I see the bungee cords outside. go, oh, I'm going to go grab a bungee cord. And I have used a bungee cord for her on a gate outside. She cannot open the gate anymore because of the bungee cord. This is great. Take the bungee cord hook up on the side of the crate, wrap it around the door, give the door a little pull. It's solid. Good stuff. Go to work. An hour later, Denise sends me two photos. One, who's at the front door when Denise walks in to the crate door with the bungee cords in place.

01:07:20 - Dan Ryan
I'm like, I'm telling you right now, she did not squeeze out the door. It's tight. He's like, it's not. And Denise is like, you're sure I'm like, am I sure I'm like the dog up? Yes, I'm positive.
01:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the bungee is still there, so.
01:07:35 - Dan Ryan
And it's still there? Exactly. I'm like, there's no way. So Eric's like, dude, you're going to have to get a camera.

01:07:45 - Dan Ryan

But baby gates up. then I found that after that, he was my little beach on mix. She just pounced over it like a deer. I watched her. She didn't even. I'm gonna get a running start. She just went, bing, and I was like, what the heck?
