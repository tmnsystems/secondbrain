00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Tina Marie: Is there a day.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Dan: Yes. Sir. Hello.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Tina Marie: Hello, sir! How are you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Dan: Hello! What's up?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Tina Marie: I said, Hello, sir, how are you?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Dan: I said, Where are you? I'm like, I'm home. I'm home, and I'm fine. I'm fine, and I'm home.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Dan: Either one.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Tina Marie: I am shockingly like. Energized for having gotten like maybe 4 h of sleep. I woke up.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Tina Marie: I went to bed at around 12, woke up at 2, could not go back to sleep until 8. Got up at 1030.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Dan: Yikes. No thanks.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Tina Marie: I'm expecting a crash hard later.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Dan: Yeah. No. Thanks.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I did wake up to find out that the mission, the video I've been creating, which. Is just like a slide presentation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Tina Marie: And spent the last month on for my new mission assignment. Was approved, and.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Tina Marie: They're very happy and pleased and. That made me feel good.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Dan: Nice.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Tina Marie: Like my my volunteer work. Like. I can't believe how happy I am to work for free. That's funny.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Dan: Hey! Turn it off.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Anyway. Oops. Sorry drop mine. So. Um! 1st of all, I don't think last week I asked you anything about.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Tina Marie: Another 71. How's everything going there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Dan: I think there was this. I think we're in a score lease right now.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Dan: As a matter of fact, I think it started. Tuesday. So.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Tina Marie: So number going up.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dan: I mean, no, yes and no, right like. So we're definitely. I mean, this quarter's almost over.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Dan: So if we again, the problem is. This is the down season. Right? It's not the down season. It's a down.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Dan: So anyway, we're averaging 35 a day. So that I was right.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Tina Marie: That's crazy, I mean, because, like you couldn't budge forever, forever, ever, ever from 31 right.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Dan: By adding a system. Uh correct. Well, that was our.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Dan: That was our best ever. So it was getting we got back there. But we so we were there, and then we lost it for a couple of years. Then we got back there last year.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Dan: So this is the 1st time we actually. Tried to go past it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Dan: Really. So, yeah, we struggled to get back to it for sure.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Right.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Dan: But then we did, yeah. And now we've launched a new thing, and we.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Dan: Go to 35. But that number is gonna go. I I gotta figure out.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Dan: I'll I'll just. I'll just start talking to Bobby, and then the answer will come to me. I'll start hitting Bobby up and be like, How are we gonna do this? And by me asking him, I will come up with the answer.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Dan: But I know there's gotta be a way to. Figure out what is likely to happen over the summer.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Dan: By looking at old data around these 3 months and say, Okay, well. We actually increased. We didn't increase 4.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Dan: We've increased more than 4. Because these 3 months don't average 31.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Dan: They probably averaged. 28, or 27.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Dan: The yearly average is 31. So if we've gone up from 27 to 34.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Dan: And that's a, you know, 11% increase, or whatever the hell it is. Well, then, wouldn't we get that same.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Dan: Level increase in the summer. Sure, great! What's the summer average? Oh, the summer average is 35. We'll then throw 11 on that. We're going to be doing 41.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Dan: In the summer, and then you can take all those numbers and say, this is going to be the average for the year. Which will not be 34. It's going to be higher.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Dan: I just figured it out. Thanks, Tina.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you're welcome for the questions, hey?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Dan: I guess I just needed to ask anybody.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. Yeah.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Dan: That's it. We just gotta figure out what percentage increase has been achieved. This we have to. We're gonna have to wait.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Dan: Till the month is over. But that's.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Tina Marie: Now, when you say percentage of increase uh uh cause I I'll tell you why I'm asking so. The one target that we had was percentage of increase of market share. But are you talking about percentage increase of.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Tina Marie: Um, just yeah. Okay, that's that's what I thought.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Dan: Daily daily subscribers, yep. Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So then, the other thing is, what did that percentage of market share increase? Because that was the go goal right?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Dan: Yeah, so that will be, we can figure that out. After. So then you can take that number and say, Okay, then we have acquired X.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Dan: More customers. As a result of this. And then figure out what percentage market that is. Yeah, exactly.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Dan: So I mean, here's the deal. Both goals are going to be achieved. Period. Um.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Dan: We just don't know to what degree. And that was done the 1st week of the year, like.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Dan: That's why I told Denise I was like, I don't need to work all year.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Tina Marie: What did she say to that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Dan: So you're semi-retired. I said, Yeah, basically. Um. That's why we're going to Italy again.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Tina Marie: I love that.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Dan: Yep, I just got all that. Actually, I got it. I got it. It's all booked. And I just gotta go pay start paying the.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Dan: Ground stuff.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Tina Marie: Um was the last time that you guys went a few years ago, when Evelyn was singing.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Dan: No, that was Scotland uh, but the last. The last time we went was 3 years uh. It'll be.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Dan: 2 years ago.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Dan: When we go this year it'll be 2 years since we went last.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I was like.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Dan: We're going. Coincidentally, we're going around almost the same exact time.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Tina Marie: Well, you probably picked that time for a good reason.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Dan: Yeah. So the kids can stay home with the dogs.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Dan: They're not. They're not going. They didn't want to go. I was like fine. Fine by me.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Dan: They'd rather live, live together alone at home. I'm like, all right. Great! You won't have to board the dogs. This this totally works for me.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Tina Marie: It's so like that is most teenagers. Uh, I thought that that was just the exception.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Tina Marie: Nope. Yes.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Dan: No, it's the rule.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Tina Marie: The fun ones are the exception. The the intrepid ones are the exception.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Dan: Awesome.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Tina Marie: I did not know that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Dan: Yeah, we're we're going to um. Santa Cruz, tomorrow.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Dan: So Mariel's staying home with the dogs. She's like elated.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Tina Marie: I bet house to herself and the dogs, and no other people.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, oh, and. And so we didn't know this.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Dan: When we booked it. Um. So she does theater.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Dan: And then the the. I don't know what you call it's like a dress rehearsal for.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Dan: Friends and family is.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Dan: Tomorrow, which we didn't know. And so she has to go to that to be in the show.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Dan: So then Denise was like, Oh, wait a minute like you can't. Go to school and leave the dogs home for 4 or 5 h.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Dan: And then go after school to theater. Because then they'll be home way too long alone.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Dan: And I guess you're just gonna have to not go to school tomorrow. Mariel's like, Okay.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Dan: I know.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Tina Marie: That sounds like my kind of logic.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Dan: I know I mean.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Tina Marie: I'm like. I don't even care if you go to school to tell you the truth, because.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Dan: It. Really, it doesn't matter. It's just.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Tina Marie: Well, no, she missed 4 years of school, Dan, and she's still ahead of everybody else.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Tina Marie: And she was like, Mom, I'm going to be so far behind, I said, Watch no, you won't. I promise you won't.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Dan: You won't, because.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Tina Marie: No, she's literally.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Dan: The screen goes so slow.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Tina Marie: And they teach so little. And I'm like you are constantly learning, doing all these other things, as in just the fact that you read Scriptures at church. You're reading harder words than you would learn even in advanced English.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Dan: Yup!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Tina Marie: So, yeah, yeah. Anyway, turns out I was right. It's a complete waste, and yet they want to like, breathe down my neck and be like.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Tina Marie: Sending truant people, and whatever I'm like, I know the law. Do you cause I don't have to send her. She just has to talk. You want to know what the law is, they have to be able to to um pass a state.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Tina Marie: Um? What do you call them? Test.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Dan: Competency test or whatever. Yeah.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, basically.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Dan: Yeah, they're. And they're stupidly simple.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Tina Marie: At 8% dan 8.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Tina Marie: Percent, not 50%, 8%. I'm like. In in her sleep on her worst day while she's sick. If she can only hear every 10th word she could do that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Dan: No, I know. I mean, talk about low, low standards like.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But yeah, they want to make everybody afraid. And just like this whole fucking fear campaign. And I am so.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Dan: Bye.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tina Marie: Pissed off about it. I'm like, how dare you even darken my doorstep like my kids can run circles around almost everybody, and that has. You know it's not a judgment attitude. I could care less about it until you come fucking, knocking on my door, telling me how I need to manage my life. You can go fuck off. I make more than all of you together in one apartment, so.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Dan: Seriously.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: You know what I'm saying? I'm like, oh. Can't tell. I'm out of that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Dan: Right? Yeah, it's this. It's the nanny state bullshit.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Oh, yeah, dude, and it's just getting worse.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well. Um alright. So I uh another 71.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Dan: So I'm gonna do that, because now I can do. Now I know how to do it. I'll get with Bobby and do that.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And I assume that you're going to remember. But I will.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Dan: Well in in a week of the wait.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Tina Marie: Is he on?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Dan: Wait what? No, what? I gotta wait till the month is over, so we get like a full quarter.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. So I don't think you're gonna forget. But do you want me to remind you to check on that in a week.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Dan: Sure.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay, um. Hold on. Let me go.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Dan: Well, it's funny. I was thinking today, cause in my mind. I've been like I'm not going to do. Not in my mind. I mean, this is literally what I'm doing.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Dan: I'm not working on anything. Another 71, not not not not anything. But like I'm not changing anything in another 71 for this entire quarter. And now I just figured out.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Dan: Okay, this is likely. What's to happen. So there's 2 ways you can play. You can either.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Dan: I mean, I think I'm just gonna go focus on Cpa, exam.com and be like, all right. If if that adds.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Dan: Will know like, if I can do this math and say, All right should be 41, or 42 in the summer. Then, and that will happen, because.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Dan: Math um. Then I can go work on cpaexam.com. Which is what I was saying to myself today, I'm like, I really want to work on that.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Dan: It's like, I just gotta wait like another week and then. But now I can do it. With a level of sort of confidence of like, All right, if that does anything, I'll know plus, I was thinking, oh, well, I can go. Look at how many customers it was generating.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Dan: Up until I start working on it. And then see if I increase that number which would then I could then say, Oh, look! We did hit 41 in the summer.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Dan: Oh, no! Wait! We hit 45. And I doubled Cpa. Exam referrals or customer or conversions. That's where that came from.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Dan: Just solving all the problems right now. That that damn data.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Tina Marie: It's so, you know.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Dan: So annoying.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Tina Marie: It's so hard to get in such a pain in the butt. How many times have we heard that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But then look what it does. Um, okay, wait. This is uh marks. Where's dance?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tina Marie: Oh, so did the guys review the book.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Dan: The book is reviewed uh. From some of their feedback. I ended up rewriting.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Dan: A section. Yesterday. They submitted all their edits.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Dan: They yesterday literally so Mark submitted his. Then Sean added to those. Then I, and then one of Mark's feedback points was.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Dan: About this thing that I came up with. It was like, kind of a tongue twister. And I was like, Yeah, right? I'll. Let me revisit that idea. So I came up with a new framework around the same idea.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Dan: And then rewrote that yesterday for a couple of hours I worked on that, and then I literally sent it to her like an hour ago. So she. I sent her their edits yesterday.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Dan: And then said, Hey, I have this one big edit. I'll send it to you. I sent that to her today. Some of their edits, she discovered, was they weren't.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Dan: I guess the font. Was used in this template.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Dan: Doesn't have an Ampersand. It has. It puts an infinity, infinity, symbol.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Dan: Instead, she's like, Yeah, there's there's no Ampersand in this font. We need to change the font. I said, Okay.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Dan: So she's like, let me do all these edits, and then I'm going to change the font. That'll fix like a bunch of the stuff that they pointed out.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Dan: She fixed the real spelling errors. And now, based on, we have to just see how things shift with the font. Which I'm sure is going to like change. Page breaks. But I was like, that's fine, because the page breaks. That's my last edit is to go in and like clean up.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Dan: Page breaks, so it should be done. It should be done, you know.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Dan: But maybe tomorrow I mean, I'm flying tomorrow. So. Maybe I'll I'll well, no, I won't. It's such a quick flight, and then I gotta drive.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Dan: So I don't know. I might be able to look at it like tomorrow night, or whatever. Um.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Dan: Although I was like, I'm not gonna bring my laptop. So maybe maybe I won't get to it until next week.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Dan: I'll bring my laptop just in case.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tina Marie: At. No. Sometimes you just wanna um.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Tina Marie: Work, use your brain.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Dan: Well, I mean, yeah. So anyway, yeah, it's it's like 99% done.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Tina Marie: Um. So while you were talking about that and flying, Mark says so I got to land a plane with only one engine yesterday. And they were mad that I was too calm about it. I'm like.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Dan: Sweet.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Tina Marie: I know.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Dan: Sounds like mark. He's like. Look! My back hurts!

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Dan: There's not much I could do.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Tina Marie: Let's go fly and play.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Dan: I wouldn't be able to exit this plan quickly if I needed to.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Tina Marie: I'm like, dude. When did you start flying? He's like, my life is weird. I'm like, Yeah. But Chona is doing.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Dan: Wait! Wait! He was flying.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes, Dan, I was like, why are you not like making more.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Dan: Oh, oh, I'm gonna I need to talk to him about that. I've been thinking about doing that.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Tina Marie: I have always wanted to do it. I have to finish raising my babies first, st though.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Dan: My buddy, here is my friend's wife. I'm sorry my wife's husband. Is a I think he's a pilot and a helicopter pilot.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Dan: There's like a there's like a little. Airport. That's.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Dan: I don't know. 4 miles. East of me.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Dan: Yeah. And you can just like fly up to la, it takes like an hour.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Tina Marie: You wanna know the 2 weird things. I guess they're not really weird. But all of us.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Dan: Click analytics.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Tina Marie: I've never thought about this, but one day I was like. I should be a notary public. I don't even know why, but.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Dan: Oh!

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Tina Marie: I'm like, I just feel like I should be a notary. My brain got weird.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Dan: Stacey. Stacey did that for a while.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Tina Marie: Want to do it as a service. I just want to be able to.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Dan: Yeah, that's she did it for a job. The guy she's like I don't know. I guess they got shit notarized all the time, and then I don't know if it was her idea.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Dan: But she just got a notary, so that she could just not have to get notaries.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Dan: So so then, but then she did it for me a couple of times. She's like, Oh, I'm still notarized like shouldn't have the job anymore, and then she'd let it lapse.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Tina Marie: It's just one of those things where, when you need one, you need one, and sometimes.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Dan: I need one. I actually need one. That's so funny. Where and I'm gonna have to hire a mobile one.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's the other thing, is there? Aren't that many of them. But let's say, like it has nothing. I make way too much money doing what I do. Not. Nothing's gonna replace my effective hourly rate because.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Tina Marie: Everybody else coming in is. Double what you pay.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Tina Marie: At least, and.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: Ah! But. Um the types of things that need to be notarized. Those are bottlenecks like you can't move forward until you get a notary, and sometimes they're just not available, and they're not cheap, but not like I really care about the money. But I care about time. You know. I care about time and bottlenecks.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Dan: Totally.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Tina Marie: So anyway, I'm just like, what if the reason I feel lightweight is because one day that's going to be a big deal for me, and it might be only one time. But then I'll be like I wish I had done that.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Dan: Right.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Tina Marie: That, and I have always wanted to be able to fly, because again, like. There are a few types of skills that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Tina Marie: Very few people can do right. Those are the ones that become bottlenecks.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Dan: True.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Tina Marie: When you really need them, like they can be.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Dan: Mean? It's literally.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tina Marie: Life or death or opportunity come or go. Type, type like deal breaker things, you know.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Dan: Yeah, I'm sure if I went to the office right now. Stacy, Eric.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Dan: Gibber or there? And if I said, Do you know a pilot. I don't know that anyone would say yes.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Dan: I do. I mean, I do. Just one guy literally won my entire life.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Tina Marie: I know several, but that's because I'm Lds. And these Mormons.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Dan: Anything.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Tina Marie: They get stuff done.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Dan: Yeah, and now and now, maybe. And now, maybe mark.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Tina Marie: That that actually. Yeah, that is, that is something that's always fascinated me about people in a church, because, you know, I didn't grow up in it at all.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Tina Marie: Is that that is an industrious people right there.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Tina Marie: Running businesses, but, like how many pilots, how many doctors, surgeons. Pretty much. If you need anything done, somebody in the church can do it, and will do it, and probably for free.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Dan: There you go!

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Tina Marie: Bonkers. Man, that's it's it's a good. It's a good community of people to be plugged into.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Dan: Good network. Yeah.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um so book.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Tina Marie: They've submitted their edits. You're working on it. Got some tweaks sending it to the designer girl. How's the design coming out.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Dan: Oh, it's done so. It's literally just.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Tina Marie: Oh, everything's not done.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, it's like 99% done. We're down to. Hey? There's some spelling error here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Dan: And then, oh, that page breaks weird. Let's put a page break, or or that breaks weird at a page. Break. It's just down to that, just down to like.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Dan: The flow of the book itself, but all the content. Done, the design is done.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tina Marie: Are you somewhere where you could send me a link to peek? Peek at it while we're talking.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Dan: It's. No cause. I left my laptop down on the patio, and I'm up on perch 2.0.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Tina Marie: I haven't. I haven't.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Dan: I mean one perch, 1 point. Oh.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: Uh do you have? Do you remember? It was years ago, but. I was showing you some like solar lights that I had outside.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Tina Marie: They'll dangly bobbly ones, and you're like, Oh, you need them on the perch.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, I bought them.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Dan: I'm looking at one right now.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Tina Marie: I'm so ready for summer.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Dan: They put they a couple of them. I lost a couple. I gotta get. I gotta get them again. But there's 2 left. The other ones blew off in the wind over over the years, but.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Dan: There's 2, 2 remain.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Tina Marie: Ah! I, my daughter, my 15 year old Isabel, the last one Dan. She. She wants the yard access this year, and I'm like you can have it as long as you do it.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tina Marie: And she's like, I gotta go buy this, I said. You don't have to buy anything. I'll buy you all the stuff. Just go make it pretty. She's like, I want a pretty yard, because. It's a janky kind of.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Tina Marie: Set up, where. It's on a hill, anyway.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tina Marie: It wasn't done well when we got it. It was pretty, but it wasn't. It was all rock.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Dan: Right.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Tina Marie: And it, you know it's not kid friendly. It's not. Energy. It's not good energy, anyway. Okay? So you can't send me that link. I I do want to see it. I'm gonna send you an email with some.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Dan: Well, and she's editing it right now, literally like she. Yeah.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Send buckle.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Dan: So when she's done. Yeah. When she says, Well, she'll send it to me and say, Go, look at it. So we.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Dan: So she said she'd be done in an hour. So she'll be done by the end of this call.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Dan: Or no, she said she would. She'd get to it in an hour, so she's not gonna start it till, like.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Dan: 1230.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Tina Marie: How are you guys tracking sales.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Dan: I worked on that yesterday. Um! So the sales dashboard that.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Dan: So high. Level's not great at that. Um. So we started. Mark built the dashboard, and we've been using it.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Dan: For whatever this quarter. And then like.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Dan: Not this past week, the week before. It was like, this isn't right, because.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Dan: You know, like a lead comes in. So the flow is, hey, submit your song, Facebook, lead ad. So then that becomes a lead in.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Dan: High level. Then we have to send them a link. Where they can actually submit the song. So step one is.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Dan: Hey? Yeah, raise my hand. I want to submit my song. Step 2 is. Here's where you submit your song.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Dan: Then then they're in the funnel, right? So the it's almost like there's a. Even though the funnel starts with a Facebook ad, well, I mean, I guess that is the beginning of the funnel. So it's Facebook ad.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Dan: Then email, click the landing page, or they can click through the. Facebook for um lead app. But a lot of people don't.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Dan: So, anyway, then it's submit song when they submit the song. That's where you get qualified or not. So then qualified people.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Dan: You know, answered. They've got the right budget. They're on spotify. So yesterday. What I did is I broke.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Dan: I broke those out into. 2 separate things because I was like, I don't.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Dan: One funnel is going to go. Facebook song, submit.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Dan: Qualified yes or no, and I just want to see that. Okay, you got a hundred leads. You got 80 submits.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Dan: And 50 were qualified. That's to me one sort of pipeline.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Dan: Then pipeline 2 starts with qualified okay, you got 100 qualified leads. How many book to call. So I broke those. I didn't break it out. I started setting that up yesterday.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Dan: That's how it's gonna get broken out. And then I figured out. So the problem with the tracking is.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Dan: When or this is what. What I was thinking. So, as you probably know.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Dan: Tags don't have dates associated with them.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Tina Marie: That's dumb.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Dan: So you, yeah, none. And no one does it. So you can't.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Dan: If I look at a report.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Tina Marie: Entreport does.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Dan: Oh, does it? Um!

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Tina Marie: Yes, it does.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Dan: So if you look at a report and you say, Show me all the book calls tag. Show me all the book calls last week.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Dan: It's really not helpful. Because, yeah, they booked the call.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Dan: But did the call happen because this call was scheduled? 5 days later. So it's like, you're never looking at accurate data. So.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Dan: I figured out, okay, I need to like. Create custom fields.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Dan: And then say, book, call. Update this field with the date.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Dan: Call scheduled update call, scheduled field, with the date.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Dan: Call uh sale, close update, custom field sale, close date. So I mapped all that out.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Dan: Last night at like 6. That was the last thing I did yesterday. And then I sent it to Stacey to give to Eric.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Dan: So Eric's gonna get that set up. Now, is it going to work? It seems like it.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Dan: Good. We'll find out. I've never done it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Dan: Rather than go to air table, because I was like, I'm gonna try to. Keep this inside of high, level.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Wait, how? What would air table do? Air table is just.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Tina Marie: Hello!

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Dan: Uh! That was like another path that I explored. But it's the same principle I was like you'd still have to send the date and stuff. The the reason for air table is it visually? And you can cut the data way better.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Dan: You're super limited in high level. So I was like, All right, if I can get it to work in high level, and then I feel like I want to go deeper. Then I know I can just. Go create the same sort of data matrix over there.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Dan: And then I can get, you know. Slice it and dice it differently.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Dan: But I was like, I'm not. I don't want to do that. I just need the Ghetto version right now. I need a version that we can look at on a Monday and.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Dan: Get a pulse, because I haven't really worked on. That funnel much. I worked on a little bit.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Dan: And now I'm like, Okay, books done. This is done. That's done. Next quarter right? We're going to have all these rocks banged out this quarter, and I know.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Dan: Next quarter is, we're launching this shit and we're getting sales. So I was like, I might as well. Get this tracking correctly. Now.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Dan: And it was given to me as a task. So there's that, too.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Tina Marie: Um speaking well. So remember when we mapped things out a little bit in Guru yesterday for the funnel, for Mom.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Tina Marie: Did. Was that anything that you've looked at again, or thought about it again?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Dan: Uh no, I gotta. I gotta. I have not sent the book.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Dan: Funnel to. Sodden those guys. Yet. I'm.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Dan: Probably gonna do it next week. I've been kind of holding off on that, because there's all these little.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Dan: A it's not. It's literally not on. The to do list for this quarter. So I'm like kind of get, and which I think we talked about. So I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Tina Marie: Brought up.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Dan: So I'm like, man, I don't. They shouldn't be working on it, because it's not really a priority for this quarter. So I'm holding back on it. There's so we can get.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Dan: The things that are in our meeting done by the end of the quarter.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you got like, 10 days. So.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Dan: I'm a yeah, yeah. I'm gumming up the works. If I throw in something that's. Really meant for next quarter.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Dan: I mean, but I would. I would love to have it like the 1st week of April, so.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna. Well, Dan.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Dan: If I if I can give it to them next week, they're so they're so close on this other stuff. So like super duper, close.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Tina Marie: What are they working on now.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Dan: Landing pages, the dynamic landing pages, the. Onboarding um.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Dan: App, pop up, thing, the. There's there's a bug that came up.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Dan: Eric scoped it out yesterday. I haven't submitted it to them, but I am going to submit it because. It's an issue that came up.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Dan: Ah, high levels. Api like make and.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Dan: Zap right so. Both of them. Their integration with their Api for creating sub accounts just doesn't work.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Dan: And it's a people are pissed. But high levels, like there's nothing we can do like. It's not our plugin, it's not. We didn't make this app. We don't make the make.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Dan: So it keeps failing. Um, like, data's missing.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Dan: And we have an oauth. That we created for our apps, that we can piggyback, that Nora is like you can just piggyback on that.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Dan: So Monday. Eric brought that up, and nor I was like, Oh, yeah, you could totally do that. And I said, Alright, scope that shit out, and I will send it over, and we'll.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Dan: Get it done, which is sort of. What we've been doing all along just.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Dan: Using the stuff for as long as we can, and that's it.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Dan: Okay. Now, we gotta make our own. And then, in my mind, it makes. Things more valuable, you'd be like. No, no, no, we're not using 3rd parties. This is all.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Dan: Custom code that we made.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Dan: So so we'll send that over. So they're doing. They're they'll be doing that. They're doing the onboarding. They're doing the landing pages.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Dan: The so and then the landing pages like unlock these other things that they've been working on. So they already built like this Facebook Conversion Api. Add on that works with the landing pages.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Dan: Then there's the URL redirect thing that's meant to be used with the landing pages. So all those are sort of on hold waiting for the landing pages, but they're like, you know.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Dan: 90, 95% done. They're literally just waiting to be tested.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Tina Marie: Awesome.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tina Marie: It's all coming together.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Dan: It is.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Tina Marie: Awesome. Are they excited?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tina Marie: They're so busy I don't know if they would. I don't know.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Dan: I think they're no, I think they're. Yeah, I mean, I think there's some level of of excitement. But it's also like.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Dan: The vibe. Of like, Oh, shit! This is actually working like we're actually doing the thing.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Dan: Um, and it just progressively gets. Better and better. Right? It's just it's like iterative.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Dan: It's also known as what I do. So like, yes, it's working because this.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Dan: Was my idea. And this is how I saw it rolling out. So yeah. I don't think they fully understand.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Dan: Like how good this book funnel could be. So it's like, Yeah, get ready. But I mean.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Dan: Mark's like dude. I we need a salesperson. I can't, I can't. I'm booked solid. So we I referred him someone for sales. Yesterday, 2 days ago.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Dan: Weirdly. I went out with a lunch with some guy, and he's like, I'll I'll sell this. I'd sell the shit out of this, and I'm like, I don't even know how that works.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Dan: So I will put you in touch with Mark, and I did. So it's Mark and his brother. And then Sean's no longer doing sales because he deals more with the artists. So they yanked him out of sales.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Dan: Which is fine.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Tina Marie: Remind me who Mark's brother is. I know I feel like I've heard his name.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Dan: I don't know. You haven't cause I don't know his name.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Dan: I wanna say.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Tina Marie: No, Johnny's. His cousin.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I was like, there's a mark relative in here. But no, it's Johnny. Okay.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Dan: There is. Yeah. And then I think the dude's name's Matt. Maybe I'm not sure.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Dan: I mean he's in high. He's in Lee, Floy or Famflo. I just don't remember his name.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: Thanks. I just think it's exciting in the sense that.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: There is a real business being built and. With a solid foundation and.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: Um. You know how liberating that becomes. I, and I think it's solid enough that they can.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Tina Marie: Play within the bounds. And still have the.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Tina Marie: Freedom that their, you know, creative, artistic souls are going to want. Which actually, that's the thing about a business built on solid foundations. Is it creates that. So you can go do whatever you want to and play with your shiny objects.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Dan: Here's here's what they don't understand that I do.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Tina Marie: And still have. Hmm.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Dan: And there's that, and there's no way they could understand this. It's where I am right now.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Tina Marie: Yes, exactly.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Dan: Right. It's like, Hey, Ps. I just have to show up for a phone call every Monday.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Dan: And make a healthy 6, almost 7 figures a year.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Dan: Um, and I just have to show up for an hour phone call a week. It's not even an hour. It's it's literally limited to 45 min. We got cut off this Monday.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Dan: We hard. We got a hard stop by zoom, we still do that. We still have the free zoom. So it just cuts us off.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Dan: Because by the time, if we get cut off we're talking about nothing, and sure as shit, we were talking about nothing. At the 45 min, Mark, and then it hung up on Jeff. I was like, Oh, there we go!

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Dan: Um. But so like.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Dan: That's why, on the like this past Monday. You know I am always saying, you know, you know, Mark.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Dan: Mark's fucking in the batter's box. Okay, pitch is coming down the middle. I'm going to grand slam this thing, and I'm like, or.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Tina Marie: Floor.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Dan: Or we just keep hitting singles.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, well.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Dan: I literally said this on Monday. Go, or we just keep keep hitting single single, single, single.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Dan: And I'm like dude. We we cannot take our focus off of. A subscription based model. We just can't.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Dan: I'm like, if we get we work this model. This model will work. And it's it is a freaking game changer.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Dan: And at 97 bucks. It's even better than another. 71.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Dan: And do I think we could get 4,000 people using this? Yeah, totally. I do. Um cause it's it would be like.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Dan: The market size is ginormous. And we've got 50 or something right now, and we're not even trying to sell it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Dan: So it's like, okay, yeah. I think we can get there, and then it becomes.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Dan: This cash machine that's running. That you don't read that you spend an hour on a week.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Dan: And you have a support person. Right? It's a very similar setup to what. I have right now.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Dan: And then that opens you up to do the other things that are related to this, that. You know the the working with artists and the all that shit right like.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Dan: But they want to do it now, and I'm like we don't need to do it now. We should not. I got. I use my plate spinning analogy.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Dan: I said, we don't need to put up another plate. So Mark really wants to sign this band, and I go.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Dan: Why, why would we do that. It will not make money.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Dan: And so I hit them up. I'm actually mapping it out to show them. I, surreptitiously. I guess you could say I just set them all a question in the we have a group chat.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Dan: I go. Hey? What? What would you charge someone right now for label services? And Mark, without hesitation, is like, it's a minimum, $200 an hour. I go. Okay, cool thanks. And then it was, why did you want that.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Dan: So you'll see.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Dan: Cause. Yeah. Cause if we sign this band, it's a 4 year deal. How many hours do you think are gonna go into that band over 4 years. It's not a couple.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Dan: So now I know I can multiply that by 200 and. It already. We already lose money on it, based on the calculations I did.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Dan: So we're going to lose even more. So then you have to tell me what's the benefit.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Dan: What is the benefit of doing this now? Granted, it's not a huge loss of money. But you're allocating capital.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Dan: Towards this thing at a time when that capital could go towards leads and sales. That will not lose money.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Dan: So I'm like, or hopefully, when I lose money. However, there he did make a good argument for doing it in that.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Dan: These guys are, these guys are like going on the vans warped tour. And they're they're getting a lot of visibility. And I was like, Okay, well, if they're on fanflowy and they're like dude, we could probably get them to like.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Dan: Put a fanfaloy logo on the stage. I'm like at warped Tour. Really. Okay. That's interesting.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Dan: To only lose a couple grand over 4 years. The problem is that you have to come up with. Well, and we don't even need to.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Dan: Come up with all the money upfront. You're actually spending the money over an extended period of time. So it's not like you're having to go. You know, when you sign a band they get in advance.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Dan: And that was the language that Sean was using. Because that's the language of the industry. And I was like, is it really in advance, though, if we're actually just paying. Their marketing on our dime.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Dan: And he's like, Oh, yeah, no, I guess you're right. So we never actually give them money. We just spend money on them.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Dan: I was like, okay, so we're not. Outlaying 15 grand in one. Go.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Dan: We're outlawing, outlaying 15 grand over some. Period of time between.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Dan: I don't know. 24 to 48 months. Which I was like, okay, that's doable.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I has Mark like.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Tina Marie: Mark's not married with kids or anything yet. Still, right.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Dan: Yeah, he is.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Tina Marie: Oh, is he? Why did I think. Or Johnny isn't probably.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Dan: Johnny is not yet.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Tina Marie: I know Sean had a does he have a second one yet?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Dan: Nope.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh, well, either way, just you know the.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Dan: But he has a stepkid. So they do have 2 kids.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay? I mean, because that the point is like, everything changes, and you know you, you don't know it until you know it. That.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Tina Marie: The need for stability. Um, and the attractiveness of the stability.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Tina Marie: Changes across seasons of life. And uh.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, it's it's just cool that that.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Dan: Right.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Tina Marie: But you can't make it happen overnight. You can't decide that you're ready for it, and then have it. No matter how hard you work.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Tina Marie: It takes years to build something solid.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Dan: Right. I mean you. You remember.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tina Marie: Peering.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Dan: What their goal was. They wanted to be like a global blah blah blah.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Tina Marie: World, class.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tina Marie: World, stage, yes.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Dan: Well, guess what that is going to happen. It's just not going to happen to your point overnight.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Dan: But it is this is this is the path to that.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Tina Marie: Yes. But it's also not going to happen the way that they were doing it.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Dan: It's not going to be the model that they thought it was going to be. It's going to be a better model. It's going to be a different.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Tina Marie: Nope.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Dan: A different path to the same destination.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Dan: A better, a better path. Um! Um! A path that's. Stable. Cash flows.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Dan: All that good stuff.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Tina Marie: Amen! Amen!

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Dan: Mhm.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Tina Marie: Um, yeah. And then they get to enjoy it. But. This is always my favorite part. Their families.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Tina Marie: Get to enjoy it, too, and that's like a whole. That stability on a family level. It it's it's it's a circle, right? Because with a more stable family, the business owners, more stable.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Tina Marie: The business owner is more stable, so the business is more stable, so the family is more stable. Blah! Blah, blah, blah, right? It's just this infinite, wonderful loop. But the opposite is careful.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Dan: And there's also the. There's also the. All of a sudden, you're not hustling.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Dan: Right. So it's it's like, Oh, then.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Dan: If you can. Like when you have time to stop and think.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Dan: And then, you know again, I don't set goals. I don't really plan, but I do. It's like when you start having that.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Dan: And then those things start happening. However, as I pointed out before, they're already happening.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Dan: They're they're already happening. I'm like dude. This is going to happen. So.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Dan: Just because we, as I said to him, just because we can do it, doesn't mean we should. I mean. I know it's it seems, counterintuitive, but.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Dan: We need to stay focused on. Getting people on this platform.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Dan: Period, end of story.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Tina Marie: Right. It's good, it's good. Good. Um! Hold on. Let me go through here. Okay, so.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Tina Marie: Let me go back for a second with the finance. Dashboard!

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tina Marie: Actually, I'll just go look at the notes of because I didn't wrap my head around. Everything that you are doing. But the impending need for it. Why, my dog is going nuts right now. It's bothering me.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Dan: Or for what? For.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Tina Marie: Um. So uh, because because once you get a funnel going right.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Dan: Oh, that dashboard. Yeah, yeah.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Tina Marie: Data finances, all of that like, how are you tracking what you're doing? How are you? And and also just even mapping out. The next quarter, like.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Tina Marie: Whatever your go ahead.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Dan: So Stace Stacy and I are working on um. Figuring out how much money I've put into this, because, as you can imagine, I have no idea.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Dan: Um but her and I that's her and I's task that we started yesterday. Um, and then from that we will get. Hey, this is the this is the monthly.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Dan: Overhead, which is low dollars, really of of actual cash going out. Um, but I have to add up, like all the money that I've invested.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Dan: Quote unquote into this which I I started working on yesterday, and then her and I will just. Come up with that because they had asked for it. And I was like, Yeah, yeah, I'm right on top of that.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Dan: But ultimately we need that to your point. Right? So it's like, okay.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Dan: Because obviously the goal is for me to get paid back. So the the goal is really to be like in the next quarter, like everyone's on a subscription. Where you know the affiliate program is going to be set up and.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Dan: Again. This is a goal for next quarter, so like, get it set up and get it working. So then we're actually.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Dan: You know, in business, for lack of a better term. By by, at least by the end of the quarter, if not like in the middle of next quarter. And then that's the machine like this is what we're running.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Dan: For the next year or 2, or whatever. Unless and until.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Dan: We get to a place where we could sell it as done. Diy, which um, I mean. I think it's possible. But.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Dan: Not right now.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Dan: But maybe it's never possible. Which is fine.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Dan: It's like a gated thing. It's like, Oh, you're not. You're not ready. Oh, we did close the distro flowy deal. So I'm actually.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Dan: I gotta make a. Stacy's non-husband.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Dan: So, Warren, I sent it to Warren. I was like, Hey, man, look over this contract. Tell me if you see any red flags.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Dan: Tell me if there's anything you changed. So he actually did find something that. Did need to be changed, and then he and I worked on that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Dan: For like 2 days. He's coming by today. So hopefully, we'll finalize that language. Then send all that back to.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Dan: Those guys which should be fine, because I sort of explained it to them. In an email when I was extracting data from them.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Dan: So, you know, maybe that goes back like one or 2 more times, and then. Um. Then I just pay them, and we start the subscription. So.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Dan: That should be. I think if they said it takes 4 weeks.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Dan: So that would launch next quarter too. Greg just sent me the 1st draft of the design. I just sent him back some notes.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Tina Marie: Awesome, so.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Dan: Yep.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna have to go back and read the notes for that, too, because so. Distro flowey is that.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Dan: Yep.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Tina Marie: I have it all written down so. But but that's the to, is it? To get song, distribution. Out, or it's because you have one that's capturing like the whole. What's the last song on your catalog? When was it released?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Dan: Oh, no, yeah. So it's a we become a distributor.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Dan: Yeah. So we. So now we are a distributor. So where we can.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Dan: So we work with this one small label, and they're like, Oh, if you guys get distribution, I'll move all my artists onto your distribution. Then, if a new artist is releasing a song right? So if they've never released a song before.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Dan: They have to get distribution. So that's how you get on spotify like you can't go to spotify and say, Hey, spotify. I want to put my song on here. You have to go through a distributor to get on spotify. There's, you know, a bunch of distributors, but there's 3 big ones.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Dan: Tune poor CD. Baby and distro Kid. So we're now.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Dan: That, except it's called Distro flowey. Or that's what we'll be. Now, the song leads that you were referring to that we get.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Dan: Some percentage of those I could tell you, but I. I don't know the exact number, but I'm going to guess it's somewhere around 30%. So.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Dan: For every 100 leads we get 30 artists. That are not on spotify.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Dan: So that means they do not have distribution. So then we make an offer to them that we came up with on the phone.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Dan: With the company, which I thought was hilarious. The guy was like. We were talking about these different pricing plans, and he goes, you know you could just do.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Dan: Release your song for a dollar a year. And I'm and we're like, Wait.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Dan: You don't care about that, do you? And he goes. No, we just get we get our 50% of that. Plus your monthly subscription.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Dan: And and he's like, so yeah, you could just say, release the song for a dollar which nobody has. It's like a crazy offer. And I was like, okay. And then I got with Sean. I said, Can we make it $2? And he's like, why? And I said, I've always wanted a $2 product.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Dan: So I can make a reference to better off dead. Where the paperboy wants is $2.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Dan: $2.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Dan: So it. So we now have a release. Your song for $2. Hey! Shut up!

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Dan: Hey! Get over here, shut up!

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Dan: You guys just like to bark at each other.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Tina Marie: Which one.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Dan: Xenia barks at this dog up the hill. They literally just will go out. She'll go outside. The dog's not out. She'll bark.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Dan: Trying to get that dog to come bark. That dog will do the same thing.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Dan: It just goes outside and barks when she's not around. Trying to get her to come back like, you guys are annoying.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Tina Marie: Hilarious.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Dan: It is so. Anyway, you become a distributor. So now those.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Dan: 30, although it's way. More than that, we probably get over a hundred a month. We can instantly make them an offer. Hey!

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Dan: Sorry we can't take your. We can't consider your song until it's released. You should go. Use this for this. We work with this service. Distro Flowey. You can release your song for $2.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Dan: Yada Yada Yada! And then it's a $2 a year subscription. And then they, if they're.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Dan: You know, if they release more songs a year it would be like $2 per song. So you can get 24. You can. You can do an album for 5 bucks, which is 9 songs. Um, you can do unlimited songs per year.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Dan: For $24, which? So we're. Positioning it.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Dan: Like next to what the other people are doing, and then better than. So we'll see.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Tina Marie: I like it.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Dan: Yep.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Tina Marie: Um, but um, and so. What do you get out of that? Though, as a commission like? Do you earn money.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Dan: So we get half. We get half of the whatever they buy. So we got a dollar for every song they release.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Dan: And then we get a. There's like a royalty percentage. So if their song gets played, and yet we get a small royalty payout.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Dan: On every song in the quote, unquote. Library.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Dan: So if you get like a band. Like we, that band nonpoint that we have so nonpoint gets 3 million streams a month. They pay. They currently probably pay.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Dan: 15%, a 15%, royalty. It's not 15% of the total. It's like 15% of some subset of royalties which we're not going to get into.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Dan: But they're paying, or I'm sorry they're paying 20%. We're instantly 15, so we can go to any big artist and say, Hey, if you switch your.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Dan: Distribution to us. You can save 5%.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Dan: Just period. Um, or better, we. We can make whatever deal we want there. These these guys don't care because.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Dan: We would just pay for that. That artist would be considered a $24 a year. Artist. Unlimited, so they can move their entire catalog over for 25 bucks a year.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Dan: So what what we would tell the deal that we want to make with them is. Hey? We're going to charge you.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Dan: X. Again. We're it'd be like per artist. Oh, yeah, we'll do it for 15%.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Dan: And a hundred $20 a year. So that way, we're not paying. We're making no money off them from the subscription thing that 1 20 we're sending directly to the white label guys.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Dan: So we're just betting on their catalog making money.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I like that because I was, I would say, Yeah, because I was. I remember you talking about this before. But. There's always something new. So I'm like trying to put it together in my head because we haven't had a visual. But I am.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: Put as I, because you don't see but I'm writing all this down on my list that I have. And then also, just. Um with the notes, and then and then with what we did in gear. We're just kind of.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Tina Marie: Finally putting it together in my brain. Because I think most of this. Has probably lived structurally just in your brain. I feel like everyone else has bits and pieces of it, which is generally how it goes. Anyway.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Dan: Yeah, that last bit didn't actually exist on paper until.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Tina Marie: But.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Dan: 10 days ago.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Dan: When we actually had to, we had the so most of that came out of the conversation. The final negotiation was where we nailed down all that.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Dan: And we're like, Oh, yeah, that. Like on the call. I'm like, shit. This is a good plan. And then Sean and I got together after I'm like he's like, do you see anything wrong with this? I'm like, no. Do you.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Dan: He's like, no, we should totally do it like that. I said, Yeah, all right, let's do that, because we, when we were negotiating with them. It was kind of we were kind of unclear about. Their per user fee. And then he really clarified. And I was like, Oh.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Dan: Okay. So you just want a per user fee, no matter what we charge. He's like, yeah. Oh, done. Yeah, yeah, we'll do. We'll do that.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Dan: Makes it super. They're like, we just want to keep it simple. I'm like that is simple. I thought I thought it was way more complicated.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Tina Marie: So when you say on paper uh, like actual piece of paper or.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Dan: Yeah. Well, a doc like Sean put together a doc so that we send it back to. He was going to his. Bosses or whatever. And we're like, okay, this is what we just agreed to on the phone.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Dan: This. These, these are the price points we're going to use. And we just separated them into Sean created a table that just laid that out. And the guy was like, yes, exactly. I'm going to bring this to them because we had negotiated everything up until that.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Dan: Because our I'm not going to get into it. But our our original plan was way more complicated. And then he showed us how. And I was like, Oh, yeah, no, that's just like.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Dan: 4 lines or 5. Okay, yeah, let's do that. And then that's what's going into the contract that.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Dan: Warren and I are working on.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Tina Marie: I love it. Okay, hold on. Let me see if I have other questions.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Dan: I love it. Yeah.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Tina Marie: Carl. I have another call that I don't normally have right after this.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Tina Marie: And I need.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Dan: Okay, I have an in person meeting that I need to go to as well.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay, hold on. Just let me look real quick.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Dan: Cause I'm going to Santa Cruz. So I was like, Oh, wait! We can't meet on Friday, Stacy.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Dan: It's like we need to meet. We need to meet on Thursday.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Tina Marie: Good. Um. Also I feel like my blood sugar just went.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Tina Marie: I'm actually having a bigger issue, keeping it in a healthy range, high. Than not letting it go too high. Anyway, it's fun stuff.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Tina Marie: Crashing. No, I do not have any other questions. What I will do is send the AI notes over. And there was a task I was gonna send to you. From that which I've already forgotten.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Tina Marie: Um. But I sent 1. 0, yeah, for the book request, anyway. So I will send that to you, and then I will catch up with you.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Tina Marie: Let's see, are we talk? Are we meeting next week?

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Dan: 2. Yeah, I'm not. I'm I'm around it.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay. I am on vacation next week, but uh, usually at that time of day when I have all my calls, is.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Tina Marie: It's just a good work time, anyway, so I don't. Think I need to schedule or reschedule anything.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Tina Marie: Think business as usual, anyway.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
