I'm sleepy, I got up at 5.30, but I'm good.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It breaks your throat behind me, I was gonna think, oh yeah, that's funny because you know what honestly I'm just waking up like I woke up early but I feel kind of groggy too but I know I'm getting better and I wrote out instead of reading the Bible this morning I actually just wrote out one of my favorite ones is I can she I just wrote it right but what I'm loving I have this for like seven years I've barely used it I use it for videos for posting videos online and stuff but I have this big it's not it's not your your smaller size I've got I'm just gonna bring it just so you can see the size of it.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like yeah, so I'm using Notability and I'm he's not even bigger than mine I've got the iPad Pro and I thought I had the bigger one but maybe they go there.
00:00:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is like the 12.9 inch on a second. Okay, maybe it's my head small.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. No, I mean, I'm Hold on. No, yours looks way bigger.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And a little for comparison.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was a pretty big Bible. That's yeah, I mean, this is this is mine with the magic case and stuff. I didn't know they go.
00:01:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They've got that big double point. No, let's see. This is my iPhone.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 15. See, Jesus, maybe yours is the same size. It's just kind of the optical illusion of me.
00:01:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When we show you this alert, this is my this is my lock screen.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. I love him.
00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you doing on your big old iPad?
00:01:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, so I have this app called Notability.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You ever heard it?
00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not sure I have actually. Okay. So it's just an app where, like besides just knows the stuff, he didn't get right on it. But what I've been journaling on it, right? So you saw the picture of it from my yesterday, so that's what I was using, you know, I was writing on it. So, and I just grabbed like a template, so it was right, and then what I do is I used to do marketing videos on it, that's kind of what I have it, like yesterday's thing, like I make it in Canva, but then, you know, I put it here, see, and then when I come up, then I might have a graph, but then I can, you know, talk to it, right? Yeah. so here, then I kind of, you know, draw it. So it kind of keeps people's attention, right, when you're drawing on it. And ages ago, I used to use it, I have a stand for it, so I used to put it up here and then just record my videos, and then upload it to Facebook or Facebook ads, whatever. So, of course, video ads made easy, and I was trying to people how to record the iPad or their phone. It's I like drawing. I guess that's why I got the bigger screen probably QA is that way you got the bigger?
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that and my older lady eyes. Yeah Yeah, this stage where I wear glasses all the time except for when I'm working on a screen cuz I have to go like this. Yeah, I had coke bottles losses from age seven till 20 Six maybe and I got LASIK But now they're they're starting to disintegrate again and So what happens now do you have to get LASIK together? What do they say to freedom? I would probably really just have to deal with it because what happens when we get older is the muscles start to weaken and So the distance from near and far becomes more difficult But I'm like there's got to be an exercise and everybody's like nope There's no exercise and then I finally saw a video And someone's like, yeah, you just go focus out here, focus in here, focus out there, and keep doing it.
00:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, that makes sense. So I need to try that. I don't have good eye genes. I'm a little bit the same. look at Lasik, but I've been wearing context, gosh, since I was like 13. And for every step, I don't have to get it. And then now, you know, not only my 50s, I'm like, maybe I'll just wait. But yeah, this is interesting.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If there's a surgery I can get, I will do it. I mean, Lasik was really painful, but it's still tolerable. it in the hours later, I had perfect vision, which was amazing because the peripheral, like I get a little vertigo and just oriented with the rims of my glasses. And then my hair and like, there's all this stuff. So I don't have my full peripheral access because of that. And yeah, I think if there's a surgery and also technology keeps evolving so quickly and we will. But because I have a stigmatism, I can't really where contacts, a stigmatism and the bifocal view issues, so it has to be some significant improvement in technology to really help me a lot, or basically get a new cornea.
00:05:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a high level surgery, and I'm not sure I'm going to go there, and that's not going to go there. don't You're right with technology. Who knows? Five years from now, yeah.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you are, you got a process to try to work on finding your compass, yeah. So sorry, I got a hair in my mouth. Um, we get to talk longer, tomorrow I'd love to just kind of like, hammer you with some questions and go deep, whatever, but for today what I would love to know is, do you feel like, um, you have enough to just keep you focused on
00:06:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
getting more clarity and I like to break things down by the week like if you have an idea like I know what I want to do today I know why I want to do it today my day is full if I get done at the end of the day and these things are done I will have felt like I was on track even if I don't know the big picture I have steps for my now yeah I feel I feel that like I feel more calm or comfortable that I think it's just more about also just taking the action as well to kind of just figure out what what the final kind of compass is right now so so direct answer your question yeah yes I have on my schedule like what I know I need to done today actually want to get your opinion on the power graphic I've started on your your stuff so it's a balance between my own stuff and then also client-like, but I'm really excited about the whole YouTube channel and helping women over in their 40s and 50s kind of reinvent themselves how to start making money online. It's very basic, but I think that's needed and I vacillate between working with beginners versus people for CEOs and already doing really well because I can do both, but I think by doing especially if we've probably come across this a lot for you, a lot of people are scared of getting laid off their executive job, and then how do they do consulting or coaching or do they do a digital offer? That's what I'm sort of playing with and I've got already laid out out of 10 YouTube videos that I want to do, so it's more just starting it and yeah, just kind of going with that. I did have another person reach out to me since yesterday's video. So I said, hey, I once bought left for I kind of thought I could use one more consulting client. So I'm going to probably just quote on something not like huge amount of per month because I don't want. I don't want the responsibility. I love creating. You asked me what brings you joy. I love creating. love low ticket funnels. And I thought, oh my god, I like, yeah, start focusing on that and help me with that. But also maybe make some in advance and flip it, right? Hey, I got a converting offer here. Try some ads for it. already converting. If you have a good back end that this works perfectly for your offer, know, buy this for me for life 15 or 25k, right? So it's done because a lot of people pay 20k to get something done, like, and they don't know if it's going to work, you know? or they're announced as paralysis because I don't to, know, to case really low compared to what, you know, but. uh he's like changed his topic for me three times the last you know 30 days so that's why I haven't started on his because like right when my meet and then we're gonna go with this literally few days later oh no I decided to change my offer I'm gonna do this so best how about we do front in here so I didn't even respond to him he's in front of my dude I didn't even respond to his last text when he said oh I'd rather do this of like I'm gonna come full service and no we decided on this you need to stick with it because you're going or you can pay a new price because I've already started this so if that's that important to you we're renegotiating that's a new contract that's a new price yeah your indecision is not my obligation is not my responsibility is is not anything we had an agreement you renegotiating opens my renegotiating so either we're done and I'm paid by or if you want help the price that you pay for your uncertainty is your
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
delay, but also my fee, because your uncertainty is not my burden.
00:10:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that. That's good. Yeah. Oh, and then other things besides business, like, because I know a lot of it's about self-love, self-care, my nails done here straight. So, oh, you're both red. Yeah, I noticed that. And next week, I'm going to go get my hair highlighted, because I just, you know, everyone will feel good when we're doing that.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:10:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just have to figure out some of my office space since, like, I sprained my knee, and it's kind of hard to go up and down stairs when my office was. So, I'm right here, my living room, and I did bring my soft box lighting down to record part of the video yesterday. So, I'm kind of getting settled in on that. So, I think I'm making movements on that too.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Yeah, it's the environment makes a big deal. When I go into the bathroom and I see myself and my hair looks dull and my energy. my color looks dull. I don't really wear jewelry because I can't.
00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would. I love sparkly.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love sparkly beauty. The beauty of the earth, the beauty anywhere, energizes me. I think it does that to everybody. look at beauty and you just, whether it's the ocean or the sunset or whatever, beauty is powerful. Sometimes people use it really superficially, but I think that there's something to be said for like even in Adam and Eve, we're in the garden of Eden and it was perfect and God said, go dress this garden.
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you made it perfect.
00:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to go do something to improve it? Like, improvements upon what we have is part of the plan to always, you know, all of these things. so if we are continually improving our environment, I'm adding more light, light. or color, for me, lights a big deal.
00:12:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't have enough windows, I'm depressed.
00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If everything is really dark, I'm depressed. Yeah, so it's a big deal. So you going and doing that, creating the content, just pondering on your compass. For me, I call it an anchor because my compass is more a moral compass, it's my values.
00:12:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that can't be somebody else or something else.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is my own personal values, but my anchor that everything is attached to is God. It's that I have a Father and a Heavenly Mother. And I want to be like my Heavenly Mother and I want to be like them. And I love them and I want to honor them and I don't want to hurt their children, even if their children are really mean and horrible to me, I have to remember that hurting them is hurting him. And so I have, you know what I mean? Like I just thinking about those things. um actually creates my values and my compass comes from that but I don't I personally just don't think of it as my compass I think of it as my my center um maybe like the pole which my compass operates like it's my north pole kind of thing yeah yeah so but additionally you're you agreed to show up to talk to me every day so yeah for me I did this with you I got two other women that I will speak with weekly nobody else daily yeah but but I put that into my life um the exercising my mission and just all these little things and I draw a little bit of energy from it but the social part of it though especially the women yeah because we tend to encourage each other and also we catch each other if we're playing small yeah or you know if we're dealing with somebody who's a using us. And then, you know, that word gets thrown around very loosely, but tab using just means using poorly. It doesn't mean that you're baiting us. It doesn't mean that you're a terrible horrible man. But to pay for your time and to make an agreement and then to add more work on it because somebody changed their mind is abusing. It's not using you as a grade-upon outside of, you know. So I built things like that into my life so that I don't keep having it. You're building that. One way or another, things are going to just improve because of the compounding effect of the environment that you're creating and the energy that you're improving. So it's awesome. love how simple it is. And again, that's like a fundamental principle, right? It's just improve your environment. It's what you're having showing up in your life consistently and things just get better.
00:14:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. yeah, so like I yeah, so Oh, feeling good. You know, I know, um, as part of, uh, sort of into searching around my mom as well. And, uh, There's a little bit of codependency between us, right? You know, so, so even though I love spending time for, I can't spend every single minute of like a lunch or dinner with her because then I'm the crutch to her and she needs to start socializing on her own. So I kind of had that realization, like even like she's funny, called this morning. My brother was there on, can you stop by? was way to work. And so he picked up and said, I'm glad you're there. And they said, yeah, I brought my Macapuccino. So cool. And then, and then, and then, and then when I talk to my mom, So will I see you today? And I'm like, well, no pause there. And then you also have, we have one girl a week that comes and takes her shopping to her favorite grocery store and all this stuff, like the three hours spent time with her. And, uh, I said, no, you're seeing Lisa today. And will I see you tomorrow? Like she wants every day. And I said, well, we'll see, mom. But, um, you know, so, so that was a big, I mean, sort of realized that a while ago, too, because I know my sister even said she lives in five hour flight, but she said, you two really could pet her on each other, like she's come to, like, like literally, if I don't call her for a couple days, when I was sick about a while ago, I love five voicemails from her. But yeah, where are you? But yeah, when you come by, or if we could bring some orange juice to you, like, so it's adorable. But at the same time, I know that she's got a fly on her wings, too, and not just depend on me. So, because she's got a lot of friends, does art tomorrow afternoon for art friends. Like, got a lot of activities. I just don't want her, um, I guess what I'm saying is it was just a good realization and me encouraging her, because when she called me, why don't you call so-and-so your friend? Why don't you call, you know, this person, like, so I'm, you know, it's just, it's just a place that I'm co-hosting her, you know, it's that ever, it's that question of what's, what does she want? I still feel she'll be better socializing in a retirement home, but I also have to let go of the wheel and let her decide that, you know, that's the thing, yeah.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really tough. The one thing, especially working on my psychology classes is studying the difference between individualistic cultures and collectivist cultures, like Japan, China, Eastern cultures, African cultures, they're collectivist. They are more about the collective group and the community rather than the individual. The individual isn't lost though. It's just that we all are part of each other and we have, you know, Latinas are multi-generational houses and nobody calls that codependent because it's called family. And the thing about this individualistic culture I feel like there's a lot of the adversary of Satan, darkness that tries to pull families apart and cause it pop culture and psychology and says dependency. And so I would say trust your heart and your feelings. I do think we all need to work on our socializing. I think that our happiness is attached to a single other person, whether it's a spouse or a child or a friend or whatever. I think that's too much burden. I think that we're supposed to have bigger communities. But I do think that it is really a dark and poor thing that we have called it individualistic and independent and separated ourselves from each other. The happiest and the most, the longest living cultures have three or four generations in their house. They don't lock their doors, their windows are always open, nobody calls that codependency, they live the longest. I don't think it's Italy, but it's in that area. Yeah, so I would say that you have a very strong heart, and I think that that is what your compass is, your love and your heart. I think your love is. I think the reason you thought it was your dad was because you loved him so much, because he had so much of your heart. But really, I think it's your heart. I think your heart tells you what is true, I think that when we feel lost, we look for guidance, and I think we have to be very careful to not just who we look at, but what is the why behind it. solid are they in their compass? how happy are they? How happy have their decisions made them? Do they have a lot of love in their lives? Do they have really loving relationships? Are they complaining about other relationships a lot?
00:20:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they feel bitter and angry?
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're going to take advice, take it from advice from people who are happy, who are centered, who are peaceful. Yeah. But yeah, so it's a hard thing. for sure need to be able to have our own identity that just is us. But part of us is part of other people. Your mom still has your cells in her body. She is attached to you. It's tethered. It's not, she's not a friend. She's not, um, yeah. Anyway, just, just something I've considered, you know, my mom was really, really abusive to me. We aren't close, but I a thing about her every day, I want to get to the point where I can buy her as she wants a traveling van or an RV and just to be free and go wherever she wants to go. She'll never be able to do that for herself. And so my goal is that in five years, I can make that happen for her.
00:21:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Along with the ability to help her sustain that and but I'll only do it if she will agree to join groups where she can travel into other people. Because we don't have a kind of relationship where we can live together. Although I would and I don't plan on having a set house, plan being portable, mobile and going out anywhere. Otherwise I would make a place for her that was close to me even though we don't get along well because I think that that's how important it is. And God told us honor your mother and father that they days may be long upon the earth. And here's the thing that people never quote this by the way, but they also say parents provoke not nice children. and unto wrath lest he esteem thee as thine enemy. Always talk about honor your parents, but they don't talk about the parents role, too, honor their children. Anyway, some sort of thought as you're going through this, think adding the friends and the community is great, but if you just love being with your mom and it brings you, she's not gonna be here forever.
00:22:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I know, yeah, yeah. So I'm not gonna live in my house here, but with the dog and the cat, the dog's 85 pounds, and I'm scared. Yeah, knock your mom over. Yeah, yeah, it's little dangerous for her. Yeah. And she does like her own place. She likes her own solace. And then she's an artist, too, so she likes, yeah, that's why she was no, like, she even freaked out us hiring Lisa to spend three hours of her every Tuesday, who's a retired nurse and perfect for her, right?
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom's a retired nurse, you know? Strong woman, huh?
00:22:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, no, thank you for that. That's that's that's And also, because yeah, Lithuanian is the sense is my mom and dad were born Lithuania, even though they met in Canada when they were, you know, in their 20s. But like our East European heritage, like typically, yeah, the parents live with the kids, you know, like, like my dad's sister had my dad's, actually they live side by side, they had two little houses side by side, you know. And so, but no, my mom's funny.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, no, I love that. I'm really excited about tomorrow, because I want to ask lots of questions, but I'm also really excited.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
would love to see the power wrap right that you started. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not like, what do you call a, it's important just to be very simple about it, but I like it like the start of it. That's, that's kind of it. Oh, did I send you what Maui made? You sent me the Canva presentations.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I get to send this to you because I have a graphic sky. You're going to be annoyed that I've worked with for like 10 years. He's from the Philippines and I was like, I told him I was going to have it and want it. But I wasn't ready for it yet. But he's like, here, man, I already got to start it. I was like, Maui, I didn't even give you instructions yet.
00:24:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is what he made.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I sent you on Facebook because I don't know how to download it from here. Oh, you sent me on Facebook? Hold on. Hold on. I will screen share with you. You're going to laugh. I think you're going to laugh. Watch this.
00:24:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's good too.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's beautiful.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like it. Yeah.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Why is there an iced tea? either. No, he is a goofball. I don't know.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he's generous. She got a dick in it. It could be coffee too. But yeah, he's really good.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
By the way, you're graphic. he's he's wonderful. Um, he's got three daughters and a wife there in the Philippines. And he's respectful, so kind, works quickly. Very humble. Yeah, I love, I love the Filipino people.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're very good people. Well, I love it.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, God. So any updated this spreadsheet for me too? Is this the right one? No, that's not the right one. Let's see if I can get animation of open client stuff.
00:25:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, Maui, can you go take, you know, put it in a spreadsheet? So like, I want to improve how this looks a little bit better. So I was working on that. The other thing, is this the right thing? Did you happen to take a look at this?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I know you told me about it this morning, but I haven't had a chance yet, but I will this afternoon.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, I wondered if it might be helpful.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It would take a whole, probably five minutes. I don't want to, but if I just read it to you.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. how it flows because the difference of the text versus like my voice is the difference, right?
00:26:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah. Yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I'm gonna get my water.
00:26:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got.
00:26:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Um, probably needs to work on this, but anyway. All right. Hey there, genius. I know you're a genius because you just chose a path of working so much smarter. You don't know me yet, but you're going to learn very quickly that I am hyper excited about what I do. Part of that might just be the H and the ADHD, but I don't it. And what I can tell you is that if you're a person who's also struggled to focus, you are going to love what I teach you if you're willing to suspend your irritation.
00:27:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
about doing organizational tasks, everything I have ever done since high school has been around getting the greatest results from the least amount of effort.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not because I'm lazy but because I despise waste and I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day and only a handful of those really spent on what matters to me. I want an amazing life and I figured out how to create that for myself. Along the way I figured out how to help people who have totally different values and mental processes do the same. The exercise you're about to go through has been life-changing for so many. It is deceptively simple. It looks like an ordinary spreadsheet but and I need you to really hear me on this. Pretend that the spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter but in real life it's a superhero. I first had people go through this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I have been delighted to learn that this exercise alone own was deemed worth the price of my full course at that time. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful and valuable in helping people make the most amount of money with the least amount of time and stress. I'll give you two other examples of how this exercise impacted two very different people. One, a voice coach and a musician who hated numbers and all things administrative. By the way, I have yet to meet a business owner who liked the advent and stuff, but she trusted me and so she did the exercise. When she finally finished the work, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. I'll link her testimony below if you want to hear from her. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music and she got there three years early. In fact, I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday, a video of her on a ranch inviting me to come visit. When I tell you I'm different, but I can get two results.
00:28:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope that you will trust me just enough to try this for yourself.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll also tell you got a doctor client in mind who just this week just did this exercise and how it flipped what he thought he knew about his business. He has multiple businesses with varying degrees of effort and profit margins. He was 1000% positive that one particular channel was the most profitable turns out. Another part of his business actually makes him $1,666 more per hour than the one that made him the most amount of money. So by switching five hours a week from one business to the other, he will make over 86. No, I'm actually did that math. It was like 430,000 more per year.
00:29:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
told you my math.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 430 half a million dollars almost more. This is why you're such a genius because you're going to learn in just a few minutes, what wasn't taught in medical school and isn't taught how to be anywhere else, including business schools, but in tiny corners of the world where some someone nerdy like me figured out how to do some awesome math and you stumbled into one of those corners. You may not know how to make. But you may know how to make money, but if you do not know what to do to make the most amount of money in the least amount of time in your own business with your own skill sets, then you might be spending more time in low profit activities and cutting your earning power in half or more. That is what this exercise is going to reveal. I'm not going to teach you how to make money. You should not be here. If you don't already have a business that generates money. What I am going to show you is how to leverage your time according to your skills and your existing business. You will discover ways to improve things according to your own values, skills, and resources.
00:30:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There is nothing magic here, even if it feels like it is when you're done.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I will help you receive is clarity. That clarity will move you like few things ever have and you will do it with so much confidence. Do the work. Tell me your mom that you can't.
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ready to see? Let's go. I love it. Love it.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect.
00:30:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay! I love it I love it um so like when you do that video do you um do you do do captions underneath or are you gonna just let like we can do everything what I'll do is I'll start it first I think you should have captions because the study that I read is that people are watching videos at work or they can't listen and they want to consume the content so you need to make it so that they can consume it on mute wherever they're at whenever they're at perfect I also think maybe popping up some little emojis some little like one or two pictures of what it looks like or little things just the the engagement right so it's not just my face and just the words because we do have that ADHD but also if it's done right they reinforce the message your graphic artist seems so good if you give them the script you might come up with a few things things to keep me.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's a great idea. I don't have a video editor. But you know, what I should do is talk to him and see what kind of because I don't because I pay him hourly. And if he's got a slow machine and stuff, I'm not I don't I don't want him to do that. But yeah, I would love to be able to give him more consistent work. So I will see if he wants to get into some super simple video editing.
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, good idea. I'm like using CapCut or VDDIO. We have our guy. He's not as creative or didn't he doesn't listen to my instructions. So we have him back on Pinterest. But we did I did train him on these CapCut and how to do stuff. So he was able to do it for the Philippines. just though he thought he could do a lot more other things besides what I asked him to do to a video.
00:32:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, what are you doing?
00:32:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so yeah, but no, no big deal. But anyways, yeah, that could be cool. But
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's perfect like and that's huge about the doctor and meaning like oh my gosh I was like do yeah like this by the way is paid for my coaching for years if you actually implement what I've just taught you a five hour shift each week yeah the problem is that the business model he has has limitations to how much he can do and grow but but he had no idea he was 100% sure it was yeah I feel like it's got to be more than that I've got to do the math hold on a second that's huge no really huge what's tall well congratulations that's a big win so I get up with all the time Maria that's what these things do wait we do what sorry this activity that's what it does this happens all the time that kind of revelation that can result in millions pretty quickly if I'm working with high-level people and for low low where I don't say low level people, but lower earning people. What happens is that clarity confidence, which reduces stress. It reduces their mental friction every day. So even though they're not making as much money fast, I removed a huge burden. This, this is normal, like getting massive cause as normal anyway.
00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, when I like about it, too, is that like even for me, like, even though, yeah, I still figure out the exact offer and, you know, what business I want to have over the next, you know, year, five years, even 10 years out. Um, but what do I do now? Like just doing that activity is like, regardless, like I was doing nothing to build my audience, like it was, it was like crazy and a lot of shiny object syndrome, you know, not going lie, like, oh, yeah, want to research YouTube videos and before I know it, I'm two hours into it. It's like, no, it didn't need. So it was interesting. was really good for me to go, okay, if I want to make money, I better start showing up more, period. like even if I haven't figured it all out yet, just show up more because I know that I used to teach people, hey, more lives you do the more money you make, you know.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you have way to capture the people that show up, like you have an offer to make because showing up doesn't do any good if you don't offer to drive them to follow up sequence to continue to nurture them to ascend them. So, you know, that's a big conversation. But yeah, for sure, I'm glad that that was insightful for you.
00:35:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, how can I just, I know we're supposed to get going because we want to keep this short, how can I help you get this low-tech offer off the ground? Because originally, typically I do the graphics, but you kind of had a guy do it, which is amazing, right? go with that. do you do you drink coffee, right? you drink coffee? Oh, you don't?
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then keep it as the iced tea. I don't drink iced tea either.
00:35:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, but typically, like I kind of put it up on like a could funnel page or something and and the person then imports that into their click funnels, or they if they have goal level, they import there. I'm looking at system I own myself because I got pissed off at active campaign tripling the price of my service. Yeah, they do a lot changes and they change plans and it's like my bill tripled. I like what are you guys doing them? So they're because they added AI in it and they added the sales pipeline management to it, but I don't want those features. So yeah, so anyways, so a lot of people I know are starting to use the system. But yeah, what can I do to help move the little ticket offer forward?
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got decided to use Wordpress and Elementor and funnel kit. And this is a landing page that I liked the template of and that's really too much for a this low ticket offer, but it's very easy to pick and choose a few things from here and then got everything else. And with funnel kits, they have really simple, and I didn't know she'd done this, a good job for her. Really simple stuff. mean, this looks like an onter page, really, this is the basic template for an onter page also. So really, I feel like I get the copy in my sales letter. The things that need to happen is ads follow up sequences. I don't know, you know, you've already has your offer and you know what you're do, you do, but any first of all, any just kind of directional support saying, okay, this is what we need to do next. Let's set a date, let's set a time. Giving feedback on the copy is amazing. But, you know, I haven't run ads in, I mean, 12 years.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still think that I could do amazing at it, but I don't want to. I want to serve my clients. I want to create the content. So whatever I can tap other people's brains for and pay for or exchange, you know, my services for. Or that's what I want to do because, and this is what I teach everybody is the more types of work you do, the more friction you create because of the, yeah, get out of flow of, you know, if it's analytical, if it's creative, if it's administrative, all those different types of things, it takes a while to shift from one to another. And so I want to minimize the shifting and the only way that I can do that will the best way for me to do that, especially with the minimal amount of time that I'm that I want to work. And so that when I do what I do, I do it at the highest level is by using other people for the other things. Now, I'll probably always tweak some copy and be like, oh, let's do this. Let's do that a little bit. So I feel like I'm pretty good at copy and psychology and persuasion. But any help in the creation or suggestions or, hey, you should probably have a seven day follow up sequence for this. And maybe these are the bullet points or these are things. Anything that reduces my mental load by zooming me into the next step a little bit closer, just because I can get there doesn't mean that it doesn't help lift my burden.
00:39:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, have a good like a typically I deliver the load ticket off where there's like a little Google slide presentation and it's like maybe some suggestions templates for the abandoned cart email series. Wait, if you're using this template, is there an Abandoned carts. Do they first click a button and enter the email to get to the order checkout page? Initially, it's not a deal breaker at by any means.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no funnel kit. Let me go Abandoned card to see what Google tells me Captain V. It's boost orders time. follow up some brothers. I don't know They probably your sales page example again.
00:40:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
me see what happens when they click the button to buy it That you're this one. Yeah, when they say get in there what happened? Oh, it takes right there Okay, so there's two choices You could just take them right there and we just test that out And then the next choice can be when they click that button kind of frank hernsel They enter their email not their name or anything else. They're just their email to then get to this page So then there's an automation that we can run that checks after life say 15 minutes Then they buy or not and if they didn't buy then typically a three email Series that's called a band and cart where it's like hey notice you Didn't check out finish your checkout process, you know, did like get in the way and you can include your customer testimonial, come back and buy it. But it's not critical because I just saw today, I was talking about lady that has a $77 frontend offer teaching people how to become fractional consultants. And she uses a Sam cart and she has no band cart and yet she's converting at 5%, which is really good for a $77 offer. So, you know, we could start with this first and then see what the conversion rates are and then go from there.
00:41:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I like that. And also, I've got my dev girl putting in Google Analytics on there to make sure that we can track all of that.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, beginning. Another note, like, I think you and I talk about this. Do you, are you going to start a YouTube channel?
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I know. I mean, I know that I mean, all of my business has been a word of mouth and it's always also and the way people I've had people recommend me who've never even worked with me because of my Facebook posts. So my content is powerful and it wasn't even video. I can't even tell you how many times I've been told you should write a you should do a podcast, you should be on video, whatever. So I know that I need to do that and I know that YouTube is the king for lower cost leads. You tap into the SEO power there as well. So yeah, I would want to create the content for YouTube and repurpose elsewhere rather than the other way around.
00:42:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I'm kind of attacking that strategy too. So I just because Facebook's good and ads are good, but it's just it's when you turn ads off for whatever reason that all of a sudden it's nothing, right? get no more traffic. Whereas YouTube, some of my friends that have started their YouTube tube channel even a couple years ago, they're still getting traffic from something from three years ago a video they did, right?
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what do we think about this over the other one? With the express checkout option up there versus this? I love when these things are up at the top, especially if there's Apple Pay. Should I do that?
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, because they already saw the sales page you clicked to buy, but go back to the top then again.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can get rid of most of the stuff.
00:43:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's very simplistic and yeah, that's fine. Let's see what that's there. It reminded me a little But what Shopify looks like, and that's kind of why I was thinking maybe subconsciously, that's a good thing. Yeah, anything that is familiar. Yeah, like the top part necessarily, but that part there. Right. Shopify sometimes, you know.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but just replace this with like a purple strip. What is Shopify as a blue or purple? I don't remember.
00:44:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it's purple. Uh, well, it depends on if someone changed the cart, because the standard one, I think, is just white with your logo will be on the top left, right?
00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I think this will probably be better. Sorry, and that's the thing, I think, too, that will be great about our short calls is that, so when we get clarity on what are the steps, be like, okay, what did you do? And then like, okay, well these are the things I have to do, but I'm not sure if I should do this or this or This or this? Yeah, I think that is going to become a very big part of the conversation, probably for both of us. I was thinking this, I was thinking this, here's my criteria, got anything to add to it to help me kind of like narrow it down. And then obviously we make our own decisions, but that feedback with somebody who understands all the nuance of the decision is super helpful. And then, okay, cool, then I'm not gonna sit with that all day going should I do that?
00:45:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Should I do that?
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that little echo is just enough. And even if it's wrong, it doesn't even matter if it's wrong. Sometimes just hearing something back gets us to take action. We learn if it's right or wrong through testing.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're never going to guess everything correctly. Our opinions don't really mean anything. But we use them before we activate ourselves into action. Yeah. so anyway, but I think that I'll get inhabited being much faster with that kind of stuff and like.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyways, anyway, cool. Love it. Okay. Wow. Let's go Have an amazing day. All right. See you.
