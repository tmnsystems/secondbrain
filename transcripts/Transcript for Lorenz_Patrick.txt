I read an article this morning that there's a flu epidemic in San Diego. I'm pretty sure me and my son started it. When we started it? Well, we went on vacation to San Diego last week to see the zoo and stuff, and we were all sick, so I don't know. It makes sense to me.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, everybody's just had quite the month, haven't they?
00:00:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple months.
00:00:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is pretty flu stricken as well.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, Patrick's not going to be here because Mark kidnapped him. Oh. It's just you and me today. How's Miss Kerri?
00:01:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's sick.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On top of everything. Well, the gauntlet, a refiner's fire, it's something else, isn't it?
00:01:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I, the mission that I'm serving in, I work from home, it's crazy to me. just, the things that are happening, the trials for my family, but working with senior people, you know, they're like late 70s and 80s, most of them. We do have some younger kids, but they're they're unable to serve a mission for one reason or another, generally, you know, health, but some of it is autism and things like that. with the, you know, grandparent level people are unfiltered. At our age, we're still, especially with kids at home, you know, you kind of dance around the topics and we don't really just tell it like it is. And I think that that actually is kind of more detrimental to us that, like, if you listen the profit and our general authorities, when they tell stories, they call out names. They're like, well, or they'll say, my son, my daughter, and you know, everybody in their family and community knows exactly who they're talking about. And they talk about things in detail. And I honestly think it's the adversary that kind of just convinces us that political correctness and keeping things quiet is the way to do it so that we won't know what's happening. And we think that we're alone. But working with these, these people, the amounts, like it's interesting to me how eerily similar the types of trials are, the way that the adversary has attacked families, the kinds of behaviors and things and we think that hardly anybody's going through it, but like everybody's going through it one way or another. The kids that follow away or just make some really weird and disturbing choices and yeah anyway it's just crazy but so like there's different types of trials, of them are really physical, some are really financial, some of them like spiritual, I think it's all spiritual but are like what's the world like, faith crisis type things, identity crisis type things like they're they're all different ones but everybody is going through it and I really feel like that's just part of of the the preparation you know for and being strengthened enough for the things that are coming and that's the reading for this week right the calamities of the last days I haven't read it yet so yeah that makes perfect sense um but that's one of the things that's um that I love about reading the scripture so much is that it just gives me peace because like I've seen these patterns I've seen these patterns they they repeat over and over again and also with just history you know human history and um philanthropy studying the different cultures and whatnot it does us well to learn it because then you know these are the patterns this is the stuff we got to get there and I feel like it can kind of fortify us like it passes but also it comes with some strength like we can we can be strengthened through it so Well, I know it sucks. We lean in and find the good things and trust that the break comes.
00:05:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's come.
00:05:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, yeah. You know, I, we have the flu. It's not fun. But compared to the rest of the world, what they're going through, you know, it's, we're okay with the flu.
00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fine. Right. I'll take the flu and my bronchitis and my asthma and my arthritis and everything else over cancer over like I have kidney pain all the time, but I have kidneys and they're not gone. You know what I mean? I don't have kidney cancer. There was a brother at church and he just had his leg cut off and I'm like, I have to wear glasses. That's annoying, but I have eyes and I can see and I can hear and yeah, perspective, perspective is good. And I heard that hate just up and left. So how is that affecting you?
00:05:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I mean, you know, I talk tomorrow. a little bit about it when that happened. I was like, honestly, you know, I, if we need to increase our case volume, this is a good time to do it. We're, we can handle it. And he was like, well, I might also most of it to Patrick, so we can keep Liz on board and try to keep her busy while we look for another attorney. And, you know, it's fine, whatever you want to do. But if our case load increases at this point, this is a good time. We can handle it.
00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm glad that you feel that way. I was worried that you might be stressed out a little bit. But it does help too. Well, I'm trying to get in a little bit fine. Sometimes the password for this account changes automatically.
00:06:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
then it's pretty surprising. never met Hank until the holiday party and I got to spend a little bit time with him and he looked pretty solid.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are steady. You know, you always are, what can you do to be better, constantly improving, and like, I don't know if you have any interest in going anywhere, but I think that you're a great fit for Sweet Law.
00:08:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I haven't checked my, what you call it? don't even know what it's called anymore. The, the place where everyone like looks for tops, the monster.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, like indeed or something?
00:08:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, indeed. haven't checked my account in like three years.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. I'm glad to hear that because, I mean, everything that we're trying to do is built around people is built around who we have. And, you know, the priority of the company is definitely to be profitable and to make money and to grow. But right underneath that, I'm very close to it, Mark like making people happy, taking care of people, actually getting them justice, making this people That's why people are so loyal to him. That's why I'm able to feel that.
00:09:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good. The guy that wanted me to take over his firm last year, and I went straight to Mark about it, I wasn't like trying to hide into that or anything. And he was like, he was like super cool. was like, oh yeah, if you ever want to do something like that, let me know, help you out. I was like, mean, I'm not interested. know, I've done the firm that I'm not interested in having my own firm or anything like that, but That's a lot of work and a lot of stress. Yeah, I can't put my wife through it again.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what I'm doing.
00:09:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And Mark, his response was so he they don't make many like that.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, good. Okay, so you're not stressed out and you feel like you could take more. why don't we get some stats real quick? Let me go to my dashboard. What are you going to say?
00:10:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, no, was like hopping.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. So I'm going to go ahead and do last 30 days and screen show you.
00:10:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Somebody was rough.
00:10:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know. And we're going to take that into account. So but it's not just you. It's across all of Sweet Law.
00:10:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There have been Sam had a Sam and Tyler had pretty awesome months today.
00:10:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but the lead volume has been lower. You all have different teams and And there's been months where you did better, and you've had improvements that they didn't. So because of the length of the cases, we have to take all of this information in perspective, know, keep it that way. So we are just looking at the last 30 days. So this is gonna be really, wanna make sure that we're looking at this right. Okay, good. All right.
00:11:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Mark had an awesome month. It's unbearable.
00:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we don't even like Mark's cases are, yeah. Oh, and gross attorney fees. We had some really big ends and some settlements come in. So that was good. Okay, so we'll look at really 30 days is not anything to look at. I just look anyway. Because this is, you know, what's her average? Okay, so look at this average days to close team Samantha for the last 30 days, so See how easy it is for these to just look really weird So it's really good that we're looking at all of this and looking at it different ways frequently So that you can go okay. It doesn't always look one particular way So now let's go last 90 days and it's refreshing and so 90 days is a little bit of a longer period, but I really want to look for like a whole year um And see this this this can't be right because It is remember because we're closing out a lot of older cases.
00:12:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So it's throwing off in November and December we closed down a lot of Cases where we we help funds and trust because because we're waiting on Medicare, or waiting on Tricare, or waiting on a lien holder. So the case cannot be closed until that lien is resolved. And so a lot of those cases work. We move through a lot of those old cases, and so it's going to throw off the average.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that, so but here's the thing. This number should be bigger than this number.
00:13:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, let's see what you're saying.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So something is off because every other time, that's how it looks. And for Samantha, that's how it looks, and for Tyler, that's how it looks. these statuses, it feels like it would be a status issue, probably. But let's go ahead and look at last. The year, the whole year. I know we've looked at this a lot, but we finished the year, so let's look at that. Average days to close 371, average resolution, right? So that's, we, we know what we're getting. Now we're just waiting for the check to come in. This is how long it takes to get the check. This is how long it takes to actually settle the case. resolution is settled. This is closed. Pate. So Samantha, just of their 300 days to settle, 355 to close, and the gap between you guys is 16 days there, and 47 days there. Hold on a second. No, 33 plus 4, days. Um, which is not huge. Let's see, Patrick, we can't even look at his data, Tyler, um, then And then this, it's just so interesting. Everybody's different, plus you have a different state. So that has to be taken into account. All of these things have to be taken into account. So we could do some comparison.
00:15:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I was, that is one thing that I'm sad that we lost Hank for, because I was looking forward to compare our stats this year. Yeah, to get to have those comparison.
00:15:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. And it really takes us a long time to find new attorneys that match, that are good match for sweet laws. we'll see what happens.
00:15:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
He wasn't getting, like Mark was giving him good cases too.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not like he was. Yeah, I think, I think he just, maybe just didn't want to work. He went to a small firm. So there would be a smaller load. And that really might be all it is. Last. two years. let's let's go check in on one more time real quick and go and look at everybody's. So we're going to look at really focus on resolution. Your gap between resolution as close is pretty good. Samantha's is actually a bigger gap. So like that gap I think is significant to watch. And Tyler's is closer to yours about a month.
00:16:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah I was I was beating Tyler until about August I think this year. And then August I don't feel like Mark talked to him or something but he just kind of just woke up and started settling like crazy.
00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder what happened. should ask Mark about that. Okay so we're going to go last two years with this refresh. back down here.
00:16:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Here's me.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so yeah, if you were looking at that before your resolution speed looks like it slowed down a little, but your closed time picked up. What did we say that was? That was like 3.33. And, ooh, Samantha's has improved little. Tyler's has not, because, um, wait a minute. I don't if was hers. I feel like it was $2.99. So, actually, everybody's stuff. So this is, we're averaging over the last two years. The last two years data is better than the last year. Why I think that happened is because of case volume. Um, I think it's taken a little bit longer also because, so let me, let me check this. Tyra went up.
00:19:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
My average fee went down from last.
00:19:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so the first one was the last two years.
00:19:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That was 12k.
00:19:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And Samantha was the same. Tyra was, I think, the same. Patrick went up to 14k for. So this is the last two years and then one more time we're going to go to last year. 13, 18, 12, and you're 12. Come on, let's fly. You can do it. We've got mentally heavy crash.
00:19:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it's a little bit discouraging.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. But those old cases that you just settled or closed out, do you think that they had any impact on the average attorney fee?
00:20:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Probably some. The biggest impact, the biggest difference I can, you know, from my end that I can see is state farm and USA have been a lot tighter at their wallets this year than they were the year before. That should be the same for the other attorneys.
00:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it, I mean, is it possible that it's different for Arizona, even with state farm because every state has to be different for Insurance companies also it's possible.
00:21:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's also possible that we do litigate a lot less in Arizona, so You know the the longer we practice in Arizona And the more we're gonna get a reputation for a non non litigation firm So there's less you know, maybe there's less leverage there but Because I have been referred for state farm I I continually get referred to the non litigation adjusters So they know that we're not Likely to litigate a lot in Arizona, although we have been doing a little bit more so Yeah, so one thing though that does stand out is that your percentage of hitting the 40% is
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
higher, let's see, 105, so you, I don't know what that percentage is, but it's more than Tyler, and more than Samantha, significantly more, matters hit the 40%. So that's good.
00:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What does that indicate client satisfaction, or?
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's how much you hit policy limits, or get the full, not policy limits, the full 40% attorney fees, whoops. So if your average attorney fees are lower, but you're hitting the max 40% or often than other people, then it must be the value of the cases. Yeah, I do feel like we emphasize, let me actually, let me do one more quick math real quick. because it could also be volume. So Samantha did 139 plus 105, so that's 244 matters. You had 98 plus 123. What did I say hers was 144 and yours is 121. So, I mean, 18,000, let me do some quick math here real quick. I'm going to a calculator out. Okay, so Samantha 139, 105, and I'm going 439,000, 4,392. thousand, which is about right. It says 4.4 million and you were 2.5 million. So, then it has to be value of the case. Well, I need to talk to Mark about this so we can figure some things out because I think it would help you feel better about what's happening when we're looking at comparison because if she's averaging 18,000, like what are the total case value difference? Easy versus CA. Because if she's hitting it, attorney fee 40% max, less than you, but averaging 18,000 per case. Either we've got some major outlier cases that were huge.
00:25:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We did get a lot of huge cases this year.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She, but not you, right?
00:25:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Correct.
00:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. um, super big cases. And those I want to throw out, like if I could go and just take those out and see what the numbers are. So, oh, can I get a report? Can I get a report that's, um, excludes outlier cases to get real average. That's what I want to do. I think, Okay. That that would even the playing field. You can't help whether not you get one of those cases.
00:26:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She can't help it.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it's a death case, right? there are certain types of cases. So, and if Arizona is not a litigation um state primarily and you have a reputation for that, death cases in Arizona are probably going to go to a litigation firm, I would think. We get a few and Mark handles them.
00:26:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Um but um yeah not.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My point is does it take you out of the running for some of the types of cases that that would change your averages like this. know what mean? So, because the whole point of looking at these stats is to measure But let's do this. Let's, let's do this. Let's do this. So how much money did you make for a lot last year? I haven't looked at my taxes yet, but ballpark it.
00:27:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have them to to 60 to 70.
00:27:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how much did you make sweet law last year?
00:27:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wait, no, no, not to. Probably 170, 180.
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Give it. Look at this number. Remember, we have the conversation about being a profitable servant.
00:27:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's super easy math, right?
00:27:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
right?
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Is low rent profitable servant?
00:27:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, and I don't want to be the devil. I get what you're saying and I want to stay positive. don't want to be like negative nelly, but I also have to take into account like my team. And so let's do that math.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So having as your team, what's their average? All right, do you have any idea? I have an idea.
00:28:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You got a ballpark, it's a 22 bucks an hour.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably somewhere around there.
00:28:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. don't know, what is that?
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's just say, let's be really gracious and say, everybody makes it on a thought that they don't. How many people are on your team?
00:28:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Five right now, one is count on temporary, but five right now.
00:28:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's say your team costs $700,000. And let's say, OK, so how many matters did you have? Let's just build world math, 98, that's 123, which those aren't even the cases you got paid with, equals 221. So the average I'm going to do this mask because I don't I think that's math. I'm not supposed to share how much it costs us to get a case, but I'm not. Oh, actually, I'm not. Yeah, I mean, well, these profit margins are an issue, sweet lot. The incentive program is really good. And it isn't the most profitable business, but it is profitable. You're a profitable servant.
00:29:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can't share these numbers with you because they're it's not appropriate. Absolutely.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no, it's but I promise you you're a profitable servant.
00:29:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, uh, enough. Nobody's going to walk away from that money and or you and the team. So even if these numbers say the same and they're not what you want them to be, it would make no sense for you to be in any kind of risk. And I can promise you. So I wouldn't bring this up. If this wasn't true, I've asked, does Lorenz have anything to worry about? Mark, absolutely not. No.
00:30:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And I appreciate that because, you know, I think it may seem when you talk to me that I'm pretty, I might be a little bordering on negative and anxious, but that stems from wanting to grow. don't, I am not interested in, you know, a nine to five job where I just check in and clock in and clock out. I want to be Part of this growth. That's what excites me about coming in is is is growing this firm and that's why I'm That that anxiety it comes from Wanting to be my growing or am I not growing?
00:31:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I want to grow Yes, that's good to know that helps with the perspective. Mm-hmm. What we have to look at is all the data points so this data is kind of skewed in in that Some of these things are in your control and some of them aren't All that we can do is look at are we improving now all the things don't improve at the same time Sometimes so here's what I know grew and improved this year that's going to continue to Have compounding benefits that you will continue to reap and that your employer will continue to reap and that is is the way that you're reviewing the cases. You're looking at them more frequently, more diligently, and more deeply and managing it well. You have grown your, I mean, the changes vary just opening up more and feeling safer. That's a leadership that's not quantitative, that's qualitative, right?
00:32:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I appreciate that because I told Mark before I even met you, I told Mark, you know, my one weakness is I struggle managing people. I have, you know, I'm used to just burying my head and my work and let people just manage themselves. so that's why he connected us and I am very mindful of the fact that any success I've had, The ship wise is directly connected to your mentorships.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
appreciate that.
00:33:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not BSing you either. That's like, that's true.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's real. I got goosebumps.
00:33:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Thank you.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really care about my job too. I love what I do. And I love that also. I'm super excited. I have my second promotion in my mission. So now I have two little sets of missionaries and I won't get to do as much of the genealogy work, but in my patriarchal blessing, was told to study leadership. I was 19 years old and given some specific direction into that. And so to be able to get to use my gifts and talents and training and organization and supporting in, you know, it's a business, but it's also the mission field. Like, I am so excited that because we make, we make that covenant to consecrate our gifts and talents and so that I get to. My best one's for the Lord. I'm so excited.
00:34:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you do have a gift for it. Like from the perspective of someone who doesn't have that natural ability, it's really impressive to, you know, I basically do the little things you ask. And, you know, the team starts growing in confidence and starts hitting and stride. you know, I had a, I wouldn't call it a hard conversation, but kind of a hard to heart with them yesterday. And today, and I told them, you know, this is not business as usual. We're not trying to just do the same thing we did last year. This is, there's new, new expectations, new standards. We're raising the standard for Team AZ. And it's kind of a firm talk. But, you know, because I had built that trust in the last year, they were, they're all going home about
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
they're all excited about it and they're love that so they you know it works thank you for that feedback it i need it um i hear it and i know it but you know how it is like if you don't get that feedback things start to chip away at you and you start to doubt yourself and so it's one of the reasons i make sure to always tell you what you're doing great because i know that that's what happened there's that erosion so i make it a point and i think that we all need to make it a point always to speak good to people when we see it in them and observe it even if we don't know them like i see somebody doing a good job anywhere i'm like you're awesome i love that you did this and i love that you did that and i appreciate this and um it's just it's just good i think it's the way that we fortify each other and kind of plug in the holes and and and offer offer healing but the other thing is that i don't know if you remember but i i talk about it from time to time that all that I teach is foundational systems. They're super simple. told you, there's nothing going to be like, wow, whizzing, anything shiny and just like, oh, can't believe we're doing this, you know, like, it's nothing like that.

It's super basic, it's foundational and it's fundamental.
00:36:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But what happens is when we focus on fundamentals, and I'm going tell you a football story in a second, is that, well, I think about the renovations of the LA Temple, what they're doing right now. They're digging under the temple. Like you're not going to see any of that, but because of the work that's going to be done, it's going to withstand all the things that are going to happen. We know that. And that's what you're doing with your team. So you did that fundamental work, right, at the foundation level. And so now you can put some more stress on it and it will break. And you can put more stress on your people and they won't break. They'll... Be able to sway a little bit, you know, the earthquake comes and then regulate and I'll be well, and you you did that my love He likes to talk about these things and it's probably something that I Realized from him like 10 years ago, and he said that coach Vince little Barty every single year And he's famous football coach imagine you do know, I don't know if you're a football guy not a football guy, whatever, but He would take these NFL players First day of practice and say gentlemen, this is a football and he would teach them the basics and the fundamentals and They knew it but Most of us Become apathetic complacent arrogance, which all kind of run hand in hand I think apathy and complacency is a side effect of arrogance really And it's pride and it's thinking that we know everything and not remembering the value of the fundamentals, none of the fancy tactics and strategies work well or for long if the fundamentals aren't in place, aren't managed, and we're not mindful of them. So the fundamentals that we have worked on this year really is the stats, knowing the stats and the numbers. In terms of like these, right, that we're looking at here in Lettify, but also, sorry, I bring water. Also, how your cases are handled. I can't, I could, but I don't go in and look at all of your cases and see how long has it been since somebody reached out to somebody and reached out to a client. and going. That is a fundamental process of running your business. And it wasn't being looked at frequently enough. And it wasn't being looked at to the level that it should be. And one, because of the frequency, but two, you know, if we notice somebody hasn't been reached out to, then say that needs to be done. And then you give it to somebody and then four weeks later, they still haven't been reached out to you. That is a fundamental level of management that wasn't happening consistently. That I know you started working on. I don't know how it's doing right now. But if you continue to manage that, these numbers of natural consequence will improve, but also so will your results in getting, continuing to get or increasing how many of the cases that you get those full attorney fees. Because you're your clients are gonna feel like you earned it that level of showing up how many times they talk to you Like if I heard from you like three or four times you're like I want 40% on be like what did you do now? It's because they don't see and they don't know But the perception when you show up every week is you are thinking about me. You are working on my case You're earning your money. You make sense? Yeah and then the other thing fundamentally is Knowing your people and what they need and what is causing Reflection or stress or concern for them and addressing it one of it was wasting time Being on a meeting that was going over cases. They have nothing to do it. And so you altered that and Meeting with them every month and finding out, you know How they're doing and then giving them feedback on a regular basis so that they knew it's gonna happen Whereas it was being done And, inconsistently, now they know, number one, Lorenz is watching me, number two, Lorenz is supporting me on a regular basis and they can count on it. Those things over time create so much more stability. are the rebar in the foundation that keeps it from falling apart when things get difficult. Things get difficult could be somebody's out for two weeks, and then somebody else's out for two months, and then somebody else's out for two months, right? all of that happens, that can happen. There's all kinds of things that can come and shake the building, and you're doing the things that are not just going to help you get through it, but help all of your team get through it together. So, we've only been doing this just barely six months. I think the results are fantastic. So, I think I can feel, I can feel there's something that's about
00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
to like something big is going to happen this year. can just feel the momentum shift. The energy shift is different. confidence in the newest team member is higher than the most experienced team member had a year ago. There's a shift and there's an energy and how much the the staff wants to help clients versus one to earn a paycheck.
00:42:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's that. I'm highlighting that note for myself. That is huge, Lorenz. You drove that. Do you understand that?
00:42:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with your help, yeah, and with Mark's support.
00:42:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I appreciate that you acknowledge that because it is important for us to know where it all came from, but it would have stopped at you if you didn't let that happen. So yes, it was a group effort. of course, to stop at them if they didn't let it happen, but it is important that you just go ahead and take in and of itself the fact that you facilitated that. So you were given opportunities but anyway just own your part and that is what I really want you to do. It is good to be humble and recognize all of those things but it's also really important for you to understand how much your contribution meant to that. It was the most of it. So Mark gave you somebody right as an offer and that he had showed up with years before that even happened. We'd been working together for three years and paid for that. I put in my part and my skills but ultimately when it comes to execution because Mark paid for it, I spent an hour a week. The rest of it was you. you. in your team and moving them. And I'll say that because the team didn't change. They were the same people. You led, and they followed. People don't follow, um, weak leaders. Um, not for long, not for good, not, you know what I mean? They followed you to good, good for them, good for the company. So you were the biggest heart of that growth day to day throughout the week. It is really important that you let that in to your mind and to your heart. Um, because you need to know your goodness and your power for good. Um, you need to know your abilities for multiple reasons. I don't want to know this is just the beginning, like if you continue to develop these skills and attributes in yourself, your ability to lead, not just in sweet law, but in your family and anywhere else the Lord might call you to, or that you might endeavor to go. These are skills that are transferable and have great value that you've been working on. So I really want you to acknowledge your part.
00:45:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I really appreciate that. I do, or I'll try, I'm I was self deprecating person by nature, but I'll try to recognize my own goodness and influence. But also, it's interesting you say that because yesterday I was telling my team like, this is just the beginning. I need you guys to to understand. that, like, there are great things ahead and we're just starting to discuss the surface here.
00:46:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. How was that received?
00:46:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I think, you know, I tried to kind of like you told me a few months ago to sandwich, you know, harsh wars between, you know, good things. Trying to, I say harsh, but I wasn't that harsh. I was just saying, you need to step up to the new standards. We need to, this is not a continuation of what we've already done. This is a new standard and you want to step into 2025 with that mindset. But, you know, I was telling them, like, you know, I don't want you to be here just because of the paycheck. want to see your potential growth at this firm. As this firm grows, you you're going to grow as part of this, part of the process. And you could, you know, like, a year or two from now, we may need someone to be married for Arizona. That might be you, Viri. That might be you, you know, John or whatever, you know, someone that can, that can fill in into that growth.
00:47:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need to see yourselves as love that.
00:47:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And so that's kind of similar to what you're saying, like this is, you know, this is just the beginning and there's more to come. There's better and more to come.
00:47:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, good. All right. Um, so let me go, uh, let's see my name. Oh, I'm going to switch. Actually, I switch my share. I
00:48:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm trying to be mindful of the time here. I did have to have a bit of a rebuking with an increase of love type of moment with with John yesterday. I asked him to, there is a task asked him to do before Christmas and he still hadn't started it. And so I had to tell him, look, when I asked you to do something and you put it off and you put it off, it makes it look to very, another younger team members, what the attorney thinks for the team doesn't really matter. And you step it up a little bit, but hopefully I address that.
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did he, which one, who did you say, John? yeah. And how did he take that?
00:48:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. He, you know, John, I have a good relationship with him and he's always the feedback I get from him. He would rather be straight with them, then try to like sugarcoat it. So that's, that's always little bit. Good.
00:49:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, just trying to see. Okay, good. had Patrick did have some notes for me. I'll go ahead and look at that later. We'll take his back in string, focus on the APC cases. John is. Oh, good. You said that. So did you already go with Hank?
00:49:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, my understanding is that, well, I mean, I talked to him at the Christmas party is in order to study for the bar. He's going to stop coming into the office. And just focus on studying for the bar and then take the bar and then, I mean, him and, Or, I don't know if I'm Mark of an arrangement. That's bad.
00:50:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to go back to my notes. Hold on to see if I have notes about Yuri. I don't remember Mark telling me about him. Maybe he did. It would have been a few months ago. Probably I know Mark is taking some. This is the right thing. Patrick, Nevada bar in February. I'm going switch for a lot of them. Load for me. Or don't. Okay. Oh, there we go. I'm fine. A bar. Next. Hank was going to take the jar to bar in I don't have Yuri notes. Oh, yeah. Taking California bar. By not Arizona. I don't have him taking California bar. When was this when we had this conversation? September. So.
00:51:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I like Yuri a lot, by the way. To visit with him. He's a great guy.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. All right. So, good luck. These things, notes, wrong notes. I feel like fever coming back. There are some team of the teen to beat in 25.
00:52:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
All right. Sorry. That's maybe a little bit arrogant.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it's good. I am a trash talker. Even if I'm losing friends. don't know. Jesus loves me as I am. just going to say that.
00:52:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I came back for my vacation. I'm glad I listened to your advice and took a vacation. I came back pretty energized. Pretty good.
00:52:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's slingshot energy. Right? It's like, you know, and then you come back and you're like, I'm ready to go. Oh my gosh. I'm so glad. And how did Kerry feel about that?
00:52:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Vacation. Yeah. Well, I mean, she wasn't crazy about the fact that I got sick halfway through it. But I, I, I powered through and just, you know, took on some day quill and.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you were more present, do you think that she noticed that you were intentional about?
00:53:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean a couple of times, you know, my slack on my phone, I was checking it out and she, she let me know that that was in cool, so I, yeah, silenced it, but.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, and was there attitude, do you feel like your attitude was maybe different than it might have been in the past, having been kind of caught in that?
00:53:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, and I think that's something I've not, I've been doing this for 10 years and I've struggled with it for 10 years, is the having boundaries, yeah, never really figured out what the right proportion is and so, you know, Kerry has been good at letting me know when, when I need to, to have better boundaries and that's part of why I couldn't continue having my own firm, you know, was.
00:54:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, we're all built differently and we're also all in different seasons in life, and we have different callings in life, and it's really a great gift to have the wisdom and the discernment to know who we are, where we are, and what we're called to. There are lots of people who, and the world's probably blessed for the fact that they work these crazy hours, but it's always at a cost, and I think a lot of people don't take spiritual cost into account because spirituality is not important to them, divinity is not important to them, eternity is a non-consent to them, but you're not a person, and so the thing that I have to remind people a lot of when we're working together is they'll want to compare what this person is doing, what this person is doing, and do you know what kind of relationships they have? Do you know? that their pop and roll aids constantly and they're on the verge of a heart attack is that what you want to trade with them because if you want their reward you have to pay their price and most people don't want to pay the same price that other people are paying for the reward that they're getting and the reward that those people are getting you know down the road they don't they don't want that either and just like you can't cherry pick all the things in a partner that you want to have you know in a companion and and and and then leave all their negative things that you don't like you can't do that with anything in life you can't do that in a business but yet somehow we convince ourselves you know that we can aspire to these types of things and and results that people have in their business and just really don't like what is their their sleep schedule look like and is their biology and physiology even compatible with your body and physiology like it we're not the same there's so many elements that go into it But we're sold this. It's about mindset, and it's about habits, and it's about patterns. Okay, yes, and discipline to a degree. But does your neurochemistry even allow, is it even compatible with that type of operation? And a lot of times the answer is no. A lot of times we've got, you know, some of these most successful people are autistic.
00:56:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've been on Musk.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I functioning, but do you want to trade that? Do you want that? know, do you want the kind of family relationship that he has? No. No. I mean, there are gifts that the world receives for it, but again, at a cost. And fortunately, we also don't have to worry about, you know, eternal judgment for those types of people. I think the Lord blessed the measures us according to our knowledge, experience, and our gifts, and our physiology, and our biology, and chemistry, and all of these other things. But we also need to be able to discern and seek the gifted discernment. To be able to look at something and go, that's not for me. I can tell you Lorenz, because I am competitive, okay? I'm competitive. I look at all these things and go, I could have made millions of dollars any times over, and I would feel immediately this angst. And then when I, you know, I have to go through a whole process of yes, but I chose motherhood, I chose this, I chose this, and this, and all these things. But I would still feel this anxiety. And so what I immediately learned to do is go, that's not for me. And just not even think about what could have been, what is, what was, why am I, whatever. Not only is that not for me, but very happy with my trajectory. I can measure my growth as a person, as a as a daughter in any compartment of my life and see growth every single year. I can still see also my flaws and my weaknesses and the things that I wish weren't there, but because I can see that I've improved intentionally and with effort and all of these things, you can't ask more of me. I can't do better because I would always do better if I could do better. I used to be sitting here, spend eight hours watching TV, which is incredibly rare, but of course on the days I actually do it, I'm beating myself, I could be so productive, but then I realize that I can't, like I'm exhausted and I'm fatigued, so I could either keep pushing myself while my body is telling me to rest, but what I've learned is that that means another week or two or three or even months sitting there doing nothing. because I'm just burnt out. learning to recognize all these different types of things and learning to prioritize energy above all things. Except God, but it's right up there with God because if I have no energy, I have nothing to give him. I am energy. So in my striving to be one with him, I'm striving to have the most energy so that I can make the most out of this life. And so the things that bring us joy, but the things that make us sad, the things that make us feel ashamed or stressed or pressure, all of these things, just taking them into account. And so family time, boundaries, and just asking what is it that you want to accomplish in your life and work backwards for this? we're going to wrap up, but I want you to think about these things. Whether you go home to Father and Heaven tomorrow, or 10 years from now or a hundred years from now, okay? Twinkling of an eye, things can happen, I'm just saying. What do you want to have as a sign to show him? So I heard once that, and I can't tell you what General Authorities said it, my Bishop told it to me. I talked to other people who have heard this, when we get back to the Savior, he's going to ask us four questions. The first one is, what do we do to get nearer to him? The second is, what do we do to get nearer to our spouse? The third is, what do we do to get nearer to our children and to our families? And the fourth is, what did we do to further the kingdom? I, since then, have chosen to prioritize everything in that order. So the kingdom, the business, all those things are last. It's my relationship with second. Hold on to the rest of my family. Third, the kingdom last. Any time any of those are out of order, I'm out of order. There are problems. Any of time the priorities fought within that rank, everything is blessed when I work and prioritize the Lord. Everything is blessed when I work and prioritize the one relationship that I have out of the entire planet. That is my partner for life and eternity, right? That's all of us. Same thing with family. And the other thing that I learned is, I don't know, I think I heard a general authority say this, they have the best teachers. I don't conference is the best school. But it was that we save our best manners for strangers and people that we talk to who have nothing to do with us. And the people that are most special and sacred to us. And I Wow, you're right. My whole family does that to each other. That's terrible. I'm going to flip that and give my children my best because that was really where I showed up the worst. I think and excuse myself. I'm mom. Do it. It's a blah, blah, blah. And I was like, okay, you get my best manner. So if I'm talking to a client and you need something that can wait and I will take care of you and speak kindly to you. And I can have clients that either are okay with that or I will get rid of them rather than feel like I need to snap at my child and get them to be quiet because that was a situation. was a single mom making other people millions of dollars going bankrupt by the way and feeling bad that my children made noise and were children. Nobody allows that to happen except me and I was allowing it to happen. So, you know, feeling obligated to answer slack when I'm supposed to be present with my family. Nobody can make me feel or do anything except me. Now, what I get to do is when I'm back and then appropriate at time, I get to slam through all of that stuff and be super focused and have really good replies and handle my business. And if that's not enough for the person I work for, I get to let them decide how they want to handle it. But I chose how I'm going to show up.
01:03:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
like that.
01:03:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I've learned is people handle it pretty well. And the only ones that don't, I don't want in my life. Anyway, I give people a chance to decide how they want to show up for me and most people show up really well, but instead of fearing how they might respond to me behaving whatever way, right, not responding to a slack message, I just do it. And I don't borrow fear from the future possibility of what if Because that's guaranteed pain now. Fear and worry is guaranteed pain right now over potential pain that might happen in the future. Kind of silly when we think about it like that, right?
01:04:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I should talk to my second born. That's the way he specializes in fearing the future.
01:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, try that line. Worry is pain borrowed from the future and hope is joy borrowed from the future. And we get to decide how we're gonna do it. And worry is also guaranteed pain right now because worry is pain. It is pain, it's anxiety, it's hurt. But it's over something that potentially could happen. So now we're the one stabbing ourselves, right? worry, inflicting our own pain. came over a potential that may never happen and most of the time the things that we worry about don't even come into fruition. So it's just like having ourselves constantly with worry and sometimes the visual can really make a difference and it's one thing to know something and it's another to be able to change the operations but the first step is understanding and clarity of understanding. So if you can help him understand in a way that makes sense and the spirit can help you find those words but the visuals really, really do it. So maybe that'll help.
01:05:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
