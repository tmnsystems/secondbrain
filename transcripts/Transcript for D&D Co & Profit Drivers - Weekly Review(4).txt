Hello. How you doing?
00:00:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Working.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's say what you're doing. I said, how are you doing?
00:00:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
right.
00:00:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking at my plan here that looks like it's dying. What the hell's going on here?
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you two of a black thumb Dan?
00:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't. Because I don't know what to do with the plants here in the office. There's no sunlight.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need different plants. Oh, I love that. Okay. See, we don't need to be distracted like this, but they have all these different lighting things that you can get on Amazon and there's shows that have the lights already built into it like bookcases and they're pretty but functional, which I like.
00:00:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like UV light?
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
put out UV light? Yeah.
00:00:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, um.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah there there are all kinds of different things it's in my list but um like it's in my list yeah because these are these these are pretty I'm just going to continue with this search results in chat because you will get fed all of the things uh and there come I have like 50 plants in my house in well I got a couple of door ones Denise buys plants she has a black though he killed her baby it's like she brings in a plan it's like last man last man dead man walking you're like oh is it because she forgets or doesn't know how to figure out what she does and uh yeah she doesn't really research
00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
what she just likes the way it looks. I was like, does it like living on a kitchen counter? Cause that's really all that matters. The answer is no, it doesn't matter.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is an app called Planting, and there are other ones Oh, I've got it. Yes.
00:02:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's why my outdoor plants are thriving.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got things kicking off flowers that have never kicked off flowers, palms that are just like a nine, 10 palms on it that never had anything. So what you're telling me is the solution is the data.
00:02:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Totally.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
grab what it wants, and then give it to that. Give it it wants.
00:02:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I just haven't, I won't commit to the period out inside. I'm like, I mean, water them inside too, but I don't really do them as much as the outside was.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, I'm the other way around. Like, just because I don't like my outside here, being on a hill. I've got people above me.
00:04:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, they definitely, so we basically decided not to do it until first of the year just to get like, you know what, we're not going mess up any current data, but it seems like, you know, we're on a, we're on like a good track. And I like, well, we might as well let it finish it out, we still might do a black Friday thing. hasn't really been decided. Um, so we might not. And then they, we changed, we're going to change like the supplement upgrade, we're going to try to do like a cross sell to the other subscription. But then I was like, you know what, this is just way too blue G and like the even the checkout process is going to be so abnormal because you can't really check out, you have to like go inside your my account area of blue. I was like, you know what, nobody's going to do that. And even if they do, like, what's the point, it's, it's, but we could start with, hey, unlock all the supplements that we can do that's super simple. We have all the code for that. Why don't we just call that upgrade one and then the other one's mostly coded. like, then we could just split test it later against the other one and then we'll know. we launch one that's similar to the upgrade we already have, which is just this unlock idea. Then it's like, we can contrast and compare those to like, it doesn't convert the same, does it not? And then we could split test, get the baseline of that, which probably should be similar to the other one. And then we could try cross-selling them or we could just wait to see, hey, how many people ask us to get the rest of the ship, because if no one asks for it, why are we doing it?
00:05:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm pretty sure no one's going to ask for it.
00:06:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, so those guys had mapped out like multiple different and I was like, no, there's this nightmare and so we dumped it down to just that, which actually does make everything easier. So they were building that part. They're going to finish that part and then we just mapped out like two other. We need like a switcher, right? We didn't have a switcher for the supplements. When we're like, yeah, we should have a switcher because we will let people switch in between supplements. That's easy. That's a gravity form. And then I Bobby hit me up about that. I was like, do it like this. I was like, oh, okay, I'll do it like that. Um, that's it. So it's, it was like 95% done. So it'll be done. It'll definitely be done by the next time we meet him next month. We was actually doing his part yesterday, but we could just launch it on the first of the year.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, and so then we didn't have a conversation with Jeff about the pricing of it because you're not doing that until it's like, I'm going pull the trigger. Yeah, but everything's set up to you 70, 70, 80, 80, about the bookkeeping process?
00:07:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We're going to get message from Mark every time she says the next week, every time. I'm sure she's going to next week, I'll hit her up, I'll hit her up.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about an actual date, because well, that's why it's literally just the next next week, and I'm like, after she's like, my sister had cancer and now she's like, no worries.
00:07:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, all right, I will literally. email her right now because I would love to have that and then be able to like run all the numbers for 20 that's another reason that I do it then we'll run the 2024 numbers for those dudes and then a couple am off.
00:08:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just something to keep in mind um obviously you want to be decent human being and people go through stuff but when people go through stuff and they have pylons they have other people who are not so kind pushing and barking down their throat and whatever and so just reminding them and being kind to them might help you get moved to the front of the queue if you remind them kind me but also like here's why this is really important to me and I need this um because she's propped I mean when you're behind that much other stuff stacks up so being cognizant of the other things stacking up and trying to let them get prioritized because their jerks is all I'm getting it. Hey, and here's a reason you want to help me and not them because I'm those you and I'm yeah, you know And then maybe they just don't need to ask whole clients because we all have them. Well, I use it. I don't have any anymore Okay, About anything. I'm sure it's kind of it sounded like it pretty much had petered out at the end of it Uh, can we get an update on those numbers?
00:09:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it definitely petered out much.
00:09:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I knew it would.
00:09:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean, that's it's literally how they're Designed to work. So then the question becomes Uh Are they worth doing at all like that That's the part I don't Really know Well, so what you haven't been able to do is look at does your so maybe the release Only work a certain way, but your system was release it every 30 days And what you don't know is like is there a compounding effect that happens when you release regularly like that Like all of you Right Things went off a cliff on Starting on the fifth And then I would say the playlisting ended on the Sixth It's like a stark drop and now we're down to like averaging two a day We were averaging Over a hundred a day during the playlisting You know around 100 with another run. Yeah, so like 96% of plays. This month were from playlists. Other people's other listener playlists.
00:11:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is there a way to top into that without a release?
00:11:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like the news, um, yeah, so this was that. This was that. Like this had nothing to do with the release. The song was released in May and I didn't start playlisting it until. Let's see when I start last month. I started playlisting it in October. So I did two playlists, things back to back separate, right? So I could be. I mean, one went not so one. got like a thousand, about a thousand plays of one day, and they immediately died out. And then I, then when that one ended, I started another one that they told me it would last X long, right, roughly, which it did, right, done in the fifth. So I actually, actually asked this of Mark. So they turned me on to these guys, some guys approached one of our bands with a playlist thing, with a Facebook ads to streams, I think is what they're saying, and a play listing thing. I reached out to them like two days ago, and they, I think they like three grand, and they were saying they'll get like 50,000 streams or something crazy. what was interesting about them was they said, We'll set up the ads in your Facebook out account and then you could just use it after that. I was like, really? Like, here's what you don't understand. I will use that with 30 other bands that I have on a roster. I was like, yeah, the end of the year. Maybe I'll just pay these guys three grand.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's right off.
00:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I actually have to, I think there was a question yesterday, I got to respond, I got to, it's going to run to my mark, but I'm like, I might just do it just to see. If they, he's, and he's saying that the chunk of the plays that they're going to get it from the Facebook ads, I'm like, okay, I want to see that. And then yeah, you're going to share with the strategy and I can just replicate it next time or sell it myself. Okay.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, or make it better. What will I take for you to make a decision on that?
00:13:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just want to ask Mark, like what he thinks.
00:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know that play listing is a good strategy.
00:13:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it just a bit of a? Entity metric or can it like sort of what you were alluding to a second ago, can it, can it cause other things to happen, right? Will it trigger the Spotify algorithm?
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then, and will it trigger it?
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I'm using it. And I purposefully, I'm like, we'll use this song that's been out for six months. So then you could have a more robust strategy like, okay, here you're going to do this release thing, and then it's going to go into a play listing play, and blah, blah, blah, or whatever. Like this, what I thought was interesting about play listing is it got us no followers. Like, no. But that makes sense because they're on your, they're on their playlist. never go to your profile.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I, when I hear a song I like, I go to the artist. If like, I've never, like, who is that? When it suggests something to me or if I'm on somebody else's on it to their playlist.
00:16:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You get to see if it goes on to a Spotify algorithmic playlist or a Spotify editorial playlist, which is they're like human-made. And then algorithmic is they know the genre. That's probably where the other stuff comes into play, a bunch of people are listening to this all the way through. So it's going to push it towards the algorithm. You get to see followers and you get to see if they add it to their, like you just said, their own playlist.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:16:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mmm, that's it. And you get to see plays that are from, if they're playing it from your channel or not. So as opposed, so you see a play, you'll see like plays from all playlists. It'll just be like, hey, other people's playlists is what they call it. Then you see anything from your catalog. So that means they're in your channel. I think you get to see. three cities of like that.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'd be interesting because, um, you know, so I'm trying to compare different platforms, right? So there's like, I was thinking about Etsy, I was thinking about YouTube. Um, and I would imagine Spotify is the same because it's music where you can have one winner. And so there's probably some immediate information because of where it was first going is, do they, um, not try to award kind of flash in the past success and just look at longer term thing? But I was like, no, because some things are just hits all by themselves. Like you can have one artist that has, they're just one hit wonders, right? Of course, the platform would want to capitalize and tap into that. But is there not two tracks of, you know, what's the hit, but also who are the content providers who consistently bring us, you know, new content, new fresh content and releases for people that like that. And so maybe there's kind of two tracks, maybe there's different types of tracks, right, which is maybe you fulfill a particular genre that doesn't have a lot of stuff. And we've got listeners who want more of it, or maybe you're just a statey content provider, or, you know, maybe you created a hit. And so maybe there's thresholds that their data is processing, right, going, does it meet this? Does it meet this? it meet this? Okay, this track. And so we treat it that way and get it views because it's this value and, or ticks these boxes, which is a particular genre that's not really saturated and wants more content, whatever. Anyway, just feel like bottom line was, I feel like this is the kind of thing where you'd want to do it for a year consistently. Before we get Or you make a decision because you don't know what you don't And because of the changing system.
00:19:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and marking them. No, bunch, right?
00:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, but it's also like, it's the same old , right? They've never been consistent in anything really. So like what they know, will that change a lot with a year of consistent strategy in a release like that?
00:19:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, there. So Mark is actually, they just, well, they kicked out their singer and then they just recorded and released an EP. So the funny thing there is that the court. So that's like his band. So he's like the leader of the band and like, I think he said, he gets total say. So he's like, yeah, we're putting out an EP. And then they're going to do the, he's doing the continue. just release strategy. He's like, we have three more songs that are already done. And we're going to release a song every five to six weeks. I was like, really? And they're running ads. So he's actually executing fan flowy with himself. only problem with them is they just got their phone number suspended for some stupid reason. high level is not really explaining it. But it's like there's definitely the whole thing of like, getting into the algorithm. nobody knows how to do that. There's like, there's ideas about free, right? So there are people thought this, like, thing about having presaves. That's not true because a presave is not even real. However, they are now because Facebook just released some sort of actual presave feature. But it appears to only be available to select artists. So that's going to become an action. actual, so they took something from outside this idea of pre-saves and they actually made it a real thing, probably because they were like, wait a minute, we actually could use that, that could be a signal for us. And they rolled it out like two weeks ago, but I think Mark and them looked around, like, we don't have it. It was like, it's Linked Park has it. So it'll went to make its way down. But then it's like, they do give you data on, it's like they want people to stay in Spotify. And they want people to hear the commercials and pay the subscription like, you know, time on site, but it's or it's time and app or whatever. But now one really knows what pushes you, quote unquote, into the algorithm. They think it has to do with like, things that you're doing up to and then during the release, like day up. Does it get a lot of place and then of those metrics like are people listening to the whole thing kind of thing? So when mark and then released Brep they got pushed into date. They trigger the algorithm now. Does he know how he triggered it? No, he doesn't but he did use the strategies and fan flow in which he never had never done before and I'm I Guess I don't know if they've ever got pushed into the algorithm for And then we've got someone releasing a song another band is starting to do it, too, like It's band an aria, so they're releasing the song the sixth and It's the second one they released and they're pretty much they're probably about six weeks out So we'll see how they do like that the first time it worked. they kind of screwed up the release thing a little bit This time they're a little more on it And then Child's Band is, I don't know what they're doing, they're on tour. He's in Europe right now.
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That says kid, how old is this child now?
00:23:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She's a year and a half. Right. I think she's born in April.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One AIDS.
00:23:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
fun. Speaking of kids, how's Abel is doing?
00:23:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just harassed texture here and there. She's coming home for Thanksgiving. Yeah. She'll be here on Wednesday evening.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. be interesting to see how everybody acts. They grow up and they get errors sometimes.
00:23:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:23:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. I missed my independence already.
00:23:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm sure.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's. Okay, so for you, for like, just music production, how's that been?
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, I was working on this one song and then like, Eric has to sing on it, but he's been dealing with his father-in-law or his stepfather. So I was like, oh, I don't think anyone's gonna be singing on this. So then on the other hand, like, I clearly need to do a song that's just me. I'm starting that next week. I'm gonna do either this one that it's, I think I'm gonna do this one that I did with Dan Burke. The problem is, the problem with that one is he played bass on it and he sent it to me, but the bass was broken. So it has this feedback and buzz on it and I'm like, and then I probably could figure out the bass line. just haven't. So it's one or the other. I'm either gonna figure out the bass line and play. myself or be I'm going to buy a base and put today and be like, you're welcome to be back to baseline. I was like, just going to throw a base on my points. It's the end of the year, but like, here you go, dude, I didn't don't say anything. did not pay for this. It was free.
00:25:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How is it free?
00:25:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Amazon points.
00:25:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do love my points.
00:25:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I'm approaching like a million. Like, I'm just probably using some of these.
00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, like, it automatically offers because I don't have Amazon card to cover one. And it just goes and applies automatically. And I like it. Um, let's see. What's up, the Spotify app?
00:25:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, it's submitted. That's all we can do, now we wait.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we wait. All right. So Mark, go back to the questions you asked. It's been interesting. There's just a lot. Let's see. Do, do, talk to me. That's what it was first step is understanding where the leads patients are coming from. then we Eric and I have to figure out how to get them into the CRM. So meeting with attorneys or maybe also chiropractors, I think. Maybe, yeah, I have to figure this out. But I think chiropractors, because so she does in management specifically for. the clinic. And she also works at the hospital, but they, they're, they're, they're doing together is at the pain clinic. And so she had a meeting yesterday with an attorney. So I think it's almost the in person and his network. And I don't, so I don't know how much of the, the follow-up system there is yet. And Mark can only talk about it to a certain extent. So that's what I need to ask him. And I think I'm going to talk to him this evening. She can't meet tonight. She had other things going in. So some of the schedules have been like enormous kind of moving this forward anyway. Um, but let's see, leads patients are coming from really, so it's going to be It's it's coming from a doctor's offices.
00:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know if it's coming from attorney offices, but it's coming from other people's offices If that's helpful or not It isn't Okay Yeah, it's like how would you Like how would you get these leads into that level Right there like and then what data comes over? Is it just the name? Is it all kinds of like Yeah, it's not really clear what where they come from how many different sources there are What game is included what Like what a record ultimately is going to be right so then once they're in Are you collecting other data like okay great well what fields are those like what What is a complete record what what would a complete record look like if it was 100 complete And does every record have to, does every record reach 100% or, or, I mean, maybe that's something that we describe it like, what are all the potential fields that could be related to a record?
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No idea.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's how we'll, yeah. So I'll send that to him.
00:29:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like with, with the dent dudes, right? They were like, when I helped them, they were like, and I go, what do you have people fill out when they come in? But we could send you that, like a great send it out. I was like, okay, great. So I just turn all this into fields. Yeah. Okay. want all this stuff. Then it became, all right, now you need to explain to me what, what is the process, right? with them, I'll just keep using them. Like, oh, we get a lead. Yeah. Okay. Great. then, and then we find out the model of the car. right? Okay, I got that. We built that field. And then if the model is 2016 or before they're rejected, I go, okay, great. We can write logic for that. I go, okay, so then they're not rejected and what, then, or you're booking an appointment to do a quote. What's right? Yeah, then they come in, we do a quote, and then we give them the quote, and then we follow up and then they get the quote, then we schedule them to drop off the car. know, okay, great. So the end of the first pipeline, we'll call it is accepted quote. And then you schedule, okay, great. then the beginning of the next pipeline, because it's a totally different process, is schedule drop off. And you're like, yeah, then what happens? Oh, then they drop off their car. Once the car is here, it goes to such and such department, I forget what it was called. Okay, great. And then what, and then when those guys are done, then they pass it over to the dead guys. Okay, great. And then what, and then when they guys are done, they give it to the detail guys, and then they wash it, and when they're done, we book, we call them again and book them for a pickup. Okay, great. And then what they go, and then there were some other step, there's like somebody to do with the insurance company, and then once the insurance company says, blah, blah, blah, then we come for a pickup, and then they come on, I go, great. So then they pick up the car, that's the end of the second by one. Yeah, then what? Oh, then we try and get a review, I go, great, third pipeline. Now we start another pipeline. But that was it, but that took weeks, weeks, weeks and weeks, phone call, phone call, phone call, and I'm like, Oh my God. So, and of course they don't know what I'm trying to do. I'm like, just tell me the information.
00:31:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, to that end, which is the OMG. Oh, oh, sorry. This strategy needed to come. Well, how did you get as approved yet for Mark stuff?
00:32:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they were approved on Monday when we talked.
00:32:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I didn't realize that.
00:32:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, any. I'm never mind. Yes, I'm buying data.
00:32:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's right. That's right. So is it like, basically, if that ends up being successful, do you still want to do some of that with Mark or are you just like, because you were talking about not doing that anymore?
00:32:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I mean, of course, I don't think it's going to work. Yeah, right. There's that. Uh, if it was here, I mean, even if it was successful, yeah, no, I don't. Because I'm like, what it, what am I going to do? I mean, the thought I had today was, why the am I working on this thing with Mark? Like, if I look at my effectively, effectively, think about that. Yeah. Am I coming? on.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing?
00:33:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like Heather just texted me and was like, Hey, when can we have a meeting with Jamie? like, I'm not meeting with Jamie. Like this is not my problem.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:33:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's like, fair enough. I go the same page meeting. I'm like, you guys need the turn page meeting, right? Like Heather now realizes she's screwed up. She shouldn't have triggered the buyout. So now so they had this bizarre exchange last week from like, Oh my God, I don't know what's going on. Heather's now in the mind reading stage. And I go, dude, when you're a mind reading, you're you've crossed over like you don't do that. Because then you're then you just get all get all spun out. She's mind reading that Jamie's doing this. Jamie's snaked that.
00:33:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I hate to bring to you, but like she's not that smart.
00:33:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm like, To be honest.
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, she's got four kids.
00:34:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think she works a whole lot. What you're describing is work.
00:34:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? You think she's suddenly working? Is that what you think, really? mean, like, just change the context. You're telling me that you think Jamie's working extra out. Is that what you think's happening? That is not happening. And even if it were, so what? Um, but they, I think they just sort of like killed the generation.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can deal with both of their egos.
00:34:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, I'm like, Heather, you think you don't have any ego, that's Jamie literary was like, can you forward me that email? And for whatever reason, Heather wouldn't do it. And I was like, why didn't you just forward the email? Well, there's nothing in it. That's not what asked. Why didn't you just forward it? You did it on purpose. You absolutely did it on purpose. And now you're don't like the consequences of that. Well, sorry. You played a role.
00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:35:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. This is drama.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then don't do drama.
00:35:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I told her. I got you solidified my exit with that exchange solidified it.
00:35:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like I am done.
00:35:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. Yeah. So it's like they may have tanked the generation tux deal because they're like, I don't know. It's like Heather. I actually totally understand what she's doing. I'm like, now you now you're being prideful. That's across me. Don't do it. This moves on your move on. I did tell her. was like, I dealt with this. This was this is my partner's and I was prideful and I stuck around. I was like, I'll show them. I built this. Well, here's the thing. What's been built here? What? Where am I walking away from exactly? Am I walking away from a multi-million dollar company? No, I am not. I was walking away from a bankrupt company. I'm like, you're walking away from this Italy little six-figure-a-year business, like, just keep walking. Don't waste two years being prideful. And then getting in lawsuits and like, trust me, it's not worth it.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But there's a way to try to go with before the fall.
00:36:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:36:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, did. Every time, every way, everywhere, every relationship, everything, it's...
00:36:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
didn't understand it until I was here.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's most of us. And I don't think everybody understands it, even when they are it.
00:36:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and I don't think a lot of people actually go through it. So it's like, when you're in it, you don't think you're it. But that's exactly what she's doing.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I hope she can learn it with out of being too terribly excruciating.
00:37:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Man, think the job is like, you guys just need it. You don't need the same page meeting. You need a next page meeting. And the next page meeting is we're going to let. We're going to cut this down to the bone. Keep Katie, part time, she's going to do everything. We're not going to communicate anymore and just collect money until it runs out.
00:37:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
00:37:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is a good plan. Yeah. And I mean, they're making like $1,000 a month right now. I'm like, what are you, what are you fighting over?
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does that even pay for Katie?
00:37:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's all it dates for. That's the whole thing. Like those two are making $1,000 each. So Jamie's getting her YouTube three grand plus a grand from this. And then all the money goes over it. So each of them only pulls like $1,000 a month because the GT money ran out. The whole business is based off of the generation text.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's what I warned you guys about this isn't a real business that's not real revenue you should not count it right boy oh there's a child huh oh my daughter's boyfriend's uncle is like on the the kidney failure and ammonia and she's going through it with her boyfriend so it's a lot okay so it's a little too early yet friends will be to be talking about like what the schedule looks like next year although I just feel like it will be and maybe maybe not for you because you're good at not putting lot of energy to it but the mark time like I was really surprised by how much time you spent on that so it'll be interesting see just what that shift does, then just not dealing with anything Heather and Jamie related. Um, Okay. Let's see. Music. Well, okay. So where is, what's the status of the book?
00:39:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark is still not read it. Everybody's like, I have read that. Yeah, you do. So it's, you know, I would say it's not done, but it's pretty thing close.
00:39:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then in terms of like mapping out what your whole offer is, so you don't have the Spotify app and things are kind of contingent upon that getting approved, right?
00:39:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I mean, like the MVP contains that.
00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And the book, so you're just waiting. mean, there's really no point in asking a lot of questions because those two things need to happen. And so waiting for the app to because it is.
00:40:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's our app, like it's a web app. So Spotify in order to make it public, meaning for it to work publicly, it has to be approved. So our access to the Spotify API right now is only as a developer. We need public API key. Whatever. We need an open API key. Publicness. We're like, we're like, we're two, have about six more weeks.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:41:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Roughly. Well, I did some things this time. I missed last time that might speed it up. I'm not. have no idea. actually going work.
00:41:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Um, so. Regarding mark. What would it look like if you're not working on the leads and stuff? Are you like, so would you not be meeting with him anymore? Would you like, you host basis has his blogs, right? Is that blogs?
00:41:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then we managed SEO stuff. So, working with Gert or whatever who he like, they'd talk to States mostly.
00:42:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that? Our own basis.
00:42:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nothing.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? Why would you say that?
00:42:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't even charge Mark for Lee Ploey. I realized after the fact, I was like, oh my God, I didn't even charge her for this. Mark basically pays us $600 a month for hosting. I think, or, so I'd have to look it up. I actually don't know. can ask Stacy. But it's like 2,500 bucks a month for me to like talk to him slash run ads slash project management things on this side. And then there's like a couple hundred bucks for hosting type stuff. And stuff.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But for $1,000, so I would say all it, like the most he pays us is like $4,000 a month, the most. And $2,500 of that would go away if you don't talk every month or no. I'm trying to figure out what the revenue is today. You'd only have $2,000 a month.
00:43:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, okay, so I'm guessing it could be less.
00:43:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what we haven't talked about recently is a version of basic, well, we kind of have like anyway. But this is that I think the conversation to kind of spend a little bit more time talking about in terms, at least consistently. So I actually have you met with Joe recently terms like doing it for podcasters.
00:43:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That meeting is in 45 minutes.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And
00:45:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he was doing all this AI stuff with Mike, then I guess it's over. don't know what the details are exactly. I'll find out here. But then Heather said over Slack, we got to get off Mike, Mary, go around. And I was like, yeah, I'm sure because the dude's douchebag. Um, so I guess they're off the merry ground. I'm like, dude, I mean, and I did her. You know, is he, are you selling the podcasting course? And she's like, no, I was like, so you literally, like, pivoted away from your own business to go build somebody else's, right, which is what I do, right? But I still have my own thing that I've already built. And that, and now you're coming back because it didn't work out, but you made a crowdload of money. So I get it. I'm like, but now, now go build your own thing. Like, oh, don't go build someone else's again. Right? Or figure out how to take an adult. I want them to build all these clones, so they have 80 clients that they want to have on Heather and Joe. And I was like, is that a good thing? Like, that's what I think sometimes people don't evaluate things. I was like, okay, that sounds great. So 80 clients, $80,000, $80,000. like, right, but at what cost? Like, what is the cost you're going to pay for that? Are you going to be stressed out to the gills? I can't imagine you're going to get 80 golden children that you're going to love working with. give me a break. How many shitshows are going to be in that 80? Like, God only knows. How many of them don't understand AI? I can tell you, 80. what's that going to go? You should maybe do a handful and see how it goes.
00:46:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, yeah. That was the thing I was talking to, Chona. about, which is just architecting the deal the way that you want to, because she's getting overwhelmed at the clinic, because she loves being at the hospital. She gets to handle patients differently. She hates doing the clinic stuff, but she doesn't really get much of that. That's the biggest thing. She gets hardly, like maybe like $25 per person, and so like where she, in her job before she was making bank. The hospital, she loves it because it's really just satisfying on a nursing level. But she needed to know the clinic in order to be able to do the PI patients in the clinic. But because of that, they just take a long time, she's getting overwhelmed, whatever. I'm like, you know, I'm like, why are you doing that? She goes, because I have to, because he needs me. I'm like, yeah, do you have to? And is it your responsibility that he needs you? not hire somebody else. Yeah, but I feel like I happen. I'm like, you don't have to. You need to know how to do it well enough. said that isn't he interested in you getting the PI patients and isn't that completely separate from you helping him with what he needs? She's a guest. I'm like, okay, so go as much as you want to go and make plan. You want to go on once a week, go on once a week instead of twice a week or go on once a week real or a week. And so you don't get overwhelmed and burned out. that way we're still establishing the clinic and you know how it works. she just make you watch her shoulders drop and just like, breathe and whatever. that's that's for Joe and Katie. Not Katie. Heather. Thank you. Heather. Okay, so they have a Katie that works for them. And Heather also kind of reminds me of Katie Holmes very slightly. And so that's where that came from. Anyway, but it it's like just because they offer them 80 clients doesn't mean that they have to take them all or doesn't mean they have to take them all once being like, yes. But we'll take this money at a time and it's at this price.
00:49:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Take it or leave it So architecting their deal the way that they want to zone saying Yeah, I mean, I don't even know what the deal is and then I guess the real question is like, okay, so I mean at one point Heather told me that Joe was making 50 grand a month with Mike and I'm like, hey, really? Okay, like that's eight So is that now going to zero? Like what what's happening right? Yeah, yeah, then what does the show make like so? You're making a thousand dollars from your business with Jamie. know that and then Joe's making what from his business like then are you is this like with Mike it was a money grant and And then I mean it's sort of the whole thing about you know, the lesson that no one ever really learns is just saying no. Like, no, you can say no, right? Delphi, like, oh, we really need somebody to do that.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that doesn't mean it's you, right?
00:50:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
really need someone to do it, right? And if it's, you know, it's 80, like, how many can you do? What are you really looking at? What's really, what's really on the table here? 80 clients, times a thousand, right? then they get, oh, four or five a day. Are they really? Like, no one knows their numbers. So they're getting four or five day. Why is it only 80? It should be way higher. It should be 120 already. It should be 80. When did you start talking to it? should be 80 more.
00:50:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Funny how things never add up to what people claim.
00:50:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally. And then the real thing of it is, like, what are, what are you getting into?
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a good deal. But how many do they have to do all at once? What's the deadline?
00:52:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
they gonna have to work 40 hours a week when they've got both the girls? Exactly.
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. It's just the two, right?
00:52:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and then it's holidays, back-to-back holidays and it's six season because kids get sick and all the different things sing to account anyway. So really you don't have any interest in doing basis for anything else?
00:52:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because you haven't said that that clearly for a long time. Part of me is just like, pardon me, it's just like why am I even doing any of this at this point? So, I mean, I'm not, yeah, no, I haven't, there was like the idea of doing it for YouTubers, which I think is priced.
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that.
00:53:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I was like, then I got to like, then, I mean, I think the thing, but I think the podcasting is probably the way to go. I just thought as little as two weeks ago, like, I mean, if he is all wrapped up with my name eggs, like, Hey, I am going to someone I think. Well, no, don't have to, but I was like, Okay, so now if he's coming back around, I just don't understand what they're doing. But I don't want to go work on someone else's idea. Like, I don't want to help you with this plowing thing. Like, I don't even know, I don't even get what it means. It's to me. It's like, when I said to Heather, such a thing, but it was funny. actually consider maybe pivoting into web three and crypto. Just like Matt and Joe did. This is it. They were just early. couldn't make that. I didn't know, um, like podcasting is going to go even bigger now. If the big podcasting is going to go huge because of Joe Rogan with Trump and JD, and like, come on, I mean, podcasting has never gotten that prime time exposure like that ever. So now, and I think a lot more people are going to start listening to them. And therefore, a lot more people are going to start doing the power of YouTube and podcasts. I would say in the last three to six months is like on another level.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just, I mean, perfect example.
00:54:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dude that I follow in YouTube a month ago, he put out a video why David Gilmore will never come on my channel, right? This dude interviews people today. David Gilmore episode released 30 days. later, the dude's got David Gilmar in his channel, because that's the kind of reach he has from just his YouTube channel.
00:55:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. Maria's channel has grown in 60 days to 2000, and I remember watching Matt, you know, when he did all of his stuff, but he was like religious on it, and she's not, she's being really strategic, really leveraged. She goes out and she does some research, and it's really...
00:55:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Of course.
00:55:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're actually going to be doing, that's what we're going to be doing together, and okay, so we're trying to figure out where do we email from, like, if we're going to host email from high-level or active campaign, do you, or anywhere else, do you have a recommendation?
00:55:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like active campaign because they're...
00:55:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I thought you were going to get off it.
00:55:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no. Well, I think you saw infusion soft got sold, but I'm like, we're going to need to... get off to use itself because that's the end of the line for them. But they got acquired like two weeks ago and not head for the doors. People, there's no way they survive. Um, so literally that's like, we thought we were getting rid of our infusions of people when we are. So I actually met with her in person like two weeks ago and then it subsequently got sold, but even at that meeting, she was starting to head out the door and she was looking at high level and I'm like, dude, high level is great for some stuff, but I'm not sure that their email reporting is not great. Yeah. Um, there is a dude that's making a third party up on, but it's, I mean, it's one of those things where like, oh, it's done. And the good thing about high level is like they do, they are constantly releasing updates and stuff, but at this stage of the game, I don't think that their email.
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
implementation, but sufficient and clean data. And yeah, so for that, for that purpose, we're going to stick with school for right now, for just MVP, right? She already did the MVP because she got 30 people in two weeks with no ads to get to buy a $97 product, and it was just her showing up on a webinar, and the reviews was amazing. So just courseifying that basically, and then building that out, but she keeps putting out the videos. So the list keeps growing bigger. It's getting organic sales into her school group, but also it was 10 of the 30 who bought the YouTube product came from the YouTube videos that she was making and didn't promote, right? She just created it new to promote it. So anyway, yeah, so that's where We're going to start. And then because we were talking about doing like a CMO COO kind of hybrid coaching program, but this would fall under that because it's already getting getting traction. also, I've been wanting to understand and leverage YouTube because it's, it is so good at free targeted leads. They want the content. We've got content to create and to give. Anyway, but also she, because it's building this audience, people who want to use YouTube for the business. Maybe that's a good like, maybe. So one of the things you're talking about is tapping into existing audiences. Like, Joe has all the podcasters, right? So doing basis with that. Maybe there's a version of basis with the YouTubers and it's still your idea. It's your thing. We don't have any plans for building out a whole website system program, all of that. Yeah, we just want to teach people how to use YouTube and use the analytics and plan the video content creation in order to get targeted leads. But that aligns perfectly with what you're doing to add on. So anyway, that's just something to think about. But in terms of like, I got to wrap up too because I got to get to an appointment. But just reflecting over this time about what you want, do be taking into account your effective hourly rate, whether there's drama or not drama. Like, is it solving a puzzle? also you're getting into a new season. Ableton's gone. Mariel will be not far behind her. So, you know, there's a real shifting that happens mentally at that point. So that's something to keep in mind. And then it's end of the year. your stuff as well. So just be contemplative, maybe journal and just observe what you're thinking and what you're feeling. And if you notice anything that might be worth sharing, let me know like text, email, whatever, so that you don't forget it. So that because we're definitely in a reorganizational season, it's clear.
01:01:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So let's make sure we're really in that. I will do that. And then in listening to what you just said, you probably could build Maria's entire thing in high level, like F school, build the whole thing in high level. And then the reporting that you're lacking on email, you could probably get like going out to air table or something, right? So then you'd have like this self-contained it because the cool about there is like how you can automatically add someone to a high level group. And if the group she's doing is actual courses, that's what their thing is good for, right? That was my issue with their thing is like, it's not good for communities, whereas like, but even schools, courses, right? So those dudes, did you buy the, you bought the group from those guys, you said?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:02:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So now they have like an $89 a month course or whatever, where I think you get access to all that the that you bought. Yeah, it's hilarious. Like I'm like, didn't, aren't you guys. But it's also just to get them into the high ticket thing, right? that dude, like they're starting now to like look at high level, we're gonna, we're gonna switch to high level. I can see that they're moving in that direction. They're waiting for like one or two features.
01:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I really needed, because I want to learn. high level but I need somebody that is willing just to sit down and like show me the foundation of it. Like I can go through and do YouTube but that will take me so long to do it that way whereas if I can hire somebody like you or Eric or somebody and just say okay help me build some like I the community is super easy to put together what I think is not intuitive is their campaign building.
01:03:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are talking about like automation?
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes triggering automations let's say from a sale page to eat right so somebody who knows and like I pay you for a time if that's what it says but like who understands not doing it bloated right so you go to a landing page and well I could ask Jason and Chandel too but yeah that's the biggest thing I don't want to spend too much time I don't mind spending the time learning it but I don't want to have to spend the time before we can actually get this out because the momentum as a result of the election, also as a result of the time of year, I want to be able to tap into it. People want it and eat it now. So MVP is, that's why we're talking about school, getting it out there and then maybe moving to high level in a few months and taking whatever losses we take if we move, right?
01:04:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You could literally get it on there. I mean, and then, you know, if you're not trying to put money into it to like build the or whatever, because you guys are building it, like, yeah, I can get on the phone with you. It's really, it's not that it's not intuitive. It is, it is once you get into it, you just got to sort of things, like what you just described, I was like, oh yeah, no, you want to build a funnel and then have the automation to work with the funnel, right? have funnels and websites that you want to use like the click funnels thing, which is the funnels. And yeah, there's all kinds of triggers for that. And then of course, First you have the ability, which you never have with schools. Like, if you want to go outside that and do other things, then there's my dudes, like, sodden on it. Like those guys are great, all bets are off. Those have everything I've come up with.
01:05:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, let's build this. They're like, OK, if they're available to hire an intro would be amazing.
01:05:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm about to send them a funnel project right now.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
build a 14 page funnel. That's awesome.
01:05:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, and I've got Greg, right? Greg's, we have a whole big more project that's based on high levels. Yes, that's for him. But they use these two frameworks. We have a stock funnel with blocks, right? have we have a flow blocks or flow is for all the flow is. So I just got to go ahead and use sales page and then he builds it with the blocks and all the blocks are based on high levels. They use a they use a framework called unknown. And tailwind through so fun. When I asked them what time they're like, what framework do they wrote back on?

No, I'm like, that's your answer. Unknown, I don't know.

First, what's on second? It was hilarious.
01:06:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, oh my god, that's the name of a framework. Wow.
01:06:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's unknown blocks.

So you would think doing this without active campaign just straighten everything on a level?

Yeah, because I don't think you're heavily relying on email metrics. They are. They're just not super accessible. And then this dude does have a thing. But you might be able to tap into those metrics and then put them into an air table or whatever, right? So it's like, you know what I mean? So it's like, oh, then you're everything's in one place. And it's way easier to manage. And the good thing about high level is it's very extensible if you have developers like the dudes that I have. And these dudes are such a money find. And not that you need that. I think a lot of it you can just do within and then you could hire these guys to build automations and they're so cheap.

Well, and I also one of my goals is understanding high level on a technical level myself because I want to understand its capabilities and I can't wrap my head around things unless I'm inside it. So that's part of it and ultimately I don't want to be the one doing all the things, right? But this next year I would really like to get really familiar with how it works on a technical level especially because I do think it's going to evolve so much. but just the getting started and also the reality of just launching something simple that isn't going to make customers mad because they don't get access to things or be to you or whatever and all that. have to run. Thank you for that. That was awesome. please do be pondering, you know, don't. don't forget that and I think it's probably naturally happening anyway but I just want you to be even more just aware and try to be specific in those thoughts and follow them through to a what does this look like operationally you know I mean yep okay okay well I'm not meeting with anybody on monday to lobby flying I already told mark that oh I gotta cancel all the meetings yeah I can't do that it's holiday so tell Bobby okay oh my daughter's calling me I gotta get this but I will talk to you sometime soon okay bye early
