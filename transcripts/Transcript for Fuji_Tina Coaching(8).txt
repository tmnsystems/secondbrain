00:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hey Fuji, how are you? Good. How are you?
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Got a lot going on, huh?
00:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I realize my speakers aren't set up, so I don't know where the sound is coming from, but I could hear you.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you click on the microphone icon, you can go to your auto-yell settings and see if you want to change it.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, testing.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that better? I can hear you.
00:00:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can you hear me? Okay, that's better. Okay, now it's coming out of my monitor. That's great.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, um, your, well, let's, we could just go away, Norton. Hold on a second. Get my notes. Thanks. had them open. just got to get to the right tab, and then I'm going to share this.
00:00:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you for letting me, range check last week. More of a shitshow than I thought it would be.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it's moving, so you were entirely overly optimistic if you thought it would be anything less than that.
00:01:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I switched school 17 times before I graduated and lived in eight states by the time I graduated, so I know a little bit about moving. And if you're even remotely settled by now with such two little kids and yeah, you're doing okay.
00:01:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I mean, I were in LA. flew out with her on Friday afternoon and then took her to her wedding on Saturday and then we swam on Sunday and then our flight was yesterday got delayed by four hours. Ooh. So we got home.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
sucks.
00:01:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. So it was, I mean, was good though. She did well. She didn't melt down or anything until she got home.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a typical woman will hold it all together until it's time. and then your home in your own space, and then it can last a while.
00:02:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What was it even to me? was to her grandma, so. Oh, everything okay? Cool.
00:02:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so you were moving, you can decide how you feel about the homework situation. Here's the thing to keep in mind. This whole process, this coaching, you drive this. The pace, it's the human being that is running the business, not the business running the human being. So life comes in and I personally, holidays, sickness, and major life events, schedules go out the window, and that's okay to prioritize what really matters in life at that particular moment. The bigger thing is that in between those times we be studying consistent in our accountability and in our traction and momentum and just mental awareness as well as commitment and effort as long as that's happening, I think everything is on track. And the other thing is how quickly we return back to the work. One thing I do do often is when I know something's coming up, I front love like I go extra hard beforehand when possible right if I'm going on vacation things like that. And then I expect to do the same when I come back, if necessary. I've also entered there in my business to not need it so much, but I also have diminished my earning power on purpose in order to balance that everything is trade off, right? as long as you are consciously choosing what trade offs you want, then this needs to be built to engineer the to support the priorities that you have to allow for the fact that a different seasons and life your priorities will change and that's it. So your the purpose of the accountability consequences were because you wanted to improve your level of accountability. So keep that in mind when you think about this but I don't think that I think you get a buy for the last couple weeks having moved. I think we knock out this week as much as possible and we set realistic goals knowing that you're still changing house and getting adjusted and that maybe we adjust the pace. You need to decide what your priority of the pace of the the work growth is when we set those goals. So the other thing is that we want you to get in the practice of choosing realistic goals and realistic deadlines. So understand that all the deadlines are arbitrary. You know what I mean? So take all of that into account. I would say there is no penalty. There was work that needed to be done. And the penalty is probably the frustration that you didn't get done what you wanted to get done because you were moving. And that's a real that's actually a real penalty. That's real cost when you're a builder and a creator. And so let's dive into it, see where you're at, meet the best of it, and celebrate whatever growth and not, you know, messing up the family and the process of moving.
00:05:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no, yeah. I think that's So yeah, like I always, I get excited when I talk to you and that's why I like these calls and you I do need that extra little kind of kick in the pants to, you know, remind myself where I want to go and my dreams and my aspirations and yeah, it's just, I guess I've never, I've never really been good at keeping my schedule and never been good at just how procrastination works, I suppose, but yeah, I, yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm ready to, I think I'm ready to get back on and get at it better and do the best I can.
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, one thing that you need to take into account too is most people aren't going to hire somebody to help them stay accountable, they will make excuses, they won't show up, they will still show up and make excuses and then they'll quit this. So the simple practice of making the significant investment in it and then showing up and doing the work. You're so far above and beyond the majority of any people, including successful people. A lot of times they get to multiple eight figures without a lot of discipline. Nine figures and above, there's some discipline for sure. Even if the discipline is simply choosing, having earned enough and worked hard enough to pay the people who do the discipline, right? But making sure that you hire well, that you know how to hire well and paying attention to your money well enough. Not necessarily doing all the work all the time, it could be good leadership. But most of the time, those people are also really steady workaholics. Unless you get to the point where you're like Warren Buffett and you spend most of your time reading, then it isn't laziness, it's he's able to distill everything that he has read and accumulated. Into succeeding. enough information to put it into tactical approaches to give to his team, but he's still investing a significant amount of time to do that. Anyway, when you're thinking about you falling short, bring into account the effort that you're putting in and the way that you show up to the call, that matters.
00:08:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I appreciate that.
00:08:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay.
00:08:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So like of the when I was looking at like the things that I really wanted to do. Hi, Esther. Hi, Esther.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, look how beautiful you girls are.
00:08:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What's the baby? Oh, no, just grabbing my foster.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You girls are so pretty. Good to you. Did she like her daddy?
00:08:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, thank you. I was just going to say of the things that I think, you know, when it's when things are difficult. I think I still of those, you know, these things that I'm looking at right now, you know, the the one thing that I still got to remember is like if my business isn't growing, then it's whatever. I don't remember the quote from what you did last time, I think that's that made an impression and I really got a hone in on new leads. I mean, the lifeblood of my clinic is new referrals, new case managers, new law firms. So I think, like you said, when I have big life events that come up or I know I'm going to be busy, I need to front load things and of the of the things that I do and with my time, that one thing getting new leads is the single most important thing in my business.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, Actually, I'm going to clarify that because I can't tell you how many people I've seen who have great leads who don't do a good job of converting and keeping and capitalizing on what they get so capitalizing to the point of like getting second and third appointment and things like that. So, I just want to make sure that you draw a really accurate picture about what that is and don't focus too much on obtaining new leads. But how you handle them. So obtaining, retining, and optimizing, maximizing leads.
00:10:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that's interesting. Okay. Oh, that's right. do remember we talked a little bit about that. That was kind of like, that's why we were looking at warm leads.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The ones that had sent me a case in last month because those are lot easier to talk to retention over acquisition. And like if you have nothing to it, nothing of required retention is nothing, right. Zero times zero zero zero.
00:11:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But I have we have people that have sent one or two in the last month and yeah, I forgot about that.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah Okay, well, and that is why the conversation about consistency comes up and frequency So we only meet once a week and that is enough as long as you are coming back to our conversation and reviewing our notes If you're only looking at it the day that we talk you are not capitalizing on our conversations You need to be looking at it a couple times a week besides the day We talked so roughly three times a week if you want to get the most out of the time So if you're committed to a year, but if you're planning on quitting in a year that you need to maximize all the money and all the time that you're spending with me by Reviewing everything that we've talked about and making sure that you're touching it a few times a week and getting maximum traction so building the systems that Optimize acquisition and then optimize retention and we are only talking about
00:12:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
lie in that area.
00:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, you've got you've got other things going on that you want to keep going on. There's a lot of room for, and let's say when we talk about your business, right, let's talk about all of the things. And really, there's a higher overarching goal, which is $10 million and not working too much while you do that, so that you've gotten to the point where you feel like I can take care of my family and I'm not worried about anything. So, within that realm, if you're not going to work yourself to death or put yourself at extreme risk, then how you run business is everything. And so, you have to be strategic about it. You can't just show up and be like, okay, I'm ready to work what's in front of me and do it. You need to be planning every single day. What is the best way to use my time in order to leverage it and to get the most out of it. So just a reminder because you're getting back into the swing of things that every honestly every morning the beginning of your day every day should be reflecting if not the night before but really it works even better when you do it a little bit the night before and a little bit first thing in the morning because there's something that happens with our subconscious that's really amazing that connects dots for us in the middle of the night. So plan it a little bit at the night before a little bit in the morning with any kind of renewed or new information that might have come to your mind or coalesced so that you have a new understanding and then make your plan. if you're doing that on a daily basis the efficacy of that process increases and you so I've talked to you before about mental lag time right and a lot of the processes are to reduce the friction and the mental lag time which is why we have the visuals, why we have the spreadsheets, why we put the data in there right? The other thing that improves that is the consistency and the frequency. So if on a daily basis, you have brought your mind back to this plan, the why, the how, the when, the due dates, that everything else, your ability to maintain a clear image of what you're working on, and to be able to activate on that plan is going to be improved. If you take days off because you're busy, then you're going to have some mental lag time and come back and have to like, okay, where would I just like your experiencing right now?
00:14:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's significant. They lost the significant. Yeah, I see that. I feel it.
00:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but that is why. So we've got points right here, right? It's a visual. How quickly without me even talking about some of it, did your brain look at it and go, oh, yeah, I remember. That's because first, of all, we discussed it thoroughly. Second of all, we had other visuals. Sorry, I didn't know I didn't meet my phone. We have other visuals that you're able to draw upon. You can look at your one spreadsheet to rule them up, pops into your mind. The master means pops into your mind. And so you have images, puzzle pieces to be putting together because we created them. So anyway, all of these things I want you to see how they come together to create speed for you to be able to. So like, let's go back one more time too. know I'm like monologuing here. ridiculous. But trying to get you back up to speed. But in the beginning, how much time it took to wrap our heads around everything and how many ahas there were. Now, we can take two weeks off and you come back to it. And even though there is this lag time and you realizing how much wasn't, you know, top of mind. And very quickly, you can get back there because of what we've been building. So anyway, take that all into account.
00:16:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I like that. And yeah, I think, I think maybe like when I even this morning, I'd forgotten about like my priorities to call. But yeah, I think it takes me time to figure out who to call. Like if I had already know who I'm going to call, like I think on our call, we had the 16 firms that we had identified that call, you know, if I have that exact reason, right?
00:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just talk about it takes me time to figure out that is the thing. Like I want you to like do that into your head when I talk to you about spread sheets and planning and sorting and ranking that time where, let's say you come and you sit down and you're energized and you're like, I'm ready to call. But your brain is like, I don't know who to call. And so this happens to me. All the time. I'm excited. I'm ready to get to work, but I my energy, my social energy back to the look at spreadsheets so fast So if you have it ready when you're ready to sit down and you're fired up and like I can handle phone calls or knock them out Yeah Yep, that makes a lot of sense.
00:17:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I need to Do you have this this meeting notes document? Can you share it again or every third already? It's just so it's in my inbox. I need to put it in my inbox.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not shared with you. There you go. Thank you And internal error has occurred. Send it away. Yes Okay, there you go Um And I missed things Um, because I just get you a homework or fathom notes, so. Oh, I just added it would be easier to put it here today. So I could do this screen sharing instead of going into email and, um, that way also I can take notes if we have anything show. Let's think about this. Um.
00:18:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, let me look at my schedule for this week. That'll also let me figure out what kind of work I can get done.
00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So today, um, my family's, uh, well, first of all, Emmy got a fever. So she's home, but she's not going to jiu jitsu today. And my, uh, my mom and dad are going to take her present and jiu jitsu by herself. So actually I am free until I'm free all day now. I have nothing going on today. So I think this is great. I'll have three, essentially three uninterrupted hours to work after we get up. Well, two and a half until five o'clock when we eat and stuff. So I think this is good. have all have two and a half hours right now to just work and get caught up. So I'd like to kind of target what I'm going to work on. And like you said, I think I'm going to spend, I'm going to call my manager, Paul, and work with him a little bit more about how he can help prep the people I need to call. Because like you said, that little mental, I have to figure out who to call, even though I was ready to call, it's slowed me, like he said. So where think I should have him? Because he's already consolidating the number of visits, he's consolidating. You know, he's putting the volume calls per agent. I'm just trying to figure out where we should have him. I don't want to have like a thousand spread sheets for him that he fills out either. Maybe I'll use the the one called clinic volume. He's already filling that out for me. Just make a tab on that.
00:20:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This one, right?
00:20:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, clinics volume.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:20:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I think that might be a good one. Because this is where I take the data from this and then I plug it into our one document that has the money in it. So I didn't want him to see the money and stuff.
00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. That's the one to rule them all, right?
00:20:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes.
00:20:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So I kind of have to wrap my mind around this. because to me, where you were getting the information about who to call was this document.
00:20:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that was it. I lost that one. Yes. That's what I was missing. So, can we consolidate these though?
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, so as long as the tabs are named well, and the spreadsheet is named well, because what you don't want is a system where people are like, wait, where's that? Like you were just doing. So the names of the documents and the tabs are important for that mental lag time and friction. So, and also if the data is not really formulated ideally for the activity, then it's worth creating a tab that pulls the data in and formulates it or formats it the way that we want. So, let me think about I'm lose the term because we only need
00:22:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
this in September, it was the first time he could he pulled data for me. Okay. But he actually was asking me, Hey, what you want me to do for October? The same thing. And so I haven't really told them, but we're all October anyways.
00:22:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this is raw data. So we want this, first of all, to be updated every week. So we're behind now.
00:22:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. And I would like him to do that.
00:22:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That would be fantastic.
00:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this is not a formula.
00:22:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So he, so these are all the new referrals from September. So I guess what he'll do is just put in, because what he's doing is just copying and pasting the name. Maybe we could just, because what I, what I need is just account.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
need it's account. It's account if though, and it's going to be account if, by the name of the, um, what the name period, because you've got multiple people at law firms, right?
00:23:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What if Tina, can we go back to my master lien's document? Do you have that? Yeah. Okay. So what if you scroll all way to the bottom, which is like 5,500 at this point, 4,400, you know, this is the up to the minute input. So what if I took a mirror, like I made a, I made a copy of ML, like a real time copy, and then from there, you and I make a four, maybe not us, but we make a formula to pull out the law firm names, because we already have the case manager law firm. Like here are the case manager emails in this column here, and then, you know, the one next was the law firm.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All of these are long thing. If all of your documents that your team has access to, or that you need them to have access to, exist in a single folder, because they can have separate read access, right? So just because it's in a folder doesn't mean everybody has access. can, you can, um, matter of fact, on a sheet by sheet basis, you can change access. But if it all resides in the same folder, you can pull from one sheet to another sheet. That's the thing. To 100% you can pull from one workbook to another workbook.
00:24:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, I maybe, maybe I said like having my manager like copy paste, that's so manual. We can just use the data ML and just, yes, no, make a formula that counts only October.
00:24:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so let's do this. Okay, so first of all, let's get done. Organize properly so that they're in the same folder.
00:25:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can you do that real quick?
00:25:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could put it on a sheet I don't know how to put it the same folder though Um you could put it on a sheet. So let's let's um, where's the location of this file?
00:25:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Meaning like I could I could just copy master lien's onto a new but why why would we want to copy it? just I don't know. Yeah, you're right. just need the data from it.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so Details No, I need to know where it's located and I don't do I have is this view only from me? It's view only yeah, okay, so Let's find the location Um, you might need to go to like Maybe move so you can see where it's at Okay, the container one yeah. Oh, um, no, let's see this one master means where's it located master leans.
00:26:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's in my admin folder.
00:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you the only one that has access to that?
00:26:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, all the admins have it. But clinicians don't get access to it. So only the admin shares the second.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't, it doesn't have to be moved. If you want, you can share screen and then I'll show you how to make sure that you, you maintain the access level. The way that you want to. So I'll stop sharing. And let's look at your admin folder. Okay.
00:26:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can you see? Can you see?
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, master means copy of master means. Now, could you put.
00:26:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I don't know why this is here. Oh, this is, oh, I did make a copy.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah, we don't want to do Kate work. We don't want to duplicate anything. We just want to use what we have. Well, I don't know what this is copied. I feel like I should delete this probably you made it September 9. So, I mean, you look at version history to see if you did anything in there that you don't want to lose. Scroll down. There you go.
00:27:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Nope.
00:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:27:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, this thing's going by. This is very confusing.
00:27:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So go back where you were for sec.
00:27:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yep.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I saw the. I'm ready to go. Can tell you test.
00:27:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. I see where this one is.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know where Paul has you. You were just, I just saw it in your folder. That's why I said go back because I don't.
00:28:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know where it was, but I just thought it was that it was I think it was in like the recents. Oh, okay, please. This is his, I think this is his personal, like five.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this is his. Okay, so you also want to make sure that anything that you need to be made owner of all your stuff. So transfer ownership to you. You can't, he'll have to do it.
00:28:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:28:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually you should be able to because it's a July medical thing. But anyway, have Paul transfer ownership to you.
00:28:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Got it. Okay.
00:28:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
other thing is, okay, so file go to move file move when you're done. No, no, you're your editor, you should be able to move it. You just want him to be able to transfer ownership of all July Docs. to you. Just so that if anything happens to him, you, you have full control. You don't want to trigger fear in him that maybe he's getting fired for some reason or anything like that. This is just preventative measure in case anything ever happens to you and I need full access. Because really, truly, that is the that's something you should always be thinking about. Okay, so file move. You should be able to do that because you're editor. No. No.
00:29:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I think he's gonna have to move it. I'm gonna ask him to move it into that.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, admin. And what other files. So he doesn't have one to rule them all. But if the clinics volume data, if that's all mine. Contingosis.
00:30:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. This is the only one he did.
00:30:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So you can move those tiles into that folder, but make it so that nobody else has access to it.
00:30:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's right. Yeah. That's right.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that way all your stuff is in one folder and you know where to find it easily.
00:30:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So mental lag time reduced, right?
00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And then any sheets that need to pull data from each other will be able to do so because you'll be able to map. That's what it's called when you are taking the location of one document. mapping it. So you'll need that for the formula.
00:31:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so the location is right here. It's right here. That's it.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Okay.
00:31:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, guess it's this address here.
00:31:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go to. Well, so I will share my screen now.
00:31:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We'll stop for a minute. Okay.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I almost hit end call. No, that's. Stop screen, start screen. Okay. So, I need. So if we had the spreadsheet names and locations, it could give us the perfect formula, but we'll have it use and the reason why I don't like not using the real thing is because the syntax has to be exact. Upper case, lower case. this is all of that. So but we'll do this to start with. So I need to create a formula that pulls data from a specific column in a Google Doc sheet.
00:32:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Here's the link in the chat box to it.
00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It can't do that. So what we need is the name of it.
00:32:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But it'll tell you how to direct it to that, right?
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That because you want to pull the data from that one? Yeah. So really what I think that we need to do is give it the names of the folders and the names of the documents. It doesn't actually need to know all of the hex code for the URL. So, let me do this, okay. We'll see. This will be a learning exercise because I haven't mapped anything like this for a long time.
00:33:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I recently did it and it's going to ask you for the HTTPS address. so of that address, this is the specific. Oh, not that one just the it's the it's like the number after the D. That's the address.
00:33:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. um, a group on a specific tab. From this document. Oh, that's what it. Oh, yeah, I can't copy and piece from there. Um, so I can do it. I'll do it myself here.
00:33:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's, you know, don't, don't highlight the edit where it says edit.
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Okay.
00:34:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Everything before that, essentially.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Copy. Thank you. Um, and. It needs to go into a. Um, along where do we want it? So we're going to put it in.
00:34:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Maybe the one document.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, well, where we were using it was here. Okay. We were populating the raw data from that with, right?
00:34:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Maybe a new tab here.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, no, because isn't it. Isn't this it?
00:34:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, well, yeah, that's the data.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is, is what is here? So nine to 24. Not what you have here.
00:34:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It should be exactly the same.
00:34:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:35:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We only selected certain columns.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, What we'll do is we'll have it over right because it'll just, um, Okay. Here's what we're going to do. Let's do I have edit access that? Probably.
00:35:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can I do this one?
00:35:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know that duplicate. So we're just going to duplicate that copy of our data. And so I'm going to, um, clear this because this is a copy.
00:35:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
right.
00:35:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, and we're going to rename.
00:35:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So October, we're almost done with the month.
00:35:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I would like this document to be our, well, the whole thing is September, 2024, like, I'm right.
00:35:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Let's just get all the data. Okay.
00:35:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And formulate it and then we can make other tabs from it. But the first thing. What we're doing is pulling the raw data, right? Automatically. OK, so formulate raw data. So just so we know the difference. Or pulled raw data, whatever, whatever. It just needs to be specific. So I can go longer too, I don't have to get my daughter until later, since we missed some time last week.
00:36:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's okay.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Needs to go into this document. On the tab titled. On the raw data. OK. So, master liens, the tab that we want, the column that we want heading is what?
00:37:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, I want H. Well, I want the patient's name. So column A. Yeah, column A, then the law firm name, and the case manager's email.
00:37:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what column, is that column A, column what?
00:37:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
column A, column A, column H, column I, and then the date, so L. I only want data. Eight, nine, that's twenty twenty four through nine, that's three, that's twenty four. L.
00:38:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where'd you put that?
00:38:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Are you doing chart GPT two?
00:38:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We're here to use screen share.
00:38:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Very. Let's see, let's see if that works, copy, good. Alright, let's go to your contento now, let's see if this guy works. this works, this this this this let's let's I'm going go ahead it right in the sheet and put it right sheet.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are the dates formatted the same consistently?
00:40:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they look like they are, well you have a strikeout that shouldn't make a difference. Do I look format at the same to me? I Ask if they need to reside in the same physical folder on drive. They probably shouldn't. Because you gave it a specific hex code.
00:42:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you're actually the name of the sheet.
00:42:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how Excel works. You still haven't asked it though, it needs to reside in the same physical folder.
00:43:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. Do need to be owner or is I'll give you an order, I'm on her now.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. was us.
00:44:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, do it.
00:44:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, uh, let's see, no. I would ask you what questions do you need to ask me to make sure that this works properly. And what. The simplest way to validate my settings are correct. Like, can we just pull data from one column at a time, one column to one column?
00:45:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No. Permission. Okay, let's see the source. What's the conversion I had one in there?
00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, isn't an issue with Google suite admin level? Well, we'll that up and see if that's all.
00:46:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm just going to make a new sheet for myself. That's right, that's the end.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, well. Do you have, um, you see the AI button there at the time?
00:47:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
up.
00:47:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See if you can tell it what you want it to do and it'll let you. Just copy and paste from what you already want to try VBT. All right, you you you you make that you can can So this is what I was saying. Try just pulling one column at time. So column A to column A or column H to be the H or whatever.
00:48:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I guess A1 to A1.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the formula? Can I see the formula?
00:48:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Why is this not working? Okay, let me check. I did this already with this. Nope, not that one. Where is my tracker? tracker. So this is using the formula. exact thing. So where is the formula for this? No, no, no, no, no. There it is.
00:49:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Import range. That's the whole thing. That's not just...
00:49:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's not just that formula here, huh? Okay, well, I'm just going to copy this. All right, let's try this. I needed the whole URL. Okay. Okay, so now we have it. Is this updated? Yeah, this is updated. Okay, well, I think maybe what I'll do is just close these. Can I like hide certain calls? Oh, there it is.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can select multiple, yeah, and hide.
00:50:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Address. Don't care. Okay, always. Nice. So now we want this is the raw data. Now we want to have. So this is just it.
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think help you make it. It's supposed to, but I've never got it to do anything useful.
00:50:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I canceled it. Okay.
00:50:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would tell it what the error was.
00:50:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah. Come on, Chef CPT, I don't know where I am. You
00:53:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so now we want to copy the formula from the one we've had in Contaios, Cintas, what was it?
00:53:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, I am going- should just be able to paste the formula, think I'm just going to use this new one. This is, I don't think this would, like we can recreate this, right? He's just doing it now, and then have it sorted by this, okay. So, okay. Okay, so now we have that, and then we have the high of the A's. Again, don't want that, don't want that, don't want that, all right, okay. So do I need another tab again?
00:54:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yes.
00:54:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so now it needs to be.
00:54:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we, so September, October, um, basically every month you'll, if you want to, honestly, really I'd rather you just track it through the whole year. Let me, I have to go look at it this way because it's hard, my eyeball is looking at it there. Um, so if we're going to make this like a really good system, let's do it month to month, but then let's also have the year suddenly because what we'll want to do is we'll want to a couple of things like if we're really going to have a dashboard and it's a performance dashboard, one of the tabs will be a graph showing the calls by person over the year, right? But we also want the average that they sent throughout the year, so there will be some different formulas. But right now in order for you to be able to make the calls the first thing that we need to do is month to month. September and October beta to date because October is almost And then I could call them more real time. Yeah.
00:56:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, there.
00:56:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm always glad there's nobody around when I'm working and I celebrate like that because I Little bit about it You
00:57:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That didn't work at all. Oh, we did. No.
00:58:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's because it's empty. The text join as like that comma filter September. Yeah. Just tell it all at print. No, no, no, no. You have to be specific.
00:58:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All it printed was a comma. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, can you append, get the original formula to pull them together? Hey, wait, no.
00:59:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's it?
00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but how I did have so many emails.
00:59:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because there's a bunch of different emails. Okay. You know, because they're each law firm. Wall is very sent me 60 referrals. you know, five from each law.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Five from each manager.
00:59:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Awesome. Yeah. All right. do I wrap this? That didn't exist. We're up. Oh. Oh. Thelma, thelma, Gloria, Diego, is a bit. Where's Diego? is. Those are all marks, guys.
01:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you still have a Diego?
01:00:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, Diego. Yeah. sends me a ton. Wow. Look at that. This is really interesting. They sent me 11 referrals, but only these three case management.
01:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool. When I tell you about looking at the data, Fuji.
01:00:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, this one is even more. Well, Ayala is only coming from three case managers, 20 referrals.
01:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like 10 each. And so how much do you want to celebrate and thank those people, right? Looking at the data is so revealing.
01:00:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, this actually makes me want to do the same thing, but do just separated by case managers.
01:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, for sure. For sure. You should know it on a person by person basis. I'm telling you about human resources. Humans running the business, but like of all the resources that we have, I don't care how good technology gets for human resources are the most important thing that you have. At the end of the day, no matter what kind of post-apocalyptic world that we ever get in, it's going to be people helping people. But let's just say you am bankrupt. Let's say any number of things happen. Your house burn on a fire. It's telling you like who you know, but how you nurture those relationships. I'm telling you specifically too because you are type a very analytical, no-nonsense, get down to it. So if somebody is not in your periphery, they're your buddies and your friends, you may not think. to think about that, but massaging and nurturing the people that nurture your business, or any other aspect in your life is a very good strategy. But when you do it authentically, know, with actual real concerning gratitude, not just how can I get the most out of people? You I mean?
01:02:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen businesses on the brink of death and tens of people about to be unemployed, and it was a favor from a friend that got them through something, maybe because Google had shut them down, or this thing, that thing, or whatever. But whoever sends you the leads, man, take good care of them. But you don't know who it is first. You have to identify them first. But also, it's not always, but it can be so much easier to get more from the flow that's already coming to you.
01:03:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There we go. I added a column now.
01:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's where I went today, Fuji.
01:03:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Look at that. So, Rosie is obviously sent the most, Alondra sent the second most. Majin, that's interesting. So, Majin's actually an assistant of a case manager, I don't know who her case manager is. I should know that, but I don't. Oh, Alma. Yeah. So, Alma's actually the lead case manager for Majin. Majin's just, Majin just does what Alma says. So, Alma's actually the one sending me this stuff. That's really cool.
01:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I would come up with some strategies for, you know, who are your top tier people and how do you want to treat them? What kind of frequency for touches, the quality of the.
01:04:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
communication that you have with them um yeah i'd really think about that cool this is really cool i'm glad we took the time to do this so now that i know how to do it you're right i think i don't you're right i don't think we actually need to copy the raw data here we could like you said now we call it call it the original sheet without having this guy and i just need it i just need to be more specific about the formula like because i don't even need this september one because in this formula we just pulled from the original tab and just you know put up the date ranges and then like you said then the next thing would be to do this for all time or not all time but like the trailing quarter or the trailing six months or something so i like it yearly quarterly and monthly um
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because those are snapshot data where you can watch trends, but also because they are seasonal. So you want to know if there are seasonal trends, you want to watch them year over year, you want to watch them quarter over quarter, month over month, and you'll be easier to recognize the patterns that you might not have otherwise identified if you look at it in multiple views. And those are the ones that I find to be the most helpful in any business. Less than that, you missed something.
01:05:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What should I do for these my top refers like Rosie, Londra, slash, Majin.
01:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I saw, would.
01:05:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Last year I sent them door dashes and actually these these top people have already sent it to them, but that was a year ago. I was sending them like Hawaiian because, you know, July is like Hawaiian. I'm trying to female Hawaiian, but. I sent them Hawaiian food, but do you think that's okay to do it again like well so um first of all Did you get any response back? Oh, yeah? also had to get their texts, right?
01:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have other texts, they always said thank you appreciate it and um What was the overall read though? Was it a flight?
01:06:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you appreciate it or like where they wow like can you be a little bit more temperature specific I think sorry I Yeah, so all my said and will you share the
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me if you haven't so that I can take a peek at it and wrap my brain around a little.
01:07:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, sorry.
01:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Thank you.
01:07:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so she said we received the food earlier. Thank you so much from both Jaslyn and I.
01:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was her previous assistant and I guess much thanks to the new one. So, so much is a good temperature.
01:07:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Thank you so much. Well, Jaslyn and I, it was delicious.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. So temperature read is they really enjoyed that. That stood out, right? Hey, we just want to thank you. Totally. Like, yeah, whatever. It's in obligatory thanks versus that was awesome.
01:07:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Know what I mean?
01:07:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So that's one thing. It kind of depends on how many people you would rank as your top provider. So let's go. identify that. Um, are they, is it how many they send you? Is it the percentage above the average that that makes them the top? Like, how do we, how do we say that this is, this is where you fall?
01:08:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So each referrals about, you know, it's worth about three to four hundred dollars to me.
01:08:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it's not the money. So we want to rank according to what we're receiving, right? So what was the total number for September?
01:08:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Three hundred.
01:08:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, scroll up, please. Okay, so highlight that, and I'm trying to look at the formula down on the right, drag down to call row 10.
01:08:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, row 10?
01:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, you see where to, yeah, thank you. So, yeah, that's what I'm looking for. So, Though the top 10 people sent you one third of your business.
01:09:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm going to add one more column.
01:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you can either. Well, yeah, because that's actually 10, right?
01:09:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you for sending me 30 seconds.
01:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, no, no. So I thought about that too, but you don't want to tell them because that lets them know exactly how you, okay, right? They can do some math. So scroll down a little bit. All right, so I would cut it off at nine. Okay. Or you go down and grab the other eight, right? But I would thank them for being one of the top referers and really thank them for like just a reminder, hey, we're a small business. We're just a family business. And this is something that I've done to provide for my family, which by the way, maybe a picture of Mari and And not to exploit them, but I don't mean it that way. I'm a mom, so at this, anyway, our family grew, right? so the personal approach. Now, I'm saying something like I would do. You have to think about it for your idea, like, how do you make a personal connection and say, I just wanted to show my thanks. And so here is whatever. And you might say, well, last year I did this and it was food. And I mean, I don't know how to please everybody, but I know everybody eat. So I was thinking I would do whatever. it could be a door dash. It could be a specific place, a specific food. Think about it.
01:10:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I would tap Esther for that, for sure. It took a long time to like, and I'm not just part of it, placing the order, getting their order, sending it to them.
01:10:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe what I'll do this time is.
01:10:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Celebrate that part. Yeah, we were talking about creating.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
fall, a door dash thing.
01:11:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I think I'll make the initial connection, you know, to say thanks, and then ultimately ask, I need your phone number, and then we can coordinate from there. Once I get their phone number, then, you know, ordering, getting their orders easy.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So one of the things you could say is I just wanted to personally reach out and talk to you and whatever, communicate, right?
01:11:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's right.
01:11:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then after that point, you say, because my thanks is personal, but I am going to have Paul get this for you, and make sure that everything's taken care of, because as much as I appreciate you, door dash is annoying, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Like, you just be real, you know what I'm saying? And people, they'll probably make her and be like, oh, yeah, that's a good idea. should totally delegate that. You know what I mean? It's just be authentic. But that way, in case anything goes wrong or Paul needs to ask them a question, you've already introduced it.
01:12:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you framed it properly but also you you made a specific point of saying like this is really me I'm really thanking you like I was looking at my numbers and noticing this and I'm just grateful so thank you so much should I okay and then these are like the top people that have been referring to me for like a year I mean I know all these people should I be something to what should I do with like okay so the food thing is like something once they start you know sending me 10 a month but what about the people that I kind of want to like fan like you know water and water and plant so um like grace she can't I mean those those are three and since when this is actually her assistance I know this is grace oh this is also September right yes so seven because she this is she works for her um yeah so this is where having the tab of over a year
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
would really come in handy because now you have an ability to rank them and The other thing is if the formula is done correctly, so let's say Parnell didn't show up until August if you're doing an average Then the average is based on the three months that they were referring you not an average across the year because it will find zeros Right, so and that means that we have to get the formula correct But that's what we want to do is what is the monthly average that you sent me as long as you've been with me So so that's what we want to know and then the I mean the language could be as simple as This is a new company where a personal like mom and pop shop and Whatever thing I already have my skill I tell that We that because I do this telehealth from home. get to stay at home with my Yes, yes So but thank you for making that possible, helping to make that possible. And this is why I'm thanking you so much. Right. Because because you've been a part of helping me accomplish that. And and I want to thank you and whatever, you know, you can give us small token. It could be a Amazon digital card. It's not going to cost you very much. You can send a $100 thing to each person and see and measure who sends you more, if any. You know, I realized that these things don't get you that much. So you're kind of either break even and are at a loss. But we're only talking about doing it one time if it doesn't result in an increase the next month, then, you know, maybe you and maybe you start with $50 or something like that.
01:14:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's a good point.
01:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do I get? so it's the one thing that we didn't talk about today that that I want to always.
01:14:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, shoot over time.
01:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so scared. Oh, it's fine.
01:14:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I told you I could go over that because because we missed last week.
01:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
which is not my fault, but it's still I want to give you. So I lost my train of thought. Oh, compounding. Okay. So by massaging the retention process and the focus rather than just acquisition, you get the compounding benefit. So if you establish relationship, nobody else sends me Amazon gift cards. you know, a few months later, I got, you know, a few hundred dollars of Amazon gift cards, like that starts to add up. And I like food young and to send him some more stuff, right? So if only one third of the people that you send those to end up increasing what they send, then it works. But then also it's month after month after month, a year after year after year. I mean, so versus building a brand new relationship with a brand new person, getting to. know that I'm wrapping your head around them, finding if that if they're even consistent that that whole thing. So acquisition is important. Retention is even more important.
01:16:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see. What do I do for like the the firms like I actually know that Rosie doesn't send it to me or Allison like you know they're top but it's all coming from one of the lead case managers like her name is Danielle. So Danielle tells these people where to send it. Does that really matter because I mean ultimately these people might act independently at some point but right now I know that it's coming from one case manager.
01:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's the way to really please them right is be like I know it's you. Yeah. Thank you so much for what you do. But I can also thank these individuals that said it did it. Yes and I would and and maybe you send them both something equally so that it's diplomacy. But we're Now you're top 10 or at least your top five. Yeah, I would be doing that.
01:17:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They think like, you know, again, each referral they send me is like $300 theoretically. So if I give back, I mean, you know, I start 50, say 50 Amazon, $50 Amazon gift cards and I do nine, you know, that's $450. So, you know, essentially, that's one, that could cost me one referral to do that.
01:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and considering that the average marketing campaign costs would be roughly 25 to 30% to acquire something.
01:17:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. This is a lot cheaper.
01:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way cheaper. And then there's compounding effect, right? You're not just acquiring somebody new that may go away, you're acquiring somebody, you're retaining somebody that's continued to deliver over time. And that number will mean any even more. Or once we get the whole year's data mapped out and you go, well, take my money.
01:17:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I will go ahead and start wrapping up because I'm going to have to go get my dog. from school. But you have last week's homework. So the one thing I do want you to do is reply to that homework email. It was sent on the 14th. So you have to go back and find it. And I want you to tell me what you commit to doing between now and next week.
01:18:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm not going to send a new email. It's already there.
01:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's the thing that we looked at on the spreadsheet. So keep into account what your priority is on a oogee husband, dad level. And you just moved. And the growth of the business. And the other thing I want you to think about. So remember I told you that part of my strategy is when I have these these dips in my productivity, I front load, back load. But the other thing is leverage and optimization. So everything that you're building right now, everything that we're working on is super leverage. So if you stay focused and the majority of your time is going. into building these data and the system structures, which is tedious and annoying. And you want to watch shortcuts if it doesn't work. If you stay in that zone and putting that in terms of homework as to what you'll accomplish, rather than going big, go concentrated, being leveraged. So, but reply to me by the end of today so that I know what we're working on through next week, but also because that needs to be your commitment to what you're working on.
01:19:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sound good? Can you give me access as well to my notes? Yes.
01:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:19:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I will do that. will fly. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. You're going over. Yeah. Thank you. Appreciate it. You're welcome. I enjoy it. Appreciate it. Have a good day. I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye.
