00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You muted, homie.
00:00:15 - mark sweet
Okay. here we go. I did the okay to this being recorded.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You what?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I had the okay to being. Oh, which makes sense because you're not going to agree to it. Yeah, you shouldn't be talking.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One hundred percent, but did you not have to do that before?
00:00:31 - mark sweet
No. Or not that I noticed anyone.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should have been having to have to do that before every time. Okay. Well, because I don't have the same experience as, you know, people that attend. so I like to know, because at one point. It was, and then maybe it still does is it, but I removed this feature. So it's not supposed to do this. It was emailing. people. I had a time making sure that they were approving of the upcoming call being recorded, but the biggest problem about that was it would take any event I had on my calendar and do that if I invite someone to do it. So like, you know, my schedule with the girls and their dad when they're gone, I shared that with my fiancé. And so he was like, why am I getting asked if this can be recorded? Like, what?
00:01:31 - mark sweet
Anyway, it looks like this quantify is working.
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That? Okay, so can we get the details, like, defining what's working?
00:01:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, so part of the issue is issue and take student signup on it.
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so putting it as, sorry, doing take is doing the signup with quantify.
00:01:53 - mark sweet
Signup, okay. Because my side is used to putting it as valiant.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:02:02 - mark sweet
Creating a little bit of an issue in that regard. So we're just going back and fixing it, but they've signed at least. At least three cases. And maybe less than a week. Yeah, on 10 grand. So the price works.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how good are the cases?
00:02:22 - mark sweet
Yeah. mean, they're regular cases or nothing. That's like. Right. There's one more trying to get where it's a broken head, but it's just kind of a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There were any of them just like terrible and maybe we shouldn't have signed them like any.
00:02:41 - mark sweet
One was where we initially kind of referred it out, but they ended up signing it. It through two different sources, but they got information that we maybe didn't get or wasn't told to me about a preexisting injury.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Well, but I'm seeing at least at least three, if not for the very least, we have a game to watch for a little while. You know what I mean, even if it's only three three at 10 grand still worse. Yeah, but yes. Yes. The way that I look at things is that there's there's always potentially anomalies. It's not, you know, the thing until it's being done consistently. Oh, right. So, but yeah, for sure it looks like something we've we've there's worth looking at continually until until it's not. That's just the optimistic.
00:03:54 - mark sweet
Right. It's a lot better than the other one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. . Yeah, no, we get it. But you know, the 2022 should be a very small percentage of your cases. It was like 40 something percent.
00:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand why. I mean, I guess I do, right? They, they all have that on their lead form. Like, is it actually within within the last two years? Like, how many of your clients are actually converting cases like that that are any good?
00:04:27 - mark sweet
None. It technically is a lead, right?
00:04:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's technically exactly right. But it's like, yeah, no. mean, that's why they do it. Because they're we have to do it.
00:04:44 - mark sweet
Right. Because it's just a way for them to pad. And then I see like, it's just, it's the nature of the beast. Not happy about it, but yeah.
00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, Let's see. One second.
00:05:04 - mark sweet
I'm seeing at least three. So that's good.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There was numbers. Give me the end of the month. I know it was 85 and since. 83. bad.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
It's kind of a couple of the weekend. So it's like if it was longer, they would have hit 85, but it was already a long week.
00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's a 65.28. So weird. I am searching and I should get the right thing, but I cannot get the right thing. You sent it over the weekend, so I didn't just pop it straight into notes. What day? Let's see. Six more. All right, I'll do it that later. Well, I wanted to look at it though, and then I wanted to see what we want to look at in the report. That's now that I, we have the reports so far that we've asked me to get in the habit of figuring out what do we need to look at each week. Some of those things don't need to be looked at weekly. So that we're taking, so like the price, so we were looking at conversion rate was the last thing that we requested in the report. For leads versus. Retainer signed the month reports. It's under reports or is it under dashboards? That's under dashboards. Management main, right? Okay, so it's not. Oh, it was a different report that we that already existed that we asked that one to be updated, I think. Do you remember Mark?
00:07:19 - mark sweet
I know you're talking about I'm trying remember what we asked to be updated though.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just going if I can find the next report. Gather report percentage of cases. Yeah, I did that. Do you remember down because we were all talking about it together and then. Send the requests over through you.
00:07:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you. Yes. Would you send it to Stacy.
00:08:01 - mark sweet
I mean, either way, you were saying we had a widget that said, like, sign up great and then with each source.
00:08:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sign up, great meaning that converting from leads to retainers.
00:08:21 - mark sweet
Correct.
00:08:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, how so is a widget like the blocks. Okay. Okay.
00:08:41 - mark sweet
For like, instead of matters by zip code, which. Yeah.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you want to call conversion rate, we can call it.
00:09:01 - mark sweet
I mean, that dude is definitely vulnerable.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we need to find.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Why would someone be marked as converted yet not have a matter?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
Potentially in a death case or if it's for some other name. Oh, but if you give an example, I can definitely probably. thing into a little deeper.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's Jill Elizabeth Prophet, P-R-O-F-F-I-T. Yeah, so it's absurdly, and I'm putting the report together.
00:10:13 - mark sweet
like, I don't know what this means. Elizabeth Prophet is absurdly, okay. Because she is a matter.
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's no matter. When I search for her by her name or her email, and I pull back the records, I have contacts and takes parties.
00:10:32 - mark sweet
But isn't- It's matter right now.
00:10:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Shouldn't be listed on this sort of synopsis result?
00:10:42 - mark sweet
It is.
00:10:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I have zero matters.
00:10:48 - mark sweet
I don't know what to tell you.
00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, did you search by her name? Did you search by her name?
00:10:59 - mark sweet
I searched- I kept in Joe Elizabeth and there's only like one person in that name.
00:11:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:11:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just search by just the name and now there is a matter. When I searched by email there was no matter. Okay. Whatever. I'm not going to get into the nuances.
00:11:32 - mark sweet
I don't know why but yeah it's there.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like well I know converted I thought meant it's done which clearly it doesn't mean but whatever.
00:11:48 - mark sweet
That's that's the role it's just. Sorry, Roberta just means it's no matter.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. So what's the status of the beta-litify functions?
00:12:01 - mark sweet
We're working through it right now. It's Isaac's working on it. Like we had a meeting with it where you signed up for the beta program. So it's in the works, but I think it's like mid June. So I'm like that. It's not ready, but yet. We also Westlaw has their own. So we're playing around with that where it automatically summarizes medical records that you upload. And creates timelines. So we're seeing you that saves a lot of time or is a good use, but it's only 750 bucks per month for six seats, which it's not bad compared to litify who wanted $5 a file. It was doesn't work and they're just suggesting more like that doesn't even make sense.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I just every day I marvel at the greeniness of everything and just.
00:13:00 - mark sweet
want like 1250 for 200 250 files. It's like, it's cheaper for me to outsource it to India. Like, I don't know what to tell you.
00:13:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. To AI and India.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's insane. So just absolutely bonkers. Yeah. It's going to be so interesting to see what happens because it's like almost impossible to predict the best investors and market analyzers couldn't predict the things that happened during COVID because it was such a unique time. like, we are still and will be for a while and such a unique time because of the pace of technology. But there are so many companies that are gouging left and right that it's just interesting how long those models will be able to maintained, but also what the potential repercussions are because that's the type of thing that inspires innovation and other people to come and solve problems, but we're in a time period where more people can innovate because they have access to tools and functions that are affordable. Anyway, it's just the it's fascinating. Anyway, all the more reason to be as leveraged as possible in as many places as possible and to be which is the same thing really just a different way is optimized as possible. I don't think you can be as leveraged as possible without being as optimized as possible. anyway, um, yeah, just all the things making sure what we have never have it and what would be really great for the flow of our meetings is to figure out because because we've had to go through a process of figuring out where we could get this data but figuring out what and I did say it before but it's just we got to keep doing it and my brain isn't going to go by itself it's definitely going to be a group effort. What data do we need to look at every single week and then there will so there will always be the portion of the reporting right looking at that and then the the portion of the meeting which is okay now that we see this kind of trending what could we do to improve any of it really like sometimes it's a you know intake obviously we need a script we need to figure out this that or the other thing talking about how and we need to get to this mark how do we improve the incentive program to make sure that we're hitting max retainer max oh you know the work word. Policy limits. Policy limits. And, you know, that we're not going two months without making contact with somebody in an active case, that type of thing. But with the speaking of being leveraged and optimized, these meetings can begin to be, I think that they've always been helpful and productive. But I think that with good reports, they can be, we can use them even more powerfully if we come up with a set of things that we want to look at every week. We always look at the incident by source, by state, which is really good. We're going to start looking at retainer roughly. mean, we didn't break it down fully, but $259,000 for for 29 or 27 walker versus you said about 200,000 for a 25 monkey. That's something and at the very least that needs to be a monthly thing. But what I would love to do is if we could maybe just spend a little time thinking about what are the things that we need to look at every week, what are the things maybe every couple weeks or every month or every quarter that, especially based off of the conversations we've had, that if we look at it with that kind of frequency, we'll be asking ourselves the best questions and therefore taking the best actions for optimizing things. Anybody up for that today or you want to work on that next week?
00:17:48 - mark sweet
Whatever you want to do with it, I'm going to do it in a way, the scripts, Marco, hold from his old firm, Jose is funny from his old firm, so we're getting some more other scripts. try to cobble something together that makes sense for all of us. We're still a little ways away from that, but we definitely get in that.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a target of I want it completed by huh?
00:18:16 - mark sweet
Well June 14. I said June 15, but that's Saturday.
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. Okay, good. Um, well off the top of your head. So, um, we see what the heck just happened. I hate when I hit the hotkey that brings up the the source for the webpage. Um, I do it all the time. Okay, so we report. know, obviously it's retainers, stores, I stay. Or has been pulling that data. You should be able to get it and let it. So actually let's just go to let it. So where would I go. To get that the way you've been getting into x by source by state. I have three. I'll go this month.
00:19:27 - mark sweet
You're trying to get what the data that I give you. Yeah. I just had the cases sign this month. In this case I just changed the data last month.
00:19:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that should be something that if you can you look at. What if I or I can change. Okay. Okay. Okay. we want to make sure that everything that we need is in this report.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
Okay, um, any report we could just add it to it on the bottom. It just makes it easy for me to look at it. It's called cases sign this month.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me go back to. Okay, um, I do want to see it. So, well, whatever, it looks a little bit different in the widget. Where did I go? Why am I there? Oh, yeah, excellent this. All right, touch forward. That is what we mean. Dan, I don't know if you're looking at the screen but so any quick thoughts about what we should be looking at every week. Obviously it takes resource by state. For you, Dan, any thoughts to optimize what we're working on?
00:21:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The other thing that I, in this scenario, would want to, I don't know how we can see if, like, on track, off track, right? So I actually really do this. But so, right, in my business, the meeting that we had like seven through this morning, it's like we look at how many 30, right? So we know, hey, do we average 30 a day last week? Looking backwards probably isn't the best thing here because week too much time. So it's like what should be the average leads per day here? And then what should it be like per vendor, right? So rather than, and this could be a thing, well, there's Josh, but it's like, rather than go, it's sort of like, I don't know if you remember this, but like, we created that early warning system in for us, where we could put it on a site and go, hey, this, we know that this site gets three leave today. When it falls below this threshold, I want you to tell me that because there's potentially something wrong. So here it'd be like, hey, monkey averages 10 leave today, which is pretty much accurate. So it would be, hey, any time that that number is below 10, a you want to be able to pull up a dashboard at any time and look at it and go on track, off track, especially for like an ongoing vendor, like monkey or walker. And That comparative thing where you mark could know on any you know went next Wednesday It's like H FYI. There's looks like monkeys dropped off and Then you can stay on top of it rather than always going backwards always having to go after the fact to go Hey, leave slow down this past month Something like that. I just don't know if it's possible You know what we could totally do that in Lee Pully Yeah Yeah We could actually do that we could probably do that in Lee Floyd Does we Eric and I then they now there's now like this custom code function And we used it to do that we're using it to do the rotator. So we're defining But what gets rotated it 100 to whatever we pick So if we if we counted monkey leads and then reset that every month I bet we could do like well the daily average would be set we would just set that in a field and then we can manipulate that at any time so it only would be checking against something like that that's probably doable great work everyone I ask the questions you get the answers like
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's great. I like that. Anything else that we should be looking at weekly or monthly or quarterly. Off the top of your head.
00:25:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So probably. Like trending average settlement. Right. So how does that look? So that could be that could probably be. In this dashboard, right? you're saying the current. or for the month, right? Whether it's year to date or month to whatever whatever the filter is to date, something like that, maybe, so that you can see. So that's sort of the primary metric, right? If you throw out your ginormous settlements, Mark, I heard you got one. It's a rumor. There's a rumor if you throw those out, right? Yeah, exactly, totally. But even that number gets factored into the average, right? the outliers don't really toss it. The outliers would toss it for the mom.
00:26:38 - mark sweet
don't put that number in let it by because it would just Okay, good.
00:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then we up up the number. All right, perfect. Yeah, so you just want, that's like the another, I'm just trying to think of like, what are these sort of heartbeat issues, right? Or heartbeat metrics. So there's the leads, there's the-
00:27:00 - mark sweet
the revenue then there'd be like versions there's average settlements per month yeah so let's go into that a little bit so how much is almost like a separate dashboard by the way it does the average settlement is one how many matters settle that month yep how many matters close that month because those are not the same things yep how many each team settles because you know hopefully it gets to the point where every case they settle they're going to get new case so they can get a new clause how many drops and how many sub-outs yes and then first-engine policy limit there's no We're tracking that.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. And you're tracking it in live.
00:28:09 - mark sweet
Right. Yes.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's Josh, right?
00:28:35 - mark sweet
Oh, Steve had mentioned off the cuff. So to get it for whatever it's worth that they've been working with Einstein AI. Which is built into cells. of letify or whatever else and like what if I wants $5 a file to rename it like that's not going to work. But I'm saying AI may be able to do the same thing.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Same thing as what.
00:28:58 - mark sweet
Anything I don't know.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I. literally don't. It's a team. It can do anything. We all know this.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's how that works.
00:29:08 - mark sweet
It's built into Salesforce. Other than that, I don't know.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so if the data is there, then it should be able to analyze a computer, give us what we want, the way that we want to look at it, depending on how well it's been programmed.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:29:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I guess it depends on what this can do here.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what the interface is, because if it's just as clunky, you know, like, if it's a good interface where you basically have a chatbot and you tell it what you want to know, and it can then just go go through the data, find it, and present it to you in the way that you want it, then that's great. If not, you're probably better off sticking with your dashboards.
00:29:59 - mark sweet
Right. I mean, a big thing, too, is it's private problem with open AI as it's open, and obviously what we're dealing with, we can't really have it open.
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the open source and Dan can correct me if I'm wrong, is the foundational code that people have access to, but not everything like the API keys and the API integrations, which would be what's this would be using. All of that data is private, I think, Dan.
00:30:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it is. Yeah. You're basically creating your own container.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's the repository of code that everything is built on that is open source. That's the that's what's open is the code for the programming, but not what's connected to it through APIs. Guys, does that make sense, Mark does just the worry of forces words. Yeah, I don't, it should be fine, but the more we can keep it in the closed ecosystem, happier I am. Yeah, and I think the privacy rules and everything are going to be more clear and improved.
00:31:15 - mark sweet
How the legal world are 20 plus years behind on anything and everything.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean for yes, but for the companies that want to work with you. The owners will be on them to create those, those things. So, but regardless, we don't. I love AI. love technology. All the things, right, but that's not the only way optimization. We've already laid when we started Lidify was just everything was a nightmare and it's taken two years to get to anything kind of. Just dependable and clear data, but two years in how many people are still using Lidify and have no idea how to use it well and get good data and optimize and whatever. So, you know, we're making. very good use of what we have. We, in the process, we didn't just, you know, suddenly get our data. We figured out how what we need to be measuring, how we can measure it. It's been a whole long process. We do want to leverage things and see what we can do, but for you, especially with it being all the laws that are involved in privacy and whatnot, better to let somebody else play with it, figure it out, break it, know, you jump in, reverse and revision two or three, something like that. And in the meantime, we'd be optimizing at the foundational level right here, like this, the dashboards and just getting into the little fire reports, making sure that we're segmenting the data, all the managing the team, all these things, like we're doing, we're doing good.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so, it looks like there's a whole, full trust layer built into this for that. So that like sensitive data is not exposed to the outside world.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Instein AI.
00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it looks, it looks, I mean, whether or not this, I mean, I guess it's available since it's salesforce, like, and electrified salesforce. I'll run it by Josh. I mean, it looks interesting. It's got, you build your own prompts in here and. Oh, do I mean, it's definitely saving you the whole idea of coding out to chat GPT, right? It's doing all that for you. And then you have this layer, they call it co-pilot. So the first thing I looked at, I was like, no, but this is a better breakdown. It might be something. Yeah, it's funny. I talked your boy Salco about the AI. And he. He shockingly, he might come as a shock to you, Mark. But he's all over it. The minute I brought it up, and then I explained what it is, and he goes, oh my god, you serious? He's like, it can do that? I go, yes. And he goes, oh, oh, okay. Yeah, that might be interesting and too funny. He's I was wondering what good AI was for. I'm like, well, you might find out.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I missing?
00:34:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What was the idea? The AI demand writer. So it, in essence, right? It was that I didn't really have any right demands. But he, so I explained it to him because he was like, oh, it could never blah, blah, It would never, he gave it, of course, a very specific example. So he was saying how like, there was a case, I don't know who it was, it was Sam or somebody. And he did a file review for them, and they had like, any of So across those two companies, some weird, you know, medical thing and they missed it and he knew what it was. And so he's like, they missed, they would have missed it. Like, AI would have never caught that. I'm like, AI would have caught that. he's like, what do you mean? I go, if you give it, stop words for lack of better term or alert words, it will lead the whole file and tell you that word's in there. He's like, are you serious? I go, yeah, totally serious. Can you keep updating it? I go, yeah, you would just cause I'm like, you'd give it a first set of words. Like, hey, here are all these words that matter. Make sure that these words are in there. I'm like, and you could get it. And he's like, Oh, well, then the lawyer is going to have to, you know, review the whole file. I don't know. It could, it could spit out. A demand preview for the lawyer that hits all the highlights. they don't have to read the, are you serious? I'm completely serious. But you just, I'm, I'm. You and mark right you guys would have to teach it like it's it's like you're literally teaching it And once it's giving you output that you like it will just continue to do so He was like, oh, okay. That's not how I thought it worked. No, it doesn't just do for you. It does Once you teach it what to do, right? So he was he was like, oh wow, okay, that's a different story. Yeah So now can you use this Einstein thing to do that.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's find out All right um Okay, so We've got The information that we want to be looking at each week. So leads conversions Settlements per month. How many manners settled that month? How many matters closed that month? How many each seems settled? Drops and about percentage of policy limits. So I've got a note to Stacy for all these different things that we looked at. So she can talk with you, you guys can work with Josh or she can, whatever. Monthly, let's see, well that already that covers that. Okay, so that's a good start. Isaac is working on that, a little fly, and Tic is working on the script. Ranking leads in clients. So maybe on if we had the Einstein AI, wonder how much better, how much progress we could get on that thing.
00:37:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have turned out. You could give it parameters and then it goes and looks at everything you're in Salesforce.
00:37:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'd be crazy.
00:37:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right? Because then you wouldn't have to. go back update data. Oh man, I wonder if it could do that too. Or if it could spit out list of like, hey, me all the records that are missing this. Oh, interesting. All the records that are, um, whatever, like if you're just like, hey, show me all the records that are missing the state name, all the all the intakes there. And then, but more importantly, like, show me all the show me all the, I mean, basically you could just add prompt reports and but you could probably and then go further into it. Like, just keep giving it prompts and parrying down data that is sitting there running report after report after report. Or it won't do that at all. Right. We'll find out.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be amazing. mean, there's so much data in there. And if it's connected to Salesforce, Salesforce is already we consider it to be safe. they're integrating through API, you can guarantee Salesforce is protecting their data as much as possible to make sure that what they have is not leaking out through those API access keys. That they're going to spend a ton of money because that's their whole business and livelihood. So if they have the integration, I don't know what else you would want to feel as safe as you can operating in this world, knowing that there's risk at all time that data leads happen. know what I mean?
00:39:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Freedom of Information Act. All these, it's just a crazy, crazy, the stupid ways people think that they can circumvent living in a digital age. like, if you don't want to be caught as a bad person, don't be a bad person. Anyway, okay, let's see. So we were looking at Cordogiwock. How many new doctors? Now, where are we at in the course? that was Q2. It said, which just ended, right? No.
00:40:25 - mark sweet
And the gene.
00:40:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the gene. Okay.
00:40:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the gene. How many doctor referrals? are the top doctors? Profile them? Goal by end of Q2 is 100 incident per month. Attorneys? Okay, those are some of the goals. So we'll just touch on these real quick because these we have a month left. The goal is for attorneys, 1 million and attorney fees, 3 million and settlement fees, total per month, triple per quarter. wants that to be. Oh, I see this settlement. triple of the attorney fees. I'm not sure. I didn't write that clearly enough. Wants this to be 1.2 in attorney fees and 3.5 settlements, 3.5 million in settlements by Q4. How are we doing on that? how would we look at that in a bit? Is that possible?
00:41:23 - mark sweet
No.
00:41:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that's something that you have inside, and you can just tell us. Is that something that we should be talking about just monthly since it's a quarterly goal? yeah, I don't think weekly would make a question.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Right now I'm trying to fix a walker issue to keep on our cell phones. And now I'm finding out some of our numbers on our website aren't important, right? So I need to go at Isaac because this is not a problem.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like right now or since we get off the call?
00:42:03 - mark sweet
Um, we got 15 minutes, but I'm potentially missing you.
00:42:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So right now pissed off. Okay.
00:42:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ooh. All right. Well, I don't know where that little is, so I need to figure it out. You should go do that.
00:42:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes.
00:42:23 - mark sweet
I'll organize the notes and real quick though before I forget Dan, I saw your email. No, I don't think we have a U.S. and news top law firms, I don't think we can buy that.
00:42:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if they've found it- No, I just need something that we can put there.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
Okay. American Student Professional is just, they mean as lower of the year or whatever that is.
00:42:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I need some graphics for this to sign up for it.
00:42:51 - mark sweet
Let me know if this looks good and then I'll get on their money.
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just put them in the hat and send them a picture.
00:43:00 - mark sweet
But yeah, look, lower the year sounds better than U.S. News or whatever.
00:43:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Very nice job. Very nice. Okay. You know, Isaac, I'll organize these notes. Dan will go get some interesting data and see what we can do to.
00:43:19 - mark sweet
Is there a number that can give the walker that technically goes through lead flow, but would connect directly to our intake?
00:43:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like you want a dedicated number for that?
00:43:30 - mark sweet
We can create one. Yeah. Because for whatever reason, I'm calling our 800 number. It's not working.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why.
00:43:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we can create. Yeah, we can create. And it's just for that.
00:43:43 - mark sweet
So it doesn't need to be an 800 number. Yeah, we can create that.
00:43:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, I am then that's another point of like, Hey, this. A way of tracking Walker. Yeah.
00:43:55 - mark sweet
It only takes a couple minutes. Okay. Can you email us me? Because then I can give that to Walker. So then. I can stop this and some calls.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:44:07 - mark sweet
Cool. Otherwise, the other thing, Missouri is ready to go. We've got retainer done. We think it comes set up. So I think when the doctor is sending over his first case today.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. We have a first case today.
00:44:22 - mark sweet
We should.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Okay. I mean, I have questions if you're not going or.
00:44:37 - mark sweet
I'm going to wait for Dan to make that phone number while we're doing this, because at least then that solves my problem short term. Okay. Figure out what's going on. Isaac sees not responding to me. So you might be at lunch or something. Yeah. So, okay.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's try to figure your questions real quick. Um, just an update on new hires.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We have Hank, we have Elizabeth. We've got an interview on Wednesday with another intake person potentially.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That'll do it. Who's outside. You want, but you want to forward this to six, seven, four, seven, eight, five, four.
00:45:14 - mark sweet
Yep. Okay.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, can Liz so far doing okay.
00:45:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, it's still really, really early.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:45:32 - mark sweet
So we started some working through like other cases. So I don't have a lot of updates. Okay. And he's been a little more time with him, but I wanted him to just start getting used to the systems and he's basically just helping more rounds at this point. Right. And working on some of the files.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then the other question. Yeah. We were talking about improving the incentive program to be able to make sure that we're hitting policy limits. Have you made any progress with that?
00:46:14 - mark sweet
No, because I want to see what they're just first before I throw out a number because of my self basically, which is not good.
00:46:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do you want this number to announce that it's from Walker?
00:46:27 - mark sweet
It's short, we can turn it on too. No, no, because they call and say I'm calling from Walker, so, you know, okay.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when will you have figured that out so that we can get at least 60 days of data and preferably 90 days of data, okay.
00:46:50 - mark sweet
Because again, otherwise, I'm like, okay, they're hitting, let's say, just 80%. And I'm like, okay, if you guys say 90%, you get this extra whatever, but the real number was 87%. And I just looked at a very small sample size, then I end up paying out a bunch more.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start tracking the data?
00:47:09 - mark sweet
This last month.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a date? Thank you.
00:47:35 - mark sweet

00:47:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's my birthday.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do I know that?
00:47:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, it'll just work. I mean, you can call it good work. I'm just setting it up, Mark.
00:47:56 - mark sweet
I don't test yet.
00:47:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's a problem. Hey, now. Here I'll call it right now. I mean, it'll be actually would be surprising. Worked that fast. Great. What am I doing? Did you call it? Who's calling?
00:48:11 - mark sweet

Okay. So August 14th will be 90 days. Then you can look at the data that you can have. August to figure out how you want to plan that September. We execute. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Well, that touches Troni once everything that we're working on if I've gone through my notes, right? Although I'm skimming it pretty quickly. But I think we covered most of the things and got some good traction on what we're working on. So I'm satisfied with the call. Anybody else? Anything else we need to talk about? Add to the list.
00:49:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you get Valley and to open the kimono?
00:49:36 - mark sweet

00:50:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alrighty. Also, if you guys have any like travel plans that are coming up that would interfere with calls. If we can just because sometimes a little ball of style plan ahead.
00:50:29 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'll touch you guys some stuff.
00:50:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. Okay. Sure that we're making traction and progress every week. Sometimes we could probably do a decent job like this last week with emails and whatnot. But if we know ahead of time, maybe we can plan better. Okay. Go yell at somebody. Have a good day, you guys. Wonderful.
