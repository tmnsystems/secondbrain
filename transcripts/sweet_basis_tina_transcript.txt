00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tina Marie: Hello!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
mark sweet: Okay, hopefully, you can hear me.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Tina Marie: I can hear you. How are you doing.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
mark sweet: Um, we're having some major tech issues with our Crm or like, we can't see any of our documents. So not awesome.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Tina Marie: What Crm are you using.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
mark sweet: Salesforce.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Tina Marie: That's what is like. Lidify.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Tina Marie: That's bad. How long has that been going on.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
mark sweet: It just happened today. It was fine yesterday, so I don't know what's happening with it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Tina Marie: Yikes! What a bottleneck.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
mark sweet: I mean Isaac's working on it, but, like. Yeah.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Tina Marie: It's nothing like a situation like that to make you realize. I'm trying to think of better words. But basically, how certain things kind of have you? By the.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Tina Marie: Cojones. When you need to work. And our dependency on certain things.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Hello, Dan.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Dan Ryan: Ready!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Tina Marie: Solidify. Salesforce is down.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, wow!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Dan Ryan: That's a bitch.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so I imagine.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Dan Ryan: I blame Elon just because.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
mark sweet: Certainly could be.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, anyway. Well, has that happened before.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
mark sweet: Not like this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Tina Marie: What did they respond with.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
mark sweet: I don't know. Isaac's working on at the moment.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tina Marie: Hmm. I would imagine that as big as they are, that they would.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Tina Marie: It'd be all hands on deck and solved.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
mark sweet: I think it's more lidify issue because there's no report incidents with salesforce. So.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Tina Marie: Pretty quickly.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I was gonna say, salesforce is not down.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah, so it's lidify.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Tina Marie: Are, your.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
mark sweet: Who tried to push. Some update that broke everything, because.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
mark sweet: You know, when you push updates stuff breaks.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it does.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Tina Marie: An update on their end.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Tina Marie: One. Feel a rollback coming in your future.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, let's see. Okay, so the leads are looking. I mean, retainers. Looking good for the month. So far.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And axe. I know this one. It's.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
mark sweet: That was acting.com. We kind of took a risk on one.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um, what kind of case is it? You said risk on on that one. So it's not a great case, probably.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000
mark sweet: And then. Yeah, let me look at the details. I just remember it was like one. It's kind of on the fence like it's not great, but it could be, okay.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
mark sweet: And there's a rib fracture which is decent. Um, but they said like.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
mark sweet: A car backed into them at full speed, which. Generally doesn't happen. Also, our.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
mark sweet: Client has no insurance. But the defendant was Dui.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
mark sweet: Apparently. So. We're hoping there's insurance on defendant. But it's not like the uh.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
mark sweet: Greatest case.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so Walker, total 7. 13.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Tina Marie: Total, no. Yeah.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Tina Marie: Where's the majority of them? 11 blue steel dots.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Tina Marie: Devin right.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
mark sweet: No, that's quantify.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Tina Marie: No! This! What?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
mark sweet: Quantify.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Um wait. Oh, Devin's valiant, though.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Quantify nice. Um 5 returning clients. Cool.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Tina Marie: It's looking good. I hope it keeps. Going.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
mark sweet: Yeah. The returning clients and the employee referrals are kind of big enough for lower doctor referrals.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, I wasn't even looking at the doctor referral. So it's good.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
mark sweet: We've gotten some referrals. Just the cases haven't been. Quality from them.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Tina Marie: And do you feel like you've been on your doctor referral game like really reaching out to people.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah. And they all just got their gift boxes.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh, nice! Well, hopefully, that'll get some returns. So did you get the text reply. I sent you to the um touch bar. Um. Text.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
mark sweet: So yeah, there's like 4 problems with it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
mark sweet: But it did go through. But there's like 4 problems.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Tina Marie: Which ones are the ones. What problems do you see?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
mark sweet: Uh, it's coming from an 8, 3, 3 number.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Tina Marie: Not your number?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
mark sweet: Nope. It's coming from 8, 3, 3, 6, 2, 8.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Oh, yeah, cause that would have, said Mark sweet, though.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
mark sweet: 1, 7, 2, 3. Um, and then it also has a reply. Stop to unsubscribe at the bottom.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that was, I was like, that's not cool.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
mark sweet: And then it also just says, Sweet lowers under my name, which.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Dan Ryan: Uh no, so the reply, stop is legal. Can't remove it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Tina Marie: So that kind of makes this a moot point, because that makes it not look personal.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Dan Ryan: Or you want me to stop.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
mark sweet: Can we break the law and not have it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Dan Ryan: No, it's bake, it's baked in. You can't remove it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
mark sweet: Okay. Oh!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
mark sweet: That's a problem.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Dan Ryan: All right. Well. The the life and death of Touchbot was short.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
mark sweet: It was a long, glorious, short life.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
mark sweet: It was a it was a bright candle. But yeah, that's gonna kill it for me.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Spill my water.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, then the I don't know how you would do that. Then you would need like. I don't think.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
mark sweet: Didn't you check a box saying that they already subscribed to it?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Dan Ryan: Camp.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's literally like we don't. We can't even affect. What it says.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
mark sweet: Then I think this is.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Dan Ryan: Now look into it, but I know I mean I know it's in every 1st message. And then it never shows up again.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no, I mean, I I.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
mark sweet: Understand, the. Normal way of doing it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
mark sweet: I'm just wondering how we can. Not do it that way.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Dan Ryan: I wonder? I wonder if Mm. Cause we're not. I mean we. We're.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Dan Ryan: Because you're never really sending it from your phone. So you're always piggybacking on twilio. Uh! I'll I'll I'll dig into it.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
mark sweet: Unless there's some macro to make it go for my phone. But. I don't think so.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Dan Ryan: Right, you'd have to do something like that. But Apple definitely would not allow that.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
mark sweet: I don't see Apple allowing that, and I'm not about to switch to Android.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
mark sweet: Okay. Well, uh, that kills that one.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Tina Marie: So neither one of you are looking at the screen right.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
mark sweet: I mean, that is totally right like, that's what you have to do. We're just trying to see if there's.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Tina Marie: You know.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
mark sweet: Some way to cheat it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Tina Marie: That's weird. Well, so with before, yeah. But before I put an iphone.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, that's what we're doing. We're.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Tina Marie: This is what the response was. Yeah. But anyway, so there's no.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Tina Marie: Need a 3rd party. Toyo. Bye-bye.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tina Marie: Well, uh! You can hire a monkey.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Dan Ryan: Uh! You know what you could do.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
mark sweet: And my phone to America.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Dan Ryan: You would send everyone a message from sweet Law. And then they all would have gotten the 1st message.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Dan Ryan: And then you start doing it as mark.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Tina Marie: I like that. But are you sure every subsequent message doesn't have to have a opt out.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Dan Ryan: I I literally got the message today. I don't have it.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
mark sweet: No, it's just not the 1st one.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Dan Ryan: Because I was the. I was the test case.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Dan Ryan: That's why, when you guys said it, I'm like, what are you talking about? That isn't in there. But that's because I've already been messaged.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Oh!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Tina Marie: So we just need to think of a message that they would not opt out of.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Dan Ryan: Well, if they opt out, they opt out, but.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Tina Marie: Well, yeah, but. We also probably don't want a big percentage of opting out.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Tina Marie: For 2 reasons. Number one, we want it to work. Number 2. I would imagine that there's. Um something.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Tina Marie: Relatable to a sender score for texting.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I guess the other bit would be. Can we send a message and then switch it to Mark's phone number? So the 1st message goes out from the 8. Whatever.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Dan Ryan: And then you switch you switch the bot inside the thing to start using a different number. Will that. It should. I think it will, because it's really sending it through the original number.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Tina Marie: Trigger.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Dan Ryan: And it's just printing Mark's number as the return number.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Tina Marie: So do you need a reminder to go try that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay, let me send that to you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Dan Ryan: Why?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Tina Marie: Oh, CC. Stacy.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And you would just send like a general message that's like, Hey, this is a text from sweet law. You know. Uh, it's just a way for us to communicate with you in the future in case of emergency, or whatever.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Dan Ryan: You know we we won't be texting you normally. Something like that. To get them to, not update.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
mark sweet: Or for events and parties, or something like that.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, like, yeah, yeah, totally.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
mark sweet: So it makes more fun.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Dan Ryan: If you want your gift basket in the future, don't opt out. Bitches.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
mark sweet: I don't think we should say that in writing, but um.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I was gonna say.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, that's the that's the tone we're looking for.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so. You're gonna craft that message, mark.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I can do that.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Tina Marie: Do you need a reminder.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
mark sweet: Probably.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Tina Marie: Alright! I'm a CC. Dan. So when you reply it will go to him.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
mark sweet: So I got a new toy for Dan.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Dan Ryan: New? What.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
mark sweet: Toy.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, what's that?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:18.000
mark sweet: So selco. Forced. I don't know. Anyway, we are doing this thing where we get the back page of a magazine don't really care that much about it. It would be great if it turned into something from that alone.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:32.000
mark sweet: But we can push whatever we want to their website. The reason it's good. It's called city lifestyle. Um, so it's 1 of those magazines they like hand out.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
mark sweet: To businesses and. Waiting rooms, and whatever else.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
mark sweet: But from an SEO standpoint we can push whatever we want, ie. Death blogs onto their.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Dan Ryan: Uh-huh.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
mark sweet: Website which is recognized by Google as a legitimate journal source.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Dan Ryan: Who? Who is this?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:01.000
mark sweet: Dude's name is Brandon Farmer um. But it's the nationwide thing is called city lifestyle.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Dan Ryan: What? Yeah. So this is like the Steve.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Dan Ryan: No, the canvas.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
mark sweet: This is just like that. Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
mark sweet: Yes, this is la weekly, but.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
mark sweet: Whatever it is. But this one is nationwide instead of just local. Um, the newspaper.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
mark sweet: Back that we bought is local.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000
mark sweet: But what I'm saying is overall that their website is nationwide. So theoretically, if we see. Somehow from an SEO perspective.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
mark sweet: It's literally like. 3 grand a month. It's not a huge amount.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.000
mark sweet: For their printed stuff on the back. We don't have to buy an entire back cover. We can just buy like a quarter of a page or something moving forward as long as we still have access to.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000
mark sweet: Posting on their online. Portals uh. So this could be something that would be kind of cool if it works to be able to do on multiple of these smaller publications.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Gotcha.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000
mark sweet: Especially if we start finding ones that are. Let's just say, you know, Colorado specific or Washington specific. To push those.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
mark sweet: Death blogs for those States. To those channels.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
mark sweet: And should give us a nice pop locally.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Tina Marie: Did you say how much it cost? I forgot.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:25.000
mark sweet: It was like 3 grand a month. But that was to buy the whole back page. So if we're only buying, let's say, like a quarter of a page, I think it's like.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
mark sweet: 1,500 1,800, something like that.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Dan Ryan: And then you can push stuff to that like, did they say, how.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000
mark sweet: Uh, I just forward you, the you guys, the email we used to log in. But I'm not a thousand percent sure. And I'm sure each one's gonna have a little bit of a different.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
mark sweet: In my experience. It's mostly been you log in, and you can like post whatever blog you want.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Dan Ryan: I'll look at it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
mark sweet: Uh! But if that works it could be. Super cool.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Tina Marie: Well, it definitely falls in line with diversification. Uh, so that we can.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Tina Marie: Not be reliant on any one, or 2, or 3, or whatever amount of sources, because they all. Vacillate. I guess that's not the word, really. But you know what I mean.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
mark sweet: Yes, yes, it.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Tina Marie: Evan blow. So when does that go live?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000
mark sweet: Uh now, Ish, we have to give them our. Uh creatives, I think, either by the 20th or 25.th

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:56.000
mark sweet: Um pay like $50 a month to have them help us with it. I again I don't really care what's on the back. I don't see the magazine driving a lot of business now that I don't want to give something that looks half decent, but.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
mark sweet: Um to me. This is way more of an SEO play.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Tina Marie: You don't have any. People on staff to create creatives? Do they have people? You can hire.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
mark sweet: For like $50 a month, they'll put it together. But. You know honestly a chat. Gbt. Which.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
mark sweet: Is probably just as good as a basic. Creative agency. At this point.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Uh. The only thing, maybe, is just like a good, the good, a good image. Um, but having it.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Tina Marie: Uh, if you have it, say, if you say you know, what would Jean Schwartz say? I should have as an image for this. Or some of the other advertisers, but.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Tina Marie: Gene's a good start for it, except for his stuff, wasn't. Internet based. Dan, do you have like? What could we use as a reference to say, Chat Gbt, help me choose um the image. I should go look for like in a, you know, adobe images, or whatever stock images.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Tina Marie: Based off of. Um modern like current.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Tina Marie: Data, on. Because, like statistically, the latest that I know of is basically, if there's 1st of all, there should be smiling faces.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Tina Marie: They should be looking at you, but then. Within the context of what's actually happening.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Tina Marie: Um. And and then we how do? You can't even really split test that. So you really want to get it good from the beginning.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
mark sweet: Cause. We have a bunch of photos and stuff we took when we made the.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Tina Marie: Dear.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000
mark sweet: How is it the Led Gorilla lighting people. So we've got a lot of like Sam and Tyler, and whatever else that we can cycle through.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I'd really be interested in finding a way that we could run a internal test on.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Tina Marie: In engagement between pictures of you guys smiling and not smiling. Because that conversation that we had about your hero image. I don't want to make assumptions, but.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Tina Marie: Anything where we're using images. And it's on your website. I don't know what ads are done. If anything that has pictures. But it would be good to know what gets more clicks, smiling or not smiling. Every other niche.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Tina Marie: Pretty, much smiling. But it may not hold true for law.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
mark sweet: And.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Tina Marie: Could we run some kind of. Low, cost, simple thing, only just really for that test.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Tina Marie: Um. Trying to think what what we can do.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Tina Marie: Cause. Um? Do we run any visual ads.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Dan Ryan: Don't run any ads. I mean, we just run.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Tina Marie: Well, yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Dan Ryan: We just run brand ads on. Google.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Dan Ryan: No images, no banners, no nothing.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Tina Marie: Could we do something? That is. Relatively low enough budget just to get this data.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, I'm not sure what we're testing here. What are we testing. Date on.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Tina Marie: Imagery? Does it. Does like, whether it be for the website or any creative, that he goes and creates out.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Tina Marie: Creates like like this to go put in a magazine that's just going to live there, and we can't really split. Test. It. Does do people interact better with the smiling version of Sweetlaw or the, you know, we look tough and nobody's smiling.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Dan Ryan: Um. I mean, I don't know how you would necessarily.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Dan Ryan: Test, that.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Tina Marie: Can we just do a. So we don't actually need it to give us quality leads. We just need to know what gets engaged with more. But could we do some kind of display ad. For a month, and just the only split test is.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Tina Marie: Between the images, and see what gets more engagement.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Dan Ryan: What's engagement?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Tina Marie: Well, maybe it's filling out a form, something that would. Validate the test to a degree.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Tina Marie: Because it's not really going to be. I don't know.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like the. The like. If it's a magazine ad, right? There is no click. So it's like, how would you.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Tina Marie: Could we go like handpick? Maybe there are. Blogs that would be relevant, and we could say, Hey, we want to run, display ads, but only on these blogs.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Tina Marie: And only on these sites. That maybe are.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Tina Marie: Indirectly related. Um.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Tina Marie: Like I don't know. Someplace where families would congregate.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Tina Marie: Like maybe a genealogy blog, or like a.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Dan Ryan: So what is the pitch? What are we even pitching right? So like.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Tina Marie: It. It could just be got injured. It could be in a literal actual ad for um.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Dan Ryan: No, I mean in the magazine like, is there? What is the pay? What is the is the magazine? Just a brand play, is it a.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Dan Ryan: Got injured like? What? What is the. What was the proposed pitch? If any.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Dan Ryan: And then what did they say? I mean the other. Why, why this magazine? Why did you pick this.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Dan Ryan: Selco. I thought I heard his name earlier. How is Selco?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's like one of his buddies, and it's not an insane expense to try for a year. But I was more excited from the SEO perspective than anything else.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Dan Ryan: Alright. I need to go. Look at the. But it's it's a literally a physical magazine.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Dan Ryan: As well as these websites.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
mark sweet: So there's 2 things. There's a physical magazine. Like if you've ever been in a doctor room right or.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:27.000
mark sweet: Whatever where they're like the local magazine of mostly ads, and like. Here's the top 10 realtors, and whatever um like, they're lifestyle magazines for lack of a better term.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I went to. I mean, did I go to the wrong website? There is no website.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
mark sweet: For city life.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, maybe I typed it in wrong. I was like. Yeah, no, there's no website like, there's a.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Dan Ryan: Find local content like am I supposed to freaking? Go in.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
mark sweet: All right. City lifestyle.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, I went. I got it. Good grief.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
mark sweet: Uh-huh.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. Yeah.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Tina Marie: Wait? Why does it.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Dan Ryan: Sure.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Tina Marie: It comes up when I click on it. But not when I.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I spelled city with a I that's right.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, Lord! This thing's a shit show. None of it worked.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Tina Marie: So what kind of stats did they give you? And why was Saco interested in it? How didn't he suggest it?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
mark sweet: It's 1 of his buddies.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Dan Ryan: Program. It's program. That's all. This.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Tina Marie: One of his buddies.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
mark sweet: One of his buddies just bought it because they sell nice to like local people. Oh, like hey! Look how much more you can get.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
mark sweet: By running your own newspaper company.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Dan Ryan: This doesn't work.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Tina Marie: What Dan?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Dan Ryan: It doesn't work. I'm like in Chula Vista, and I click on everything, and every page is blank. It wants to load something, but it won't.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Dan Ryan: It's got some janky ass, Jquery, content thing. It looks like. Oh, boy!

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Tina Marie: Newport Beach, California. No results found, no publications found.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:14.000
mark sweet: I mean Arizona. They got Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Scottsdale, Surprise, Tempe, Tucson. Got bend Oregon.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, no. It looks like they just have a. Uh um.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Dan Ryan: Dynamic like. You look up your zip code here, we're gonna see.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
mark sweet: Or if you go down the bottom, you can look at the magazines. You can see every.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Dan Ryan: The site is fucked.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
mark sweet: Want to start a publication, you can.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Dan Ryan: It's not indexed in Google.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
mark sweet: What?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Don't give them any money.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
mark sweet: Well, it's a little late for that, but.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Dan Ryan: Uh.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
mark sweet: Here we are!

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, literally. It. The only page that's indexed is their homepage. There is no sub pages indexed in Google, none. So this has 0 reach.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Tina Marie: These are issue. Um. Magazines.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Tina Marie: Which is its own publication.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, Selco.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Tina Marie: Digital magazine, store.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Dan Ryan: How did you let your buddy buy this.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000

Dan Ryan: Yeah, so this is. Their their blogs are not. Yeah, their blogs are not indexed.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Tina Marie: Cookie Bot sorry.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
mark sweet: I mean, if I look up city lifestyle.com and see everything that's been posted in the last. Month. There's a lot of.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Dan Ryan: Right if you do a Google Dork, search my new favorite term.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Dan Ryan: For in URL Colon city lifestyle.com. There's nothing indexed. So while they have content.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Dan Ryan: On the site. It's not on Google doesn't know about it. So like you want. Slash chula vista, slash Newport slash blah blah!

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Dan Ryan: Like none of that's indexed. Yeah, it's good stuff.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
mark sweet: Okay, well, let's figure out to make the most of it. Or it's just another cycle of paper.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Dan Ryan: Or or tell Salka's buddy. How to get a site indexed.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Dan Ryan: Because it dexable. Sure, it's indexable.

Tina Marie: Yeah. Go teach him how to make money so he can make you money and be like.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Dan Ryan: I thought crazy.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Dan Ryan: Let's not talk crazy. Let's just get it indexed like, Hey.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Tina Marie: Alright!

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Dan Ryan: Let's go see if they have a robot text file. Let's get. It's get all nerdy.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Dan Ryan: Well, it's not text. Nope, oh, boy!

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Tina Marie: Well, that's a basic SEO thing. So. Yeah.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Dan Ryan: Here. You want me to draft an email that you can send Mark, and you'll look like a fucking genius. You'll be like the.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
mark sweet: Okay. I'm I'm good with that.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. I'll do.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
mark sweet: Then I can tone it down to.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, you can run it through. Chat, b, chat, gpt, and say, D Dan, this.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
mark sweet: So.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Dan Ryan: It will be like all this sarcasm and swearing, got it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
mark sweet: That would be cool.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: Did you just say what would be cool? That's funny.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Dan Ryan: Now I the print magazine looks nice. Is it real? Though I'm not even sure it's real. Look like a thrill.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
mark sweet: No, it is real, but.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Dan Ryan: They're putting out an issue in all of these cities.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
mark sweet: I don't expect to generate a lot.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Dan Ryan: That can't. That's crazy or no, probably not. They're probably just putting a new cover on the Pdf. Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, sure.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
mark sweet: Look, these are not hard to do.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, no, not now. It's easier than ever.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Dan Ryan: Alright! But yeah, I'll log into their thing, too. And.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Dan Ryan: Poke around. And then we can tell them how broken their shit is.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Dan Ryan: Mhm.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Tina Marie: Dan has owned the case.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
mark sweet: This is Dan's favorite thing to do.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Dan Ryan: It is. Let me tell you how you do.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Tina Marie: Tell. Call bullshit on people is Dan's favorite thing to do, and then prove why it's bullshit.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
mark sweet: And tell them they're idiots and doing everything. Yep, this is Dan's thing.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I'm gonna say. But.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Dan Ryan: Is Andrea.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
mark sweet: Uh, the broker is working on the get paid, not played. So I'll keep you updated on that. But I haven't heard anything back.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: Let me go update that.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
mark sweet: But the more I see it the more I talk about, the more I like it. So good job, Dan.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Dan Ryan: I really didn't do much, but sure. I just bought. I just got Greg Greg. Everyone loves Greg.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Dan Ryan: I love Greg. I want to go visit Greg in Poland. I need to make that like a business trip. I need to approve this logo in person.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
mark sweet: But the question, then is. So Colorado I had.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:13.000
mark sweet: Way too long of a discussion with the attorney. Um, we're getting closer to be able to launch it. We're not quite clear yet. But probably 2, 3 weeks away. Um, just some changes. We gotta make.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
mark sweet: Uh.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Tina Marie: What was that about a Colorado, though. I missed the 1st part.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
mark sweet: Colorado is our new State.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, because.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
mark sweet: Uh, we have to go through ethics attorneys 1st to make sure everything looks good. Like, we have to change one thing on our website.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Tina Marie: Who's.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
mark sweet: We can't put success rate. We have to put 99% of cases.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
mark sweet: Settled or won a trial.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Dan Ryan: That. Did you already send that over, or we're doing this right now?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
mark sweet: Uh, I'll send it over. But we just had a conversation like.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
mark sweet: Not very long ago.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Dan Ryan: Got it. Got it.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Tina Marie: Um! Hold on! Great did I put this in here.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: Who's working in Colorado.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
mark sweet: I me. Sam.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I don't remember who.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah, both of us are licensed there.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Tina Marie: Can. That's in my a different. I should just put that in this document. So I don't have to ask that question.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Tina Marie: Where. I do?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Tina Marie: It's just over here. Mark and Samantha.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
mark sweet: But you gotta go through like all the process stuff.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Tina Marie: Right, first.st

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:39.000
mark sweet: First, st which is always a pain in the ass, but. You know it's fine. I'd rather make sure everything's done right. And this is a decent, decent ethics. Attorney.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
mark sweet: Um, so he kinda he gets it. At least.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Tina Marie: You hired the ethics attorney. Now. You've got that one here.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
mark sweet: We hired him last week. But yeah, or 2 weeks ago, whatever he cause, he's got to review the retainer. The website.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yeah. Right.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
mark sweet: Uh all that kind of stuff.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Tina Marie: And then, once once that's done, you'll start ads or. You know whatever with vendors. Okay.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Well, we'll start with Walker and go from there.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
mark sweet: So yeah, we'll be, look at that going.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Tina Marie: Nice. Okay, where are we at with the Devin conversation, then? And.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
mark sweet: No, but sorry, so the reason I was bringing that up is.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Tina Marie: Alright!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:31.000
mark sweet: The winner. It's free. We may want to. Um. 2 traditional billboards and stuff in Colorado, because it's a new state. Sweet James, isn't there at all?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
mark sweet: Um. Not that that matters, but.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
mark sweet: Yeah, to make any sense.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Dan Ryan: No.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
mark sweet: Okay, uh, it may just be one that we would want to start with the smaller state.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Dan Ryan: Proving ground.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
mark sweet: That we can try billboards and bus benches with this winner. It's free.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Dan Ryan: Gotcha.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
mark sweet: But any people able to find it when they Google it still. So yeah.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Dan Ryan: Ah, right? So you need. We need to get the site built and then indexed. Indexing is this thing you do with Google? Oh.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
mark sweet: I don't know what this is.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Dan Ryan: I'll show you all. I'll show you all about it later.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
mark sweet: Okay. But am I saying.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: But it's not even built yet.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Dan Ryan: No, we got the design, and then.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
mark sweet: No.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Dan Ryan: And if there's any other feedback that you guys have, if not, I'm just gonna go back to and be like, Hey, get rid of the images and. Then we need to start writing content, basically around those blocks or.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Dan Ryan: I can write some initial contact with Grok or Gpt, or whatever. Send it over, and then.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Dan Ryan: Will roll, and he's. I don't think he's busy right now.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Tina Marie: Who Greg.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Tina Marie: Wait, so are we finished with the design.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Dan Ryan: That's what I just asked. Yeah. So if you guys have additional. Design feedback. I'm going back and saying, Get rid of the images.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Dan Ryan: That's the only thing that I didn't like.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Tina Marie: Right. You said that last week. Um.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Tina Marie: The thing I reply to is. So you don't wanna like, do you want to get rid of them completely? Do we need to replace them.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Tina Marie: Uh! One of the things I said is like you could just do like a filter overlay to put the like. I don't know. Make them fall within the color parameters, or we could cartoonize those images, or do we just get rid of them? And then I didn't see a reply. But that's where we need to finish the conversation. Are we just getting rid of them or replacing them? And how are we replacing them.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Dan Ryan: Replacing.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Dan Ryan: We need the click through and the.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Dan Ryan: Whatever, so I can have him, I can say, Hey, give me these options. And then we can pick the options so we can do an overlay of a current image with.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Dan Ryan: Colors that are from the thing. We can do my thing, which I can't really describe, but he'll get it when I describe it to him.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Dan Ryan: And I'll send them screenshots. And then whatever, if there's another option, mine's kind of like a.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Dan Ryan: Or and we could do like an icon thing. So there's there's sort of. Which would be like your cartoonization right? So it would be like, try to come up with.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Dan Ryan: A unique icon for each one. Which he he can definitely do.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, but I'll just be like, Hey, do 1 1, 1 do one of an overlay, one of my thing, one of an icon.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Dan Ryan: And then we just pick from one of the 3. And then I'll be like, Hey, if you could come up with something, throw in a 4th one. Then, whatever.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Dan Ryan: But if there's nothing other than that. Then we'll do that, and then but we, if the general blocks layout is fine, then we can start doing content around that layout.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Dan Ryan: That was our goal was to say, yes, that's the right blocks.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay, so Mark, can you pull that up and see if you have any other things to say? Hello, sir!

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
mark sweet: Okay, hold on. Sorry.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I think, because there's so much black in those images. The overlay won't really work well.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Dan Ryan: I just don't think the images work. In in general with the Vibe.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Dan Ryan: Like a clash. It's like me. But he just did what I said.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Dan Ryan: Put pull it right from the site, and then I just want to see. That if the flow worked, flow works just not that.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
mark sweet: I mean, it looks a lot like our. Current site. Obvious. I'm not gonna get into like.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Tina Marie: Right, but you don't want. If.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
mark sweet: I don't know. Some of these would.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Tina Marie: So his issue is that it doesn't work with the vibe of the rest of the energy right? This is, this is like. I don't know. It's it's shock.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Tina Marie: You know, whereas winners free is almost like lighthearted. It's. A completely different energy.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Tina Marie: Like you're focusing on. Um, the.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Tina Marie: I don't have to pay for this. Versus um. Just the pain of what you've been through. I don't know.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Tina Marie: They feel differently. Let me do this.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Tina Marie: I wonder! It's probably too much. But oh, wait.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Tina Marie: See what Chatgp can do. Gpt can do. If I screenshot all of those images.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Tina Marie: Like the whole section. There. Let's see. Hang on!

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Tina Marie: File. And actually, I wanna give it the whole.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Tina Marie: The whole thing. Scrolling.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Tina Marie: You still looking at it, Mark.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Tina Marie: I'll work on this while you do that.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
mark sweet: I mean for me. The whole thing is really. About what's above the fold. If you will.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
mark sweet: Because that's really where people are. Looking and spending time.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Tina Marie: You still want continuity through the whole thing, or.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
mark sweet: Correct. No, no, it goes dark very quickly.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Tina Marie: Because if don't you create friction. Yeah, well, there's also, just psychologically.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Tina Marie: If there isn't continuity there. Becomes this internal.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Tina Marie: Conflict mentally, whether it's conscious or subconscious. And that stops people.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Tina Marie: And creates friction, and anytime you do that, you conversions drop. Quickly, because even if they can't figure out why they feel a disconnect, they feel a disconnect, and they can bounce.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:38.000
mark sweet: Got it also. Um, well, we're not really at that stage yet. But photos, I mean, I would just do checks money like our big settlements way up on top.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah, but.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
mark sweet: You gave me like 10 million dollar check, 10 million dollar check. 11 million dollar check.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Dan Ryan: But do that? Where.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
mark sweet: Somewhere above a fold. Right. We're going the whole lottery like, hey? You want a lottery like, here's your big ass check.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Dan Ryan: Uh and use. But what are the what are. These are literal photographs. What? What are we gonna.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
mark sweet: No, we're we're making checks. If you will, because these are cases that we've.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
mark sweet: Settled like we've we've gotten these. They're not. Yes.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Dan Ryan: Well, when you say above the folder you're looking at on Mobile.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
mark sweet: No, I'm looking at it on desktop.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Dan Ryan: It should be. You gotta go mobile first.st Yeah.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, cause it's the majority of your traffic.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Dan Ryan: If they're on a billboard, or whatever. Their mobile.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Dan Ryan: So it's like, okay.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Ah! These are not.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Tina Marie: Oh, one of those is good! The only one that's good is ride, share.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Tina Marie: Um the rest. Alright!

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Tina Marie: I thought. Wanna screen share again.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Tina Marie: Share. What do you call it?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Tina Marie: These are so lame.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah. The general concept is good. But we definitely need to lean into the.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
mark sweet: When it's free. Also I need an exclamation or not. Exclamation, um! A star! Next to it. Because we have to explain that it's our attorney's fees. Are.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
mark sweet: Free if we don't win uh.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Dan Ryan: Star next to the logo.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
mark sweet: But. Yeah, unfortunately.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. Wonder if we could just bake it into the Logos.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Dan Ryan: Make one of the dots an asterisk. Or no, I guess we could just put it right above it.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Tina Marie: This is the 1st version.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Dan Ryan: That's fine!

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Tina Marie: It's terrible. But I do like this part right here. Kind of it's a cop car. So not that. But.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. But we could get if we could get.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Tina Marie: And it probably work better with single ones, and a much better prompt which could be engineered. But we could get some images that work that match the color scheme.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Tina Marie: These are so bad. But I do think, I I think that with some good prompting we could get images that that do work.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Tina Marie: I think what we would do is break it down kind of one at a time. Then to. Create the the pattern of the prompt, and then say, Okay, now do it for this. Now do it for this, and so on.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Tina Marie: And tell it what components we like out of it. It would take a little bit, but it would. Um. It's going to take a little bit, anyway, going to find any images that actually work.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Tina Marie: Well. Take some time.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Tina Marie: If you've ever tried to search for stock photos, there's just. A lot of garbage.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Dan Ryan: What we should do is just go get a stock photo of someone holding a big check. And then turn it into a winner. It's free check and use that.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Dan Ryan: So put one. Put that in the hero.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Dan Ryan: Which there's tons of those. And then Greg can just stylize the check to be.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Dan Ryan: Winter. It's free colors.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.000
mark sweet: Cause you can. We can do some like, see some of our recent winners or. Wins something like that. Does that make any sense.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Dan Ryan: Well in the hero image. You're gonna have one big one, right? So it's almost like.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Dan Ryan: It's almost like what could you? I mean? I guess you could. They can hold a check, or they can just be holding a white card.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Dan Ryan: But it's like. If that were the image on the billboard, and then they go right. You have to.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Dan Ryan: From an adsent perspective. It's like on the billboard they're holding the big check. And then on the website, it's the same image.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Dan Ryan: And then just more right. But. On the billboard. You have limited real estate and call to action. Right? So you have the logo, and then you have the tagline. Then you have the check.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Dan Ryan: And then maybe it's like, you know, car accident victim, whatever you you're calling out like the. The pain.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Dan Ryan: Then they go to the website. It's like they see that again. Which is what Fung does.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Dan Ryan: And then but and then they look. It's then the rest of the website is like, Learn more. So then you could have. Other other winners, and.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Dan Ryan: Whatever, and then how it works, and then what else we do, and then. The practice areas.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Dan Ryan: Totally, so I'll see if I can get. I'll have him do that, and then. See what that looks like, and then.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Dan Ryan: He could. Then you're going to create more of those. And then eventually they'd be real people, real clients.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Dan Ryan: Cause. Then you'll have to asterisk that and say not a real client, I'm sure.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
mark sweet: Or we could just have pictures that checks themselves, maybe not even have a person that way. We don't run into any issue.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Dan Ryan: Do that. Yeah. I mean, we can come up with the check. That's a standalone thing. Yep, totally. But and but then you have to probably like.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
mark sweet: Blue team.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Dan Ryan: It's all fake names. So you're gonna have to probably be like this is not a.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
mark sweet: No, we just do like pedestrian versus auto, or whatever it may be. We don't actually put a person's name.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, okay. Okay, so I'll have him work on both. So the check would be a standalone thing that he then overlays onto a.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Dan Ryan: Stock photo, or later, a future real photo.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Tina Marie: You guys still are not looking at the screen right?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Dan Ryan: And then we'll have a giant check printed out to put on the wall behind your desk.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
mark sweet: We've had a giant one at 1 point just no one ever comes in.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, well. Wasn't purple and yellow, though.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Tina Marie: They got a big old yellow check right here.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Dan Ryan: I was gonna cancel my stock photo account today, but it looks like I'll be using it one more time.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
mark sweet: One last time.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, big checks are us.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Big bright yellow check.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. Where are we at? Okay? So when arts free.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Tina Marie: Content SEO. Whoops. Okay?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Tina Marie: Need to replace the images. 1, 2, face, images.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: Today's the 17.th Dan is going to.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Tina Marie: Give great feedback. Or next revision.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Tina Marie: Alright um for the content. Who's working? Who who should be working on that.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Dan Ryan: I'll do it.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Content. Mr. Dan.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Tina Marie: When do you want to have something back to show us.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Dan Ryan: There really isn't a lot of content if you scroll through the page. So. I would just need Mark's help with like.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Dan Ryan: Ah! The old way versus new way, like. Can we define those steps? Granted, the number of steps might be wrong, and I know the 9 months is sort of the target.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Dan Ryan: But the idea is that there is an old way that. Or a way, not with suite law that's going to take longer and then get a.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Dan Ryan: Less of a good result. And then the sweet law way is whatever, and you could, or the win over 3 way is. Whether it's 6, 5, 4, whatever, however many steps it is, and then we just define those steps for each.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Dan Ryan: That's probably the most. Difficult part of the whole page, the rest is.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Dan Ryan: It's a couple paragraphs.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I mean, I think the old way we talk about like you go into a law office. You sit there and wait for an attorney to show up.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Dan Ryan: Exactly.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:27.000
mark sweet: Is ready to send you paperwork in the mail, you know, just basically like Old Man Law firm looking. Because I learned the largest advertiser. And Colorado is apparently Dick. According to the ethics, Dude is Frank Azar, A. ZAR.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
mark sweet: Who's known as the Strong arm you can trust.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, God! He's the double chin! You can't miss.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
mark sweet: He's got a big ass freaking firm.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Dan Ryan: He's got a big ass frigging face.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Tina Marie: Whoa!

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, my God! Frank.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: That's 33 attorneys.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Dan Ryan: Dang! That's a lot.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
mark sweet: That's a lot.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Dan Ryan: For pre-lit right. I don't see any.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
mark sweet: I don't know. He's a billboard firm, so like.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, this site is definitely pre-lit. But.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.000
mark sweet: Who the knows but. Also just assume this photo is about 1520 years old. So just.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Dan Ryan: Of course. Yeah.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Dan Ryan: I love how he throws class action in there. It's like, Do you really do, class? Oh, he does do class act.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:20.000
mark sweet: Yeah, everyone does class action. But if you Google, his name and go to images, I mean, you can see what some of his billboards look like.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
mark sweet: They're nothing special.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Dan Ryan: Now, Omar, I could see as the strong arm Frank. Not so much.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
mark sweet: But I do like.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Tina Marie: So judgy.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Dan Ryan: No. Have you seen Omar?

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Dan Ryan: Omar's jacked.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
mark sweet: No, Omar's like bodybuilder dude who's still at I don't know. 60. Something can compete.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Dan Ryan: Ridiculous.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Tina Marie: What's his last name now? I wanna see.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, harves.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Dan Ryan: His suits have to be made for him, because his biceps are so big.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Tina Marie: That's not.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Dan Ryan: They're like, ridiculously big. They're like. They're like a small man's thighs.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Tina Marie: Ajs are bigger. I think.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Dan Ryan: Aj.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.000
mark sweet: Okay, regardless. He's a big ass. Dude. I I think we're on the same page. Don't spend a ton of time on this.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, moving on.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Frank's just got yeah, totally.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Tina Marie: Winner. It's free content. So you need to get with Mark. Um about this. So my question was.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Tina Marie: And you said Big Face, and my brain just went. Anyway. Due date. Um. Do, will you? Do you want to have something to show us next week week after.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I kind of like Frank's billboard here. Ah, it's not up to me. I submitted to Greg, and then but we can ask you if you ask him for.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Dan Ryan: But when?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
mark sweet: If you want to watch the video of him, I just sent it to you. He's doing a. Billboard, Design, Contest.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Dan Ryan: Really.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
mark sweet: And this is plus in 2023. So you can see what he looks like in 2023.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Dan Ryan: Crowdsourcing design. I love it.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
mark sweet: As he's lustfully staring at the girl.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, but yeah, so I'll send that stuff, Greg or Stacy will, and I'll just tell her to say, ask him when he thinks he'll be done. He's usually very accurate.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Tina Marie: Did you send it to me, too.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
mark sweet: It's in the group. Chat.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Dan Ryan: She did the chat.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, like in zoom.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Dan Ryan: I think we can.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Tina Marie: Why is he having? Oh, designing his billboard.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Dan Ryan: I think we can borrow from Frank's billboard. Actually. I like it.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
mark sweet: This is the swag that you can buy.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Dan Ryan: So what's so interesting is then his website is not those colors. I'm like, Frank, what are you doing. Come on, Buddy, tie it together.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Dan Ryan: Getting a little better call Saul Vibe often, too, so. I'm a big fan.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000
mark sweet: Oh, and he sued a former employee. Cool. Okay. Anyway. Um, he's apparently the big fish there, so we gotta take him out.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Tina Marie: Where's where is this? Where is he? At?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Dan Ryan: All of Colorado.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Tina Marie: That's that's a Colorado is very much a good old boy, kind of. Territory, though.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:45.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I was worried about that one a little bit, too. So we're gonna piss off some people. Uh, which means we don't launch anything until ethics training for using gives me a thumbs up because I'm gonna need a shield because I can almost guarantee you, someone is gonna.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
mark sweet: Kind of complain against us.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Dan Ryan: No. Yeah.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Tina Marie: You need to go, be there physically and find somebody who has roots outside of Colorado. That like has.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Tina Marie: I don't know is not anti-california. And get your toe in the door that way.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
mark sweet: It doesn't matter, because.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Tina Marie: Because.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:13.000
mark sweet: It. Unless I'm taking over a large billboard firm which generally most people in Colorado aren't gonna like what.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
mark sweet: It doesn't matter because anyone who it's a crime mentality in these smaller states.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. It's not just that.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
mark sweet: We've seen it in New Mexico. We've seen it in. Missouri to some level.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Tina Marie: Everybody hates California, especially in the Midwest or the South. So.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Tina Marie: Is there? Yeah, just. Them, not knowing that you're a California farmer.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
mark sweet: I mean, they're gonna see it when they go onto our website. But they wanna ask them from the East coast.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tina Marie: Are you from the east coast.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah. From Jersey.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Tina Marie: You. How long have you been in California? Though? Because that accent is barely there.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000
mark sweet: A long time. You'll hear on forest.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
mark sweet: Orange, chocolate.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I've always been trying to be like, what is this? But California people are harder because a lot of them are imports from other places living in a melting pot, probably from a melting pot. So it's never super.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Tina Marie: Clear. You've been there a long time.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Okay. So you guys are, gonna get together and create the content. When will you get together on that.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Dan Ryan: Email.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Tina Marie: Email. Okay. So I'm gonna say, you have something to report next week.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Tina Marie: Week. What would be that like the 23, rd or something. Calendar, 24.th

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Tina Marie: 3, 24. 25.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:03.000
mark sweet: Remember Bill Houser introduced me some dude in Colorado who didn't want to work, you know. Spend half his time in Italy. He was doing some.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000
mark sweet: Some billboards there, but I can't. Find him in my text messages.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. Dan has to bounce in a few minutes, so.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
mark sweet: No.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Tina Marie: Devon Conversation.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah. When do you wanna have them come in.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Dan Ryan: Did he send you the leads? Cause. We never got him.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
mark sweet: He said. Everything's on air table.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Dan Ryan: That's great!

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But did he give you access to air table.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Dan Ryan: No, I don't need that. Oh.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Dan Ryan: But we so I can. Can you dump all the leave, every lead he's ever sent with the state.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000
mark sweet: Uh, he said, it's all on air table, so I'm assuming. Yes.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Tina Marie: Can you share the air table with us.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Dan Ryan: I've never used.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
mark sweet: Okay. Sorry. Uh.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Dan Ryan: But uh. Yeah. So I mean, I'm going out of town on Friday.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, let's good.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Dan Ryan: Um. I'll be here on Monday, but I don't get back until Sunday night.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
mark sweet: Nearly.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Tina Marie: So are we not meeting next week.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Dan Ryan: No, we are. I'll be back Sunday night. But.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, this. Sunday. Okay.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I but I probably so I don't know. We'll we'll look at this air table stuff and see. It should be pretty straightforward, but I gotta get a dump, and then.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Dan Ryan: Eric and I will look at it tomorrow.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:36.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, before I forget on the other people to help China with her project that I'm gonna regret helping with.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, and we both.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
mark sweet: Okay, where are we on that.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Dan Ryan: So they said they'd do it. Um.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
mark sweet: Cool.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Dan Ryan: So we have to scope out. What it is, so.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Dan Ryan: So you know, what's so funny is that like I was telling someone today, they should use air table with. Part of lead flow or fan flowy, I was like, oh, we gotta go look at air table.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Dan Ryan: Um. I don't know if that's better or worse. I've. It's might be better, because I think you can like do reporting off it.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Dan Ryan: So maybe that would be beneficial to Chona. I don't really know.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Tina Marie: You've looked at it for a little while right before we found Melissa, who did the dashboards.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, totally long as time ago. So I'm gonna revisit it in the context of the call I had this morning.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Dan Ryan: Um. So basically, it boiled down to. They can do.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Dan Ryan: Automations and whatnot? Which was my question. I know they can code. So it would be a matter of like.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Dan Ryan: Scoping it all out, which goes back to like our original conversation. Where if Chona like.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Dan Ryan: Sent. Anything that like they fill out, or any like.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Dan Ryan: I assume it's a doctor's office, so they're they're filling out paperwork. Right? So this is what.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
mark sweet: So they.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.000
mark sweet: You have to sign a lien. And then from there they're having a call and setting up a schedule appointment, because most of these clients are terrible historians.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:22.000
mark sweet: So a nurse will call them, gather basic information, and then put all that information in a system. So that way. When Jonah does her initial call, it can be much faster, because she doesn't have to go over the history.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
mark sweet: And it can just go over. What are they feeling right now? Have them. Do you know. Bend over, twist that kind of.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Dan Ryan: So would that system be this system.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that would be amazing.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, so we need that paperwork so that we can. Define the custom fields or custom values. It's gonna be one or the other.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Dan Ryan: So basically, the the goal is that I scope it out.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Dan Ryan: And send it to them. And then they're going to quote the build.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
mark sweet: Cool.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. But I need like to understand these are all the potential fields. The data related to a contact.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Dan Ryan: Period. That's it. And then from there I can say, Oh, okay. And then I'll look at her spreadsheet, which I have. And then go. Okay. Maybe we should move this to air table. Maybe this should, or it can stay in Google sheets. And then.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Dan Ryan: Then I would say, Hey, we want. A text follow up automation for appointments. We want a appointment booking automation. Whatever the hell it is.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Dan Ryan: But the defining the data set is the the 1st step. It's the biggest step.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
mark sweet: Okay. Cool.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Dan Ryan: Of course you miss Shit, and you can add shit, but I mean we wanna.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000
mark sweet: No, I'd rather get most of there, and we can always tweak one or 2 things if we need to. But, like I, I'd like to have the majority of it. Correct.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And then there's like one source of truth.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
mark sweet: Cool.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Dan Ryan: Is it.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
mark sweet: And that way you're not super involved. Someone else is building it out. But you still make it actually work. So that makes total sense to me.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Cause you cannot trust.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Dan Ryan: Other people to make your ideas work.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
mark sweet: Ah, yeah, I've learned that the hard way multiple times.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Tina Marie: Dan, it is 1 0 1. That's the Jd funnel right.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Dan Ryan: Bye, bye. But in Dubai. Yes.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay, thank you. Bye, bye.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Dan Ryan: You.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Tina Marie: Do you have anything else you want to go over.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
mark sweet: Um.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I forgot.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:30.000
mark sweet: You know, feel better with the china thing. Oh, her. Finally, finally, finally, text messages will start working with grasshopper. It finally got approved. So that's a positive.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:41.000
mark sweet: Just to finish the Patrona conversation. Um on my side. No, I'm excited for Colorado. I'm excited for this winter. It's free thing.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:49.000
mark sweet: Again. I think it could. Help build a brand for us, which makes the form more valuable, and should help us also in Ppc.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
mark sweet: And distinguishes us from sweet James quite frankly.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Yes, um and it. And it's just at the very least, it's more data about what could work.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
mark sweet: Oh, most of it!

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Tina Marie: Or doesn't work hopefully. That's not what we learned, but. Um.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:18.000
mark sweet: This will work. The question is just how long and how much it's gonna take, because. Way, too many people doing the same goddamn thing, and if it didn't work at all, people wouldn't do it.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yes, um. But what I was also saying is that it should give us relational data for other things that we're doing, and more insight, and that's usually. It's almost as good as the 1st benefit of it working because.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Tina Marie: It, or or better, because um, that information will inform future decisions and iterations across the board. For acquisition, so.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Tina Marie: I like that. We're going down this route. Even if it doesn't, you know. Be a home run.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tina Marie: All. You know, the games are won by the singles, and every time we stack another single we just get that much further ahead. I was really surprised to see 52 retainers already on, and it's the 17.th

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah. I've brought down our.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
mark sweet: Criteria of it.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Tina Marie: So, okay, that was information we need to have. What'd you do?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I just loosened up my criteria. I'm saying yes, more often.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Tina Marie: Hold on! I understand that.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Tina Marie: What specific criteria did you modify.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:36.000
mark sweet: Um whether they have to have like um, so insurance are a little bit more questionable. That's probably the biggest thing.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Tina Marie: So are you tracking. How many more cases were taken specifically because of.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Tina Marie: The reduced criteria.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000
mark sweet: No, because we'll be able to see how many we drop. And that's gonna be a very direct indication. It's it's just gonna be the easiest way to see how many we dropped.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Tina Marie: It is, but not necessarily because you might find that you're not dropping anymore because of it. I doubt it. But. You should also.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
mark sweet: If that's the case, then I should have done this a long time ago.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Tina Marie: Exactly. But here's my point. You really should be tracking. Just have somebody like create a tick box or something, put it in slack. This is something we wouldn't have take. But we're taking it. Now let's tally that number up.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
mark sweet: No.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tina Marie: And compare it to the drops, because, let's say you do have more drop cases. But you're still taking more cases, and it's offset. It's not even that means you. Still, you should have done it a while ago, or maybe not, because how much time are we spending on these cases that we eventually drop. There's a lot of data that that one decision is going to affect. And if you're not tracking.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Tina Marie: How many cases came in because of it. You're not going to be able to track the rest of the impact. And I thought, I've taught you about tracking and the impact and all the other things.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Tina Marie: Sir.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
mark sweet: Okay, I will figure out a way to do it. That doesn't discourage people. But yes.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Make it as simple as possible. It could just literally be chat just like in a in a slack, and then we go. Do a zap or something to tabulate it, or whatever we just.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Tina Marie: Copy and paste the whole chat after a month, and run it through Chatgpt, and say, Count these.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't have to be difficult, but it does need to happen.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
mark sweet: Okay, then let me figure out the best way.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Tina Marie: Please. Look it.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:38.000
mark sweet: No, it's just. I need to manually do it. It's not. There's not a. This is an obvious criteria, and I don't want intake to think this through more, and I especially don't want.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:51.000
mark sweet: Attorneys to be looking at and be like. Oh, this is one mark doesn't think is as good, and either instantly discourage or don't do a very good job. So between those 2 things, I've got to be very cognizant of it. So I just have to name it something else.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
mark sweet: So we can track it. I get it. I just need to be very, very, very cognizant of what it is.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. What I'm saying is, I would be happy to help you brainstorm and work through this. It doesn't have to be something you figure out by yourself, like. Is it something uh America or somebody else could just go through? I don't know who has access to it right.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Tina Marie: But at the end of the day do a little tabulation on what came through intake. And look for is, did we take something with um without, with or without uninsured motorists? Probably without.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's more than just that. But that's 1 of. Key criteria, so.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well. Anything that I can do to help you come up with a simple solution.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
mark sweet: We'll get it figured.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Tina Marie: I'd be happy to help you workshop that.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:43.000
mark sweet: Okay, well, right now, I gotta figure out what the hell is going on outside because it's super loud. So let me figure that out first, st and then go yell at Isaac to finish getting this fixed up.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I'll talk to you later.
