00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Enjoy it. It's a wild and amazing ride. Um, so how well, first of all, how was Emi's birthday? Oh, did we freeze?
00:00:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, hang on. Yeah. My internet.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There it goes. Can you hear me?
00:00:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Heck issues, huh? That's my internet. keeps popping off this morning.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's fun. Um, well then maybe no video is more helpful. I don't know. Sometimes the Zoom bandwidth gets eaten up really quickly. with that. Not as bad with screen sharing so.
00:01:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was Emi's birthday?
00:01:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good. Yeah we just took her to the beach and like you saw I think and yeah it was really relaxing. And then we had a fairly eventful I think it was yeah weekend because I talked to you on with the 28th. No I talked to you.
00:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wednesday. I talked to you on Wednesday. Yeah I think it was Wednesday.
00:01:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Let's see. What I love is the week before. Oh wait when did I I talked to you on the 26th last train.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to go look at the calendar now look let's see. Week go back.
00:01:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Anyway what happened was is they found my wife. And my mom found to Esther, my mom found a house. I don't know if it was that day. Yeah, actually they found a house on the 23rd. And then we visited it on the 24. I talked to you on the 26. I didn't really think it was going to happen. And then after I talked to you last week, my mom and Esther were like, we really like this house. And so on Tuesday, I got pre-approved for a loan. And then Thursday, Wednesday, we talked to my realtor. And then on Thursday, submitted an eight hour offer. Essentially, we told them you guys have eight hours. To accept our offer on this house or we're going to walk because, you know, we weren't expected to buy it.
00:02:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God. Oh my Oh my God.
00:03:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so it a crazy week, and well, it wasn't crazy. was just it moved quickly.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things escalated quickly. Yeah.
00:03:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Yeah, so now we're in contract by, I won't say it's our dream house. It's not ideal. I don't, it's not like my forever house, certainly.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:03:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But it's a very nice house, and it's pretty new. And Esther's always wanted a house. So now we have house. Yeah, the only hair in the soup is that we have to put 25% down, and we also have to pay our estimated taxes for 2024 by September, whatever it is, tax day. So I have to come up, we have to come up with one point, roughly $1.3 million by the 30th of September.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a little wild.
00:04:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so we have, we have about 700, but the other, the other 600, it's taking some creativity. We're gonna, we're gonna take a margin loan, I get some of our stocks. We're going to temporarily distribute our 401Ks for the cash. And yeah, that should about do it, but we just need to get the down payment because we're also, we have another house in Dublin that we never use, so we're selling that this month, but it hasn't, it hasn't sold yet. So we're kind of just in a holding pattern to let things sell, then we can take our equity out of that.
00:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, I got some stuff to do.
00:04:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's, well, actually it's more Esther's stuff because it's kind of her stocks that we're taking a margin loan against. It's her 401K technically. So as long as she gets all that together, we're good. We're gonna be good.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good but yeah it's uh we have to raise a decent amount of money when we weren't expecting to um we'll see that happened to me about seven years ago my i was happily renting very happily renting i liked where we were at i liked our neighborhood i liked the house even though it had quite bit of issues i didn't have to deal with it because it was property management and they're like we're selling the house you have two months and i had to find a home in the right neighborhood in schools right april yes schools were a big deal but also our church family is um our church is divided by ward so it's a boundary issue oh interesting so i had to keep within that and then also budget but also safety also beauty like all the important things to me and two months it usually takes that long just to get a house inspected and closed and all of that you're right And I wasn't expecting it so I didn't have the money. Plus I was a single mom of four kids and they were all still in school and I kept my business working just enough to really be comfortable but not set everything aside because I wanted to have more time than I wanted money so I could be mom. And so like I had to get creative so I put out an offer and I needed $10,000 for the credit and it just came out and I was like I just kind of blew my mind like there are opportunities. I'm not even trying to get to right now because of necessity at that time but yeah it's interesting what we find of the assets we have and how we can use things when you need to do it.
00:06:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah yeah like I didn't know you can actually take out 401k money you know without a you can actually you have 60 days so you actually can cash out your 401k and you get it for 60 days to it's for the purposes you're supposed to move it to like a shawl shawl or vanguard from where we added but for our purposes it's cash so for 60 days we have this cash that we can use and I think that's just enough to float us to make the tax payment and to make the down payment until our other money comes in we hope so yeah it's a wild where you can find money when you really need it I guess and then the margin loans are I mean it's crazy too that you can borrow against my you know extra stock that's crazy to me but you could do it so we're gonna do it the thing about creating assets and being able to use things so anyway but there's also the people assets like the manager that you were talking and the Esther's manager that you're just tapping for a couple other things like it's all the same
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of thing is it's getting the most out of your existing resources. That's a conversation we'll have all the time and so many times we're not considering what can we get out of what we already have without even overburdening what we have, you know?
00:08:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's a good point.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really good. So yeah we rarely people use everything that they have as well as they could and it and we have more stress as a result of it because we're not really leveraging all the things right. We're using our brain more, our body more, force rather than strategy. Okay so you sent me an email update of let's go back to this real quick.
00:08:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right so yeah my manager after we had that conversation. He called me and he's like I'm losing my other job and I've always known he's worked huge jobs.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's just a really hard worker.
00:09:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
he asked me, he said, know, I worked pretty much full time for you, but if, you know, I were to work with you just 100%, you know, 70 hours a week, which is what his hours were for two jobs combined, he said, you know, I would really like that. And I said, okay, yeah, I mean, I think that would be really good. And I think there's a lot of ways that, you know, we can improve. So I said, yeah, let's try it. And so, yeah, so I essentially said, hey, you know, instead of, I'm paying him 2,000 now, I said, instead of 2,000, I'll pay 3,000. And, you know, you work for me, balls to the wall, so he was really happy. And so, yeah, we're gonna give it a try.
00:09:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what is that going to look like? Cause I like to think about logistics, like all the way through, explain not just, you know, not super deep, what that looks like.
00:10:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So right now he's in charge of watching over his all, he basically brought on all the other five employees of the company in Guatemala. So they're all his connections, but he watches over them currently. And then he also does one of the most important things for me, which is email sorting. So we get all our business through email. And so when a case manager, like from a mark, like Diego will email us and say, Hey, I want my client scene. Paul responds within five minutes, says, Hey, thank you, Diego for sending us this referral. Thank you so much. We appreciate it. We're gonna get them scheduled and let you know how it goes. So he does that. And then he also sorts the other emails that are like more complicated, right? hi, we didn't get our visit note. Can you please resend it? And it seems like very mundane, but it is like we get 100 emails a day that have to be properly sorted. And once they're sorted, like Paul's like, okay, this guy wants a copy of his note, send it to Paula. Oh, this guy needs a copy of his Phil, send it to America, right? Like everyone has their own role, but he's the one that sorts the emails. So I told him that if we're going to step up your pay, what it's going to look like is I want you to do something that brings additional value to the clinic. And so what I talked about was the follow-ups. We talked about how do I get a second visit? How do I get them to come a second time to review the MRI? So we're going to start there. He's going to start actually proactively when we get an MRI order or MRI done, we're going to actually ask the case manager, hey, we got this MRI, do you want a second visit? And we think that that's going to convert an additional, you know, maybe 10% of business. Allow. by simply asking, because we get about 300 patients a month, right? So if we can get even 30 of those people to do a second visit, I make about maybe $200 per visit. So 30 visits times 200, that's like another six grand, right?
