00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.190
Tina Marie: Okay, it's working.

2
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.460
Tina Marie: Hmm.

3
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.270
Tina Marie: hmm.

4
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.930
Tina Marie: no

5
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.945
Tina Marie: whatever.

6
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.710
Tina Marie: Hello! Hello!

7
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.445
Dan: Hello!

8
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.880
Tina Marie: There! Wait.

9
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.220
Dan: Yeah.

10
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.590
Tina Marie: I don't know. Zoom drives me nuts. I it's it's really good for the most part, compared to

11
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.439
Tina Marie: ancient days, you know, meetings, but

12
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.909
Tina Marie: every now and then it'll just drop something like this is a big deal. Stop it.

13
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.150
Tina Marie: Yeah.

14
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.840
Tina Marie: Anyway.

15
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.920
Tina Marie: How are you today?

16
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.549
Tina Marie: I see you, Hudson.

17
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.939
Dan: I was. Gonna say, Watts, I don't know.

18
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.370
Tina Marie: I'd seen.

19
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.110
Dan: Hudson Watson. I'm like what is happening. I'm good plugging away.

20
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.039
Tina Marie: What was that?

21
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.360
Dan: Plugging away.

22
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.320
Tina Marie: Well what you been plugging away from, cause. It's been 2 weeks since we talked.

23
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.130
Dan: Mostly fans Louis.

24
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:21.460
Dan: I closed. I think I think we closed the deal on the music publishing white label. So Distro Flowey will be going into full effect

25
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.960
Dan: So I'm just waiting for them to like.

26
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:37.249
Dan: confirm, confirm he like he was like, it's a done deal. And then yesterday. He's like, we're just meeting one more time. But we had negotiated a couple points. He made a he made a couple of good points. We're like, oh, yeah, we could do that

27
00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:47.770
Dan: so that'll be done. And then I sent our girl Maria all my shit, and she was like holy, holy crap.

28
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.269
Dan: She was like, wait, let me take this all in. But yeah, this could totally work.

29
00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.039
Dan: I said, Okay, go ahead and absorb that. We're not ready yet. But I was like I figured I'd clue you in

30
00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:10.850
Dan: and then, still waiting for the book edits from the Bobsy twins. They're slacking. I just hit them up again this morning.

31
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.730
Tina Marie: Twins. I don't even know how long it's been since I've heard that name.

32
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:24.269
Dan: I know that was a deep reference waiting for them to send me those today I was gonna try to

33
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.339
Dan: figure out I might do it today or tomorrow. I'm trying to figure out how to resubmit the spotify app. But in the meantime

34
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.290
Dan: I think I just put together a deal with this

35
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:52.389
Dan: competitor, basically. And the in the conversation with them he basically showed me, you know, you could just go in and buy our 2 49 a year account and manage it for your artists and just give them the links. And they basically won't even know that you're using us.

36
00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:06.030
Dan: And then, if I wanted I could. Then that's 250 bucks a month, and then if I wanted, I could go in and pay 3, 50 a month and get Api access so that

37
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.409
Dan: we could just automatically do the manual steps. So

38
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.830
Dan: I was like, Okay, so I guess I really just need to like track. How much time beyond the initial setup

39
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.650
Dan: goes into this

40
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.100
Dan: and then submit the spotify, so this will replace the spotify app until the spotify app is ready.

41
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.150
Tina Marie: Nice.

42
00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.489
Dan: So I'm still wait him waiting for him to send me some Api docs.

43
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.167
Dan: I mean Sean and I are talking about it. But Sean's like, yeah, dude that would work, I know.

44
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.459
Dan: So then that would get us pre-save functionality like tomorrow.

45
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.510
Dan: Yeah. And then Mark did this thing where he

46
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.040
Dan: cold. DM'd all the radio leads that we've already gotten.

47
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.559
Dan: and he is booked for the rest of the month.

48
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.274
Dan: like he has calls every half hour, almost every day.

49
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.290
Tina Marie: Holy heck!

50
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.999
Dan: I know, like the 1st email went out. He got he 22 calls got booked in 2Â h.

51
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.770
Dan: So I was like, Oh, that's interesting. So it'll be interesting to see how those go down.

52
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.159
Dan: I got the spotify scraper dudes all set up, so I don't even know if I talked about this, but I had this vision

53
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:39.679
Dan: of like, oh, man, what if you could scrape, spotify? So I was doing it via this other thing that I started working on months ago where you can do a custom search on Google like a Google Dork search.

54
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.379
Tina Marie: Did you say Google Dork shirt.

55
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.999
Dan: Is what they're called. Yeah, I'm like, this has got to be called something. It's called the Google Dork Search.

56
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.370
Dan: You do a Google Dork search

57
00:06:49.860 --> 00:07:07.899
Dan: like site coal Site or URL contains Instagram, and then at Gmail is. And then and I think music or musician or something. I forget it's a Google Dork search that I came up with. I swiped it from somebody like

58
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.920
Dan: someone showed how to do that for

59
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:31.390
Dan: think finding like plumbers or something. I forget what it was, and it but it wasn't on Instagram. I was like, Oh, wait a minute. I could do a Google Dork search target Instagram target at Gmail Target, a musician. So what happens is it pulls back all the Instagram Urls of people that have a Gmail address in their profile that say they're a musician, and I was like, okay.

60
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.310
Dan: Then I paid the these dudes to go scrape that.

61
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.900
Dan: and then I paid them to go follow.

62
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.919
Dan: There's no, there's nobody.

63
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.949
Dan: No, you're wrong. There's nobody here you suck at this.

64
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.719
Dan: You suck it. There was nothing.

65
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.589
Tina Marie: So confused for me, and I'm like what is happening, cause it was breaking up also.

66
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.620
Dan: Yeah, yeah, it's cause this dog sucks it. She sucks. There's nothing here.

67
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:07.019
Dan: So then, yeah. So then I have my manual scrapers go

68
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.119
Dan: like append append data to that.

69
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.790
Dan: This is not helping.

70
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.909
Dan: And

71
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.300
Dan: And what they were doing was like they were going and finding their

72
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.429
Dan: spotify their website whatever I had them append a bunch of data.

73
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:36.289
Dan: And I was like, Oh, I could like cold outreach to these people. But at the time I didn't really have an offer. It was just gonna be like Mark going. Oh, hey? Oh, they were getting

74
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.679
Dan: their spotify the last song they released.

75
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.989
Dan: and and something like that. So my thought was like, Oh, I'll have Mark

76
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:58.359
Dan: use Gmass to mass email, these people on the regular. It's like, Hey, I saw your. I saw your new song blah, or your song. Blah blah! Listen to it. It's great. I have whatever like making some sort of pitch.

77
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.790
Dan: and then I just sort of put a PIN in that. And I was like, Okay, I'll come back to this because I don't have an offer.

78
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:23.450
Dan: But now I'm like, oh, so then, when Spotify app got declined, I was like dude. I've got to find someone that's been approved like, if I could find a developer that's done this that's gotten approved. Maybe I can show him what I'm getting like. Do you know how to submit this?

79
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:34.249
Dan: I've not been able to find anyone? But I found this one guy on upwork, and I reached out to him and I told him what was going on, and his response was like, Yeah, no, I can't help you with that.

80
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:41.140
Dan: And I was like, Okay, well, how are you not being a dick? I was like, Oh, okay, so

81
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.089
Dan: why are you. What makes you as well like? What are you doing that makes you a spotify Api expert.

82
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:53.750
Dan: he's like, Oh, I have a scraper, that! And he starts explaining it. I'm like, wait a minute. He does what?

83
00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:07.690
Dan: So now, this guy, I go. Okay. So I think what he said is is like, it gets the daily new releases, I go okay, cool. Can you get me the Daily new releases for these 3 genres? He's like Yup.

84
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:13.250
Dan: And he sent me a data record. And the record has emails and some of them.

85
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:27.910
Dan: I go. Okay, can you can. I? Can you get me only ones with emails. So I want this genre new release, the name of the song, the link to the song on spotify the release date. Obviously it's there and then.

86
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.799
Dan: If they? If there's a label, what label are they on?

87
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.200
Dan: And something else? If there's 1 other piece of data, and he's like Yup.

88
00:10:36.610 --> 00:11:03.680
Dan: And I was like, okay? Well, no, this is a totally different offer. Now, I can hit these people up for Mark and then pitch them getting on the radio, hey, Tina? I saw you dropped your new song on Tuesday. I work with such and such radio like. They're they're they're accepting new song submissions right now. You should go submit your song here, and then it's just a link to go. Submit your new song that you're very proud of, Tina. You just put it out. Of course, you would love to have it on the radio.

89
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:13.769
Dan: So I worked with that guy for like a week. And then yesterday he sent over a data to a web hook I had Eric set up, and we're pulling all that in. So

90
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.359
Dan: he's selling me them for like 20 cents a record.

91
00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:28.149
Dan: It's it's coming out to like a little over a buck, a lead. But I think I can talk them down after, because I know they're not going to convert great, but maybe they will. So

92
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.229
Dan: he he just gave me 500 yesterday.

93
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.839
Dan: I'm like, am I supposed to pay for these like?

94
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:46.560
Dan: But so that will be the thing. Those will come over once a week, so it'll be like the last week's new releases. Then I'll go into an automation that sends an email from Mark

95
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:56.539
Dan: that sends them to the landing page that we already use that converts at like 30 something percent. Or actually, I'm going to send them to a different landing page. So I can. But a copy of that.

96
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:06.814
Dan: We'll see how that works, because if that's that's getting more of different lead source. But putting in the same thing as what's been converting.

97
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:15.600
Dan: we started mapping out the actual affiliate program. So we're gonna build that out. So that's there's 2 guys that are basically using it right now

98
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:33.539
Dan: so that we can have everything run through high level. So the spam flow subscription. And then the label services, subscriptions, whatever they are. And then the payout to that affiliate based on so that it's all going to be fixed. You're this level affiliate. You get 20%, whatever the hell it is.

99
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:41.100
Dan: So those Sean sent that all over. But I got I got to turn into a spreadsheet. So I actually understand it better. But then Eric and I can build that

100
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:49.130
Dan: and then then start using it. And then they're gonna start running everything through fan flowing.

101
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.410
Dan: What else.

102
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:59.110
Tina Marie: This is the time that Hannibal would be smoking a cigar and talking about the plan coming together.

103
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.980
Dan: think that's it?

104
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.410
Dan: Looking at, what did I do today?

105
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.670
Dan: Yeah, yeah, totally. And then i've been working on the side. On the whole, like

106
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.679
Dan: it's not even just buying catalogs. It's like

107
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.119
Dan: I was talking to David Kohenic. And he

108
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:36.660
Dan: he said something, and I was like, oh, that's a really good way of looking at this. I hadn't thought about it like that. So he said, he pointed out, what you're basically saying is like you want to work with these established artists

109
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.379
Dan: that your what I called the distressed assets

110
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.999
Dan: he's like you want to work with these distressed asset establishers, and then you want to work with these totally new

111
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.140
Dan: artists. I go, yeah. And he goes. So basically, you're building a P and E,

112
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.226
Dan: and and to

113
00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:59.409
Dan: What's the word venture? Capital.

114
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:13.419
Dan: So he's like in a PE. They go in and buy businesses. They know they can grow because they have the systems to do that. So they target businesses that need the things that they're good at. They grow it with a plan to sell it in 7 years, let's say.

115
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:24.950
Dan: and I go. Yeah, that's basically it. But we don't necessarily plan on selling it. But everything else about that's correct. And they said with with venture capital. They're trying to find a unicorn.

116
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.280
Dan: So they do 12 deals with whatever criteria.

117
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:39.139
Dan: hoping one of them like that, that they use the same criteria, and typically one out of 12 pops. And it pays for the whole thing.

118
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:47.509
Dan: I go. That's yes, that's exactly what. And he goes. Okay. So where is there less risk? I'm like P. And E. And he goes exactly. So you should start there.

119
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:55.559
Dan: I said. That's what I think. But now, so I've been working with Grok and gpt to like sort of turn that into.

120
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.560
Tina Marie: What is Pn.

121
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.140
Dan: Plan.

122
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.059
Tina Marie: I thought you said P.

123
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.070
Dan: Private equity.

124
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.539
Tina Marie: Okay. So Pete.

125
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.490
Dan: I always.

126
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.819
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay, okay, I'm like, I thought you were talking about private equity. Then you keep saying PNE.

127
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.510
Dan: I know I said PND, which is wrong. It's PE. So PE. And Vc.

128
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.810
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

129
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.729
Dan: So I've been mapping that out because I think it makes a lot of sense. And then

130
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:25.960
Dan: those guys are like hesitant. They, I think they want to do the the Vc. Version, because

131
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.950
Dan: you know what would be cool.

132
00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:29.900
Tina Marie: You may.

133
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.309
Dan: Would be cool if is, if we sign this band and they blew up. I'm like that would be cool, you know. It would be cooler if we made money.

134
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.899
Dan: and then prove all our things over here with like a distressed asset

135
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:49.499
Dan: that even if even if you just, I mean we can put together deals over there that are just profitable, and we don't do anything just like everyone else.

136
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.049
Dan: Just go buy the thing except we can bolt on

137
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.570
Dan: this marketing component that no one else can, and then that has the the possibility.

138
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:04.579
Dan: the design, at least to make the stuff grow. And then we can figure out, does it work?

139
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.499
Dan: Then just go do more of that. And then, yeah, have an eye out for

140
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.670
Dan: this other fund. But have guys come in, make them a bunch of money

141
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:24.360
Dan: and then go, hey! We want to go start this DC thing, or whatever we call it. Actually, you know, I'm coming up with names or whatever. So then I got to run that by those guys. But

142
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.069
Dan: having this pre-save thing done

143
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.910
Dan: would be killer. So I'm like you know what it's worth. 249 bucks a month, or whatever.

144
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:42.859
Dan: So then I also like, I think I finished. No, it'll be done tomorrow. The whole community build out should be done tomorrow, as far as like structure goes.

145
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:50.610
Dan: and then we can start inviting people to that and just see what happens, and we shall see.

146
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.890
Dan: But the big plan is just have it already.

147
00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:01.450
Dan: including the book funnel, like operating by April first, st

148
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:10.530
Dan: and then whether or not, whenever we'll see what happens with Maria, because if this other shit works, I don't need to like.

149
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.759
Dan: I'll have 2 funnels going. I don't need a 3rd one. Necessarily.

150
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.899
Tina Marie: So what would the 3rd one be?

151
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.190
Dan: Book funnel, like the automatic clients, Maria.

152
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.529
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, okay, yeah.

153
00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:32.229
Tina Marie: So, but that I like, I'm missing something, because it's not the whole purpose of the book.

154
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:39.570
Dan: Yes, but if I don't need, if no, no, it's not so. The purpose of the book is the

155
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.940
Dan: I mean. I guess the way you can look at is like

156
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:58.599
Dan: the purpose of the book is because it solves the biggest pain in the marketplace. You don't have a strategy. So we wrote a book around the strategy, and then the book can. So we're getting these leads right now you go into the community. I'll send you a link to the community, the community.

157
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:05.160
Dan: I think it's borderline genius to be honest. And I showed this. I showed it to someone, and they were like, Oh, my God, that's such a good idea.

158
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:12.619
Dan: The community is built around the book. So like the sections of the community are the steps of the book.

159
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:19.909
Dan: So it's like Step One, and it's like step one. From what? Oh, the book! You don't have the book here. Here's the link. Go buy the book.

160
00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:21.500
Tina Marie: I love that.

161
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:32.330
Dan: Yeah, so it doesn't. So the book can be a funnel. But then all these free leads or or cheap leads, whatever all these targeted leads from the radio and then from the scrape.

162
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:39.260
Dan: They're not of the book. But if you go in the community and you start poking around and you'll, you're going to get that. There's a book.

163
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:45.110
Dan: And then the podcast, is tied to the book. Right? So I also mapped out this idea of like

164
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:58.750
Dan: having podcast episodes that are in direct alignment with the book. So it's like a different take on that step. So it's like, it's not the book verbatim. It's like, Hey, here we are talking about

165
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:07.129
Dan: the amplify, amplify, which is in step 4, or is, which is key, 2 of step 4.

166
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.140
Dan: And so I came up with

167
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:37.404
Dan: again with Grock. I came up with a naming convention thing, so that at the end of the year you could build a playlist on Youtube. That's like, here's sort of a book addendum. It's not the audio book, but it's like you can hear this shit in practice. You could hear this. You can hear this from the perspective of why, how? What we're seeing right now. And you could just build a playlist that is like a book, buddy, or whatever.

168
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:43.849
Dan: So this it's everything sort of like built around the book and the strategies in the book.

169
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:52.600
Dan: Yada Yada Yada. So then, if you made the book the front end. They're coming in on the book. So right now no one's coming in on the book.

170
00:19:53.550 --> 00:20:00.849
Dan: and then the book. The book will be in like bumpers on the podcast so even traffic that goes to the book from elsewhere

171
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:10.179
Dan: into the book. Funnel is not paid paid book funnel. Right there there'd be paid book funnel, which could be a totally separate subdomain, so that you're tracking all that.

172
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.719
Dan: But the book will end up on like book.mom.com, or whatever.

173
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.510
Tina Marie: Nice.

174
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.925
Dan: Yeah.

175
00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.300
Tina Marie: So

176
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:31.475
Tina Marie: would there be a reason to not make the investment in the book funnel for the sake of

177
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.849
Tina Marie: I mean, you've already done most of the work. The there's a few steps, but

178
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.770
Tina Marie: you already have a process for all of it. The only kind of big big step really would be. Maybe the copy.

179
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:45.790
Dan: I already did it.

180
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.270
Tina Marie: Right. So why would you not do that to capture more.

181
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:56.660
Dan: No, you would. I just don't think the so. The book sort of buy the book.

182
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.859
Dan: Well, the the book fellow requires.

183
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:06.130
Dan: 2, 3, I think 3.

184
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.940
Dan: I'll just call them courses, but they're really not, or I'll just call them upsells.

185
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:18.060
Dan: 3 upsells that are essentially I'm like literally copying this other dude. So I'm like, Oh, he's got

186
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:24.019
Dan: this. So his, like, his 1st immediate upsells audio book. I'm like, Okay, great, yeah, I can. I can do that.

187
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:32.299
Dan: Then his second upsell is or his. Let's put it this way. He's using a modified version of

188
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:43.479
Dan: the automatic clients. So it doesn't. It must be like, I think they just put out version 2.0 in the book. I guarantee you, this guy's using it. So

189
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:53.970
Dan: the new model is you have, like your $3, you know, free pro shipping. But there's no shipping, because it's digital, right? So it's 3 bucks.

190
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.340
Dan: Then when you add that to cart.

191
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:13.510
Dan: You're not actually adding it to the cart. The 1st form is really an opt-in form. It's email. Only you submit that they're snagging your email so they can do abandoned cart and all that good shit. Then you go to like the cart, and immediately you're upgraded. There's 2 options in

192
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:27.339
Dan: the cart, and they automatically put you with audiobook. So you didn't even assent to the upsell. They're just, hey? You might as well get this. So it's not even an upsell. It's like I don't even know what to call that.

193
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.630
Dan: It's like a forced upsell sort of.

194
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.010
Tina Marie: Force, order, bump.

195
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:42.969
Dan: Yeah. But then they have an order bump. So I'm like, I don't know what to call this 1st thing. So we're just gonna call it whatever they have a whatever upsell, and then the order bump is.

196
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.520
Tina Marie: Automatic bundle. Maybe, anyway.

197
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.299
Dan: Yeah sort of yeah, sort of. I mean, that's a good. That's probably a good term.

198
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:56.420
Dan: And then they have the order bump, which is, think it's 27 bucks.

199
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:09.380
Dan: It's a 27 order bump in this scenario. It's behind the scenes of my 6 figure a year art business, right? So it's the dude selling the course showing behind the scenes of his art business.

200
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.000
Dan: I turned that into one of 2.

201
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.340
Dan: It's 1 or 2 or both.

202
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.430
Dan: so we could do behind the scenes of Sean

203
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:30.900
Dan: and Sean's makes over a hundred $1,000 a year. As Lansdowne. So my okay, we could do the same thing behind the scenes of my whatever his total is, I don't know what it is, but I know it's over 100,

204
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:41.150
Dan: and or we could do behind the scenes of Nonpoint, who's even bigger than Shawn. So it would be like, here's the guide.

205
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:52.380
Dan: Non point is one of the early adopters of fanflow that, like we're like we do all kinds of shit for them, and they are 3 times as large as Sean is my estimate.

206
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.590
Dan: So.

207
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.560
Tina Marie: Talked about them, but either not by name, or I just didn't realize that was a name.

208
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:06.700
Dan: No, I mean, I'm I've maybe mentioned them here and there, but not that much. I I talked to them one time like a year ago.

209
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:26.289
Dan: same with the singer's name's Elias, and he's super cool. And so I hit up mark and I said, What do you think the odds are. Elias would go behind the scenes. So then that would be so. One would be Sean doing behind the scenes of Lansdowne on his own. Then the other one would be mark with Elias walking through the parts of the business that Mark

210
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.650
Dan: is responsible for Fan Flowy, and then the parts of the business that

211
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:50.540
Dan: Elias is responsible for or involved in. And then, whatever that number is right, it's so. That number could be 300,000 400,000. But it's like, Hey, here's the dude selling you the shit, showing you what he does. And then here's the dude selling you the shit and someone using it who's killing it.

212
00:24:51.120 --> 00:25:02.359
Dan: But like, okay, check, we can do that. And then there's like a Facebook ads course that he gives away. That's it's like Super, not great. So Johnny would have to make that

213
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.160
Dan: I'm like, alright. So we need to make 3 products and an audio book

214
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.420
Dan: like there, there's no way that's happening this quarter.

215
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.739
Dan: So I'm like, all right, I can get the funnel built

216
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:29.689
Dan: and get it ready. And then Q. 2. It would be like we need that those would be like the big rocks for Q or the rocks for q, 1. Rock for Q. 2 would be like, get all of these things done so that you could launch the actual book funnel.

217
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.330
Dan: probably in the summer, or whenever those are done. So that's

218
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:42.709
Dan: basically it's not that. It's it's not that I don't want to do it. It's like it's not gonna be ready. But these other things I can turn on

219
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.350
Dan: right now, and they're super passive, and they're super cheap, comparatively.

220
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.280
Dan: And I need Maria's feedback. So Maria's feedback is okay. I want

221
00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:09.279
Dan: you've done a bunch of these. Help me fill in these blanks. So my specific question with her to her was, What do you see across multiple funnels for the audio auto, the auto bump? What do you see for the the order. Bump!

222
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.319
Dan: Here we go! That that's it. Auto, bump and order, bump! Done!

223
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.170
Dan: And then what do you.

224
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.359
Tina Marie: Handle, order, bump.

225
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:22.690
Dan: There you go, and then the page after that is now what they call the Mid Tier.

226
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.170
Dan: I do not have a mid tier

227
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:39.769
Dan: so, and I have not been able to come up with one. I can. I was gonna maybe go buy his. Oh, no, I I have his. I need to go through his. So I need to go analyze his mid tier to see what's our mid tier equivalent

228
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:51.349
Dan: telling you straight up that, like his products suck. So I'm like, I don't really want to sell just a total piece of crap for 97 bucks. But I'm sure when Maria goes, this is what I'm seeing

229
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:59.910
Dan: the auto bundle. This is the take rate, the order bump. This is the take rate, the mid tier. This is the take rate, and then, after that, it's

230
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:13.719
Dan: kind of interesting. They changed this to. It's basically books book call one book call 2. So book call one. I think what they're doing is they're saying, anybody that books this call we're going for the highest

231
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.150
Dan: high ticket.

232
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.949
Dan: And if they pass on that they go to book, call 2 where they're

233
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:37.919
Dan: essentially selling a book call. But they're reframing it as like a different level of the community. Because you get a free community with the book on the front end. And then this is like a for serious artists. So I think it's just a way of them saying, Okay, don't pitch them. These guys are just regular high ticket.

234
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:38.880
Tina Marie: That.

235
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:46.219
Dan: What those prices are on the back end I couldn't tell you, but my guess is, it's like 5 grand for one, and then 2,500 for the other. So.

236
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:53.220
Tina Marie: Differentiator between one and 2, and like what defines and qualifies a serious artist.

237
00:27:54.110 --> 00:28:00.909
Dan: Nothing. I think what they're doing is anyone that says, yes, the 1st time we're gonna we're just gonna make them a higher offer

238
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.770
Dan: because they're they were like a first, st a fast mover.

239
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.170
Tina Marie: Okay.

240
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.030
Dan: On the pitch on the page is like.

241
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.430
Tina Marie: We almost.

242
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.919
Dan: More, hand, holding maybe.

243
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:15.859
Tina Marie: Treat them as Vip, because they said yes, and you know that they're eager. So you want to kind of reciprocate that energy to them.

244
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.689
Dan: I think so. Yeah. And the pitch on the page is like a little more

245
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:30.359
Dan: coachy. And the so let's put it that way. That's a coach pitch and the other one's a community pitch. So it's almost like one on one versus group, although I don't think the second one's group.

246
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.189
Dan: But it could be. It's not super clear. But

247
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:48.610
Dan: they both go to book calls. So I'm like they're both high ticket. I just don't know what the actual differentiate. I don't know exactly what it is. She might know. It's probably part of Part 2, because this is not the funnel this guy was using when I 1st went through it.

248
00:28:49.200 --> 00:29:01.370
Dan: But my question to her is, Hey, I want to build a funnel calculator off this so that we can evaluate all right. We're getting leads at this cost. And then this is what we should see. And then we know if that if the ads are working or not.

249
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:10.570
Dan: and then like how to scale them. I know that she usually does really good out of the gate. So I'm like, okay, let's put the best foot forward.

250
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:22.238
Dan: and by emulating his upsells and whatnot, the the upsells and the free. And I told her, like, our community is not Facebook to this.

251
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:31.320
Dan: but it's like, okay, if I get as close to this, then and then she has sort of numbers across multiple funnel. And and

252
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:46.459
Dan: you know, genres, whatever you want to call it or niches. Then it's like, okay, we're looking at a target cost per lead of 6 bucks or 3 bucks. Probably. Right? You're trying to self liquidate on the book, I imagine.

253
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.910
Dan: but I don't know.

254
00:29:51.010 --> 00:30:02.020
Tina Marie: I like it. I like the momentum I like that. We're like finally in funnel creation. But you know

255
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:10.460
Tina Marie: all the things, anyway. Order of operations right? It took a long time to get there, but because

256
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.469
Tina Marie: you waited for everything to be done in order.

257
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.500
Tina Marie: it will work great, be scalable, sustainable.

258
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.140
Tina Marie: Probably.

259
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:29.679
Dan: Yeah, and there was no high ticket offer initially, like, initially, initially. And then those guys figured out over time.

260
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.609
Dan: Oh, yeah, we we need to. They figured out a couple of things people can't onboard themselves.

261
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.300
Tina Marie: Yup!

262
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.059
Dan: And if they're left to their own devices, they're not going to do it.

263
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:50.789
Dan: But I mean, that's sort of this. That's what I think is really interesting about this is. And I pointed this out to Maria, too. I'm like they're paying us to get them hooked on the software. I've never

264
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.210
Dan: right.

265
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:58.300
Dan: It's like this, it's it's unique in that way. So it's like, Yeah, it's high ticket

266
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.020
Dan: for coaching on the subscription. I want you to start and keep.

267
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.840
Dan: And and I'm like, that's like a twist on it. So it it

268
00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:21.069
Dan: it's like the the these metrics on the front end don't need. It's not a high ticket funnel. It's a i don't even know what to call it right. It's like a it's like a done for you, Sas Funnel. It's like I don't know.

269
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.089
Tina Marie: I'm trying to think cause I I always always want to go to mapping this.

270
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:40.320
Tina Marie: but there's up until now been more unknowns than knowns, but I feel like we're.

271
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:46.859
Dan: Well, and we can map it. I'm sending the book funnel. So I realized, also, I'm like, I got to build this on

272
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.120
Dan: high level. I should not build this on.

273
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.200
Tina Marie: Oh, I know where we could do it, Giro.

274
00:31:53.120 --> 00:32:01.710
Tina Marie: I never use it, but this is what it's good for just visualizing rather than drawing it all out.

275
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.460
Tina Marie: Sorry I didn't mean to like cut you off, or anything.

276
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:13.090
Dan: Oh, no no boom, boom, boom.

277
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.539
Tina Marie: So can you see this? Are you on a phone or.

278
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.869
Dan: Yeah, I can see.

279
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:25.780
Tina Marie: Okay, so let's just start from the beginning of a funnel.

280
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.410
Tina Marie: Pick any like you've got 3 versions technically right?

281
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.930
Dan: Yeah. So the there's the song, submit funnel that already exists.

282
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:42.129
Tina Marie: So where does it start like what experience is? The user having.

283
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.680
Dan: Facebook, lead, ad.

284
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.860
Tina Marie: So let me go back.

285
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.389
Tina Marie: Whoa! Custom, object. I don't want a custom object right now.

286
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.880
Tina Marie: Opt-in traffic retargeting my email. Sorry I don't know all of these, so I gotta look at them

287
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.350
Tina Marie: content. Page.

288
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.269
Tina Marie: don't you have ads.

289
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.569
Dan: Well, it's traffic, probably.

290
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.320
Tina Marie: Yeah traffic entry. We'll just do this.

291
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.260
Tina Marie: No?

292
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.670
Tina Marie: Okay.

293
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.340
Tina Marie: Nope oops.

294
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.049
Tina Marie: Alright. Learning curve is probably not the can I rename it?

295
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.150
Tina Marie: Maybe this isn't gonna be as easy as I thought it would be.

296
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.565
Dan: Surprised. It just doesn't have a dropdown like pick your traffic source.

297
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.510
Tina Marie: Right.

298
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.429
Tina Marie: Nope, that didn't work.

299
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.860
Tina Marie: Okay?

300
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.139
Tina Marie: Well, we could probably do custom lead thing. But

301
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:56.700
Tina Marie: anyway, scenario one, let's just we'll give it a couple of minutes because it could work visitor. November source.

302
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.520
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, no traffic sources yet. So there are some things that we have to.

303
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.819
Dan: Oh, you have to like. Tell them shit. Okay.

304
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.370
Tina Marie: Okay. Facebook.

305
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.489
Dan: That makes sense.

306
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.489
Tina Marie: One. I don't know what that is.

307
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:12.840
Tina Marie: Settings.

308
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:20.719
Tina Marie: Add new campaign name F. The Ad.

309
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:28.279
Tina Marie: I really need to get my my nails are like half an inch long right now over my nails. They need to be done.

310
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:36.450
Tina Marie: Traffic entry one. We'll call that that. Oh, custom, traffic source! We don't need that.

311
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.499
Tina Marie: Oh, that's cool.

312
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:46.790
Tina Marie: Facebook ads campaign name. Okay? So what is what is this one gonna be called?

313
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.079
Tina Marie: But this we'll call it Phantom.

314
00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.589
Dan: The ad campaign. But what is it?

315
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.420
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well.

316
00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.469
Dan: Model, name.

317
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.559
Tina Marie: Yeah. The final name.

318
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.610
Dan: It's a rock, rage, song, song, submit!

319
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.080
Tina Marie: Rock range song.

320
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:14.170
Tina Marie: Submit Facebook ads, monthly visitors. We don't know. Acquisition type clicks or impressions.

321
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.850
Tina Marie: Probably page visits, isn't it?

322
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.699
Tina Marie: Or we'll just save that.

323
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.330
Tina Marie: Okay, add note, that's okay.

324
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:29.160
Tina Marie: Close, hey? Look at that. And then where does it go?

325
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.000
Tina Marie: Landing? Page.

326
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:41.240
Dan: Well, it goes to. There's 2 paths. They can go directly to the landing page if they click the button in the lead. Ad.

327
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:47.969
Dan: thank you. Page, basically go to email that sends them an email to to go to landing page.

328
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:54.460
Tina Marie: Email. So it goes to either one of these settings.

329
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.760
Tina Marie: Custom Page. What's the page name.

330
00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.949
Dan: Songs, from that.

331
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:06.349
Tina Marie: Song, submit, submit, call to action.

332
00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.039
Tina Marie: Let's say, yes.

333
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:16.120
Tina Marie: Options showing port. Don't know what that is. Customize alright.

334
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.189
Tina Marie: Okay. So it can either go from here to here.

335
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.010
Tina Marie: Can I connect?

336
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.930
Tina Marie: We'll figure that out.

337
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.840
Tina Marie: Edit, name, email. What's what's the email.

338
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.110
Dan: Submit, submit your song.

339
00:36:35.055 --> 00:36:36.330
Tina Marie: Submit your song.

340
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.570
Tina Marie: That's cool. So it I don't know how we connected, but we can do that. This

341
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.250
Tina Marie: Whoa share map settings. No, that's not what I want.

342
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:59.419
Tina Marie: Let's just probably do. And undo shapes. Chatbot! Chatbot opt in

343
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.110
Tina Marie: down top. Here, top, stop here!

344
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.170
Tina Marie: Wait!

345
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.770
Tina Marie: There is no wait. Oh, look! They're connected.

346
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.710
Tina Marie: but that's not where you go.

347
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.150
Dan: Perfect.

348
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.030
Dan: Alright! Thanks for the help. But that's all right.

349
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.870
Tina Marie: Right.

350
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.370
Tina Marie: I'm clicking on you. You're not working.

351
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.160
Tina Marie: anyway. We can get all the pieces in there. I can connect them later. What else happens.

352
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.930
Dan: So the song Submit is actually a survey.

353
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.489
Dan: so they could submit their song. But there's a survey baked in.

354
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:49.580
Dan: and they either pre call or they are declined. So pre call they go to a fan flowy

355
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.999
Dan: page. Basically a family like overview page book, a call.

356
00:37:55.310 --> 00:38:00.500
Tina Marie: Okay? And then you want to call that like an app. We'll call that calendar right? Book a call.

357
00:38:01.658 --> 00:38:05.980
Dan: No, I think that it. It's just a book, a call. It's a overview

358
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:13.259
Dan: with the book, a call Cta, and then if they click the button, they go to a calendar. So I separated those. So I could actually

359
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.114
Dan: see, like, okay, how many people are actually doing these different steps.

360
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.050
Dan: And I can also use that in the automation. Be like they didn't. They didn't go to the calendar.

361
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.090
Dan: They didn't do this, which I haven't. Really.

362
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.820
Dan: I'm gonna go manipulate that shit now, so I can fill Mark's calendar even more. Hey, Buddy.

363
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:40.480
Dan: this is what you wanted, you know. It would be cool if you got more calls.

364
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:48.650
Tina Marie: I'm not set these here. Oh, wait, wait! There we go. Wait. Well, that was, that's not a connection. I thought it was a connection.

365
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:56.360
Tina Marie: Okay? So it's kind of working interesting.

366
00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.400
Tina Marie: All right. So and then survey Custom page which

367
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.259
Tina Marie: didn't change the name overview with book a call. There it is that? What's this survey.

368
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.420
Dan: What's in the Survey.

369
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.140
Tina Marie: Yeah.

370
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:19.630
Dan: So they submit. Their they 1st 1st half is actually getting their song. But it's are you on?

371
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.200
Dan: Are you on spotify? If they're not on spotify. They're instantly

372
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.519
Dan: disqualified, but they can still submit their song.

373
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.309
Dan: And then there's questions like, How serious are you about your music career?

374
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.223
Dan: So it's really just. Wow! That was big Boston accent right there.

375
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:44.210
Dan: so it's really a 2 point survey. Are you on spotify? How much a month are you willing to spend on your music those the 2 deciders.

376
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.060
Tina Marie: Okay.

377
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.510
Tina Marie: So save okay.

378
00:39:50.270 --> 00:40:03.680
Tina Marie: alright. So that's at least some information. And then song submit. If they don't go that way and they go to the custom page. What happens after here? Well, actually, let's finish this all the way through. So custom page, and then then they would go to.

379
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.430
Tina Marie: Well, do we want to say phone, what is.

380
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:15.769
Dan: Well, they go to like a Vsl sort of but it's really not. We would call it a Vsl. Page, but it is not a Vsl that's on the page.

381
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.619
Tina Marie: Like it's a 2 step on there.

382
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:29.140
Dan: It's yeah, it's like a Vsl and then with and then it's like, if you're interested in this book, a call, and then if they click the book, call button. They go to calendar.

383
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:44.430
Tina Marie: Well, this custom page so overview will book a call. Cta, that's what I already have. So overview

384
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.649
Tina Marie: plus video

385
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:56.770
Tina Marie: with book a call Cta. So then, if they get past that, then they do go to a calendar to book a call right?

386
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.660
Dan: Yeah, that's fine.

387
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.129
Tina Marie: Of a call.

388
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:14.319
Tina Marie: Yes, and then we call them

389
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:26.660
Tina Marie: edit. Name what kind of like? Who calls them? What do we call this?

390
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.130
Dan: I don't know if it has a name, but

391
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:37.629
Dan: it's basically it's like it's a fan flow call. They know they're they're interested in family.

392
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.690
Tina Marie: Sales call right.

393
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.350
Dan: You know.

394
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.150
Tina Marie: And then they either buy or they don't buy.

395
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:55.200
Tina Marie: Yep, and products add new and flowy.

396
00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.530
Dan: Yeah.

397
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.370
Tina Marie: Close.

398
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.159
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Found for a sales call.

399
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.510
Tina Marie: Oh, wait. Okay. So phone order.

400
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.840
Tina Marie: Yes.

401
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:22.320
Tina Marie: There. Okay, that name, Dan Fluey cool.

402
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.790
Tina Marie: And then they get onboarded right?

403
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:29.640
Dan: Yeah.

404
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.120
Tina Marie: And

405
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.259
Tina Marie: how does that happen? Is it?

406
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.870
Tina Marie: Yeah, how does that happen?

407
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.620
Dan: Onboarding.

408
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.240
Tina Marie: Yeah.

409
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:49.910
Dan: So they they sign up for the they pay, they pay whatever.

410
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.320
Dan: and then they schedule a call with Johnny or Sean.

411
00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:05.099
Dan: or actually it goes to Johnny or Sean, and then Johnny and Shawn start gathering the info from them. So they'll do it via email. They'll do it via text. They'll do it via

412
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:13.760
Dan: call call whatever. They just start gathering all the data. There's like a force

413
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:22.900
Dan: 4 or 5 steps in the onboarding. So they go. They just go through step by step, and they gather the chunks of data for each step.

414
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:30.020
Dan: The 1st chunk is like, what's the name of the band. What's this? What's that? Right? So they're all segregated into like

415
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:43.939
Dan: like band info. And then it's catalog info, and then it's blah blah! If they have a domain, they'll get to that. But when that step comes up they'll transfer the domain or get access to the domain, whatever it is. Actually, they don't get access to the domain.

416
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.470
Tina Marie: I'm gonna ask you to repeat that if that's okay.

417
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:52.680
Dan: I don't really know them. So it's like, it's like 5. I would say, it's 5 steps, and it's

418
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:58.660
Dan: but I don't. I I'm gonna know them really well, because they just fixed my onboarding this morning.

419
00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.775
Tina Marie: Well, can you like just say what you said because it's gonna be really.

420
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:09.300
Dan: Like artist, info, catalog, info, social and website, info, like those are.

421
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:15.719
Dan: And then I think I think that might be it.

422
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.560
Dan: Maybe it's yeah, so maybe it's like 4 steps.

423
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.520
Tina Marie: Website.

424
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.209
Dan: Well, that's like website and branding like all that gets gathered in one chunk.

425
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:42.870
Dan: But the 1st one's artist info they like get the name of the band. How many members? And then there's all kinds of like it, writes the back catalog, and then they go get catalog, info back catalog, latest catalog. Then they go get the branding stuff images.

426
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.450
Dan: Website. So it's like, probably like.

427
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:54.589
Dan: And then there's another step that's like social and dsp info, I think that's its own step where they're just gathering like links

428
00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.640
Dan: which we're. I'm having an app written for right now.

429
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:05.020
Tina Marie: What is dsp, stand for.

430
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.400
Dan: A digital streaming platform.

431
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.850
Tina Marie: Oh, cool! I'll probably forget that.

432
00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:13.060
Dan: Okay, you're good.

433
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.529
Dan: You'll hear it a lot.

434
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.950
Tina Marie: And then so.

435
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:33.520
Dan: So there's a thank you. Page also, before this, right? So if you get disqualified, you go to the thank you, page. If you decline to book a call. You go to the thing. They have the option like book a call or no. Thanks. I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing right. There's that whole bit.

436
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.540
Dan: So the thank you. Page is like, before all this.

437
00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:43.360
Tina Marie: Before. Where? Sorry. So there's the custom page where they're watching the video. And it's book a call to.

438
00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.409
Dan: It'd be like, right below that. Yeah.

439
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.190
Tina Marie: Okay?

440
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.139
Tina Marie: And we'll call that custom page.

441
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

442
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.140
Dan: Oh, good. You're connected. Okay.

443
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.330
Dan: Below the middle one.

444
00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:02.980
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, sorry let me just undo undo undo.

445
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.230
Tina Marie: But you touch.

446
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.999
Tina Marie: Do you want to attach sir?

447
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:11.460
Tina Marie: Nope?

448
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.110
Dan: Okay.

449
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.740
Tina Marie: There we go. I see a little error.

450
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.552
Tina Marie: Okay, and this is

451
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.090
Tina Marie: So it's no thanks. But what else is happening? If anything.

452
00:46:25.895 --> 00:46:27.679
Dan: They go into automation.

453
00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:34.509
Dan: So we like pitch them well, there's a couple automations that are on on here like.

454
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.820
Dan: ultimately, we want them all to go to the

455
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:45.739
Dan: the submit a song page. Right? So there's an automation. That's a 3 day automation that tries to drive them to that page, and then it quits.

456
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.000
Dan: So the thank you pay. No, actually, I don't think there's any.

457
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.840
Tina Marie: The song, submit sequence.

458
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:59.820
Dan: No, there isn't. I don't think there is. So if they if they get to the thank you, Page, we do nothing. And then that turned into Mark, sending a cold DM

459
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.049
Dan: or cold SMS that turned into 22 calls. So we're gonna turn his cold

460
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:09.750
Dan: message into that, and maybe just do the exact same thing

461
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:19.949
Dan: making this up right now. So let's say we wait for a hundred leads to accrue, and then we say, Hey, when we get to a hundred leads, send the cold DM.

462
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:28.950
Dan: Or send the cold SMS, and then 0 out the lead counter, and then wait for a hundred, and then send it because he sent it to 400

463
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.519
Dan: and got essentially too many calls.

464
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.820
Dan: So you could spread that out.

465
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.941
Dan: I would probably do that.

466
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:38.730
Dan: So I'm.

467
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:39.140
Tina Marie: Okay.

468
00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.420
Dan: It's like a 1. It's like an s. 1 SMS. Follow up.

469
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:48.200
Tina Marie: Decline call bucket will get cold. DM, later. Does this like kinda.

470
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.189
Dan: Yeah. And then we're gonna

471
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:57.670
Dan: at some point. They're gonna get invited to the community like, that's not in here yet, but that will be in here, and it might be

472
00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:05.049
Dan: after this we would invite them to the community and then and then have that cold SMS Timer running.

473
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:06.750
Dan: I don't know

474
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:12.400
Dan: I haven't worked that part out yet. But for now we would just send this. We'd just do what worked

475
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.079
Dan: like, okay, that work. We should. We should automate that.

476
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.579
Tina Marie: I'm gonna put this invite to community.

477
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:37.800
Tina Marie: This is just kind of a visualization. But when you're looking at it this way, in my opinion, and you just tell me it's a waste of time. It kind of lets you go. Oh, yeah, there might be a gap here, or

478
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:43.720
Tina Marie: this is not going to be automated. But we know that this works. And so it's a future thing or something like that.

479
00:48:43.960 --> 00:49:05.429
Tina Marie: and might be really helpful for Eric. Just go. Okay, totally see it. And Eric will probably have good questions, because he already knows how you operate. And then, on the music side of it, the artist side of it. Having worked with so many more, the guys might go. You know what? Maybe we should do this, that or the other thing.

480
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:06.955
Dan: Yeah.

481
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.569
Tina Marie: How am I in your account? I logged into mine.

482
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.248
Dan: I don't have an account.

483
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.190
Tina Marie: Oh, I must have just set it up

484
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.455
Tina Marie: with you, cause the last time I was in here it was for you, anyway.

485
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.540
Dan: I'm like, I don't have an account. I might have access to that one. But I yeah.

486
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.078
Tina Marie: Okay? So yeah, that's probably

487
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:36.479
Tina Marie: Because we did do this. Well, we started down this path once to kind of visualize

488
00:49:37.950 --> 00:50:01.040
Tina Marie: blah, blah. The thing I like about a thing like Guru right is, it is not campaign. It's not platform specific, because some people and I would say most people cannot wrap their heads around different verbiage and language they're like, but it's not here. It's not called this. It's not called that. Okay.

489
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.460
Tina Marie: Don't worry about the label. Don't worry about the platform language and verbiage.

490
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:15.269
Tina Marie: Consider the action right, and figure how to make that action happen within the platform that you're working with.

491
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:21.279
Tina Marie: Anyway, it's just good mapping, I think. Okay, so

492
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.850
Tina Marie: we have so the custom. Thank you. Page here.

493
00:50:27.918 --> 00:50:36.169
Tina Marie: So they go to the Facebook ad, and they either get the email to submit your song or custom page. You said, Yeah.

494
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.950
Dan: Say that again.

495
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:45.670
Tina Marie: When you said they came from the Facebook Ad. You said there's 2 things that could happen, but they don't both happen either.

496
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:51.859
Dan: Yeah, most most people do not end up going to the page from the Facebook lead ad because they don't know to.

497
00:50:52.340 --> 00:51:03.739
Dan: I don't know if you've ever seen a lead ad. Thank you, Page, it's not obvious. It's a button, but some people do click it, and then they just go directly to the page. They skip the email essentially.

498
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:14.109
Dan: More people get the email click on the link or get several emails click on the link in the email and then end up on that page. But either way, it's to that page.

499
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.599
Dan: So they either go direct from the ad to the page, or they go into the email to the page.

500
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:27.030
Tina Marie: Okay, so I'm just gonna do it like this.

501
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:29.510
Tina Marie: Let's see.

502
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:33.610
Tina Marie: Well, this, how do I connect this to that also?

503
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:44.130
Tina Marie: And I connect both of them, because this has 2 connections.

504
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:50.930
Tina Marie: So and that's not how this works. It's not no email. Then they get the custom page.

505
00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.139
Tina Marie: That's not how that works.

506
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:59.330
Tina Marie: It's email or don't break you.

507
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.890
Tina Marie: Let's see.

508
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:10.190
Tina Marie: Oh, change the connectors. So go to the email or

509
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.170
Tina Marie: copy paste

510
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:22.530
Tina Marie: this.

511
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.289
Tina Marie: Oh, well, I don't know how that works. I'll figure that out.

512
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:34.990
Tina Marie: That's that's not right, anyway. So I know it goes there. And then it. Yeah.

513
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:44.310
Tina Marie: Content options customize interesting. Okay?

514
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:51.930
Tina Marie: So they're this. It's it's either they don't do anything, or it's this, do you do retargeting.

515
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.510
Dan: No.

516
00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.529
Tina Marie: Okay, are you going to?

517
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:59.090
Tina Marie: Okay.

518
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.109
Tina Marie: even if they like, watch all of. So what is this ad? Is it a video? Or what is it.

519
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.682
Dan: I have no idea.

520
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.120
Dan: Never seen it.

521
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:17.299
Dan: I think it's I think it's it might be the a video of a band.

522
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:23.499
Dan: and they're like, submit your song to get on the radio. It's it's yeah. It's like, super basic.

523
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:33.409
Tina Marie: So if it is a video, and a person watches all of it, would you not consider retargeting a person that's watched all the video.

524
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.740
Tina Marie: we're not 50%.

525
00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:46.319
Dan: No, because the leads are 48 cents, and I'm like whatever. I'll just keep going cold. I'll just keep going deeper into that, like you don't take the offer. I don't want you to submit your song now.

526
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.888
Dan: like right? It's like, Buy whatever

527
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:56.409
Dan: there's no like you'll you likely will just make the leads more expensive, retargeting

528
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.820
Dan: because the conversion rate will go down. So I'm like, at 48 cents. I'm like dude. We could run this all day.

529
00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.670
Dan: and we're only targeting one genre.

530
00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.329
Dan: It's only rock.

531
00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:13.969
Dan: So if we can figure this all out, then it's like, Oh, now go do country, which is huge.

532
00:54:14.737 --> 00:54:20.130
Dan: Then go do pop, but we're just gonna stick in this one sub genre. At the moment.

533
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.000
Tina Marie: New project.

534
00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:32.960
Tina Marie: So I can just give you this link if you wanted it to kind of share a visual

535
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.430
Tina Marie: or not.

536
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.265
Dan: Yeah.

537
00:54:37.706 --> 00:54:46.840
Tina Marie: It's account cause I know. When I logged into it it had watch down at Basis rocks

538
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.760
Tina Marie: unable to find account. Okay, never mind then?

539
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.320
Tina Marie: No, that wasn't it. It's a share. Button.

540
00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.519
Tina Marie: How is it due to one o'clock already? Share a map with simulation? There's not even that

541
00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:13.159
Tina Marie: active link. Yes. Oh, okay, sure map. And I'm just gonna drop it into text.

542
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.830
Tina Marie: Or I could email it, would you prefer email.

543
00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.340
Dan: Yeah.

544
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:29.469
Tina Marie: Yeah, let me do that, Daniel song, Brian Guru Link.

545
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:43.949
Tina Marie: and then I didn't hear any kind of thing that should be captured for a task.

546
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:45.360
Tina Marie: Yeah.

547
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.840
Dan: To do the I need to do this, the

548
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.910
Dan: the lead on the lead like the lead counter.

549
00:55:55.670 --> 00:56:06.870
Dan: but it's not leads. It's like the song submits song. Submit. Did not book a call lead counter? I need to start counting those people and then auto SMS them. The mark SMS that worked.

550
00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:13.490
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Okay, so let me just make sure.

551
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:18.900
Dan: Yeah, it's like qualified, that didn't qualified and did not book call like, you want to start to count those.

552
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.160
Tina Marie: Alright! Let me.

553
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:33.189
Dan: No, actually, I think he just emailed. I think he texted everyone that submitted a song that did not book a call. I don't know. I'll have to ask him. I actually need to know. I don't know who he did. He might have just done literally everyone

554
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.540
Dan: but he. Now he knows how to.

555
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:39.120
Dan: you know. Thought I'll find out. I got to build it around. What he did.

556
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:41.460
Tina Marie: Right? So you need to. You need to find out.

557
00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:45.669
Dan: Yeah, I gotta confirm, I think, he told me. But I'm not 100% on that.

558
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:49.089
Dan: Do you want me to throw this ball? Is that why you're throwing the ball at.

559
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.789
Tina Marie: Is it zinnia, or.

560
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.319
Dan: Oh, it's Bell.

561
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.150
Tina Marie: So.

562
00:56:55.150 --> 00:57:00.049
Dan: Jeez this dog. This dog loves me. It's so crazy.

563
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.990
Dan: Hi!

564
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:06.747
Dan: She's my Bestie Denise is like she likes you the best I'm like, I know.

565
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.550
Tina Marie: She is Dan's dog.

566
00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:30.810
Tina Marie: Hudson is my baby. When I was gone last week, because I went to Salt Lake City for that conference, and man, he went nuts. I'm so glad when he came back, and he like when we started the call he just needed to be up on my shoulder for a few minutes, he'll he'll go and be off, but if I'm out of the room, or if I haven't held him for a while, he's like you need to hold me for a few minutes, and then I'm good.

567
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.010
Tina Marie: Oh, I'm good with that.

568
00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:45.809
Tina Marie: Okay, so it so the other zoom change that they made, and of course there were no notifications or anything, but I noticed the folder changes, so it used to be as in like a week.

569
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:57.369
Tina Marie: maybe 2 weeks ago. I would get a transcript in my zoom folder of all my call recordings right? So I could just run that through chat gpt, and it was recorded locally. But

570
00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:07.729
Tina Marie: yeah, hold on. I'll go off on another thing in just a second about it, but but it changed the files to a zoom specific file extension.

571
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:18.500
Tina Marie: And I don't even know if that is the transcript, because I have to go figure out how I can even open it and access it. So it completely changed the file structure for the recordings.

572
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:21.370
Tina Marie: And then there's this

573
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:47.110
Tina Marie: disappearing of our meeting, and I know it exists because this meeting is the only one that gets recorded to the cloud, because I always run out of cloud space. And this was the 1st one that was set up as a cloud, recording everything else records locally. So I know it exists, existed right cause. I would always be able to go there to go get. I'd have to go there to get my transcripts where everything else was locally.

574
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:59.709
Tina Marie: Anyway, it keeps flipping, changing, and it's changing quickly, and I can't keep up with it, and it's annoying, because I don't even know. None of the changes are obvious until it's call time.

575
00:59:01.242 --> 00:59:06.967
Dan: But it did capture the their AI companion that is

576
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:23.689
Tina Marie: What's the word native now did capture the so it says, set up lead, counter, and automate SMS for our song submitters who did not book a call using Mark successful template. So that will. That's clear enough for you to remember what it was right.

577
00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:27.803
Dan: Yeah, plus I was. I was about to

578
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.019
Dan: send something to Stacey, if you're like, I gotta. But I'm gonna text mark and be like.

579
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.779
Dan: Oh, no, I think I gotta go look. I think he made a smart list.

580
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.600
Tina Marie: Oh, like in high, level.

581
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.390
Dan: Yeah.

582
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:50.720
Tina Marie: Okay, so I'm going to email this to you. These are the 3 things that the companion grabbed as a task list

583
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.350
Tina Marie: tasks. You want me to CC. Stacy, or have you edit it, and then you forward it to her.

584
00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:58.750
Dan: I'll edit it.

585
00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:04.199
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's probably okay. So there, that sent off to you, sir.

586
01:00:05.205 --> 01:00:33.610
Tina Marie: And I sent the Guru link to it just to kinda help visualize what I didn't grab. And hopefully my companion notes will give it to me because you mentioned some dates for targets of like when you're working on things. Obviously it'll be what it'll be. But I like seeing what you were visualizing as a target date, right? And then kind of measuring it against what actually happens?

587
01:00:34.127 --> 01:00:37.920
Tina Marie: You know. What was it? A bigger.

588
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:46.409
Tina Marie: you know, scope than intended or like whatever I like looking at? How, how it, how it actually broke down.

589
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.679
Tina Marie: So I'll look for those things.

590
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.520
Dan: Target dates for, like the book funnel and stuff, you mean.

591
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.200
Tina Marie: Yeah.

592
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.520
Dan: Yeah, yeah, okay.

593
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:58.259
Tina Marie: Yeah, this is like this should be done by April first, st and then this is probably like June.

594
01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:58.620
Dan: Yeah, like.

595
01:00:58.922 --> 01:00:59.829
Tina Marie: It's not dynamic.

596
01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:09.570
Dan: Yeah. So like just seeing like the book funnel I've been, it's I mean, it's not even in the meeting. I've just been working it on the side.

597
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:16.115
Dan: because then when the book was supposed to get done, and then I was like, I'm just gonna start working on this book funnel.

598
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.080
Dan: So yeah, we don't even talk about it. It's it's

599
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:26.110
Dan: it's not even so that's why I'm like, it's definitely gonna be next quarter, because we can't add a rock. There's no adding rocks.

600
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:30.400
Dan: because it wasn't. If it wasn't important enough in January. It's not an important thing now.

601
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:35.810
Dan: but I can ship. I can get an advance on it, regardless.

602
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:41.109
Tina Marie: As in like you working on it in advance.

603
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:41.980
Dan: Totally.

604
01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:44.477
Tina Marie: I was like, wait, I'll go first.st

605
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.230
Tina Marie: It's that afternoon like post lunch, slumpy time.

606
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:53.840
Tina Marie: nappy time, except I don't really want to nap. I got things to do, sir.

607
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.810
Dan: Use.

608
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:58.939
Tina Marie: Did you know that Mark is considering a schnoodle.

609
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:00.980
Dan: What?

610
01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:05.680
Tina Marie: So his mom has a schnoodle, Ronan. You've seen Ronan right.

611
01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:10.330
Dan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm like, Schnoodle.

612
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:11.210
Tina Marie: Okay, right?

613
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.920
Tina Marie: You yeah.

614
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.330
Dan: Out there, Doodle.

615
01:02:14.574 --> 01:02:19.570
Tina Marie: Yeah. So anyway, he had sent a picture of a puppy

616
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:28.760
Tina Marie: a while ago. I was like, Are you getting one? So I I think he's shopping like slowly, but anyway, that would be good for him.

617
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:34.920
Dan: Would it is, get a new get a new buddy.

618
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.050
Tina Marie: Yes.

619
01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:37.929
Dan: Better than a Porsche. This is true.

620
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:48.439
Tina Marie: Yes, better for his soul. And also he was doing really good when he went for walks and stuff, and but he can't do it right now, because he can't move for like another month

621
01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:56.939
Tina Marie: or end of April till end of a long time he can move, but like he has to be really careful, and puppies are not something you can be careful with.

622
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.460
Dan: Wait? Why can't he move?

623
01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.240
Tina Marie: His back.

624
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.129
Dan: Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah.

625
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.792
Dan: Forgot about that.

626
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:09.989
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's a big deal like he's. It's it's a degen degenerative issue.

627
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.899
Tina Marie: And he's trying to avoid surgery, which.

628
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.570
Dan: Gotta go get the stem cell injections head out to Costa Rica.

629
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.719
Tina Marie: He is. Well, he's not going to Costa Rica, but he is getting stem cells. I think.

630
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.710
Dan: Yeah, you could. You could probably get it in Hollywood.

631
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.019
Tina Marie: He's getting Peptides. I don't.

632
01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.980
Tina Marie: There you go.

633
01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:35.320
Tina Marie: stem cells, but he's doing like all the things he can for sure, like what do you call it?

634
01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.810
Dan: Has degenerative disc disease.

635
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:43.410
Tina Marie: I don't think that is the name of this thing. It it is

636
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:52.879
Tina Marie: a degenerative disease. It's in the spine. I think it's at the disc level. It felt like it was something a little bit more specific.

637
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.809
Tina Marie: but essentially yes.

638
01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:05.310
Dan: It's either the disk or it's the the goop between the discs. It's 1 or the other right? It's probably the other. It's probably not the bone. It's probably the whatever it's.

639
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:30.439
Tina Marie: Is shrinking that shouldn't be shrinking. It's probably the disc I can't remember for sure. But anyway, yeah, so no puppy for right now while he's trying to heal, because, oh, my gosh, I had to go buy a new TV because my like 65 inch just shattered, which is funny, because it only shattered on the inside, so like if you turn it on, it looks like broken glass, but on the front you can't see it.
