00:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey, I'm kind of groggy.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was late working on this and then up early working on this.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, how about now?
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, can you hear me?
00:00:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can hear you.
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Beautiful. Okay.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You look great. I'm going do it.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hah. Mapping.
00:00:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You look good. You're like shocked.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is three day old hair.
00:00:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. I was up late working on this and then I was up early working on this and but I was doing a good job. But now it needs to go through because I don't know what it's missed and I always miss something. And so let me share my screen with you. Yes. By the way, I just I'm a dive right in sometimes.
00:00:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, let's dive in here in that mojo. So let's do it. Because I try to look at it but I couldn't because it's all HTML and then I try to for the HTML, HTML and do a ClickFunnels page and I still couldn't look at it.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. So I didn't know if that was going to work okay or not. Yeah, that's okay.
00:01:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I clicked the Claude thing. It didn't open up Claude for me.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it was weird. Yeah. Well, that's annoying. Okay. I actually had two chats. No, wait a minute, but if I opened it from my computer, it worked good. Okay. So let me just open everything because some of them are there are variations. Yeah. And I'll show you everything.
00:01:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then these ones I know don't This one I really liked. And actually the first and it did so let me go to published and anyone should be able to go to it oh did you open in that right let's just publish um let me just do this in a new tab no not paste and search paste and go and then there's one and did we have this feed
00:03:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a must we have old school sales pages.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at that, eh? Yeah, because that's what we have. I was just basic Asian.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. Yep.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So it, um, we're really focusing on. The content, but in when we're thinking about the formatting, what I want to think about in the formatting is the. Digestibility of it, flow of it. So the way that it's broken up, not necessarily like the colors, the bullets, but more dissectioning. So it, I thought it did a good job. gave it instruction, but it actually, so I just clogged and said, chat GPT is actually degraded since the summer.
00:03:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm actually trying to clog better too.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use cloud yesterday for some stuff. Yeah. So, um, and it does this. It does some formatting, which really helps. visually and so anyway um so we're gonna bump around bump around jump around my brain is not on fire yet nobody I love this 30 minute YouTube quick start love it hey watch this though like it has this whole so we could get a developer who knows code and who could just take this and put it on a webpage for us if we wanted to make it like it so if we hosted on hosted somewhere and it doesn't matter I'm just talking about this is a possibility it's not necessary and we done different places but that also thing okay that can also be used like take a screenshot of that and use that in an ad or demo it in an ad here hey let me show and tell so many things so once the after we go through and get everything done correctly and we you feel like it captured everything that you had then I want to go with it and have it make some sales copy So, we can think of, you know, what to add, level copy, what social media level copy for X for Instagram, for Facebook, because they've got different links, you know, then, you know, a YouTube video for you and like, give you ideas there, landing, sales, copy, VSL, like, whatever, because what the cloud has done better than it ever did before, because I just stopped using it for a while, chat GPT-4, oh, killed it, is the logical and thoroughness of its logic. I did almost nothing. I just started with, here's, you know, a transcript, and we're going to go through and take as much of the content as we can left but it needs to maintain Maria's voice and personality and then after that when we're finished we're going to work on copy and then I'll actually go through and show you the original chat because it said okay here's what I think that we should do and I was like that is the most thorough ever but then when it actually kept your voice and personality and it said I'm going to use highlights of what she said and it gave quotes throughout I was like chat to be like that so okay okay so I these are the instructions I gave it can you read it or I can read it to you yeah this is a transcript of a training we just did the goals to extract what was taught into a user guide uh yeah I got it okay so um I wanted you to see what it started with Because I told it to give me questions that it needed to ask me in order to be successful. And so it gave me these and I answered everything and then it broke down an outline and then we went to the format and anyway, so we got that. So starting with, so this is the Quick Start Guide. Let me let's just break this down and see if you feel like anything's missing. So that's what we're going to do now. I've got the no ticker on and the total I didn't teach everything right because it ended.
00:07:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I mean, not teaching the last two phases, which was how I kind of glossed over it, but I told him, hey, being in the members area that how to upload it to YouTube. And then just like how to engage with people or no, the next part was on how to hire VA to help you with a lot of this.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I want. us to do today is look for anything that is missing that you said that it didn't capture.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then we will go through and add anything that didn't get said that you want to add once we've got this structure.
00:08:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Makes sense. That means I have to remember what I said.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something might stand up to you as you're reviewing this and if not, and you can look at it and go, oh, you know what, and what I would like you to do is either you can take notes or you can tell me because we got the note taker. But something I need to add in there is blank. So that will also be very effective because then I can go take this transcript and say we reviewed the work. Here's what we found is missing. Let's incorporate what was missing. But we have the best cheapest free assistant ever.
00:08:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, $20 a month. Amazing. Okay. Yeah, notes from November 12 call. I'm just putting it in the shared document that you shared with me. of the Google Drive of all the HTML documents.
00:09:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That did nothing.
00:09:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hahaha. Cool.
00:09:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Alright, so find your golden video, did you, how does this look for you?
00:09:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Search your main topic.
00:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
quick start. This is not thorough.
00:09:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yes, there might be a pre-start you tell me if you think we should include it where I kind of tell them initially find three other YouTubers that are publishing content that you want to publish like and you can start following it to know what's working, what's not working. But that's high level pre-research but this is specific to find your golden video and that is it.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I want to make sure that we do include that because I like that. When I'm teaching people, one of the things that I tell them is I never follow anybody's particular plan. I kind of triangulate my own my patient and my path through other people. Nobody's doing exactly what feels right to me, so I love including that somewhere. Wouldn't it work better if we go through the whole thing working backwards so you can see how thorough it already is or is not, and then come back to the Quick Star Guide?
00:10:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is out of order.
00:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this could be a great sales pitch because I think old school is back again just telling you.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It never left. have been people that have been using it this whole time and it's still been converting.
00:10:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't know, but let me go over this.
00:10:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where do This meta website, the secret website coming to play because I know she said grab tag, it said grab tags from keywords anywhere under to find your golden video. The last step, the last step is really, oops, sorry, we're a top right? Golden video finder.
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Where the heck? Wait a minute. Oh, I'm in the wrong thing. Sorry.
00:11:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no. So say video transfer tags and keywords anywhere. Um, So, yeah, because the video, when you use keywords anywhere, it's more, um, it puts the video transcript into Chappet GBT or cloud.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So first of all, this is wrong. It's keywords anywhere, keywords everywhere.
00:11:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is that correct? Well, let me double check because I keep forgetting and say it wrong. hold on. Keywords. No, it's everywhere.
00:11:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You got it. Oh, it got it.
00:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so it's great.
00:12:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, first of all, these, so just, this is interesting, because this is two variations of the same thing. I asked it to do this for this formatting, after it put this, it created it. I'm sorry, there's so many tabs, I'm like, which one, and then do them to move. Okay. So, I can't see the top of this, the abundance analysis, finding profitable topic clusters. Oh, these are the tools, it didn't keep the, I don't even know if you can see it, it didn't keep the formatting. Okay, and then research and planning, finding or winning, okay, so this was breaking research down. I'm going to YouTube search your main topic. Yes, so you I don't it doesn't seem like it caught if you did say it select select to use chat chippity for video summary. Okay.
00:13:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you can save the transcript and tags. I mean you couldn't keep that in there. But chat chippity puts the transcript I use chat chippity or I would add or Claude can you modify it or do you want to modify it but but we will. I can I can put it as notes right yes so anything that you can because I could do that but it will work better if you do that and I'm cuz I'm using the AI version under step two.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because how amazing could it be if we have beta version or whatever by the end of this week.
00:13:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It would be amazing.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not really what I'm working for I'm I wanted to have it done. and I was just like depressed, but last night, I'm like, you know what, I'm going to sit in my bed and watch Big Bang Theory and work from my laptop and I love that. No, with the heating pad.
00:14:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what's all that I did? Should I say for video AI summary or just video summary? Yeah, just video summary, yeah. Save transcript. The safe transcript is to the, I might be a little later. I'm going to leave it, hold it there, five steps out, but, but it says, save transcript and tags. We don't need to save, save transcript and then I'll say, don't say tags because that secret site I tell them to go to will list off all the tags. So, it's like a duplicate stuff they don't need to do.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did list the secret site, didn't you? Tell them.
00:14:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I showed them how to
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I went through and it, you kept referring, you must have done it a lot because it went through training and then it went into sales copy. It was like, and this secret site and it really got persuasional, like trying to get people to buy. I'm like, you're supposed to nothing hold back. Like this is the course. And then like, I'm sorry.
00:15:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I lost. I forgot what the goal was. Well, that's funny. No, because whenever I do training, I always tease them so that they can continue watching the training, even if they paid for it. So that's what I was doing.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do this for me real quick. Just give us that line. I'm going to hit highlight in the step. So read what's there, fix what's missing.
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Very short version. Right now, okay. So the step four, it says, select, use JatchPPT for video summary. That changes to select, use JatchPPT or use Claude for video summary. The number Five is save transcripts in a Google Doc that you will use in into the secret site called MW metadata and when you insert the YouTube video it'll tell you the tags that the video is using and also that the channel is using that's correct that's the one yeah I put it aside so I can grab it sorry I didn't want to interrupt you know I think I think that's good. So yeah, we can leave as that.
00:17:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. So I don't have a call until 130. I need a half an hour before them. But if it depending on how much time you have and how focused you are on getting version A done this week, like I would really love to do that and get some momentum.
00:17:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so step three research documentation, open research planning spreadsheet, enter channel name and URL, all of that.
00:17:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does that look? Yeah.
00:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's. Okay. I'm thinking maybe we could go high level top to bottom. So what I can do is get all of this and put it into a we could either do this together like this, because my experience is that with my visionaries, me extra. seeing it this way actually gets a better job done faster than if I say here's the doc now you go fix it but I don't know you. I don't know.
00:18:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that what you said?
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what said? Well I'm saying would that be better or would it be better if I just go dump all of this into a document and you just go fill it in because as soon as we've got everything complete then we go give it to Maui to make it I don't know if that's the way your brain works because for me if I were gonna do it I need somebody to be quiet and let me think of let me just fill in the blanks and do the process that I know but if I am not sure about what I should include then I need somebody there so I can say well should I do this but I do that kind of thing.
00:18:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No I think if you just let me edit this I think that might be easier.
00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's let's do this.
00:19:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This was useless. Um, let's go.
00:19:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so I was thinking like maybe like YouTube traffic and profits. I don't know. There's a lot of YouTube traffic. But I was like, how do we use less words?
00:19:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I still like YouTube fast track to be honest.
00:19:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
YouTube fast track.
00:19:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because it's like, it really is a fast track.
00:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is.
00:19:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's though for the goal, but I can take care of it. Like, you know, but the take line could take care of it.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And the other thing is sometimes ambiguous works well because people visualize in their own minds what they want. And either way, they're going to learn how to get eyeballs on YouTube. And that is the goal of anybody on YouTube is to get eyeballs. So, um, depends on what they want. do. So complete YouTube publishing guide.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see how and just input two things for you two regards to that. I'm seeing some pages, low ticket offers now that are doing really well, sales pages that don't even mention the name of the product to later on, like the headline carries it and you don't even know the product name until later on.
00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and here's the thing that I know that there is no, you can't follow any particular formula and be guaranteed to work. There's always some nuance to it so like and things that you think won't work will work and things that you think will work won't work and so you know wow it's keeping some really cool formatting in here. I'm just gonna keep this because it didn't keep the formatting. Oh, I like that, But this looks amazing. Yay, I wanted you to be happy. I wanted to show up for you and, like, you feel like you're not having to do all this stuff yourself and that.
00:21:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't think I'm actually having that stuff. Once we get rocking with this, trust me, I know that you're really, it's already helped a lot, but I know that you're going to be way, way more. Really, it's on some of the stuff to help conversions and stuff.
00:21:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I'm looking forward to that part. OK, so this isn't highlighted, so I must want to have gotten that yet. Wait, and this one was? OK, perfect. I'm, like, trying to keep track of, did I get in here? What did I not? So I'm just going to leave it as is there are clearly some things that are missing or whatever. we already did that. I think I opened it twice. That is for sure the same thing. OK. OK, the abundance analysis, did I already open that also? Hold on minute. I'm just gonna plug in my thumb already, what is this look different, it does look different. All right, the difference is these things check boxes, let me just see. Did it, oh I like that one, all right, what's the same, so I already have that quick start guide, we already did that, I'm almost positive, okay, yeah we did, and then complete publishing guide, that was the first thing that we had. Okay. And then now we've got this, which I have no idea how that's going to copy over, but we will try it. It's good enough. I mean, it's useful. And then this is the now. I did have a page where it said what everybody thought about it. So let me find that real quick and make sure we get that in here. Reference template complete for today. Audience. All right. It wasn't this chat. Which one was I in just now? Use your garden sales copy for a trip. Okay, so I need this one. Yes. Oh, participant feedback, okay, publish, go there. really liked this. You see this?
00:24:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I know, like one per speed 1200 for Sean's and Peter paid 754, that's pretty funny.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, oh wait, and there was also a question-answer thing. Okay, so I'm going to do this, put that in here, and let me go find the question-answer section. Oh wait, that was, it was in here also. It did a really good job with that. Interact it.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Question. Share all the questions and answer.
00:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm meeting myself because they're cutting a tree down to my neighbors, so it's like loud, I hope you can hear it.
00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not at all. Wow. Not anything. Okay, this was great, I thought.
00:25:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is all because you were so thorough in your preparation and in your conversation. conversation. So there's not a ton of reworking to be done.
00:26:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because honestly, I think it was good to charge $100 to because you got quality people on the call to ask good questions.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you brought that up. So anyway, yes, big in it got big view in here. Remember, you were like, it didn't when I did chat to be teach that you be teaching catch view. this did. So this stock, this is the last of it. This stock is shared with you. I would just love is now you can take all the formatting out if you want to or make a copy of it, and take all the formatting out, highlight what type of formatting you might like, because whatever instruction we can give of like, hey, you know, let's do quote sections like this, go and keep the quotes, but like, you know, let's do this to a quote section. Any visual examples that you have that you like, he does a really good job if we have something to pattern after. Creating a really good looking PDF usually runs us around $12550 but he uses Adobe InDesign and like every page. It's a long process. I don't know if you've ever used InDesign but we can also get a good like book cover. saw that, you know, what you call a power graphic. He'll make all of those. love giving him work too. He's a daddy of three girls and a wife and just, you know, sweet family. But anyway, but he does great work. He is the nicest. He's like always, yes ma'am, no ma'am.
00:27:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you ma'am and nice.
00:27:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's just, he's just sweet and I've worked with him for like 11 years. anyway, would he want do video?
00:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two, like in Veed.io.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He, I don't know how good he is. He's willing to learn things.
00:28:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He also likes to smoke a lot of weed. He's not the fastest at stuff.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. And so learning things, I probably wouldn't want to give it to him.
00:28:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But the graphics, he does pretty good.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know where he's been doing it so long. So to me, this is it. This is the job for the week. And there's not really anything I can help with until we know that we've got the content in there. I can help extract if you have, know, like, should we do this? Should we do that? If it is helpful to the process, and especially if, so, I like to think of the neurodivergent. We've had this conversation before, right? there's two things about it. One, too much information. It's overwhelming. So, and you're actually really good about just being concise while giving a lot of things. So, there's a lot of variety, which is great for spicy brains, not too much information in that. So, know, go research this, that type of thing, like you're talking about three YouTubers that you like, and then here's the bullet points of what you're looking for. If they don't match this, know, find another one that you like, but matches this list, that kind of thing. Because what to me, what you're doing is you're giving a conditional logic training, and that is what is missing because none of us really can follow somebody's roadmap. Very few people will like, I can follow your roadmap and it doesn't tear at my soul. I don't get frustrated. You know what I mean? Like, it's really difficult for some people to follow other people's paths because it doesn't jot. with them one way or another. But when you explain to them the value of this action so that they can think for themselves and evaluate for themselves and also just giving them confidence. One of the things I think that we should do throughout the training is nobody's results are going to be identical, but you'll get to your best results by trying. And because this is a strategic approach, even if your results are different, they're still going to be better than if you don't follow a specific strategy. My sugar just spied with a crap. Yeah, it's so weird. But I worked out at the gym last night and I like pressed 415 pounds like a boss.
00:30:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's awesome. Congrats.
00:30:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was filling it today, but it's also my daughter. had some black jeans on. She goes those jeans make Look like you got a Brazilian butt left.
00:31:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
said, no, baby, my leg pressed me. Look like I got a Brazilian shot time with Tina. Yeah.
00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, um, this is it. I don't know if there's anything you'd like to talk about.
00:31:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got a question. Um, it starts what you input in there. It starts with video one video prep, which is like the editing. So don't you want to put the abundance analysis first?
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's like, I did. I don't have the order and you can copy, paste, and move. No, because I don't know how it came. And my brain was overwhelmed just going through this process, reading it all. So yeah, you, the order, you should definitely fix the order, the way that makes the most sense to you. Add what needs to be added. Don't worry about the formatting. But, um, if you write some notes, like there's comment notes, like, know how you can insert a comment suggestion, whatever, and just be like, I think this should be this way, whatever, then share this with Maui, and as it is, and let him go make a version. So the first thing that we'll have him do is make a cover graphic, because then what he does is on page one, he puts the cover graphic right here with the credits, who would, you know, copyright information, website information, all of that stuff, author picture, things like that, and then gets into the training guide, and the PDF will be in alignment with the picture that is the cover graphic. So I'll message him and let him know that that's coming. Now, having already done the majority of this, what's a good, like, when do you think you'll have a version ready to go of this, this document? Yeah, well actually once we hang up. want to work on it till it's done like I'm hoping it's not gonna be Here yeah, yeah, cuz we're in that momentum mode, right? So it's on my mind. So yeah, this is get her done Yes, and so then the next thing is we just we work on sales copy and we can figure out an Ad-budget process. However, you want to do ads or just YouTube traffic, whatever but let's create the thing that we're gonna fulfill and And then get to work at selling it and that's when we get to have lots of fun Yeah, so so this dog or says is one video prep.
00:33:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So if you if you scroll up, so Does it care to him if my formatting is not gonna be as pretty as that like if I copy and paste the buttons now No, that's where we're gonna know it's about we like this formatting.
00:33:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could care less about this formatting make suggestions about that's formatting Call out this highlight this news graphics here. Don't use it graphic there, I'd like a graphic that looks like this here, all the instruction about what you imagine, make this really pop and look good, write those comments down, but don't do it yourself. Now we will do a pretty good job.
00:34:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will not be perfect. And sometimes, okay, he smokes way too many tweets.
00:34:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I don't have to go back like three or four times, but but I will deal with him. You won't have to.
00:34:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, because I think what would be cool is showing images in here too.
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I cut paste images there. So if you also, one of the things that you could do is like make yourself a list of screenshots that you want to grab. And then give them to me or tell me where they need to go, or put them into yourself, whatever. And he can also like make a shadow box around it and make it look good. But if we get the screenshots that go with your content so that they know when they get to meta w whatever. Hey, yeah, this is the right side because this is what it looks like so that they confirm like I'm for sure on the right insight and there's something comforting about visual validation.
00:35:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, right?
00:35:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you go there like, Oh, that looks familiar. So it immediately takes out the anxiety, even though the only reason it's familiar is because they just saw it in this guy.
00:35:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? Yeah, no, it totally makes sense.
00:35:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So I'm so excited. I love that you took this like kind of detour really from where we're going though because because you were so thorough, so energetic, it fits perfectly. All the things I've already said, but yeah. Well, like I said, something to sink my teeth into, like I've been missing this.
00:35:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good. Well, and it kind of makes sense, really, because like it is, the people are sick of paid ads, even though we still, you still should use it to grow, right? But it's just silly. really am kicking myself for not going full-blown. YouTube years ago, right? being like, I feel I'm getting, and I'm just on all one video a week, I feel I'm getting like about 3,000 a month in pre-ad then with all the traffic and views that's being generated.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that you should include that. You can say like, I can't prove this, I can't it, don't report me to the three letter agencies. But like, like I said, Owen Hamza said one YouTube live will outperform every Facebook post this year. So, maybe you have some other YouTube or quotes with them, maybe you don't. Or maybe you don't say who they are, just give their initials about what they've said about the power of YouTube. And along with the quote of, the best time to pen a tree was 10 years ago, the second best time is today. And for example, Oh, because you've been doing this so long and I've been doing this so long. How many times that we heard people say this is dead. This doesn't work anymore. This is only for the big people now with the big money. It hasn't been true yet, since we've been doing it. It's not going to be true because You know, the equalizer is the algorithms. So just because the company is big and big budget doesn't mean that they have great content. Doesn't mean that they That they that they resonate with niche audiences and it's actually the niche audiences Where you can really stand out and where big business is never going to be able to get you and so And the other thing is you know when when Google bought YouTube and The data started combining that fed the algorithm It's only going to continue to improve the niche quality when you and I start
00:38:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you remember Site Builder? Oh, yeah, I used to have that, yeah.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so you could probably go look at Tina Springs, which is my last name that I don't use to keep myself safe. But and dog gifts and toys for dog owners or dog articles. I literally had somebody ask me one time, are you that Tina that writes dog articles? Because I did that for a year because my niche keyword research told me that if I did that long tail keyword, got dog gifts and toys for dog lovers, that I would dominate. And I did page one of Google all over the place. My articles were all over the place. I got, you know, traffic. And that was my first attempt in, I don't know, when was when was Site Builder? I feel like it was like 2004, five, somewhere around there. Yeah. But keyword domination, 20 years later.
00:39:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's still just as powerful as paid ads. And YouTube is the new keyword research because people want audio and video more than they want the text for the most part. But also because YouTube, since it has the transcript and the summary, combines audio, video and reading. And so people go to YouTube before most of the other things. And so, you know, if it took us 20 years to get to this point, you've got plenty of time if you're a listener and you don't get there quickly, you know, to be able to do this. Anyway, I know you know this stuff, but I also know, because I've worked with so many people on the, you know, pushing them through, as I know you have, they need to hear the reasons why they can do it. And, yeah. Okay. Cool.
00:40:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
hands. Okay. No, I want to go work on this. This is great.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will let you go. I will go hit up Maui and I can't wait to see what you get.
00:40:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Two big things. So to let you know you'd be proud of. I, um, consider these wins. I had someone who's been with me for over 15 years and she joined the school community, you know, and she bought the YouTube thing. Um, but she wanted to do a free call of me because the ages go. was offering that, right? So I was like, for you, I will, because you've been with me for so long, right? But this is where you'd be proud of me. The call was supposed to be earlier. And yesterday, I kind of took off to remember stay in the man to have the day off, but she sent me this email, like, like four paragraphs long, three attachments on it to prepare before our call. This is one of it. And I'm looking at it. And I didn't even read much video. So I went straight to my Facebook. I said, you Rebecca, I need to cancel today's meeting. We'll reschedule another time. I'm sorry, but I'm, you know, like, like, I just refused to do that kind of call, like getting on a call and just real quick, you're helping. But like, this was like $1,000 consult she was basically asking for.
00:41:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am very proud of you for that.
00:41:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm, I'm glad.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I better felt good though. Like, anxiety, frustration like that, that angst sometimes or just like, I don't know, and maybe, maybe you didn't.
00:41:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Maybe you were just like, so over it. No, sorry. mean, the old Maria would have taken the call, right? the new Maria just looked at that and went right away to Facebook and I said, sorry, I didn't really have much of an explanation.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, think I just said something's come up.
00:41:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But, you know, so, and then this is the other good news. While I drove Amanda yesterday, we did some stuff in town and shared a massage. Building shared a massage in was renting out off. space and it's the coolest office space like perfect and because we live in a small town this is how cheap it is for an office with a window $400 Canadian a month.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy heck that's like 330 us. That's like how much it costs to rent a cubicle in some place.
00:42:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah so so I rented it so I started with at least on Friday. That is so cool and the better yet it's on the third floor and you're walking down the hallway. Like I said I need a quiet place because the massage there because it's on the second floor and she said don't get the office that's next to me available because she said they're really loud like one more over than she was a hairstylist the two more over and that floor had a lot of hairstylist as well. So I said to my need a real quiet place because I got the perfect one that's available because there's a mortgage broker beside you who's barely there like a lot of people just like I only tend to use it like four hours a day maybe three days a week and yeah do my YouTube videos and poke.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right.
00:43:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
there's no office beside it because right against it's at the end right of the of the hallway. It's at the brick wall. And there's three windows that come in. So I'll have. So here like if the windows will be here, I'll have my desk right here so that when you're doing videos, the light from the windows is coming. Yes. So I might not even have to have to bring in my photography lights.
00:43:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I do have the box lights so if you can see it.
00:43:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's one box light and then there's one over here. So when it's a little darker, I put the two box lights like that way.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you do have to get it, I should send you.
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But the finishing of the story while the energy felt so good when the realtor owns the building was showing it to me because starting so small town, I got to meet the guy on the building. I can't believe it. goes in the coolest person is across from here the hallway. I said, Oh, Santa G? I'm like, do you mean Santa G? said, you need to check his website site out at santa g.com g e e so Santa then g e e.com. And he and he said the Royal York Hotel, is one of the most expensive and oldest hotels in Toronto, hires him through weeks and Christmas time to be the Santa. So he's from Sarnia and he looks like Santa, that's him, and he's across the office race. right away I said, just give him the lease, I'll take it. That's all I needed to see. And so on his office, office like plate signs says Santa G.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. We have a guy like that here and he everybody just calls him Santa and he looks like that all year long. That's awesome. So this light, that's a lot, so I turn it down because it casts a shadow, but it's got, look at the watch it change, so that's white light and then it gets too warm. But it has, it's just one light and it just clips to the desk and it's really nice. Right, but it's also great for just, like I get seasonally affected depression. It's good lighting. It was like $150. But I did a lot of research and the the people are really happy, but it also has light on the bar. So it's like, anyway, you can you have an above you. So the light's kind of coming down or do you have? Yeah, so it's it's right here.
00:45:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:45:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I about getting getting too. But either way, because it clips to the desk, it doesn't take any space.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just always there.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in terms of like, you know, studio lights and all these things, like, I think it's great lighting. Like, I feel there's definitely a video quality difference when I if I turn it off.
00:45:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. it converted to Canadian dollars and it said 214 instead of the 100. so look, it's new. My IP address was kind of that was pretty slick. Yeah, yeah. But they might have something I like that in Canada, because I bet you want to answer my information. It's probably going to say redonkulous shipping fee.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, it says shipping free.
00:46:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, that's an incentive to buy it.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe I will. I I'm really happy with that. I got a couple of things. And it does have this little, like, remote.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I saw that in the thing.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. So wherever you're at, you can just change the temperature, the brightness. And then you can click through if you want the bar, which I don't have lit.
00:46:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it bends and moves all over the place. But the quality of the light and to not think about it, and it doesn't take up any space. Because it's cool right over the desk. Anyway, new space thought I'll tell you.
00:46:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I like that. Yeah, I'll start with one just because, like, I don't know I want to do two.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, one one was all I needed. No matter how dark it is, it's perfect. And sometimes when it's darker, I just actually dim it. And it does good. But I did want to ask you one question, because I haven't seen your Bible updates, and I was wondering if you were still doing that, or like...
00:47:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know, it's funny you said it, because I do feel little off today, and it's been about four days, I have not done it. So, yeah. You know what it is? When a man is not working, because she works Monday of Friday, and yesterday was a holiday. Oh, yeah. Saturday, Sunday, yesterday, I tend not to, because usually it's my time in the morning.
00:47:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Whereas, when she's here, she's like, we kind of just look at gap together, she's like, go walk the dog, then we go in the car, take him for a car ride. He's little brat, because when we come back from walking him, he'll just end there by the garage door to go out, because he's expecting a car ride. Because then we usually go to a coffee shop and get coffee, take him for a nice car ride. So, yeah, my routine sort of goes out the window when the... terrible thing to say.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I felt prompted. I felt prompted to ask and share the thing. So, I'm going to tell you the thoughts that I had in my head, and it was... kind of a reminder of my my own experience of getting into being religious about like doing it regularly and it was um so you're familiar with the concepts of tithing right yes it was that I give the Lord my first always and my best and so if I want the things from him that I want and I always do even if I don't know what they are he knows what they are I always want to give what he's asked for me and he's asked he's asked my tithing but he's also asked my time my skill in my talent my testimony and so I don't want a day to go by that I haven't invested my time with him because there's not a day that goes by that he doesn't invest in me yeah and it's also very easy because the adversary is very good at what he does to get out of habit and um and we get distracted and I think also of having read the scriptures so many times, the Bible probably like five times, the Book of like 30 times, which covers this whole like all these different people and generations. And the thing that happens on repeat is the people are struggling, they hold themselves, the Lord blesses them, they become prosperous, then they become judgmental, envious, spiteful, contentious, they forget God, and the cycle repeats itself because they become poor, they suffer, they're miserable, they're finally humbled, God finally relents and listens to them because they needed to be humbled long enough to remember how bad it is without him. And then he blesses them and the whole cycle repeats itself. And so I never want to get caught in the cycle of I forgot my Lord. And so at the day, have time and I'm like, but I'm. I'm not in the mood for it right now. It's not for you have any father, but I'm not in the mood to focus, and I'm not in the mood for that story, and I'm not in the mood for that energy, and then I do it anyway, and he fixes my heart, and I was already getting kind of hardened, meaning that that sounded like a good excuse to me, should concern me. That I can't give five minutes for him, and I had that thought because I know that your search is sincere, so I wouldn't be able to say this to just anybody if they were like, I'm going for God so everybody can say how good I am, but I really feel like it started with what's your center, and you went there, and if you lose a hold of what is or center or whatever you're working on, but that relationship with God, honestly, it can just take a couple of days getting off track to be completely off track. And if you feel like your relationship with Amanda is blessed because you're the best version of yourself when you talk to God and you study, then, and I know this because when I'm with my sweetheart and my kids, like I want to soak up all the time. And sometimes it's difficult for me in that day. So maybe you spend last time and maybe you go there until the spirit is like, good job.
00:51:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you for spending a little time with me.
00:51:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so you are on my heart today. think Emily was like, I miss her.
00:51:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Can you tell her? love her. No, I appreciate that. And it's funny too, because like I think she just is so burnt out on the weekends because work is so intense for her, but she used to be what he calls she almost became a minister, right? yeah, like she knows the Bible it out and she is quite you know let's do it together on those days yeah I I've asked her before but she's just sobering down from where she said me I just want to turn my brain it's like she's just right anymore she's to write like in our first few years we're together she wrote a lot like fiction like she loves writing but I think it's just um her in her version of her mind she feels she's so um because it's been very intense at the hospital in the last year like first year of COVID but the last year at a CEO that was very bad like actually they're they're criminally investigating her that's how bad she was because of public funds it's um uh in Canada all the hospitals are publicly funded by the government and a lot of people also got lost um like uh fired or whatever and she she wanted to get a package but this is no we're not letting you go uh so they have a new interim CEO but but she's pretty high up too right since she's in charge of the whole woman's um uh area and uh she manages a huge budget but just everything she sees. And now they're trying to fix everything. She just says, I just need to turn my mind off on the weekends, right? Like I just, yeah, she, yeah, yeah, I'll try again. Because I mean, even just, she joined the gym a month ago with me. That's good. That's good. And so I think she's getting back into it. But yeah, I mean, she really, she really used to be quite into it.
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, this is what I would say, like with my children when they struggle, and it's not because they're children just because they're the ones I love that I have a conversation about. But I asked them because God asked us this, would you be willing to try? Because in scripture, he says, try me and prove me now here with would you just for one week, just five days, and maybe you rub her feet and she reads for five minutes because so if it's like I'm burned out and you're asking for her for something, then you're also giving her something, not just the scripture in the word, you just be like, maybe God is the answer and just just one week. And after one week, five minutes a day, you still feel like it was too much. I will, I will respectfully just let it go. If you allow me to occasionally nudge like once in a great while if I go to buy the spirit, but I will not pester you. But could you give me a god? it's 25, 37, sometimes five 35 minutes this week, five minutes day. I'll rub your feet and see if we feel better together and see if you don't feel like you've got a little bit more in your tank because that's what God will give us. If you believe that, if you believe that, you can see that with with conviction. This period of testimony is very powerful, but it might be what she needs most right now. He loves us so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's out.
00:54:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I know in the hospital, sometimes she's a spiritual care leader as well.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, she does a lot like around them.
00:55:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, I don't know. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely.
00:55:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not a presser. It's it's or a judgment. It's a thought because we are wrestling spiritually. And I just, yeah, this is the last thing I'll say. And then we go, my goal is to care for the caregivers. It has been my goal is to support the leaders and those that lift up the weary hands. And oh, that's my I'll get a call right back. She's she's had pneumonia. Anyway, so that's it. She's a caregiver and caregivers need extra love and support so they can keep serving the world. We need that. So I'll leave you with that. I will get my sissy. Sissy, hang on.
00:55:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
closing up a call and I'll talk to you soon. All right. See you. Cheers. Bye bye.
