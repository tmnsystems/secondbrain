Hi.
00:00:05 - patrick
Hello.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are ya?
00:00:07 - patrick
Doing good.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? I'm good. Where's the lens? So joining.
00:00:15 - patrick
Do you have a good Thanksgiving? I did. Yeah. relaxing.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. Um, has me spoke though. It's Tuesday. It's with that. How are you? Good. How are you?
00:00:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. nursing the flu.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not good.
00:00:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah. But when you have four kids, that's pretty, uh, pretty average.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. All right, so now update to the journal. Yeah.
00:01:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Last week was kind of a short week.
00:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you guys update me. How's things going in the biz.
00:01:28 - patrick
Let's see. It's month. feel like. We have a lot of momentum.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:36 - patrick
Kind of rushed last month to get things in. Not everything got in. So now it's like right over to this month.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. at the report either because normally I meet with Mark on. Monday's so I've got an update for. Things, but we're not meeting till Thursday this week. I think this is the one. Let's see. Let's Close the turn. Close to turning fees by team. This is just November. Obviously, this is like, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of things that go into that on a month basis. I've seen what Marcus said that happened for this month and nothing was really like negligent on our part, so I think, and again, this is just a monthly snapshot. So you know what, let's do a year to date. So it includes last month. My daughter is playing piano. Can you hear it? like it. Average days to close, average resolution speed. Samantha wants to wrap something up quickly to get, she made a big difference. I feel like that number is about where it was, but I feel like that one has jumped up. But maybe I'm wrong. What do we think about that, Lawrence?
00:04:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we just closed a bunch of cases that were in hold and trust that probably made a jump up.
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that would do it.
00:04:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Because we closed probably 10 cases last month that we're in hold and trust, which is good, because they've been lingering for a while. But, yeah, it's going to make our average close jump up.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so these are the numbers that we have to look at. And we know that they're impacted by things that have been happening for the last year and half roughly. So it's not just everything that you're doing right now. But we need to make sure that everything that we're doing right now is making as big of an impact as it can. So when is the last time you guys have reviewed your case? is top to bottom to see where we're at with the communication.
00:05:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last week.
00:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right.
00:05:11 - patrick
week prior. I didn't I did like scattered one last week just to see what we can close out but not a long one.
00:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right so we need to make today a productive call.
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you. Last time we spoke I thought you said you'd have the checklist. We were able to get around to doing that.
00:05:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have been going to a legal battle with my family. I'm still in the middle of it. We need to have a journey today. So I've not really been on top of things. But I don't even remember that so now I'm going to need. We were talking about this, turning this into a checklist, right?
00:06:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, let me email this to myself. I'm about pain counter blessings. I need that. Okay. All right, so let's go back to this. So do we have any wins to report since the last time we spoke?
00:06:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Any what report wins? Oh, yeah, I've got a couple. All right. It started out as a really, really slow month distribution wise, and it was never, it didn't become like an awesome month that we were able to get a few distributions at the end of the month. That came in clutch, so that was good. And then client, that file a bar complaint against Mark, finally got her to sign her distribution, and we are done with her.
00:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was that in Nevada or?
00:07:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, that was here in Arizona.
00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When did that happen?
00:07:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last month, it was, she'd been refusing to sign her, refusing to sign, and then like two weeks ago, we finally got her to sign, so.
00:07:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good job. How are you guys doing on the second chair stuff? Second voice, sorry.
00:07:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Some of it is good, some of it seems to like, it kind of gets stuck. I feel like I'm kind waiting for a better offer on some of them, and the adjusters, there's a lot of voicemails being left, and adjusters not getting back. So I might need to kick it up to litigation.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But as a practice overall, still doing well.
00:08:27 - patrick
Yeah, I think so.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think we're getting at least a, you know, one or two thousand dollars extra every time.
00:08:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's what I'm wondering too, is if we're tracking, because I brought that up. But I don't know if anybody's doing it, tracking where we were at before second voice and then where we end up being.
00:08:50 - patrick
To be in the file and the negotiation. For case, but.
00:09:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I know some attorneys don't keep track of negotiations, though. Like Tyler, I don't think he he keeps track of the offers, but he doesn't keep track of his own demands or anything. Well, it's kind of like a second voice to couple of cases for him. And usually he just has an initial offer and that's about it. That's kind of hard to get a report from a clarifying.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Okay, I'm just telling Mark we need to be tracking that even it's just as simple as Case number original attorney original amount second voice attorney second voice amount because then if it's in spreadsheet we can do some very easy tabulations as this is the money difference that it's made month by month quarter by quarter year or year Um, it was Or are you going about this week?
00:12:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, yeah, I mean, coming back from, uh, a break always takes, you know, a big chunk of your day to catch up on emails and voice sales and the, uh, you know, the things that, you know, like, there's dumb tasks that, uh, like, what am I, uh, one of the cases that subbed us out, like two years ago, they want, they finally settled and they want a breakdown of all my hours of all the time that the team spent on the, on the case and it's like, it's gonna take me like an hour to figure that out. don't necessarily want to take that time right now, but it's in the back of my head. So I'm kind of, uh, to figure out some times to get that done.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where is the case at? It's not, is it closed, settled, anything?
00:12:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They just, Hold it and they want because we have an attorney lean on that case even though it they subbed us out Couple years of things like that we have an attorney lean, but in Arizona When you have an attorney lean the other attorney has a right to Know to determine whether that lean is reasonable they have a right to to ask for your breakdown your hourly breakdown Of how much you spend on that case You guys don't really track that at all though. No, so it's a pain in the butt. I have to go through the call log estimate What each call You know how how each call was based on the conversation that occurred I have to go through The whole file basically a forensic search.
00:13:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Do you include the time that you have to send in the forensic search?
00:13:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, no because that's no longer my client
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but it's still work. You have to do related to the case.
00:14:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and I round up so it's kind of included anyway, but yeah.
00:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, wherever you put that, I wouldn't be sure it gets put in there. Even if it's labeled something different, it's still ethical because that really has taken your time.
00:14:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Now put it down, it's file review or something.
00:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean, because that's what it is, right? It may be after it's closed, but it's still real work that has been expense to sweet lot.
00:14:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're getting paid.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, I think that's fair. Okay, so mostly you're still trying to catch up on what's been neglected.
00:14:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I just I'm pretty much caught up now. It was just, you know, that one thing that's kind of pain, but I I didn't really, you know, took time off and that it was a holiday, but I had my phone with me the whole time checking my email and staying, you know, apprised of crises and stuff. So it's not like it took me all day to catch up, you know, I was pretty much caught up by noon. No. No.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yesterday or today?
00:15:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yesterday.
00:15:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, all right, I know that there was a vacation, um, I would like in the future anytime that we take off, do your best to have something to report. It makes a big difference on the energy of this call and the focus of this call because I haven't seen anything. You guys are my eyes and ears. have nothing to work with really if there's not something new that you're bringing to the table. So, um, to get that. Most out of this call and Patrick. I'll ask you next, you know, how you're going about this week But but I do want you to think about Anything that you might have noticed the whole point of the journal that it is what I want you to think about now Anything that you notice that is a hey, this was actually really awesome This is something that we got probably could be working on or this is just kind of stated the union at the moment, but I Need your conversation and your input to make this call useful Okay, how are we going about the week today?
00:16:42 - patrick
Yeah, was like Catch up because last week Was a short week. I was out Monday for jury duty, which was the most waste of time I've ever The biggest waste of time I've ever had So it was just Tuesday, Wednesday, and we were really short on attorney's fees last month, so that was, like, literally the only focus.
00:17:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you get the correct as a jerk?
00:17:11 - patrick
No, I sat there from 8 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. and they asked me one question. If I'm available from December 5th to January 31st, and I said, no, you can go. That was it. So next time I get the paper, I'm just going to shred it.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the jury of our peers are people that have no lives and nothing productive to do, basically. Apparently, I was like a peer.
00:17:43 - patrick
But yeah, this week's just making sure, you know, whatever new cases we've got. Clients are going into treatment, all that stuff's being set up. Settlement stuff, nothing's really due this week. Next week, there's a few do, and then just checking emails, client spend money over the weekend, all of a sudden there's stuff closed out, whatever, where's my money type of stuff. a lot of phone calls yesterday, but I feel like I'm finally caught up and we can get back to, you know, sending out demands, things like that.
00:18:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, find a lot of adjusters are asking for extensions right now.
00:18:33 - patrick
Not actually, I mean, I send out a lot of soft demands, and those are like not really working right now. I mean, they don't just say they can't accept it and they need everything. But on the complete demands, I haven't had an extension request yet.
00:18:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm getting a ton of them.
00:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm.
00:18:53 - patrick
And you've sent everything? Wow.
00:19:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
When I'm like, it's tough and don't want to give it an extension. They're like, well, fine.
00:19:04 - patrick
Give me five years of priors, then.
00:19:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm like, OK, fine.
00:19:11 - patrick
Yeah, I mean, I would give them like a week and a half or something, but like another full 30 days after you waited that long.
00:19:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, what is the mean for five years of priors? So they, I guess, like that if you want to set, OK, can request five years of prior medical history to determine whether the injuries are related to the accident or not. You don't technically have to send them, but, you know, it's to your client's benefit. Otherwise, you're not going to get a better offer unless they're OK with that offer. You know once they request that it's either that or go to either you you comply or go to litigation basically So it's an extension or I'm gonna make you take longer to do your part.
00:20:11 - patrick
So you Yeah, well, I mean you can it can really like mess up the case like we've had a few where they've had like prior neck issues Like pretty bad We don't tell the insurance that and if they need for the prior records and get away with it but if they do it's like You know, they'll see everything it could like really ruin case.
00:20:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I imagine So When that happens, is there any room to negotiate or is it just no now you're stuck and you have to give the priors or can you just say?
00:20:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Extension this is pre litigation. So you don't have you're not you're under no obligation to send them everything. I just send them, you know If I think there's something that's gonna be obfuscating the negotiation process, I just send them what I think is relevant, but I'm not going to send them, you know, things that are going to, like, if there's lower back pain at L5, L6, I'm not going to send them a visit to their Cairo for lower back pain for for cervical pains that they had, you know, five years ago, because I think that's just going to be used by the adjuster to say, oh, look, they have back pains in the past. We don't, you know, this was unlikely caused by the accident, so I don't send them that. But then a litigation, they do have to send everything.
00:21:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so they got that asked you for that.
00:21:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What happened? Well, first of all, I just tell them, I'm not going to do five years, I'm going to do years because I think that's what's reasonable. And second, you know, if I don't find anything, I'm going to give you an affidavit. I'm going to draft an affidavit for my clients to sign that there are no prior medical history. Because I'm not going to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars doing medical search, know, doing medical lean searches, insurance searches.
00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often does that kind of thing come up?
00:22:38 - patrick
On bigger cases?
00:22:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it depends on what it's I think.
00:22:42 - patrick
Bigger cases, though, usually almost always ask. Sometimes the adjusters doesn't really want to resolve things. They'll do that.
00:22:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you give me roughly how many times a month? year, like how frequency.
00:23:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, well, it really depends on the limits. Like I can't, I mean, they, you know, we have months where we have, you know, commercial policy cases and they'll ask for priors from all of those. And my, on my team, when we find out it's a higher limit case, we'll just automatically do a, you know, ask for priors from the client, do kind of a little investigation, that way we have them ready to go when they do ask for them.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When's the last time that's happened? I like, that still gives me no idea any kind of frequency. It could be a hundred times a year, could be two, I'm like, I realize that there are reasons that make it happen, but I'm still trying to figure out how often this kind of thing happens.
00:23:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if you really want to nail it down to a number, I would say. five times a month for me.
00:24:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow. That's a lot more than I would have thought. Okay. All right. How much time do you feel like you have to put if you're doing two years worth of that mean search?
00:24:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, we start with a conversation with a client. Hopefully, know, I mean, best case scenario, this isn't a 20 year old kid with zero prior history. And then you do an affidavit of no prior, but then they have to notarize that affidavit. can take, you know, that can add an extra week to the negotiation process. And if they do have priors, you know, if it's an older, like right now, I have an 84 year old. A man with a ton of priors.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, yeah, then I have to go through, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, you know, to see what's going to hurt us. So I don't get sandbagged during negotiations.
00:25:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages. Please tell me that's hyperbole.
00:25:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no.
00:25:19 - patrick
Like 2000 pages.
00:25:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah. But I just found out about this new tool through the listserv in Arizona. So Google has this tool called Notebook LM, where you can upload documents and summarize the AI program goes for the whole document, summarizes, digesters for it, for you, can ask questions about the documents. And it even can summarize it in a pod Cast form where AI voice actors will like discuss the document in like a part like not robot voices, but like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, not really. So I started using that this week, and that's helped a lot actually.
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you using it on records that require HIPAA compliance?
00:26:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, no, I use it on documents that don't require HIPAA compliance. But right now I've been to enough AI trainings to know that the Arizona bar is really against generative AI.
00:26:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not deductive.
00:26:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But Dr. the AI is still there still in support of it like the guy that. Send out that email on the lists, if he's in the bar association, he's one of the bar. He's not the president, but he's like on the board or something.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Okay. that I'm sure makes a huge difference.
00:27:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We'll see. again, you know, generative AI is great, but I don't trust it anymore.
00:27:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It makes so many mistakes.
00:27:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And so like I have the same reservations about.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so it can make mistakes in the summaries as well. It can add its own words in. And so like one of the things I'll do is, did you, I'll ask it, did you complete the assignment and it'll check for its own errors. But also did you. add words of your own that weren't actually in the text that you read because it can do that. And if you're looking at that amount of data, it can still be difficult. But I don't think anybody else is going to go through 2000 pages to confirm it. And there has to be a margin of error even for human beings. So it's not really, it's kind of probably a moot point. But just something to consider that where something is really important, just to make sure that you're aware that that can error as well. So maybe just have some, like check some type statements to make to it, you know, did you double check your work? Did you make sure not to add anything that wasn't already there? Can you confirm this, that type of thing? it will double check, triple check its data.
00:29:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's a good idea. Can I do that?
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Do you want to, it's, um, man, it's crazy what, what kind of momentum gets lost in just a week? I mean, so you got everybody on the teams. They're there, they're working. When's the last time you had any kind of. Meetings with anybody. Any like there, everybody's doing good. There's just no issues. Nothing to report really.
00:29:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For people. You got my notes real quick.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. I'll be right back. Hold on.
00:30:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, all my people, all five of them are very, very interested in call control training.
00:30:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:30:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They are. John specifically mentioned like some sort of like. You know, when he says he has a hard time when people are like. They suffered a loss in the family like we'll get a few clients. You know, they'll. They'll get. They'll go MIA on us. Because someone in the family dies or something like that. Or even just, you know, traumatic injuries and, you know, they're kind of grieving and they need to talk to somebody and. He has a hard time, you know, not being the. order to cry on for the next 45 minutes, while still being something that I can.
00:31:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's good. Yeah, that that is definitely one of the things that can be helped with that. And I feel like Mark owes me that answer was by the end of November. So let me text him and be like, yo, oh my gosh, Ronan, I forgot he sent me a picture of Ronan, and it's a live picture, so he's like fuzzy. I have to show you guys something. on a second. I'm gonna show you my little boy that's coming to me soon. Can you see this? It's kind of a glare. Oh, hello.
00:32:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh my goodness.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is Hudson. He is a Yorkie poo, Yorkshire terrier with a poodle, and he's gonna be my baby. I love it.
00:32:13 - patrick
I love the birds.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? He'll eat the birds. No, that would be my poodle. Well, Poussaint, she's a poodle mixed with bichon and she has murdered all of my chickens. She looks so cute. And then she brings us heads of squirrels, just decapitated in on my dining room floor. So, yeah. But York charters were also bred to be mousers. So, and vermin, so it's possible that, yeah, yeah. Anyway, I'm very happy. Oh, wait, that's distracting me. Doggies, dang it, mark it this fall because he sent a picture of Ronin. Oh my gosh. Okay, I came to yell at Just kidding. Nag you. I'll say it. Yeah, well, on. Nag you. about call control training. But then I saw Ronin, not Robin Ronin, and lost, I focus. Okay, missions still accomplished, but it's so cute. There'd be a love dog or a sister so cute. Okay, so anybody else like any specific other comments like that was great. So I would love more specifics because then what we can do is that actually gives us once we do get the call control training, how do they feel about these specific things? Because a lot of things this specificity gets lost once we've done the work.
00:33:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, Jessica is she has a hard time with so Hispanic callers when they're upset, they just don't stop. They just they just keep going they don't draw breath. And she has a heart time, you know, cutting them off and interjecting, especially if we have a couple of clients that are very aggressive in that, you know, she's just tell, just get, well, just tell them, you're walking into meeting. That's what I do when I have clients like that, tell them, look, I'm walking into a meeting, it sounds to me, these are the issues, one, two, let me address them in an email, I'll get back to you. And she tried that and a couple of her clients said, oh, so you don't want to talk to me, maybe I should look somewhere else for another attorney then. If that's how you treat your client, no meeting should be more important than talking to me.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then the meeting is not the right angle.
00:34:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what is something that I mentioned before is that you can do is, okay, I want to get to work on this straight away. Here's what I heard this, this, this and this. Is that correct? Okay, let me go because I'm going to go make this phone call, you know, and get it taken care of. maybe you're not making the phone call right away, but you are going to handle it. and it still needs to be done. So you can make it about them, why you need to get out the phone because it's about them because I need to get to work for you.
00:35:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very different feel.
00:35:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's what I used to tell my clients when I was, you know, with being court and they keep like whispering in my ear, you know, things they wanted me to say in court and things like that. just at one point that I remember one of my clients did that, turned it in and I was like, look, do you want me to listen to what's going on, what the judge is saying, what the evidence is presented, or do you want me to talk to you about your case?
00:35:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another thing that you could do is go, do you want me to do the job or do you want me to do the best job possible? And then you don't talk until they answer the question. Because a lot of times they won't answer the question. They'll just be quiet because they're rude. They're mad because they're mad. And And to answer the question is for them to acknowledge they're in the way of you doing the best job. So they're not going to want to answer. Yes. You just stay silent for a while. And if they don't answer, then I would say I actually really need you to answer that question. Do you want me to do the job that you want me to do or do you want me to do the best job possible for you? I need that answered. Okay, because there's going to be an acquiescence that happens. And they can't go be like, oh, I'm going to go to somebody else who doesn't, who'll care more or work harder. So, and you once they've answered to say, in order for me to do the best job, this is what needs to happen. I need to be very clear on the details that matter. If you tell me all of these extra details, I'm going to lose my focus on the things matter most for you. I'm human, my brain can only handle and process so much. I know this, I know this, I know this. This is something I can work with and I can go to. How do you feel about it matters? But unfortunately, that's not going to actually help me do the best job. The facts help me to do the best jobs. Unfortunately, emotions don't. The courts don't care about it. I do. But the best way that I can handle your emotions is to do the best job for you possible. So I need to go ahead and get to work on this. Do you have anything new factual statements to make to me that I have not heard before? Okay, no. All right. Well, my plan is I'm going to go and get straight to work on this for you. And then broken record, broken record, broken record. Yeah, it's almost impossible argue with now illogical people can try to argue with it. But you'll have to learn, there'll be some allowance you'll have to make, there'll be some people you just need to sit with so you don't lose the case. But I can just about guarantee you nobody handles the calls quite that well. Some people probably do, but the majority I would say probably don't handle the calls quite that well. They don't have that logic that comes straight to that reigns, which is why role playing would be really great. One of you be the ridiculous ones is blah blah blah blah. It's not ridiculous. People are hurting, they're going through things. But it's not helpful to them, right? So the role playing can be very helpful because it kind of wires your brain to make that conversation reflexive. And we have the driving analogy, right? We went through the driving analogy with you guys, I explained to you, like when you're trying to learn how to drive, how you're trying to process everything and everything new. then after a while, it just. comes reflex and you don't even have to think about it and you can have conversations and do other things while you're driving. It's the same kind of thing with anything that you do. There's the default network mode, right? In your brain, that's what we call autopilot. So when you've done something often and off, you can recognize, hey, this is the situation, you can just kick right into that. So it takes the stress off of your people and they just go straight into it because they've done it so many times. That's what role-playing can help you do. You can add that to a meeting, maybe it's every couple of weeks. You just get in a practice of call control practice and you go through the scenarios that make the biggest impact on call times.
00:39:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So what about clients that just will not be interrupted? Like they're just machine gun talkers. You know, they just talk and talk and talk and that I experience that so much with my English speakers. That seems to be more of a cultural thing with Hispanic speakers, especially older Hispanic people. They seem to treat Jessica like like they're the elder and she's there to listen to them kind of thing. It's a little bit, they're not they're not disrespectful like yelling at her or anything like that, but they're very they're they're they're very overbearing and every time she tries to chime in they're like but wait wait wait listen listen listen and then they just keep going you know and it's it's something that you know I a hard time getting our pointers on because it doesn't happen to me that often, honestly.
00:41:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it is. Having the voice that I do and being common, I female, I have experienced that a lot myself. I, when I was much younger, worked in the call center and experienced that a lot, especially with older men and especially with like Arab men, just zero respect. So there are there are some things that that happen and it will take practice to learn what kind of tactics you can use. Usually overpowering does not work. It has to be a pattern interrupt in the rain, a word that creates pause without necessarily being the word pause or waves, right? that, or you talk really softly. they're like, what would you say? they hear you talk. And she's saying something and it's real and important and useful, but they can't hear it because they're talking and They're like, are you not listening to me? Yes. I was just talking to you and telling you blah blah blah and it It can still have the same effect so We can try some different types of tactics, but it would be interesting if she tried actually Lowing her voice and talking while they're talking and saying what she needs to say and seeing if they'll like wait What'd you say?
00:42:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't think that would be an issue. She's super soft spoken.
00:42:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's yeah Yeah, what you don't want to do is try to change the personality because it it doesn't work very well There's a disconnect and they'll just create anxiety in your person But but there are ways around it and some of it can be framing as soon as you start in the conversation You know, they so I would imagine that they gets off the rails almost as soon as you say hello and they just launch into it.
00:43:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, the way she explains it to me is they'll get really upset at reception and then she'll talk to them and they'll be slightly less upset but they basically, as soon as she says hello, yeah, they should tell her their whole life story.
00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wonder, this sounds terrible, but I wonder if accidentally pressing a button on the phone, you know, or it makes that tone, just like for two seconds, you're like, oh, so sorry. Wait a minute. What did you say? needed to know or like pattern interrupt. It's a mental pattern interrupt. That's all you need is you need their brain to pause for a minute while not igniting anger and triggering anger at the person they're speaking to at your people. Oh, You know, we could have some psychological little experiments here and see what happens. Yeah, I have used it by the way. It has worked in the past.
00:44:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
My go to is always I'm walking to a meeting and. haven't failed yet for me, but.
00:44:18 - patrick
You'll get them to stop talking or.
00:44:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, just be like.
00:44:26 - patrick
Get out of the conversation.
00:44:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Get out of the conversation when I.
00:44:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Get out of it, but redirected to where you needed to go.
00:44:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, when I get all the information I needed, you know, 15 minutes ago. It's it's time to wrap it up and, you know, actually work on the case, I think. Yeah. So I just say, hey, look, you know, I've got another meeting, but I'm going to follow this up with an email. You know, I understand your concerns are this, this and this would discuss this, this and this. Let me follow it up with an email. If you have any questions, let me know that this is the plan of action. and for now. But you know, I know it's different when someone tells you an attorney, you know, compared to a, compared to a case manager too.
00:45:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that, and then there's the female, and then there's also if it's a quiet voice, so a non assorted person, whether it's male or female, and then it's also how, how observable youth is, or as much as they perceive it, right? So youth, um, soft energy and authority, meaning rank, those things can impact, um, the, the wrestle on the call and the need for call control skills.
00:45:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, the dynamic, the, yeah, the power dynamic. Yeah, so that can be something.
00:45:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so she is soft, spoken, and does she sound useful younger?
00:46:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Jessica? Yeah, she's, uh, you can tell she's young. You've had some issues with, I mean, she's, she's 30, you know, she's not like 18.
00:46:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
matter what she is, it matters what they think she is.
00:46:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but she does, she's very soft spoken and, you know, and a lot of, a lot of men usually are, can be a little overbearing. Sometimes last week we had an issue where I had to talk to a client about not flirting with her over the phone. That was inappropriate.
00:46:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, even when I was in my late 20s, I had people they would call and they would say, I can I speak to your mother. Yeah, I'm the mother. So, you know, it's there, there is an immediate perception when people hear a voice and, um, Yeah, you have to do with that, but your perception is going to be very different. And the way that you're received by people around is going to be very different. So just kind of taking that into account. Not only that is though, that's been her lifelong experience. And so it's framed how she thinks what she thinks is possible versus what you think is possible and even probable. You can just solve it with this or that you can't. That perception is kind of hardwired in people. And then when you add the cultural dynamic of it that anything that is a collectivist culture, elders are ranked higher. In America, we don't really work like that anymore. We're individualistic and, you know, every man for himself kind of thing and you don't get respected unless you earn it. That's everything. Obviously, there are cultures within cultures and not everybody has liked that, but that's kind of the overall. are all things that we have. So learning how to respect that, so using language that is respectful, but is also guiding, directing, and the energy, the voice that she uses, and maybe some tactics to just create a pattern interrupt in a person's mind to make them slow down for a second, take a breath, and here. And then a very intentional script or set of things to say that redirects to doing the best case possible. So, Daniela, you want me to do the best job for you? I possibly can. Power is great. Maybe she's really quiet and waits and then okay in order for me to do that and the whole brain being full I use I've used that a lot it works really well for call control and it's true and people can relate to that and understand it you're giving me like I feel like I'm drinking from a fire hydrant right now and you're giving me all this information but the truth is I can't process it all at the same time really well so I need you to let me ask you questions and then I need you to answer the questions very specifically so that and repeat I can do the absolute best job possible for you um I like that if you want to do a good job or do you want to do the best job possible that's job possible I mean so who's gonna choose anything other than the best job possible and Then, but here's the thing, once they've already answered that question, that is also a mental pattern interrupt because they've already answered the question, they already know the answer, so when they hear the question even begin again, do you still want me to do the best job possible? Because that insinuates one, I know you do, but clearly we're getting off track and this is not helping me off you. So, that, it takes a lot of practice and it takes you talking to your people about that logic and that dynamic over and over again. I can send you guys the call notes from this, so if you want it for reminders of some of the things that you can say to help your people, and then you really, really should have some role-playing exercises. It can make a huge difference in a day, in a week, then you compact that, compound that over a month, over year, it can reduce a lot of stress for your people. It can free up a lot of time. When the stress is reduced, energy is increased, right? Because stress reduces energy. So that allows for more productive time. Stress impacts health, stress impacts sleep. So it is no small thing to say, call control skills can be life changing.
00:51:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, especially if that's, you know, if that's 70% of their job is calling people.
00:51:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's a big member. So we're at 152. Let's. did you have any. else besides John and Jessica.
00:52:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now Mike and I came up with the script for intro calls, so that's good.
00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to see that.
00:52:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, sure, I can I can send it to you. It's I mean, it's based on the feedback specific to our team. So I don't know if it's something I would love to see what you guys came up with.
00:52:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about you, Patrick? you had any conversations with your team about call control?
00:52:37 - patrick
Not call control, but I spoke with Elsie the other day. Just, you know, she's handling the cases. always ask her how she's doing with the calls, because she's taking most of the phone calls and I know I can get overwhelming and annoying. So I was just checking with her to make sure she, you If it's too much, but she's pretty solid on the phone Yeah All right, well Unless you guys have any questions or things that you want to bring up.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that We're good. It's and a little bit of a lull because of holidays So let's make sure that we try to get some momentum back I really want you to take good stock of all of your cases make sure that you're just reviewing and making sure that nothing has Gone longer. It's a holiday. So if it's gone longer than a week Let's get caught up. Let's make sure people don't feel like hey, took a vacation and you know, we forgot you Let's show them that we're there for them. I remember that Yeah, you know that they're an individual person and that they they don't care that you have 250 cases or whatever As they they want to know that they matter and that's going to make an impact on the reviews which makes a big impact on You know, how hard we have to market to get business with a profit margins are. There's a lot of things that impact just the overall health of sweet law in general, but also good reviews help frame it for other people when they come in feeling confident that they're working with the right attorneys. So that means you've got less resistance that you have to deal with on the front line when you're talking to them. So it all comes kind of full circle. So just make sure that, and this is what I like to do. So going into a holiday or time off vacation time, I front load whatever that week is. I just like extra work beforehand, kind of get everything prepared. So maybe I'll touch more cases, go kind of above and beyond and make sure just the deck is stocked for everybody feeling extra taken care of whether it's my team or my clients, and then set the expectation of when you're going to hear from me next. And then as soon as I get back, hit the ground running and put extra effort in, you know, work a little bit harder those few days coming back, not necessarily longer, just focused, driven, high energy, and just kind of nurture it back and then just, you know, make sure that no momentum was lost, and that's the best way to be able to do it. But the other thing is, when I'm off, I'm off. I am taking, I'm touching almost nothing, looking at nothing, and I am fully being restorative to myself, fully being present where I'm at, knowing like, basically, if you're not gonna die, nothing's burning down, I'm not talking to you. But that means that I've got what I need to come back and go and overdrive for a little while and take extra good care of But we need that balance. If you don't really fully ever unplug it, you're not really getting rested. And over time that does lead to burnout. So keep that in mind, especially when about Christmas coming up, okay?
00:56:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I had a conversation yesterday to get back to the ground running. It's not, it's not the on holiday mode all month and then get caught out in the last half because, you know, we basically were slow on them. So I'm pushing them hard to put the egg, knock down, get the work, or even the same concert.
00:56:34 - patrick
I've been telling clients like last week and then all the way and probably till Christmas, like if I know they're waiting on something or something to come through, I just tell them like that, you know, holidays are coming up and it's going to slow things down. Not on necessarily an RN, but however we're waiting on just to kind of curb expectations and slow down as many phone calls as well, a simple but.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Something that you might do to just slightly modify that, it said with the holiday times, there's a lot of illness and a lot of offices, insurance offices, doctors offices, things like that. So it tends to have a slowdown effect, not because nobody's working as hard, but just sometimes there's less people working and it just has an actual effect. So because the implication could just be that people are just chilling, you know? So you wanna be really specific with that imagery that it's also a time of a lot of illness because it is. And lots of people have kids, kids are germ factories, schools are germ factories. You know, it just helps because people will look for reasons to be mad. People will look for reasons to complain, to put blame. They will, and they don't know you, so they might be mad their husband or their wife or their aunt or their boss. Be like, I got this guy on the phone and he's- and some of my money. know what else you're going to get? Some of a piece of my mind. going to just yell at it and make it feel bad. So, you know, just kind of put on that strategy and it's kind of a piece of armor to protect you. Just use your words very specifically, strategically, intentionally, and make sure, number one, that you're not triggering potential issues. But opening a door of like, it's going to slow down, but not giving a really good reason why it might and that kind of thing. It all makes a difference on stress and energy. at the end of the day, those things have a huge impact on your health, on your quality of life, on how people feel about the jobs and it's really worth paying attention to. All right. I'll get my new puppy for like 10, 11, 12, 13. Between 11 and 13 more days, but when I do eat prepared pictures That's just like that whatever just show me if they gonna come in like a box like a Christmas box No, he actually I have so this is my third dog I've had shipped from somewhere else in America one came from Santa Fe one came from Kentucky and one came from Pennsylvania and And so they get somebody flies with them and brings them a dog carrier and delivers them to me Because when I want a doggy, I don't want to wait for a doggy to be born nearby I want my doggy now and so I go find my dog now and then I have somebody bring it to me right now And I you don't want to know Thousands I've already spent yeah Anyway Anyway guys You're awesome. Um, you better have reports for me next week and it better not happen the day of our conversation. want extra reports by next week. Momentum. Children that are maybe possibly older.
01:00:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)

01:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
