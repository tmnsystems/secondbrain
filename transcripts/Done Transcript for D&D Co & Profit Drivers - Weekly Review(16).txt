Hello. Hello. Hello. Dan Ryan today.
00:00:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Trying to fix this.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think your video is on. Or that's your new screen.
00:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. There's video. There you go. I don't know why. you were looking inside the toaster, what you were doing. Oh, yeah. How did you like that?
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Toaster was toasted.
00:00:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A little rumbly.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Gonna get that thing cleaned out there.
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's something. This automation and fan flow that we cannot get to work. It's just ridiculous. Oh, my God. Why? I think we're I think this is it.
00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're kind of like garbled.
00:01:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what is insane? What's all they called with you?
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did I crap?
00:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. No one else ever says a word. But every call I get on with you, it's always the same thing. It's so weird.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think it's just, because do you know how many times I have said something when there's a group call and then Eric or Bobby be like, yeah, yeah. But they're not the ones that bring it up, ever. I think I'm just the only one that brings it up.
00:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, I will talk to people that don't know me. And they never say like, oh, you're breaking up or, you know what I mean? like, Salco. Oh my God. I gotta say like an hour.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talk to him for like an hour.
00:01:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It sounds weird to me right now. It sounds like you're lying. little volume.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what the crap? Hold on, I've got a child. Okay, sorry. But I do have lots of other meetings and I also don't have issues with anyone else. that's weird too. It's just a and the and the Tina thing.
00:02:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Whoa, that's loud. That's loud as hell. It sounds different, but there's totally different headset. I switched by most, but I only used for sleeping time.
00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it the quiet comfort?
00:03:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know.
00:03:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I have. I've been listening to Jodie's beat again because I've been having a hard time just like relaxing fast enough because if I'm dead, like I want to go to sleep, but yeah, anyway, but so I have these Bose quiet comfort and they were, they were like 330 bucks or something or maybe it's the 330s. But anyway, they were for sure over $300. They're so good though. They're well, are they earbuds or headphones?
00:04:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, they've got a, they get the cable that goes around your neck, right?
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
they're wiffy or blue tooth or whatever. Yeah. These ones are the ones I have are over the ear. And I got them last year in Dexter with like, like, I mean, funny. Like, I thought you couldn't wear it as well. Like, I could wear these because I have a sense of the, I have a sense of the memory. Anyway, okay.
00:04:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can hear Dan. Yeah.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To be garbled at the moment.
00:04:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're issue with fan flowy and it's.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long has this been going on with that?
00:04:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been going on for like a week. I'm like, I am a while. It's just there. It's like a unique. It's just something that we need there. It's the same jam as always like, oh, nobody needs us except for us, right? So it's like, oh, how are we going to do this? So I think we figured out how to do it, but we're about to find out if it really worked, but it's Eric and I have been banging on it for like two hours straight to like finally get it. But I worked on it yesterday. I've worked on it like a little bit every day. Johnny's been messing with it for days, he's like, dude, it doesn't work.
00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks.
00:05:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, so that.
00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That seems fun.
00:05:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Of course. And then once we're done, I'm like, we're going to change this. But like, if we can get it to work, then we can change this one part that I think has changed a lot. We'll, we'll find out.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's another 71 going?
00:06:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So sales are like through the roof.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we're like, we're like, what is happening?
00:06:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, it doesn't make any sense. Until about five minutes ago, when Bobby texted us, texted me and Jeff was like, I got it. Because I'm like, this can't be, this can't be right.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's can't be normal.
00:06:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I had my whole theory where we're back to normal. We're not back to normal for all of 2024. AICPA has completely screwed up this whole thing. So I think Bobby found a Reddit thread and it said, oh, hey, if you don't, if you don't take your test by June 24 or 25th, then if you take it by then, then you will get that score in July. If you do not take it by then, you take it on the 26th. The score won't come out until October 31st, which is ludicrous to make people wait six months or five months for a score. Like if they fail that, I'm not going to know they failed. And they know that 50% of the people fail. What do they think they're going to do? They think people are going to go just take another section. going to have to. They're going to go take another section, hope that they passed. And if they didn't pass, then they have to go backwards. And I'll go with it.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
An insane way. So stupid. Bureaucracy is just creepy.
00:07:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. It literally just shows that there's no thought to the candidates, to the exam providers.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well and if there is thought that thought is we don't give a and let's manipulate them or just whatever this is wow it's whatever they're doing it's built for them not for anybody 100% Wow so I would imagine that that is a government based entity that makes those decisions no no but it is very bureaucratic who decides they're like they're just professional whatever sort of like the bar it's very much like the bar not government but is that not government deputized at the very least I don't think so I mean it might be I just wouldn't know like how it wouldn't be because it would have to be like who does it answer to how you know what I mean like if it's not attached to the government, how would it have any power or authority?
00:09:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because they established them. I mean, they might be the government, you know, sort of like, like licensing, right? How you have to be a licensed hair stylist, right? it could be that the government says, okay, you got to be licensed for this, which it is, and you're in charge. And then that's it. I don't think the government then gets involved beyond that, right? Thing, you're the person in charge of licensing for this, and then they just act very much like the government because why wouldn't you?
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, no, it's a public professional association of lawyers. The judicial bar by state. That's so weird, but also, of course, I mean, that would make sense too, because either way, it's It's not cats controlling things, which are governments the same way. Interesting. So I would imagine the CPA stuff is the same thing that there's like a group of accountants that get voted in or whatever. I don't know. Now I want to know. Sorry, my curiosity brain got triggered, Dan.
00:10:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sorry. Okay.
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, I'm like, I'm sorry that's happening when you're a call. I'm not sorry about it happening. Come on, Maureen. Okay. Cetera, how's it? Have you hit another record?
00:10:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're averaging like 51 sales a day. It's 51, 51 subscriptions a day.
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Black. In a good way. I will see what happens. It's almost like, do you feel like they're doing some scarcity stuff like Do they get, because people have to pay to take the exams, right?
00:11:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally. you feel like it's a, we're not meeting our financial target. So we're going to try to create scarcity so that we can drive sales now. When it's a normally slow thing.
00:11:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:11:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
they make prime, they make more money on people paying to be licensed than to candidates, right? There's 10 X accountants and there are candidates. And then these changes are not creating more candidates. If anything, they're slowing things down, right? They, they, they down the number of people that are taking the exam. But yeah, it has to be because I mean, I really. They don't know, but it has to be that they're not prepared on some level because they changed the exam, right? So then there's three new, there's six total nouns, so it's an expansion of two, but three are new, right? They ditched one and they brought in three others. And I don't know if they can't, if they just don't have the capacity or the code or whatever to do the score releases. There's a reason, and the reason is that they are ill-prepared, I guess, but in what way they're ill-prepared, couldn't tell them.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, okay, how costs to require customer, I don't know how to do it, I don't You are working on, but if Dan could source them, then he know how to go through them. You were talking about trying to calculate the cost to acquire customer, and you did that, okay, what did you come up with?
00:13:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
$16,000.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, you got muffled again.
00:13:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's $16? You could round it up to $17,000, or round up $16,000.
00:13:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was your target for how much you could spend? That's the current cost. So what's the LTV?
00:13:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like 40 something. I didn't have to calculate that. that's always in the memory.
00:14:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, it's weird because if you move the window, it changes.
00:14:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's like, I guess I could say like, what's the LTV for like, I guess, I guess, because all time went from even, no, because you changed, like, well, all times since it's been a subscription model, all time in Ninja, not even subscription, which, like, could go there now.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's do it.
00:14:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you look at it, so if you look at it, yeah, if I look at it in, like, this current default window, it's super high, like, there's me. So, yeah, 270. Yeah, so like the lifetime lifetime value is 270.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the difference between ninja and the subscription story?
00:15:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So different. So it's just that we, when we switched to subscription, was on another 71.
00:15:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:15:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm not going to look at that. That data is, it's literally totally separate.
00:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I can't even calculate it if I wanted to. It was totally, yeah. Okay. Okay. already thought that, but then when you said it, I was like, wait a minute. What I'm confused. Okay.
00:15:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Do you have a small child? A red child. A dog voice.
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you're talking to me, I cannot make it out.
00:15:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are you kidding me? It's you.
00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. know what? Let me, let's all work from a different laptop um this got a new MacBook Pro in three what on that wait a second it lies it lies oh my god it has to um yeah it's got within my iMac that i just got last year that is blazing fast and i'm like damn with 36 gigs of memory and a two terabyte drive yeah is this okay let me start this i might have to okay so i'm going to re-cream host over here hold on you sound totally different now do i better like clear well that's awesome that's what i want to hear because i definitely don't want to downgrade my audio
00:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The audio is on the better for sure.
00:17:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Because if I can be 100% portable, because the keyboard is actually pretty good, but I don't mind having, because my laptop bag, I can just take a portable keyboard with me, and I always use a full sized mouse anyway. But this is 100% USB-C all the way around, so I either have to have a dongle or attachment somehow, because they don't really make USB-C mice yet. Anyway, I have to be distracting.
00:17:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh wait, because now I have to open my... I don't know, I have a USB-C mouse. Well, it's huge, so I don't know if you want a big mouse.
00:17:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't want it and I want it to make.
00:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, yeah. it's the Logic Tech MX, whatever.
00:17:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just ordered that.
00:17:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I love that mouse. love it.
00:17:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I actually, I got the, you have the MX Master, the MX Universal.
00:17:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, Master.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So I ordered the universal because I was doing some research on it and I think that I will like that better. And they said that it's faster with the MacBooks anyway. but it was pretty much a pros and cons are equal in both of them. So I just went with the universal because I'm a little bit smaller handed. Okay, I've been using it for years. I need to, I mean, I guess I can still, they had my notes open. So I'll talk on this one and I'll work on this one.
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, LTV back to that. Now do I sound different?
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, but there's still like this something like a reverberation and I don't know if it's just because it's the deepness of your voice.
00:18:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you know, and it is, it is a little deep today. Some days it's not so deep. It depends. Don't sleep like I can feel it. It's a dude. I'm like, oh my gosh.
00:19:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But so far, there hasn't been the Garveling. You should try the original audio that you were doing out of curiosity. Well, I may just have to go like tell them this this iMac or turn it in for another MacBook Pro. Yeah dude. This is really and it's um 16 inch. My last laptop was a alien wear and it was 17 inch and it was a beast but this screen is so nice. You know the retina displays and it's still pretty heavy but that that little bit of difference in in size makes it so much easier to use and I like it and it's faster. A lot.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. These sound better.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, okay. Well, we'll just try this out. I'm going be really. It's so weird.
00:20:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Everything is like crystal clear.
00:20:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is very good.
00:20:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like myself.
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How weird is that?
00:20:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That should have no.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yeah, it's weird. That is very strange. All the G is a weird B stand.
00:20:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's my? How are I? Okay. Anyway. Okay. So we were looking at LTV and getting that. So then have you gone through to try to figure out the calculations of what you would want to spend, like what's your cap to acquire a customer?
00:20:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I have to find my. So it's like the universe. So I'm like, I had to find the source of the data that I trust. And then I think yesterday. It's like really? How about we get the date?
00:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is my keyboard typing very loud?
00:21:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nope, I don't hear it at all.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow.
00:21:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, on the 4th, so two days ago, Stagmetrics was like, hey, over all of our dashboards and here's version 3.0. And I started looking at it this morning and I was like, what? my god. So I got to get in there now and play with that. But it can do things that I've always wanted to do and I've never done, but I actually just did this for Mark sort of. But I've always wondered, is there a relationship between leads and sales? Like if leads go up, the sales go up. And if I could overlap those together and put them in one chart, do it, you know, do I see anything and now they do it? And you could do it by source. Like, oh god, if I can get leads by source and then customers by source and see, know, like lead to. Google or convert better than leads from whatever. That's exactly what well first if there's a relationship at all And then it would be like okay, if there's a relationship, then I know where to go spend money period Yeah, obviously source to customer it already does that and so I just got to figure out if The days in there if it's not how do I fix it? Whatever it is, so I do but Start of that yeah Okay, so I I I I I
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
puzzle in the most important place, which is awesome and so you'd go. End of Q3 is about time to review market share. I want to just take myself an out to keep that moving forward. Oh, Jeff recording that tell that going. You just got so quiet.
00:23:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he's not done yet.
00:23:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's your volume.
00:23:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That was my personal volume.
00:23:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. He's not done yet. Did he make any progress this week?
00:23:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean. It takes progress every week, but he's just not done yet. Yeah, he just chips away at it.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Did you make any decision there?
00:24:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we talked about it on Monday. So now we're thinking we're going to make it 77 and 87. So there's like 97 is too close to 100. People are going to round up they're the 77 and then we'll just have increased. And then the $10 difference, but to be like, oh man, for $10, I can get another seven other things. But then also on Monday, so we're talking about that and I was like, all right, we got, you know, Jeff's gonna finish this stuff. But on Monday, we were like, okay, well, we don't, we didn't know what was happening, right? I'm like, okay, well, if this, if this is real, then we can't change anything for like a month. And we have to see what the new normal is, right? And but now as of 20 minutes ago, we know this is not real. I know this will very likely disappear. Yeah, this will very likely disappear on June 26. So it's like, there are these outside forces that we have zero control over. And And now, I mean, I could have sworn, and that's the thing, I could have sworn Bobby said something else, and I know he did, but I could tell today that he didn't know this, but he's like, wait a second. There's no score release until October. So whatever he was looking at that, they either changed it, well, God only knows, right? So it's like, we're sort of at the mercy of this bureaucracy, right? And there's nothing we can do. It's like, we just have to roll with it. So when he came in today and he goes, hey, yeah, there's no score release until October. I was like, okay, see you guys in six months, because I don't know why we would do anything. We can't ever really know that any of this stuff is really working because we're in an environment. We're not in the environment. This is not the correct thing. environment. So it's like, okay, it's like being in like super salty water and thinking you're swimming better. It's like, no, you're in super salty water.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're just floating.
00:27:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're more buoyant.
00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:27:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, man, that's not going to stop me from like doing this other stuff to figure this stuff out because that stuff has merit. But then I'm like, okay, well, then we should launch the new products because I'm really really confident we shouldn't do it because we need to see where we land without them. But now it's like, oh, no, we're not going to know that for six months. So it's like, well, , we should launch them. And then just get that and just know, just know what that looks like. So yeah, we have three more weeks of whatever.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
also because there's just like, there's a new monkey wrench all the time and everything that other people are doing to make that market volatile. Whereas you- who know that the drop off right from 67 77 is going to be negligent, negligible, negligent. And so why not just increase the revenue anyway? And then when you do the 77 choice to 87, like, I know you don't that's such a good prediction, like an educated, you know, prediction that I think you should just do it. Like, that's leaving money on the table for hopes that things will even out and regulate when they could go do something else to keep it from regulating. And then you waited for nothing and left money on the table for nothing that you can't get back.
00:28:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the other thing stopping us now is Jeff. that we need to face the products, right? we can't, that's part of the things that we can't, but there is, we can't offer a supplement that has audio if there's no audio. So it's like, all right, Jeff, get those, get those, I think he's only working on one section, I think he's just one section left.
00:29:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I would, and I always wrestle myself because I wanna do the bull thing and be like, go use AI and do it anyway, but I learned that that always bites me in the butt and just.
00:29:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I mentioned that I'm Monday, don't think I didn't. I was like, why didn't we do it again? to get a version done, right? It's like, okay.
00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's so like, the argument I think some people would have would be like, well, I don't wanna feed my voice. we can do it, but his voice is already public. Anybody could go clone his voice. So, you know, that cat out of the bag and permanently never going back in. So, you know what I mean? Like, why not take advantage of it?
00:30:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, um, okay. There's my note. Mmm. There they are. Oh, yeah. AI chat for this new level that we have of AI. I know you said it did nothing before, but I don't know if it would make much of a difference now. The reason I was thinking about it so much was because you were talking about there was confusion. There seemed to be confusion for 67 versus 97, but this new pricing would pretty much eliminate that.
00:30:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, no, the confusion is around people think we have a supplement when we don't.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, that's right. I couldn't. My notes were not clear enough for me. Can say supplement please explain?
00:31:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So when we started we We supplement meaning a that you have a complete course and you're like I'm just not getting it done. So and then you go by all the same notes, right? going to go by these notes from this other company. And then I'm supplementing my primary course materials with additional course materials. So in the very sort of our principal sort of way, we created them. market. That market did not exist until Jeff and I came along. Nobody sold notes or odd, nobody. There was no such thing. So we created that market and we've been associated with that as a result. We were the supplement for years. Now there are other people doing it, right? So we're no longer the supplement, but we are ourselves no longer a supplement, yet people still associating us with that idea that you just have notes. For the longest time, we were just notes, flashcards, whatever. We didn't have the software, but now we're like a full blown course. have everything that they have and more yet we're a supplement in a lot of people's minds.
00:32:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I could see how that happens.
00:32:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I get it. I totally get it, but we need to be rid of it.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do, I mean, and you've tried to address that in your copy on the page, but people still are confused.
00:33:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because people want to, they come in and they say, I want to use it as a supplement. So we're like, you can, but we're not a supplement, right? it's a full blown course that you can supplement with, right? But similarly, the other people that are coming in, we're saying, we're a full blown course. So if you haven't bought anything, yes. So when you see on Reddit, over and over and over, can I pass with just Ninja? The idea being that it's not enough. And people are like, yeah, I only use Ninja. And it's like, oh, my God. So we have to serve both of those ideas and we do and it works. But it's like, we could do it in a different way by having. and two products. we can just have one sales message that's like, Hey, yeah, which is what we have right now. It's a full blown course. And we're also the number one supplement. Or we were, I think is what we're saying. And then just put them on this sales page where they can literally see, Oh, there is the supplement that I'm looking for. Right now they go to buy the supplement, there is no something they don't understand. No, you buy the whole thing and supplement as you choose. Even the way we explain that. Um, they, I mean, they literally just want to see supplement. But it's like, all right, let's give them that. Let's do that. And, and my argument on Monday, as usual was like, guys, we know from experience that if the card's broken, well, one person tells us the card's broken. We know it's happening to way more people. And then we all could also can see the data. I'm like, here, we're missing that second data point. We don't have it. All we we have is the Reddit threads, the people writing into the support desk, like it happens every week, multiple times a week. And so I'm like, it's way bigger than we think of it. We just don't know how big. If we give, if we put this thing in place to catch that data point, we will know. Period.
00:35:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so, what percentage of people do you think it can be used?
00:35:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, honestly, it's like 50-50.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot.
00:35:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
think, I would say, no, you know what, it's probably 80-20. 20% of the people are confused, right? I'd be willing to bet it's more of a breakdown like that.
00:35:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if 21% of people are confused, how many do you think by anyway?
00:35:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Obviously, you don't know. Yes. Right, go fractal, right?
00:36:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then 20% of the people buy it.
00:36:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And don't. Yeah.
00:36:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So what is that costing you to that math real quick?
00:36:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't tell you because you don't know, no, know, but I don't know what number to use for the first, the first split, right? Do they get confused when they get the product page? Did they get there on the site?
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But well, let's just say it's on the check it.
00:36:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, order page. But yeah, it would be like on the sales page, probably, right? And don't know if I can, so our analytics is messed up, although it should be working, but I don't think it is. I mean, should be working because I fix it, but I don't I'm going to have to get with the super funnel kit guys again. What? Well, that's weird. Now it's kind of working.
00:37:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is kind of working?
00:37:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, actually, it's not. For whatever reason, it is not passing variable data to Google Analytics, although I see it sometimes. So when I go in, I just see a product. I don't see far. Odd. I just see Ninja Monthly, which is fine, right? That's like a nice roll-up, but what I want to see is Hey, this many far has got added to cart. This is the conversion rate of heart. This is the conversion rate, whatever, but it's not it's not populating into Google Analytics correctly and I Have no idea why Well, I mean I did I thought I had to figure it out apparently I didn't but then there would be bits of data like it it was Sometimes happening, but I never saw it happening. I just saw it in here. I was like, oh well I can see that there's bar data or far data, but now there's none like since I fixed it air quotes Now there's no variable data at all which is Good in a way. It's like, okay. no, it's not working at all Whereas before it was intermittent and I didn't understand that at all or maybe I just need to turn something else on in here, so anyway, do to do, so let's see if we have I have a hard time with it, I'm like, how do I see like sales page or visits, you can't, I mean, you have to build a board We never say that Google Analytics was ever-intuitive, but GA4, yeah it comparatively it totally was. Yeah.
00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The more I see of Maria the more I like her and I told her yesterday we should just do something together.
00:40:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've asked you to do it in your current offer like whatever. So, I don't like her. Yeah, yeah, I dig her. I'll put three points. That was in my wish. Oh. Oh. I was close in my head. was like 10%. Um, 10% 18% of people add the card.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wasn't it last on your sales page?
00:41:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then I bet some of these people have the card thinking they're going to see something else. If people purchase the card, it's ridiculous. All right, so I'm going to say they don't know they could add the card. So a certain percentage are not adding to cart. So the 3500. So what did I say? thought 20% of people were confused. So it'd be 20%. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. 8 customers a day, roughly 8 new subscriptions a day would be, I guess, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what does that add to financially over the year?
00:43:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that would be... Will I say 270?
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:43:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
80 grand. No. 800 grand.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's say that, well, let's go back to 80-20 again, let's say if you were able to get an AI chat plot on there that did work well in 80-20, only, you know, converted 20% of that.
00:44:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I'd check out for one.
00:44:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, clarifying, so...
00:44:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's what's crazy. Nobody asks this. It's insane. I know it's like what you're thinking. But when we had a live chat person, when we had that chat service, we got every chat and turned it into an FAQ and the amount of people that asked, is it a supplement? It was so low. it was barely existent. Yet. We see that more on Reddit than we ever saw on chat. And I don't know, I think it's the whole thing where people don't want to look stupid. So in their mind, they're thinking it's a supplement. They can't find it. They don't want to look stupid.
00:45:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That actually might help because if they know they're chatting with a bot and not a person, maybe they'll be less inclined to feel dumb.
00:45:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Maybe. Yeah. wonder what Joe's Delphi thing. I wonder if we can use that. Ooh. I'm gonna ask him right now. Because that thing works like crazy for Jamie. Rebecca who's Jamie's bestie is like, oh my God, it's like I'm talking to you. Except it just stories of some weird words here and there. She said, but she's like, it's literally like into your. like you're answering. It's not good. I was like, really? like, oh, yeah, totally.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it? That's Delphi.ai, right?
00:46:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, forget the domain, but yes.
00:46:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Something like that. But yes.
00:46:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It's, yeah. Actually, he just sent me a link earlier.
00:46:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are their prices?
00:46:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't think they, I don't think they're front facing it.
00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it does get started now. Oh, there they are. Zero 100,000 of words to train it. Five hundred message credits. The highest one they have is $399 a month and it's full access on limited message credits. 10,000 minute credits per month on limited training. Bye. on instances, priority support, limited collaborators, that's cool. Custom domain, 10% paywall commission, and limited mass messages. Telegram integration, oh yeah, so delphi.ai slash pricing. And you can see what all of the things they have, Slack, Discord, Telegram, SMS, and WhatsApp integrations for 99 a month.
00:47:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does it, I don't even know, our use case right now is just so weird. like having embedded on, does it have a pop-up? It doesn't even know it works. I just know it's good, but I don't know how you use it, like what they're medium, like I don't know how to show.
00:47:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that it's better than this thing. Mm-hmm, Brian Tracey will chat with them, it's interesting.-hmm,-hmm. Try with Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, that's very interesting. I haven't really looked at it, because I don't know that there was anything to look at before.
00:48:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There wasn't. There definitely wasn't.
00:48:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, how does pricing but at let's say monetize, manage your audience, ask questions and prioritize effectively. wonder if it'll say how you can do it. Thank Come on, fun number, you can like, that's crazy, call somebody, hi, want to talk to Tina, here's my clone, that's what that sounds like, um, in bed, in the starter and the advanced white label website in bed, Instagram, save your resume, yeah, I mean, how else would I do it if it's not like a pop up? I mean, obviously it can be embedded in the site, but just because the standard for chat is a pop up or some script, that's what you want. I interesting. I'm going to have to take a look at this. Okay, so back.
00:50:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. mean, this is like, this is like, Graham goes, what's his thing that you liked? He had like, where they could ask him a question. He would be like, this would be like the first line of that. Like, oh, talk to Tina Bot. And then if you don't get the answer, want them. Then it goes to you directly, right? It's like, you could totally do it like that.
00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't remember anything like that. He had a forum. So, then back to notes. Where's my notes? done. I'm like looking right at them. So, regardless, If you think that the confusion is costing you roughly, we'll be conservative. Well, okay, let's say this. Wait, how do we go?
00:51:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I think the other issue is also this, and this is bizarre, but it's true. We hear this constantly. Then they don't buy it. Once we do clarify for them, well, I don't want all that other stuff. And we're like, oh my god, no one's saying you have to use it.
00:51:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this is not like you buy a lunchable and you throw 75% of it away because you only like That's how they view it.
00:51:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's exactly how they view it. It's a perfect metaphor. They view it just like, I don't like baloney. I just want the crackers and cheese. And it's like, well, then just have the crackers and cheese. You're getting like, you don't, the baloney's fine. The baloney's there if you want it. can share the baloney. can't share it. But so then it's like, it's too much. And it's like, oh my god, no. you're getting so much for 67 dollars.
00:52:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe you're looking at this totally backwards. It's maybe you use that kind of language of unlike this, you know, whatever you don't use, doesn't clutter, doesn't cause waste, doesn't cause whatever, and you still can't beat our price. And I would like highlight that. You still can't get just this and beat our price anywhere else.
00:52:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah. But they're not really the indecisive people. Weirdly, it's not a price situation. It's the questions always will it work? Will it work? So if you look at the Reddit threads, I'm last week, I was like, okay, we need to start collating these Reddit threads and start using them. Because. I think it's better than any testimonial because we cannot affect what someone says on Reddit. But you put a testimony with five stars and you're just like, who gives a ? It's like, everyone knows those are, I mean, they're real or they're fake, right? think you, I think people just gloss over. So, but we need to start leveraging these let Reddit threads as like testimonials. And, um, oh, Jason said they're adding, even though he doesn't use case, it would crush inside of ninja. Like it becomes another, like another weapon inside of ninja. And I want to think about it. Yeah, dude, this is what he said.
00:53:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is a slide.
00:53:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's a what? He's gonna send it. He said there is something to slide in or pop up.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm very nerding out about this. And I think I need to figure out how to play with that and get it. Um, okay, so then, uh, held out Tina is drilling, uh, let's see, okay, so either way, what if we just keep, so, um, I know you do split test in whatever, but I want to try to be to on a split test to find puzzle for me, that's my game, I like to play it, but, um, just another 71, just the boosting conversions.
00:54:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, what's the split test?
00:54:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you already have the idea of wanting to put the Reddit stuff on there, but what?
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, no, no, I'm going to put that in emails. Look, yeah, no, I'm like, we've got to use it.
00:54:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's, I don't think put it on the site on the page, you know, let's see. like maybe it's in um i don't know i have to go back and look at it hold on what's what is it just another time anyone dot com no name does cpa review cpa review dot com i haven't seen it in so long where's the show me the ninja only path ninja as a supplement well there you go what's the difference between the two and the prices there is no difference that's the thing why do you confuse that that's what confuses no here's the comedy our our sales went up when we did this right so we created this two pound thing because people come in and they say
00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
looking for the supplement. There isn't one. How many in?
00:56:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:56:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Got you. Right. So we're educating them. Yes, there's a supplement path with this product, but it's not enough. But it was enough to increase sales. Right. So it's like, we actually did do somewhat better. You have it. Of course, we had COVID and all this over here.
00:56:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a heat map on it?
00:56:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we have clarity.
00:56:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Next week.
00:56:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's the thing. Here's the I tell you. Everyone goes to the two paths page. That's the number one page on the site. Not the home page. It's this two paths page. And then what happens is we're trying to say to them, okay, I know this question's in your mind. So tell me which path you're on. Oh, I'm on the Ninja as a supplement path. And you go down that path and then educate you on. Oh, yeah, all right. So it's we have two sales pages that drive you to one product.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
product. We're trying to, to your point, pre-frame them like, yes, you can use this.
00:57:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then still, it doesn't work. But I think what happens is two paths page though. No, it isn't.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is too.
00:57:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking at it. No, it isn't. There's literally a two pounds page. It's it's got two pounds on it. But there's a page that's just that. How do they get there? Ads. Every ad goes to no ads go to homepage. Okay, what's the page? It's slash two dash paths.
00:57:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oops.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That can't. Oh, no, wait. It's maybe ninja two pounds. Yeah, ninja two paths.
00:57:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there two paths to dash paths? Oops, that page can't be found. You know, won't you see this page?
00:58:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What did you talk about? It's a ninja dash two dash paths.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the number of the letters. Okay.
00:58:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Letter sorry. Okay.
00:58:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes.
00:58:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's what people mostly land on. How many, what's the split?
00:58:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who goes down what path or who buys what? So then that's the other thing. So this is set up in the background, but I don't trust this data. If you go down the ninja only path and purchase, we capture that data. So it's like, but I don't know that I actually trust it because people, I know that the market is confused. Or. So I don't know. Oh, here we go. So it's almost 50, 50, 9,000 Ninja only 10,000 Ninja supplement for this year.
00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One more time, please.
00:59:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
9,000, like 9,281 Ninja only 2,219 Ninja supplement.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2,000 what Ninja supplement?
00:59:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
19, 219, 1,200, 19.
00:59:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
10,219.
01:00:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, 9,000.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
9,281 in general,,219 ninja supplement.
01:00:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, what we want is, well, we want to reverse those numbers, but that it's like a 50-50 split.
01:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, what is the conversion rate of each of those pages?
01:00:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, it's 50%.
01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, can just take the aggregate data from earlier. Okay, so just bear with me while I ask and make sure that what I'm asking is what's being answered. So, if somebody gets to the two-path page and then one person goes to the
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conversion rate of the ninja only page is exactly the same as the conversion rate of the ninjas supplement page once they get there It pretty much has to be if you look at the check out right so they go to the They go from ninja if they go from ninja only I can Fortunately go to Atlanta 19 tell us this but It's gonna it's gonna be lower in supplements Because that's where the confusion is well, that's what I'm wanting to know like how much lower and What can we do to?
01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on that especially because this it's higher amount of people that get to that page Anyway, I just think dialing into that with as accurate of data as possible And you want to go to market share, like everything that you can do to tweak and improve capture percent here and a percent there. I think knowing those exact numbers and improving this process.
01:02:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't know how to get that in Google Analytics because I don't know Google Analytics 4. Thanks Google.
01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does Eric know it well?
01:02:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nobody does.
01:02:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that.
01:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
even kidding. I know knows it well. I know who knows it really well.
01:02:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I need to know well.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to be able to do this.
01:02:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can teach you.
01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you know his partner, I can't think of their names. I haven't seen him for a while. The crap. We would talk about him. His name is coming up with Google Dashboards.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sorry. It's super similar. It's 1600 versus 2000. So 1600 people go to that page and then how do you add in? I guess I need to build a, can you build funnels in here? Here's the problem is that like, I mean, I got to think about this. The, you'd get like the people that, you know, when they're doing it in a session, they go boop, boop, right? We could get that data, but then there's what they leave and come back, they go directly to the sales page.
01:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you don't know who they are anymore.
01:03:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's another optimization that we made, right? So it's like, it used to be that we forced you down to paths and that worked for a while. And then we, I was just optimizing as we went. And then it became like, if you're on the two paths page and below, there's their like ninja returning for more, like those people don't need to know anything. They're like, yeah, boom, I'm ready to buy. So we added that and then that helped. And then the button on the button and the switches, right? if you show up the first time, you can't get to the product page. We force you to go down a path so that we can see, hey, yeah, they went down this path, even though I don't totally trust that data. But then when you come back, that button turns into by now and it's you skip the paths, you can go direct to the checkout. So, yeah, I need to figure out, I need to figure out how to, well, whatever need to figure out is how accurate this data is, but I've never been able to figure out a way to do that. Like, if you buy ninja only, are you really that? I don't know. Well, I could only know if you were a lead beforehand, or no, I could know, I could know if you were a lead beforehand, there's no way that there's, oh, maybe I can do that segment for exactly. Oh. With their new stuff.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'd be nice. Well, um, measure it. Those are the guys. But specifically, the only one I've ever spoken to was when, Karini.
01:05:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
01:05:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
might take him before. That dude. I mean, I'm sure you could pay him for a consultation and ask him just to show you some very specific things and which I mean, there's just put together a hit list and you're like, I want to do this. Yes. But also what he is amazing at is if you ask this, he will. Well. In. You'd be okay with this because some people would be annoyed that it goes off in tangent, but the tangents are really powerful because what he'll do is teach you about something, why this works, that works, or why what you're asking for is maybe not the right question. What you should be asking is this, he's freaking brilliant, Dan. think you would love to talk to him.
01:06:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No one else is going to help me.
01:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he'll blow you away, but I also think that you'll love his personality. He's just a dad. He's just like a family guy, they raise chickens, they have a farm. They're so not the average anybody in this industry, but anyway, just really stand out. I think you'd really like him, but also that he could teach you exactly what you want to know. I don't know anybody else that could. Maybe Chris Marshall, but I mean...
01:06:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I got Mercer stuff, but I just don't have time to go through it all.
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. not stuff. You just need to talk to somebody, pay somebody's time, ask the questions that you want, the hit list would be perfect.
01:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's a combo of like understanding how it works, right? I mean, my methodology that works for me is I go familiarize myself with the things, right? then I go, okay, these are the things I don't understand. For example, with Sean, right? I spent all that time learning logic or whatever. And then what I was finally like, okay, I sat with Sean about Sean, right? Sort of what you're talking about. I paid Sean to be there to walk me through stuff, but it was like all he was doing, even though he didn't know it, was connecting all the dots. I had all the dots. I go, okay, I got the dots. And I got the dots in a way that they made sense to me. But I'm like, I'm not, I'm missing something. And then working with him. It was like, dot, dot, dot, dot, and it was like, all of a sudden, it all came together and I was like, oh, okay, I got it, I got it now. So I probably need to do what I probably need to do is go through Mercer , familiarize myself. Yes, familiarize myself with like, Hey, this, this is how it works.
01:08:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, I guess you're not opposed. Like me, I think about going through that stuff and my brain is like, I'd rather talk to somebody now, which is funny because there's a dog. I used to be the exact opposite, Dan. I would be so annoyed by having to talk to somebody. I'm like, in my way, just let me do it. Yeah.
01:08:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's not that I want to do it. I just want to go understand like the core. I literally in my head, I'm just thinking about how the music recording thing went, because it was like, oh, okay, I just went and I don't want to sit there and have someone human mouse me. That's a waste of time, right? It's like, oh, okay, if I go familiarizing myself with where things are and what they're supposed to do, and then go, hey, yeah, but I want it, I want, like, so now I can go to Sean to go, how do I do this? And I'm using length, I know I'm saying the right thing. Yeah. do I do it? And then he goes, oh, you do it like this.
01:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go, okay, great.
01:09:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So everything he's saying back to me, I'm like, got it.
01:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I mean, but they also have a service and they will build out dashboards for you, track everything, teach you everything, report everything length. there's a little thing that's a bit fun. Whenever you're ready for an intro, at the very least, you I'll be ready soon.
01:09:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I gotta, if I can get, I just gotta get the funnel kick guys. So the issue that we're having with the data going into analytics is not our issue. That I figured out. I thought it was us. And I limit it. I took all the things off the table. Even the teller was like, I don't know what's going on. I figured out what was happening. got rid of them all, and then I ultimately found a bug and followed it, and they were like, oh, that's a bug. We're going to fix that. And they fixed it, and they gave me a pre-release of it, and we uploaded it last week. But now, as we just learned together, it's still not working right now. Something got better, but something is not working right. So I will send this to them now and go, hey, it's still not working right. And if they fix it, and then I'm getting, because now there's no way to go backwards, right? You can't go back popularly data into Google Analytics. So when I would talk to Win, I want to have data that's right and say, hey, I don't have bug or add to cart, that's a problem. That's our number one song product. want to have four or add to cart.
01:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Far add to cart?
01:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the far section. So I want to have variable data in good.
01:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, oh, okay. Gotcha. All right. Um, okay. . Sorry. I didn't really cost me a lot lately. fixed that. Not that you care, but anyway. I got to wrap this up. Oh, I left my notes over there. So what I mean, I want to talk about the other things also, but there are all kind of slow moving and whatever. I would love to talk about to just optimize. mean, that what was it? 4% you were trying to get this year extra. Market share or no, it's 1%. Are you there? Hello. Daniel.
01:11:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that's weird. I got muted. Okay. 1%.
01:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
1%. Yeah. Anyway, I mean, you can decide how you want to use my time, but I would love to apply it towards that for a couple of weeks, at least.
01:12:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm definitely like, it's definitely, I'm getting out of Wilbur. It's like, no, I just don't even want to do it. Like, you know what, I don't even want to do it anymore. They're, they're dynamic is just so bizarre, like, okay, I don't, why am I, I've learned all the can there, and then the fan flowy stuff is working, those damn should have some code back next week, and God willing their code will be good. And if their code is good, there's like, all the things are there to make that go. And it's just like, okay, we got to get these couple things worked out, get this code, these developers are good, I can get it. I mean, Norio said he'll be done with the other code in like three weeks, three to six weeks. So if these guys' code is good, then I think I told you this before, but I'm gonna go to Noria and go, okay great, can we get the Junior Devs to finish it so I can get your brain over here and let them finish that and then maybe Heather and I do something with that software or whatever, or we just leave it, you know, it just makes the six, it'll make like a thousand bucks a month as it is right now, but like, I did this thing other day, I sort of felt bad doing it, but Jamie sits there and talks about like, oh, know, the real strategy and I'm okay, if you know how to do it or you think you know how to do it, let's do it. And her and I have these multiple email exchanges where I painted her into a corner, threw her own words, where I was like, okay, so what I'm hearing is you're the person that wants to do this, are you willing to do that? No answer. like, yeah. because you're not I know you're not you're willing to sit there and talk but you're not willing to do work and that's a problem but she did launch a clothing brand so thank god she did what launch the clothing brand oh new distraction yeah t-shirts you know how profitable those are right yeah seven years ago yeah I sold three this week but no it's almost nothing and it's for me it's more like a hobby yeah there's it's very very very very low profit margin lots of work and if you wanted to actually make money and need money that's not the thing to do it's fun for me she needs not fun she needs an actual like a business income yeah she didn't do the ehr right but you're you're not doing your hourly rate calculation your girl you're doing that I'm having fun with calculation yes exactly which is I'm gonna and find you penniless broke.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, cuz I have one you to throw at designers and people to create my listings and I don't really actually touch it. I just go I would like this. Please go do this.
01:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Thank you back. Yeah, yeah Anyway, the fan flow everything It's it's gonna work, right? It's like It's definitely gonna work Um That thing can start and then I'm like, all right. No, and then if another seven, I'm like, I'm back to like I should just do another 71 And maybe we'll see how this pocket and when years back We were talking about something around like five different I know it's just it's just like the only thing that I think I'm I'm Earning it to the things that are my idea. Wolfer wasn't my idea. Therefore it has to go Right like making the timeline stop. Where was my idea? So that'll probably work Wolfer, not my idea probably not gonna work So then it's like, okay, I'll take that software basis. My idea, probably gonna work. You know, just look at like empire. My idea, it was my idea to get my company flowy. It's been working for three years with I'll fail. It's like, okay, it's, if I just, had I realized this a couple years ago, but that's not even the thing. Had I realized it a couple years ago, there's all this I wouldn't have learned by going and solving these other people's problems.
01:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, you know. Which is what we keep coming back to you is that you've got knowledge.
01:16:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's like, I need to solve their problems in the context of something that's mine, i.e. basis, right? It's like, hey, if you're paying me to see your problems, great. That's probably the best way for me to operate.
01:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It's almost like you're good at this stuff, Dan.
01:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sometimes, I have my moments.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whatever time. Yes, I'm actually flying out next Friday, but I'll still probably end up keeping on my call schedule because the way that kids are. are and everything else. like, man, there's this whole low period when I do my calls anyway. So I'm like, I might as well just don't Right.
01:18:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That way I will what I am going to keep working on is getting the stupid data in there correctly. That is the first First and foremost, I got it needs to populate correctly and if I get it to work on ninja, it works on every site Because they're all built on the same setup.
01:18:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're all not working exactly correctly It's great I'm excited to see what segmatrix can do now that they've got that update too because You know everything that we do is around that data. Oh, yeah All right, it always proves to be true Yeah, right mark I was just thinking of him, but I was also thinking about his poor doggy. Okay. I'm not gonna cry On that note Oh, by the way, your audio hasn't been perfect the whole time, so really it was my iMac and I need to tell Apple.
