00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, can you hear me?
00:00:06 - Seth Ellsworth
What was that?
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me, but I'm sleepy.
00:00:12 - Seth Ellsworth
Sounds sleepy.
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, but my mission blessings set me apart when I got set apart said that I would have enough energy and do what I need to do. So I'm not canceling anything.
00:00:26 - Seth Ellsworth
We'll put that to the test.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited and I'm loving it.
00:00:42 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm excited It sounds like a really cool family history of the life changing thing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is. And being able, I think, I thought that, I don't know, I do everything from my computer. at home. So I didn't think that it would feel very different, but it is definitely different. The interaction with the Holy Ghost is different. The level of accountability I have spiritually is different. The blessings are different. And I'm only just getting started and I expect that to increase as I practice and lean into it. I was literally just built for this, which is why the spirit I think was bugging me so bad about wanting to do this kind of mission. But the records, the technology, the speed of the evolution, and most of the missionaries are senior missionaries. So they're not super fast. don't have top of the line technology. They don't have their brains aren't really there. They're just like four, all the things that are happening, but they're willing. and that's all the Lord needs, right? He will make that happen. But I'm willing, ready, able, and amplified. And so it's, it's exciting. Anyway, I'm loving it. Yeah, but also we've had three wrecks in my family in three weeks and really horrible things happening to my children and like car wrecks? Car wrecks, yeah. My daughter got into two. One lady ran into me. I just watched her. was like, she's not really going to, yep, she is. And but nobody got her. It's been traumatic. I'm probably gonna lose my insurance. Like there's so many things going on. But the thing that I noticing is that resilience when it comes to just trusting in the Lord, that's everything. Like I understand how the children of Israel could have hated life and wanted to die. I if they couldn't be delivered, but then the Lord didn't deliver them, he just strengthened their backs and they were joyful. I'm like, I get that now. I get that now. Still in prison, still suffering, but finding joy and I totally get it.
00:03:18 - Seth Ellsworth
So that sounds like a really heavy.
00:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't feel heavy, though. see it. I know it should be.
00:03:30 - Seth Ellsworth
I know that it is, but it doesn't feel like it, which is what the materials so.
00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that's I think the blessing too is because while they're freaking out and crying and hurting, you know, like, I've got all my wearable tech, my ordering, my Apple Watch, like my sleep is not disturbed. My heart rate is even, my stress levels. Physically, there's no physical. to change and I just I'm like it is going to be okay all day long. I'm saying it's going to be okay. I don't have to stretch for that. I know it. And I can see that it has the calming effect because they've always fed off of my energy and I've definitely been a stress case in the past and but it's a good thing. The reason I'm serving the mission most of all besides being called is because I needed the extra blessings and protection but it's funny how simultaneously it comes with extra work and burden. Like it's a 12-hour week commitment. I don't even work that much. So for a year but I'm anyway so excited and so blessed and hopefully I can pass the blessings to others because I want Jesus to come back. Okay that's actually number one reason. If family history is the thing if Building, if being ready, having Zion ready, having done a certain level of tempo work, is what gets him back. I'm y'all, let's get to work. would like him to come back now. That would be wonderful. Anyway, you've got to have another baby up in here.
00:05:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Pretty nuts.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so...
00:05:25 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not thinking about it too hard. stressful.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, everything will be okay. Nothing's straging yet, and we're promised that our enemies will not prevail over us. Right?
00:05:50 - Seth Ellsworth
That is correct. Where is mine? I'm trying to bring up my iPad so that I can...
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:05 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. My apple pencil is not charged either.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:06:13 - Seth Ellsworth
So you can use your finger. You can also use the whiteboard here. Okay. going to decide where to start here. So the direct inbox. Sales page and tracking. Is all working. So now my full focus is on getting. The automation backbone. Solid. And that has been. Tricky because. Because I'm trying to do some unique things here that I thought were easy and it turns out that it wasn't as easy, but I think I have it solved. And then from there. I have a lot of ideas for the email automation. I'm actually excited about that. That has been a real huge question mark, but the call that I had with talking more than his boardroom clients. Last week. Was really great, probably more for me than them, because. I got to spend a couple hours on there with him afterwards and he helped with a bunch. So I'm going to explain to you firstly. The. That's my three year old. Two year old banging on the door.
00:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just once I hear it.
00:07:58 - Seth Ellsworth
No problem.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:07 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. You You Okay. Sorry. Michelle is in bed. She is that she's at the point of not sleeping.
00:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it's exhausting.
00:09:28 - Seth Ellsworth
And we're. Everything's chaos at the house because we're moving everything around and moving rooms and. Anyway. All right, I'm going to. I'm going to show you that the few pillars here. I think I have everything down to really two or three simple concepts. That are. Really easy for people to understand. It makes sense. And I'm the only person talking about them. They're super unique. The value is kind of obvious, but the first, the first problem that people are having is with delivery. We're talking about email specifically. Second problem is opens. And third problem is sales.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:10:25 - Seth Ellsworth
So you have, if your emails aren't getting delivered, you can't get opens. If your emails are delivered, that doesn't necessarily mean you have opens.
00:10:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you have opens, it doesn't necessarily mean you have sales.
00:10:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So all of these things didn't actually flow this way. the concept of delivery. Is solved by a little bridge here. The concept is really this. Our job is to prove to the email service. providers like Google that you are family. If you can prove that your family, you're not subject to the same deliverability rules that everyone else is, which is why your mother can send you you know political chain email about some conspiracy theory with 97 links in it and it never ever ever gets sent to this sandbox. And so that concept of becoming family instantly makes sense to people and nobody's really going to argue that because it's 100% true.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I'd argue that I'm just asking how would you how would you prove that? Well you're proven with the simple concept of it, one's the last time an email from your mother was sent to spam.
00:11:58 - Seth Ellsworth
And if you're in the same cat February. In terms of how Google sees your business, the likelihood of you ending up in the spam box is very low.
00:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:12:10 - Seth Ellsworth
So it's not. I don't have a ton of data to prove this out yet, but the cause you just said you said the key thing right there.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would just make sure that that's always there. When's the last time the message from your mother ended up in the spam box, even if you wish it had.
00:12:29 - Seth Ellsworth
Right.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because for sure wouldn't read that content, that type of thing.
00:12:34 - Seth Ellsworth
And so I'm thinking that my ads can revolve around that singular concept. Because essentially, that's what DTI delivers. helps. If you're having 60 to 80% of your new subscribers reply to you, you look like family.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:57 - Seth Ellsworth
Because businesses don't get replies like that.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
effort. Yes, love that.
00:13:03 - Seth Ellsworth
And that's the whole concept. And that allows you to completely ignore all the massively technical aspects of delivery. so we saw this for 10 bucks. The first time I implemented it, it took 10 minutes. So I'm using the $10 for 10 minutes thing. It's probably going to take others much longer than that. But it sounds good. Okay, so that's the concept that then allows your emails to be delivered. Now how do we get them opened? Now here's, here's, we have an automated, let's see, we have 80% opens. Which is interesting and there's there's two there's two side. There's two Good So they eight percent opens is is set off by five seven ten day email automation So the What's different, let me put this in a different color We talked a little bit about this before I think via text messages, but I've been struggling with like what the upsell is Right And I think the upsell is just the ninety five dollar course, but Do you have the ninety five dollar course defined?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or even outlined so what's that and so this is how this is how
00:15:00 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm going to approach it. Now that you have delivery, how are we going to get opens? Well, it starts with an automation. And so the process that allows for sales, and then I forgot to do this part, which is the ongoing broadcast emails on into the future of 60% to 80%. So in order to maximize sales, in the short term and the long term, what we do is we make sure that we nail delivery. We run people through a five to 10 day email automation, and then that allows us to sell efficiently. And then on into the future, your broadcast will typically fall between 60% and 80%. And that's when you do this properly. So I'm leaning towards. I'm confusing myself, where did I over-complicate this?
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you were talking about the $95 up-so, but one thing I would love, because this is the first time you've said something that I've been listening for, and that's delineating the difference between open rates for sequences versus broadcasts, because you say this gets 80% open, there are going to be plenty of people going, that's , you can't do that. Not consistently, not across the board, with all things, you can, but there are caveats to it, right? Sequences that have been specifically designed and engineered, right? with all the things. And your process will improve broadcast, but broadcasts are handled differently by ESPs. So that changes things a little bit. And what I would love to see you say so that you're being more responsible with language is 80% open on sequences, maybe in parentheses underneath it. And maybe there's an asterisk or something, but just a truth and marketing kind of thing. Trusting the Lord to bless you for being different even in that aspect, right?
00:17:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
00:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because one of the things I think one of the hallmarks of Seth Ellsworth is I'm different. I do things differently. I get different results because I do things differently. I want you to lean into that always and that difference is a few things. It's that they go left, you go right, but you go right because you feel inspired too. But the difference is also you have the story of the old lady. I can't remember her name, but I want to remember her name that lost money because you sold her something. You said enough sold her.
00:18:41 - Seth Ellsworth
What's her name?
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nancy. Right. So you have Nancy that you'll never forget because you had it, what you did to sell affected her life so powerfully and negatively. that you swore never to do that again. So you always are, and I don't think you're going to lose sales because of it. I think that it actually is more powerful, especially for the people who are willing to do the work, because even at $10 they still have to do the work, that you're purposely not making salacious claims. You're making powerful claims, true claims, but there are caveats and nuances. anyway, just these tiny little nuances, right, to the language I think makes a difference where you separate the difference between, and you can even inform them of the difference between sequences and broadcasts, because I've seen where people had great email health, and then they went from sequences to broadcasts.
00:19:57 - Seth Ellsworth
Everything else was the same.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They were this computer. their messaging was the same. Their sender score immediately dropped, tanked. Everything went to spam box after that. So there is a mechanical difference, a qualifying difference between broadcast and sequences at the ESP level that people should be aware of that affects their open rates because it affects their inbox placement. So anyway, we haven't talked about that and since you're really diving into this and I think that you're going to master this, I think it takes a little while to build up at this price point for it to be really valuable for you. But what I think, Chris or Chris, Seth, is that, as you have a Chris reminder come up, that this is going to be a compounding thing that your audience is going to compound that your business This is going to compound that you will be because you're going to continue studying all of this an email master, but, but that also aligned with a bigger purpose to me, which I think is your master of teaching of learning, I think you're a master student of the Lord, and many other things, but I also, and the best student ever of all time is the best teacher of all time. Jesus, we know he was the best student of all time, because who did he learn from constantly? His father, he was always learning. That's what made it the best teacher. You know what mean? So you're doing the same thing, but everything that people are sending in email, the things that people engage with the most is kind of entertainment. It's we're learning from whoever we're buying from. The reason that we're buying is because we learned some thing to convince us to purchase, right? So you're teaching people how to teach better, you're teaching people how to lead better, even though it's email, you're teaching people how to email better, but the reason their email is working better is because you're teaching them how to communicate better, how to engage better, how to lead better, and the result is people want to read from them more, and people trust them enough to buy the thing that they're recommending. So you're not just the email guy, you're the teacher, you're the maestro, you're like, you know what I mean? And I see this really developing huge, but I think the cornerstones of it have to be around integrity and just saying like this is exciting, it's hyperactive, it's all of those things, like it is new, brand new, in terms of so people do it and it's powerful and it's almost magic but it's dressed up as work wearing overalls because you have to do some the difference is you only have to do a little bit like that's my whole thing right people stay work smarter not harder i actually make it happen most people that say that can't do it i've mastered it nope so that's that i think that's where you're at you are this the supreme leverage of email anyway okay $95 up so um so you've you've handled direct you've handled inbox placement $10 the next issue is open rate you have a $95 product which what is that is that we'll talk about the we'll talk about the the products in a second okay um so so this these are the content
00:24:00 - Seth Ellsworth
concepts that string together. I think I could use the family concept in the ads probably so I might need another concept here like an automation or whatever. But we have delivery opens and sales and the difference is how to get opens, well, this is how you structure the the intro or the I don't have a good name for the onboarding experience when somebody enters your world. This is how you structure that automation. That's what I'm going to be giving away for free as the as the reply-based value. It's here's how to structure an automation that gets 80% opens and I'll show them the structure. And then from there it's what do you get the automation to do in order that you make sales. That's where you let we layer on top the concept of completion versus conversion. And then that unlocks something I'm playing with is this idea of 80-20 which is 80% opens and 20% conversion. I don't think those are crazy numbers. When people do it this way, I don't want to suggest that they'll get 20% conversion.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you but you can reference the parietal principle and you can very quickly show the evidence that that's the case. Now you can say this isn't a claim but there's a reason we keep hearing about 80-20 over and over and over again. It's 100% possible. Probably depends on you. Depends on how well your able to execute and I can't guarantee your ability to execute what I'm teaching you. So there's your caveat. But the probability of somebody doing the optimal, you know, psychological and mechanical operational approach to email says that the Pareto principle takes into account anyway. First of all, that 80% of the wealth is created by 20% of the people. Can you be in that 20% like we talk about being 1% but you don't even have to be 1% and nobody says that. Nobody says that because it's so much easier to be in that 20% than it is to be in the 1% right? So and you can steal that but you better give me some credit because I'm about to go on that one. But that's the reality is we're told that it's harder than it is but it's not actually. So anyway, yeah, you can make that claim if you, if you say it rightly and you borrow from evidence that's already been presented that everybody already knows.
00:27:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Perfect. Well, that's the concept. I mean, 80% opens, 20% And that's what makes you open on sequences.
00:27:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just going to keep tagging.
00:27:30 - Seth Ellsworth
You can tell me no, but that's, that's all I think you should write on this on this stuff. And then 60 to 80% ongoing forever. Ideally, that's the. mean, is it possible that forever? No. If your list is stagnant and you're not dumping fresh leads in there, like it's going to stagnate at some point. But like I haven't sent an email that hasn't gotten 60% opens in a long time. And I don't even have any automations for this yet. So it'll just get better from there.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:04 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, and I proved that on the call and everybody was blown away. I could give them a screenshot. This is the screenshot of every email I sent for this promotion. And these are all broadcasts. And the worst one was 64% open rate. And they have about lost it. Um, so, so here's these, these are the, these are the things that I'm going to sell here. So, so these are the concepts per se. what I'm selling is how to become family, essentially, and also how to get completion, um, which is what the, the, the $95 workshop is about. And then from there, we, we go directly into the $300 per week offer. Um, which teaches you. you had to do all of this. And we implement it. So that's kind of an implementation, folks, hey, would you like to, you know, do all of this and get of full funnel? I don't think we need any more things to sell than those. Well, the upsell to a power day, I think you should be building in. Right. I mean, that's always in there. I'm not going to not sell that because that would be silly. But in terms of like the $10 thing leads to this and this leads to that. Yeah. That's pretty much it. The $25,000 stuff is going to easily come out of this.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, my dog is playing it.
00:29:52 - Seth Ellsworth
There's also a $9,800 a yearly buy.
00:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which saves them how much?
00:30:05 - Seth Ellsworth
I think $300 a week for 52 weeks is $15,600.
00:30:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you definitely need a good powerful sales letter that points that out.
00:30:25 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't. I was told to, if you want buy in on the 9800, put it on the order page and have a beast of prize.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I'm mostly saying where you have the 9800 specify that that's how much it saves them.
00:30:47 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So the. I don't know if you've seen this or not.
00:31:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry.
00:31:10 - Seth Ellsworth
I said that link real fast and you'll see the. I don't. So I only say 37%.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could definitely. Oh, for sure. You want to give the number. The this the dollar amount savings is what really matters to most people. 37% is like that's an average savings. Yeah.
00:31:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So 300 times 52 is 1516. That saves you $5,800. $100.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought this was in her mind right now. She plays tag with a deer, there was a baby deer that were born a few years ago and they used to sleep underneath my front deck and now they just come and they chase her ear. She barks and the other dog too but mostly it's her and she has started bouncing night deer down. She like springs up and down like they do and the deer are not scared of her. They run at the fence and go up and down within, if she gets called into the house and can't play anymore, they just stare there waiting for her. Yes, it is annoying because she barks a lot and I have annoyed neighbors, but it's also the cutest thing to watch a deer and a dog play together.
00:33:14 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, that's that's a viral that's a viral thing right there.
00:33:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but it's nobody else's business so they don't get to see it. Okay.
00:33:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I just added want to say 5,800. Join us for 9,800 for a year immediate access to everything private on morning with set up plus quarterly one on once.
00:33:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I would do is change your start now to say 5,800 per year start now underneath it all in that button, which is huge. But it really it draws the attention right there. I can like if you set up split test, you could see almost always. that's going to win is having the save the price, save the amount of money on the button right there. When we finally get into being able to work regularly and can do split testing, have a team do all the operational stuff, I can't wait for you to see the tiny little things that make a difference quickly. But yeah, like we're barely even on the playground right now. We're mostly like looking at the playground. And then I just had a flashback to 1990 something with ABC, another bad creation at the playground in Ayesha, old songs.
00:35:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay, I'm just adding that to the button.
00:35:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's check it out. Refresh. I don't see it yet.
00:35:25 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't see it?
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did see the first thing when I refreshed, so... It's weird. Let me try it in the incognito browser. Nope. Let's In all your business, have you messed around with GPT 4.0 yet, or 4.0, not 4.0, but... Okay. What you've experienced before, it's 10 times better than anything, so... I think that we'll be able to start using this to help you knock out some stuff pretty quickly. You can upload with more. I'm pretty sure it can read videos now, so in terms of feeding it a stuff library and getting it to help you with copy. Framework, right, so you go through and tweak it, but it should reduce your workload significantly, not because it did everything for you, but because it started everything for you. Yeah. Right. Let's try to see if it. Man, come on. Let me see this. I'm going to type a box of new notifications. What's going on? If you go into an incognito browser, can you see the change?
00:37:26 - Seth Ellsworth
No, I saw it immediately.
00:37:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In an incognito browser, where you're not signed in. Let me put it in Safari.
00:37:44 - Seth Ellsworth
Instead, I always use that. Yeah, it shows up for me.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just. Okay. Yeah, I'm in Safari, which has never loaded that site and I can't see it. That is very strange. Let me do it from my phone.
00:38:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Whoops.
00:38:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. Email. Actually. All right, now I see it on my phone. That's good. Awesome. Good job. don't know why I don't see it here. It's. Available publicly. Okay. Let's make sure we. Get the best out of this time together. So. First of all, did you already know? No, I feel like you've solidified some things today. Just had it in your head, but solidified like what the upsell is. Where? Just run through your head about what has to be built. So obviously, you need an ad. You need a landing page sales page, which you have. You need to follow up sequences. You need to be able to deliver this stuff. So this $95 course, where have you got that?
00:39:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Right now, the sales page just sells the recordings of the workshop.
00:39:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'll get it done, because that and what you're going to put them in the email list group, right?
00:39:40 - Seth Ellsworth
Correct. The email list, they get access to everything.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so actually, but so how would you support the people who paid for all the recordings at $95? Would you, what kind of support would you offer?
00:39:55 - Seth Ellsworth
There's no support for purchasing.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so. It's just for the knowledge and the information and the recorded videos.
00:40:03 - Seth Ellsworth
Are there transcripts? I put those videos up on an entrepreneur page.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you get me a link to one of your videos and let's try chat dbt and see what we can scrub out of that right now on a call? Or what? Because if we can pull out not just a transcript but bullet points like you can create a quick PDF support and just add the the feeling. First of all the searchability, the access like I hate watching videos. If I can get timestamps and you can tell me where I can go back to go find the thing that I want. If you can give me like a table of contents for each of the videos, chapters, things like that, then I know exactly where to go. So maybe people watch it the whole way through. but then they want to go back and go, okay, where was this thing? You've saved them from having to scrub through it. And now here's a quick little, here's this, here's that, here's this. And then if you have a little bit more time, what you can do is find some screenshots or whatever to go back with it. And now you've got an additional thing with the PDFs quality content that helps people who process information differently. So you've got the audio people, you've got the visual people, you've got the audio visual people, you've got the, I can't read anything or I can't listen to anything. You've covered them all, which means you're going to be able to serve more people better because you've provided the content across different ways.
00:41:59 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh. I've got 15 minutes before I got a call of landing, right, so okay, so what I what I did is I just sent you an email or okay. just sent you access to, at least if I did it right. To the team of Maria systems at Gmail. That's the right one or not, but that'll work. That should give you access to the delivery page where a content is. There's really just two videos on there. But they're longer videos.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't have anything. Do you have, do you happen to have them on like Google Drive or anywhere else or are they just on your computer?
00:42:58 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't use Google Drive for more.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
anything.
00:43:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay, but you should get an email a second. It looks like I added the right tag. So we're waiting for our automation to get it to me. Well, that's how that's how it works. Okay, I can't send you here. Yeah, either way, you have to be cookie in order to see it. Otherwise, you won't, you'll go to the page and you won't be able to access it.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the video only exists an entrepreneur?
00:43:37 - Seth Ellsworth
No, you can't play the video unless you have a proper cookie that says they.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm not a customer. I'm trying to help you with this. So that's what I'm asking you. Does it basically exist anywhere else where you can share it with me, not in the system?
00:43:52 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't need to see in the system. can I can give you, let me find the email links. All right, let me make sure those are all viewable. This one should be unlisted. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I sent those to your text message. I don't know if that's useful or not, but you.
00:45:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'll work. Sorry we couldn't find that page. Maybe he has to be logged in.
00:45:50 - Seth Ellsworth
right, so it should be, it should be good. I just switched them all to unlisted so you should be able to see them.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you click on the links, the links might have changed when you did that. don't know, but I just clicked each of them and two of them I clicked after you changed it. So it's not a cookie issue.
00:46:30 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, You There we go.
00:47:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, good. can see previous. So that means it's definitely going to work. OK.
00:47:30 - Seth Ellsworth
OK.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. See how fast. I can do it. Does Vimeo offer you transcription?
00:48:09 - Seth Ellsworth
Nope.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:48:13 - Seth Ellsworth
So what I would like to upload it to like Loom or something and that give you an instant transcription.
00:48:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I upload it to anything or if you're willing to use Dropbox or a cloud something, give it to me. I'll download it. I'll get the transcription. But yeah, if you have something you can get the transcription, let's do that because I really think that this is going to simplify your copywriting, writing your emails, writing your creating support. I think that I think it will give us a lot. Any of the videos that you have that are training around email lists, having a cloud so that that I can can get access and I can help you chat GPTA40 is night and day difference from the previous versions. And it's trained very quickly. It's, it is so much, it's just so much better stuff. Because so let's see, you let me go check base camp and see what you have already created for assignments for this funnel. Where would I find it? Because you don't have a DTI project. Have you written out the task for what needs to happen to get this as a full funnel life?
00:49:47 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, it's it's the 30,000 foot view or Yes. Okay. I mean, it's still in
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
July down. Yeah, it's still in the dump format, but okay, I haven't updated this in a minute, but generally It's okay because I know you have to go soon What I'm going to do when you get me those videos is I'm going to capture all of the task lists And I'm going to capture our content and I'll spend a couple hours with chatgbt Trying to create as much of a framework as possible Then let's reconvene Um Can you do next Tuesday? I'll send you what I have before then so you can get to work potentially before then but let's get a tentative call for next week And Tuesday is 60 Yeah, but I am not available until almost let's see That I mean Yeah, I'm going to have to do that. So that's 10.30. I'll be down by 12. Then I have to drive home to 12.30, my time, 130, your time, around 145.
00:51:17 - Seth Ellsworth
Your time?
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, 245, your time, sorry. Wait, no, 12.45, my time, 145, your time. OK, let me put this on here. If we have to reschedule, we can. I am going to send you some stuff at a time. So there, go ahead. What? OK, cool. That time, I just want to make sure I get this on here before we get out the phone. So when can I expect you to have that stuff somewhere uploaded for me? All of the videos that you have around any of the email.
00:52:00 - Seth Ellsworth
um trainings that you've done. I have them all in everything's in Dropbox that I've ever done.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, can just share that with me then. If you can, if you will, or move it into a folder that is shareable, however you want to do it, but that would be the thing to do.
00:52:19 - Seth Ellsworth
We'll figure that out.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There we go. It's going to be the usual line. I'm not going to copy it, paste it. Um, a usual paste. That's my brain, usual line. Okay. Save, send, obviously 1245 my time, which is 145 year time. Okay. Um, good job. Uh, anything else that, um, you need help with just any mental blocks, any encouragement, anything, like how can I help you in the next five minutes?
00:53:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I mean, I'm not really sure.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your biggest struggle right now?
00:53:13 - Seth Ellsworth
Yesterday, I spent 14 hours trying to figure out how to get make.com to work. To help my funnel because one thing on report does not do. Is any any sort of reply based automation. And this is going to be a core piece of my funnel is driving people to reply. And that's what is the upsell is on the reply page. So I want to drive people to the reply and it's a value based upsell. I teach them a new concept. And upsell them. So tracking all of that and making it part of the funnel was way harder.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you accomplish it?
00:54:02 - Seth Ellsworth
I think so. There's one little thing that's not working as I thought it would.
00:54:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the next time you get stuck on an automation thing, I would love you to work with this young lady that I hired who she may not know what to do yet, but she is very good at figuring things out. She loves automation. She's excited about it. She communicates very well. She's the $15 hour Filipino, but she's still cheaper than almost everybody else who is really good at this stuff. Because the sooner we get you support, I realize the money's not there and that's eventually what you want to do, but the thing is you'll get to the money faster when you get help faster. So what you can teach her, her ability to problem-solve by the information and keep trying is high and good. So I think that that would be worth your while and I can introduce you at any point when you're ready so that's something to keep on your hat because this is you want to direct that this is the thing to do this is where we're doing it this is the overall thing but we don't want you doing the mechanics of it and the operations of it and the sooner we can get you out of it like that 14 that's so draining that is so draining that piss yes exactly so tapping into somebody else even for $15 an hour and that'd be $150 plus whatever else like almost $200 but still that $200 you probably would have gladly spent if we could have made the same amount of progress and you didn't do it no for sure so at any point let me know I will introduce you and I feel like she has the capacity to learn and figure these things out so that's definitely need help because it's
00:56:00 - Seth Ellsworth
It's not, uh, I mean, not, not just automation stuff, but, but helping somebody help me.
00:56:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, especially on the technical side of it, and then on the customer service side, I can always find you somebody quickly. I just don't know. Well, like we haven't talked about finances for a while, so I haven't talked about freaking out. So are you getting money somehow from your, your, I mean, I have to get by, but we still haven't paid rent.
00:56:29 - Seth Ellsworth
Today is the first of the month. So kind of the same situation, but not as urgent because I have some, I have a movement. Okay.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not like going to collapse mentally because you have enough to keep from that. Yeah.
00:56:51 - Seth Ellsworth
I mean, I'm not collapsing mentally, but there's not enough.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're just, um, we're good.
00:57:00 - Seth Ellsworth
more resilient and we're closer, we're closer than we've ever been. And I know this stuff is gonna crush.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just me managing my mentors in order to get the work done. Yeah, let me make sure that this works. I'm gonna send you her profile. So we'll start with one person at a time. This is the most powerful person that we need for you right now. It's in chat. I'm also gonna text it to you. So tell her that I sent you her new client, Tina, Tina Maria, whatever, recommended you her. And I'd be happy to get on a call with both of you. You can zoom like she speaks great. Screenshare, she gets it started as soon as you can, teacher everything. And I'm happy to help manage that in any kind of way. But the sooner we get you one type of support help to offload some things. So it would be this person first. And she has worked in on support. I don't know how efficient she is at it, but it doesn't matter. All it is is a matter of navigational stuff. The function, understanding functions and possibilities and what things are supposed to do is more important than understanding the navigation. Because then she learns the navigation. So she understands the functionality of automation and what's possible very, very well.
00:58:36 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep, I got to jump on to this call. Okay, go, care, talk to you soon. Yep, see ya.
