Hello, 18 a good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you? I'm doing good. How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, I'm glad to speak with you today. Um, have you had any kind of background about about what this conversation would be about or what to expect or anything?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.
00:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so last year, I met with Samantha and Lorenz, and we had one conversation, and we talked a little bit just about leadership, because it was more an exploratory call, like, happens if we talk to the attorneys, not the business owner that hired me. And Samantha wasn't interested. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. This process isn't for everybody, but Lorenz kind of around with it. And so we had a conversation that he was particularly interested in, and I'm telling you this because the approach is different for everyone. So what you're interested in and what might be beneficial to you may have nothing to do with anybody else, and I'm not interested in doing anything that's not helpful to you or not interesting to you. So keep that in mind. But what he was interested in is the fact, first of all, Samantha puts up big numbers and she beats everybody. She beats everybody in terms of attorney fees and how many cases she does. I don't know if you know that, but she does.
00:04:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I figured, I figured.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but her approach is different and her approach doesn't work for everybody. You know, there are different types of personalities inside of Sweet Law. There's been shifting around, you know, different case managers on different teams, different assistants on different teams, things like that. And a lot of that, Mark has driven based on conversations with different attorneys and just finding who works best with there.
00:04:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So that's one little type of tweet, right?
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But for Lorenz, he saw those numbers and he's like, I could do better. I want to do better, but I don't know how to do better. And so, after having a conversation with him, I figured out something that I thought would work for him and I give him a book called multiple. pliers. And that is how to make better leaders out of everybody around you. So instead of him, because he didn't feel like he was really bringing the best out of the people on his team, and also he didn't feel that that was his strength. So I gave him that book and he had a couple of aha moments, but fast forward three months later, and he almost was doubling his monthly numbers. So, you know, that that's that's some good results. And he was interested in this. So I don't know what might be good for you. I know you're fairly new. New to Sweet Law. Now, I don't know how new you are as an attorney.
00:05:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
know you're a younger one attorney. don't know if you practiced anywhere else before. No, I'm coming up on just putting my second year and know that.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did you become an attorney?
00:05:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
My uncle was an attorney and when I was a kid, my guy was just following his footsteps. I saw it was like a lucrative opportunity. I feel like the type of work is things that I'm able to tolerate more than most people would. So I do feel like it's something that because I know the average time for an attorney is like five years before they kind of make a decision on what they want to do. They want to go somewhere else, you know, but I'm cool like the work that I do coming in here talking to clients, getting like, you know, complained at why is the number this or, you know, just juggling things. I just feel like I have a good tolerance for that and I can just crank work out. Now, there's like two sides to being a lawyer, like some are in court all the time, some are, you know, doing what we do here where we're just office dealing with clients, which I feel like is better for for me, which is why I pick this area, but if I have friends that are attorneys, they're like, I can't do what you do. Like, it's just boring. But for me, I'm like, I don't want go on court once in my career. You know, so I don't know. I like what I do. And I just feel like I have what it takes to make a good living off of it. And it's cool. Like, we have this one case, the kid was like 22 years old, pretty big injuries. And the money that we got for him, he was able to pay off school that he's going to. things like that are cool to know that, like, you know, that took a chance in hiring us and we were able to change a portion of his life, which is pretty cool. On every case is like that, some clients always complain about the money that they get. But every now and then you. get something cool where you feel good about about what you do. So, that's good.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good insight that that helps me actually to learn a lot about you. So you would you consider yourself pretty easy going?
00:08:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my my requirements are like very low as long as I have a few hours to go to the gym during the day. That's all I really care about. Well, coming to work early, you would have to do pretty high patients level. did go to a military college, so things that would probably stress people out more or like start to freak out a little bit earlier. I typically have like a longer range of where I'm able to tolerate it before it gets to that point, which why I'm like just so chill at work because I've been through so much.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing.
00:09:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, this is nothing, you know, um, yeah, I'm a pretty talent person. Like, I don't, or how many needs, you know, but do you feel like do you feel driven or do you feel like I'm just like meandering kind of through life and it's just chill and is really big goals? just don't like I'm the type of person I'll just rather do the work than just, you know, talk talk about, you know, what my big plans are or like, I keep a lot of things to myself and like, yeah, you like blink in like two years later, it's like, whoa, how did Pat get there? It's like, you know, putting in the work like after high school, I went straight to college. After college, I went straight to law school like never really did you live in like, kind of a poverty or like gang area or anything when you were younger? No. And then I parents weren't like really well off, but We weren't like on food stamps or anything like that.
00:10:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not necessarily that you were poor, but that was it around you.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, not really.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. you just have a. You remind me of a lot of people that had like lived in tough neighborhoods coming up, you know, and so I was just wondering, I was curious about that. So I know that you hope you kind of keep things close to the chest, but would you share any of your professional goals with me?
00:10:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm two years in. Obviously, like the first day I got here, I saw that like Sam was the highest. So there's like a competitive nature, but so a lot of respect. Because when Mark hired me, I didn't really have any experience in this. field, first that I had when I first started now, obviously like I got more cases and have a team now, but like I always joke around with their teller like, because I don't have as many cases as she does, so obviously I can't really get the numbers there, but you know, obviously my goal is to be the one that does leading the firm as far as the numbers go, just from a competitive standpoint, obviously every month like things change, but I love that. Because I know I'm still pretty young, but, you know, some months I'd be Lauren's or I don't know if you've met Tyler before. And I have like half the cases that they do. So like, to me, that's like my way of showing that, you know, because I'm obviously they're older, they have more experience and education, but that's my way of trying to get respect that like, hey, I just got here and I'm, you know, starting to make my mark. So that's really important for me.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So do you keep track of stats like how long it takes your cases, what percentage of the time you're hitting a max settlement and what's the other one? Just how many cases you're taking? Like, I know that you're given cases. But what are you doing in terms of monitoring those numbers? and trying to push them, if anything.
00:13:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I have a list of cases that get settled every month, so I see a daily track of what the number is for that month for settlements and how much the attorneys fees we brought in. There's also like a little note on there if it's settled for the policy limits.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure if you know what that is. Yep, that's what I meant to say when I said how much, yeah.
00:13:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so obviously every case we pushed for that, but it doesn't always work out that way. Right. know Mark keeps a better track of how many policy limits cases we get. I don't know if so many cases were because I can keep a lot of things in my mind, like right now because I don't know as many, but I'm really on top of the numbers. Because that's obviously the indicator that, you know, Boss looks at to see where everybody's at you are you able to see that and let if I The list do you have access to you have access to let if I everybody does right?
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, okay, so we've been working on the dashboard for the last three years This has been a whole long process and and one of the things is just really trying to put together the numbers and a really clear way That are important that help us figure out. Okay. How are we performing? Across the board. How are we performing across attorneys and pods? How are we performing across? Types of cases how are we performing across? Vendors who bring us the leads because we have several different vendors that bring us leads They all perform differently how are we performing across states? So like we're really analyzing breaking everything down and You know how it is any anywhere you go you've got some people that come in to collect paychecks And we've got
00:15:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
uh people that come in because they got missions to accomplish and goals to accomplish and then we got people that are just in there trying to slam everybody like there's a whole spectrum right of how they show up and um so um you said that there was something that like sometimes that at night you'll think about like what you could do better what are some of the things that i've popped up in your head um just being more efficient on certain tasks because when i started it was just me with my case load and then in january i got a case manager and then like march i got an assistant um so i'm just doing every piece of the case myself um now obviously i have people who are being paid to help me um so it's more like let me focus on certain things that are gonna that i need To do, for example, negotiating or, you know, pushing certain cases out, monitoring, that's one of the things I did the last month is going through the case load early and figuring out why something is stuck, or how can I move it forward? Because the more cases you get, some things start to slip and get stuck. Mark does a good job of going through our cases, too, reminding us like, hey, you know, this one can be moved and get done this month. So just kind of trusting another person to do their job, see like things that kind of slip. Because when I first cut a team, I was like, well, this is great. Just let them know what they're supposed to do right. I'm like, okay, you guys go do that. I'll go do this. And then I started looking through the cases and like certain things are being missed. So I know that I can just give these people 100%.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I love that you've noticed that. And so you have Cynthia, right?
00:17:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And she used to be on the rental team. Yeah.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like, one of the things that he learned about her is that she is very systems and processes oriented, like she needs to have structure. Whereas he said a lot of other people that he's worked with, they don't, they're just like, you know, they roll with whatever. But she likes to have the documented, she likes to be like step by step. Do you feel like you've noticed that also or noticed anything about how she works?
00:17:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she is like that. But now she's a little bit because for like a good three months, it was just her and I. So, and I didn't know I was going to get other help. So I kind of trained her to, you know, be proactive and not necessarily have to wait for me to task her for every little thing and be like, look, when we get this case, these are the three things that always need to get done. You know, after a month or two, distance to get done. So now she's a little bit more, she's still like very task oriented, but she's still now, she's little bit more proactive where she knows certain things have to get done, no matter what, so.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you consider yourself a leader?
00:18:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm still figuring that out because I'm a really independent person. And like if I was able to, I would just handle all my cases by myself.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you do with is being a leader. What's that? What you do with Cynthia is being a leader.
00:18:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's still hard for me because like, like I work out a lot and I never have a gym partner.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always go by myself.
00:18:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. But she's been, yeah, I mean, I know what I have to do in order to get the team to, like I can be a leader, still figuring it out because like I said, a lot of things in life I would rather just do by myself, but. Obviously, can't 200 cases, when I need to, in college, we had a lot of leadership stuff. We're at like lead teams and trained people. I'm just trying to find how to do it, because obviously here it's like, if you don't perform, then your job is on the line. So I need to manage how I lead them, because eventually it's on me, right, if the team makes a mistake. So I need to kind of control and not be too harsh on them to the point where they're like, you know what, just go work somewhere else. So it's like a balance between, okay, we need to like fix this, but not talk to the team in a way to where it kind of ruins the dynamic because, you know, conversation, and they'll always remember that. Um, so that's kind of how many jobs have you had in your life?
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Real jobs or any job. Like I had a newspaper route when I was 11, I worked in the fields and dug two lip bowls out of the ground and my fingers were bleeding by the time I was like 10 o'clock and I was 11 years old.
00:20:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I was weird, but I worked, I cut grass, I babysat, I did like all of those jobs.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they all shape us. So tell me about your work history.
00:20:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I used to work at a grocery store before law school. And this is my second job.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So how are you? How much time did you spend there?
00:20:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Three months?
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three months? Yeah. So what did you do?
00:20:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like did you play sports? Yeah, I played water polo and swam in high school.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was a different. Swimmers are different I'm trying to I'm trying to profile you.
00:21:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, the biggest thing is like the gym like that's like my my baby so That taught me a lot of lessons.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um Do you compete?
00:21:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't but People would think I would the way I treat it, you know Are you an only child? No, I have an older brother How much older two years?
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're the baby Okay, yeah, just taking so do you feel like you've had much for opposition and life?
00:21:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um Probably not But those are a lot of times those were because of the things that I did like Like I worked my up in school to Fast the bar on the first try for example I could have been an opposition if I failed and I got away another year to take it and things like that So I feel like I do the right things to minimize the amount of like hurdles because I don't like when things get postponed or I Don't know I'm just very that's why you don't like working with other people because most people don't show up like that, right? Um, I mean the team's been really good so far.
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't really know. Let's just talk about the team I just talk about you in general like all the way up through life because you do a lot of stuff by your own So it's definitely not just about your team and and treat law Why does it do you feel like like all you do you feel like you're I don't think you're an extrovert? But are you extroverted introverted or ambivert meaning a blend of both?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
But it just depends what I'm doing like I Work I'm pretty pretty introverted and just come in do my thing and go home but then at the gym I'm looking
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
totally different person like. Yeah.
00:23:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You know, or if like, there's something that I want to fix in my life, then I'm extra vertical because I'm like, I got to get this done or do you have to be around people all the time like to feel and there's okay, so you're an amber bird. I can literally work in a square box and not see a single person for a year and be okay. But I can also come here and like chitchat and have lunch with people like, you know, yeah, it's kind of weird. Like I can really do both.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's that's good. You actually you have a lot of qualities I am very familiar with and they're all amazing. So I don't know that you know that about yourself yet, but you have the potential to do some really amazing things. And the great thing is you should try to stay humble, which I think you actively work on constantly. I think you're probably conscious of that. But there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. But the power of confidence is that you get some things done faster, but also it has energy and it's palpable and it moves people around you. And I think that you have it, but you may be resisting it in the vein of wanting to not be arrogant. Hold on, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm we'll keep our eyes up. I will finish my call and then no, not here and there. You know what, go ahead. She can come. Come on, you're filthy. All right, thank you. you okay now? Okay, so we had a massive flood in our yard. We had an above ground pool that just exploded in the morning and it sounded like worse than any tornado or anything I've ever heard. And so my daughter was out there and she she's 17 and she's going to clean it up and apparently it cleared a little hole in the corner of the fence where her dog could get out and she was terrified that she'd lose her baby and so she was like freaked out and I'm like okay anyway you never know what you're going to get no I've got four daughters and they're all super strong well they're two of them are grown 117, 114 and I have a granddaughter and It's the most wonderful, amazing thing in the world, and it is also the hardest I can imagine in the world. My mom used to always say, I hope you go and just like you. And I was like, well, I got four, so... Perhaps you four is something else. Yeah, and by myself, that's been something else. But like I said, it birthed. It birthed this, and I love what I do because I get to meet amazing people, and they're all leaders, and they're all brilliant, and yeah, yeah, pretty magical. I love what I do. So anyway, back to you, Pat. You prefer Pat. Yeah, not Patrick. I think they're way worse. In the way. Well, okay, so let me look at this time. just kind of think about this. So I don't know. this is... We didn't have a contract. Mark and I did make a contract for how long we'd work. with you, but he's paid for the quarter. So what I would love to do is just, so in the beginning with anyone, and then normally they're seeking me out, not this is somebody else's person that I work with. I do work with teams, but it's not the predominant thing that I do in way that I go about it. But since the quarter is paid for, the schedule that I suggested to Mark was I meet with you, once by yourself, you and Lorenz twice, although we may switch that up and just be do more one-on-one stuff because you will have very different goals. The benefit of meeting together is that it helps uncover some of the commonalities, some of the issues that might be not necessary issues, but what are the processes, what are the levers inside the business that we can do to improve? So like intake, for example, does not have a script that people follow consistently. And because of that, calls are handled differently. And we have figured out some better ways to handle calls, but because there's no script and the process, it kind of depends on whatever mood people are in, kind of mood the calls are in, and that's not the optimal way to run business. So, Mark's competitive too. Mark wants to see Sweet Lock Row, wants to get more cases, everybody wants to make more money, but not burning people out while doing it because life, you get one life, like business is not the thing. Life is the thing. So, figuring out how we can do all the things better and more powerfully in a more leveraged way so that, like I said, I love more from less. So, What I think, I would love to be able to spend time talking to you about just things like Cynthia, we talked about her a little bit. don't know anything about Elsie because she's newer also. And kind of figuring out how you guys work like what are some of the things that you come across. It's really a lot of just, it seems like we're just talking. It's very, it may even seem unstructured. promise you, it's not unstructured. I have been doing this actually for 22 years. So I've learned that there are certain types of conversations and it's primarily PAP. It's primarily probing. So I will ask a lot of questions and sometimes what you'll find out is that the questions made you think something you weren't thinking before. They make you ask your own questions or ask a question you haven't. Ask yourself before and by coming up with that answer, you're just like, Oh, well, I didn't think about that before. So now maybe I could try this. Maybe I could try that. The other benefit because we're doing this kind of as a group inside a sweet law is that as I'm talking to you and looking at things like go to Mark and be like, Hey, you know, Pat was having this experience. I didn't know about this. Can we try this? Can we try that? know, and I see that, but Mark, and I imagine you've figured this out, but Mark loves people. He loves his people. I don't know how he shows up in the office, but the way that he talks about people is, you know, this is like this is kind of his surrogate family. He, he cares like he's not, he cares about to take, like you talked about how you talk to people. He cares about that too. Although I think he's better at it now since talking. Can you me? I'm just going to take a little credit there. Just, you know, just work is work. We're all people trying to be the best people that we can be. And we do better when we can work with people who have some different experience, like you talking to Samantha. That's great that she's supportive and that she answers questions like that. And I think I remember Mark talking about you doing that from the very beginning, just asking lots of questions. Like that's actually also a great sign of a leader there. It might not seem like it because they're going to somebody else, but it is. So goals, that's what we were talking about. Okay, you want to compete with Samantha. Yeah, I like get some of the best case, not necessarily with her specifically, but as far as Sweet Lodge, just be one of the best attorneys. there, put up those big numbers, but also you care about the clients that come in, you want to take care of them. You've got these broad chill shoulders that can take some stress that other people can't take. You've noticed that you've got to be accountable for the work that happens on your team and so that you can't just leave them unchecked to work fully autonomously, but you did try to give them autonomy and but with direction and leadership. All of that is really, really impressive actually. There have to have to be diplomatic and when I say sometimes, so hold on a second. I won't say who and where but in some places, some people just don't care that even in tweet law, there's there's somebody that just those up for paycheck. That affects everybody, because they don't hold the same weight. And that could be in any department. I'm not naming names or anything. But my point is that even just one person like that impacts the energy of the firm, impacts the trajectory of the firm, and it takes a really long time to hire anybody. In the three years I've been working with Mark, I think we've hired maybe three attorneys, and he constantly has ads out looking to hire people. It's just really difficult to find good people in a good match. Not everybody wants to do pre-lit, right? know that. There's a lot of different things that people are looking for. when he's got somebody, he wants to take a care of them, train them, and make the most out of it for sweet love, but also for that person. And me, especially, I'm just mom wherever I go, which is not a professional way to really look at it, but it just is what it is. I was, I was born a mom, I was as a kid taking care of everybody and like, can I feed you? can I do for you? Um, so, so that's it. And I feel like you've got some mad potential actually, and it's really exciting because I've been watching sweet love grow. You know, I've, I've heard, um, some that Cynthia's had some struggles and to know that there might be, but also that she's great, that she's nice, you know, that she's a good person. So if there's somebody that can help her grow and, and be better and be able to be even more valuable, then that's amazing. And that makes you even a greater asset. So I would love to talk to you about just leaders. ship and optimization. different ways that like you've noticed, there are some things that have to be done. Like, so one of the things that I know sometimes calls just don't get followed up with consistently enough and the ball gets dropped there. And you know, if the cases age out too long, sometimes we've missed things. We're not we're not getting those. For the life of me, I can't tell you how many times I forget that word. And I know it. Yeah, no, when we don't when we don't get the backs. It's the benefits, but it's that's not the word. Yes, thank you. I swear there are some words in my brain that just are never want to come. Oh my gosh, and the most random ones and inappropriate ones. Sometimes we'll come and have the right ones. Anyway, policy lemons. Okay. Well, let me turn it back. Yeah, so not following up with things consistently and also like, again, on the intake side, not asking some of the right questions and then we find out that they've already talked to another firm or that they haven't gotten to a doctor and the case is too old, know, like there's all these different things that impact the likelihood of being able to do well and get our money because at the end of day, it's also a business like we're here to help people, but we got to help the team first by making sure we can stay in business and do good. So all of that. But I think that you and I talking together. Now, it's not a, wow, amazing. I can't believe this thing happened. You know, we don't have conversations like that. What happens is it's like working out like if you lift and you follow a regimen for years, sometimes some of them like you can, you can beef up fast. but some of them are like you just look six months later and you're like dang like I'm a little more cut and or I can I'm not tired anymore or these joints don't hurt anymore or like this this you're so young you probably don't know these things but yeah I'm injury free thing going you don't you don't know I'm 40 so I'm about to be 48 so like I know about these things I'm sorry um weightlifting is life for me I don't go a lot but it literally but I go consistently all the time and it's it's life like I'll never quit I'll be a hundred in a gym I don't care I'm like I'm not gonna have all that old dick crub and stuff happening anyway so um but I think that if we focused just on because I think that you're already you may not do you feel like you were interested in leadership like consciously
00:38:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like naturally I'm just like better off as like the grunt like just have me do work and I'll crank it out. So not naturally like seeking out leadership roles, but I feel like here everybody has their own little team and it's cool that way because I get to manage it and it's not like I know a lot of firms. It's like case managers just bounce around like whoever needs to grab want to do this, but for me or here it's like your team is your team like they don't just go work for somebody else for a week and come back. So it's cool because I can obviously I need the help right so I'm going to do what I need to do to make sure that everyone here is like working good and they're happy and so it's cool in that regard to know like when we have like a really big mantra. whatever that, you know, the team did it. at the end of the day, if I'm managing them well, then those numbers mean that, you know, as a leader, you did the right thing. Which is cool because if I go out and go do something by myself, that's great. But if I was able to do it while managing four different people, obviously that takes a lot more work. So the reward is like, wow, he did this and was able to manage all these people. And it's like more responsibility. But it's cooler when, because I know like if I'm just by myself, I know what I can do, but I've never had to really manage people. So that's like the new test for me. Which is cool like when it works out. But you like it? Yeah. Now, if I have like five people then, I don't know. But before we got into the group and we're doing good. So I'm gonna have the smallest team because I don't know. The biggest case load, but like months where we beat the other teams is like cool, you know, because it's like the three of us or when it was just me and Cynthia's like the two of us were able to beat the team of five, you know, yeah, but things like that keep me competitive. Like, you know, the mitigation guy, but he only has like Nick, really love. Yeah, really a lot of cases and he was beating me for the attorney's fees this month, like Mark sent it like a couple days ago and like that pissed me off. I was like, what's Obviously, if you get like a big case, big numbers, but And that's the ones that go to litigation anyway, so Yeah, they're kind of predestined to be higher numbers anyway. Yeah, but still.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll just tell you one thing, though, is Don't compete with people playing a game you don't want to play. You don't want to play a little game. You don't want to play litigation, so like, don't compete with people playing a game. You don't want to play. don't want to do that. It just, it gets in your head. You know what I mean? Gun from the people playing the same game as you. Because you just get tripped up. You take your eye off the ball and that becomes a problem. It creates this internal dissatisfaction that can't be corrected because you're not playing the same game. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:41:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I get that, but you're not playing the same game at all. You know that, right?
00:41:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, if Mark sees it that way, then I'm cool with it. But as far as I know, could ask him, you can ask him.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's the numbers and it was last and that's all he was saying. litigation and everybody else is 100% completely different. And I know because I've been talking to him for three years. And we look at the numbers and we don't even talk about Nick and the litigation team. It pretty much is isolated and honestly That's my bad. We probably should talk about it more, but that's it's not because what what really? Mark see sweet lot as a pre-vit firm period and the story litigation is only there to serve a necessary You know thing. It's a need we have to have an outlet for it. There's money on the table We're gonna take it, but Nick is playing a different game that Mark's not even really interested in playing It's just part of it. You know, you know I'm saying. So I You know you could talk to him ask him out right because Mark I think is pretty open about stuff too And if he tries to evade the answer cuz he does do that sometimes pin him down and be like wait look I like for real tell me Um, you said we're not planning to say gay That way like put it on me. I don't care. I'll be scapegoated all day long. I'm built for it. So Yeah, so the question really was like, do you see yourself as a leader and what I see is that you're still evolving and defining how you see yourself. You really just getting started in the professional world. And, but I would tell you, Pat, 100% you've got innate natural leadership qualities. And you may not be seeking them out. That's, that doesn't mean that that's not what you are. A lot of leaders don't. There's different types and, and it has a lot to do with the extroverted introverted type of thing, right. But some of the best leaders in the world were there because everybody else said, look, we need that guy because first of all his ego is not going to trip us all up and get us in trouble. It's not going to send us to war like Mr. somebody with their orange hair, but you know diplomacy whatsoever. You know what I'm saying, like, so. So, there's different types of leadership, here's where it's just natural for you. see a problem, and you say, like, you see yourself as, I just the grunt, and I just want to knock it out, but that's leadership stuff. I see that there's work that has to be done. I'm going to do it. That's a leader. You know, even if you're only one person, you're a leader of one, I know you've seen enough people in life to know that there are people who won't even steward themselves and manage themselves, right?
00:44:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, percent.
00:44:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. and there's a lot of those, right? Yeah. So, you not only will take care of yourself, but you see that, okay, I've got this thing that I'm a steward over now, this little pod, this little group, and I was trying to give everybody space to let them do their own thing, because I like to do my own thing, but then I realized they're not doing it well, so I'm going to help them. I'm not going to browbeat them, and I'm not going to hurt their feelings. I'm just going to show them how they can be better so that we can be better. Dude, that's leaders all day long. That's like good leadership all day long. So I would like you to just kind of ponder on that. It doesn't mean you need to go seek out leadership opportunities. It doesn't mean that you need to see yourself any kind of different. But knowing that first of all, it helps the people that you do have stewardship over it. Like I said, there's an energy to it where, and I would bet you anything Cynthia already feels this and else you do. It's Elsie, not Elise, right? Yeah, Elsie. They just are like, Pat is doing his job. Pat is watching out for us. Pat is going to help. Because you have that calm energy, but it's also strong and it's also smart. And people, especially women. in work and probably in lots of places are going to feel safe there, but when you're also giving them the skills and empowering them, you're going to find out I'm telling you this because it'll be important. There's going to be a lot of ways that you can compete and you can win because you'll be able to activate people that other people won't be activated because they'll want to work for you. They'll want to do their best for you because they don't feel afraid and they know that they're supported.
00:46:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I could tell you I might be wrong, but I'm almost never wrong about this stuff and I only say almost just to be humble, but I'm never wrong about this stuff. So watch, but people will want to work with you throughout your life. know you don't know where you're going to be, how long you're going to be there, I really want you to hear this and take this with you because you'll see it showing up in your life that you can get a lot out of people because they feel safe with you and because they know you'll do the work. That's another thing like a lot of people are told what to do by people who have no food because they're not doing it. They've had terrible leaders, terrible bosses. When they get somebody who's in the trenches with them doing the work, who knows what they have to do and appreciate it, they'll show up at a whole new level. So talking about leadership, there are two books. you like reading and all or listening to audiobooks?
00:47:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't want to have you do things. I'm never really trying to read at least when I can.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you like podcasts?
00:47:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's more tolerable, yeah. I think I've read maybe one full book in my life. Like as a kid, would be reading and I would just like read the same line over and over my mind would just be somewhere else.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you didn't lost.
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I would like to go reading.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ADD?
00:48:17 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't sitting there flipping through pages.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you don't listen to them either though. So it, um, do you, like, do you watch a lot of movies? Or you just like hit the gym a lot like, uh, I watch movies.
00:48:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was the same movie like over at all. I for sure don't have ADD. I just don't like, I just don't like to read.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, now this is me asking because like I said, I'm trying to profile and understand because if I try to get you to do stuff that you don't like and don't want to do, then that's just not going to be good. So what I can do is just kind of distill some of those things that I think would be useful for you. Some people like to and they get a lot out of it. So my approach with you would be, let me go refresh my memory on some of the books and talk to you about a couple of things. But the principles of, so there were two books I would have recommended. One is called multipliers and one is called essentialism. And the thing about multipliers is just kind of basically something I think that you do innately and that is look for people's strengths and abilities and just help them tap into it, support what they have to do, and then give them the freedom to do it and what you described was doing that with Cynthia. So it would basically be the purpose of reading it would be to see maybe the other applications and also so that you had a greater awareness of the power of what you're doing, but it's not, it's not necessary to read it. And then essentialism is just, there's a lot that gets done, and this would be towards the processes and figuring out, you know, where is there anything that's happening that's being done that doesn't really need to be done, are things being prioritized so that the most important thing is getting done day-to-day to push a case to where it needs to go, right? Every day, there's lots of phone calls that have to be made, right? There's lots of contacts, there's lots of information that has to be gathered, whatnot. So making sure that the most important things get done first, that drive the needle forward, sometimes that's not what people do, sometimes they just take the low-hanging fruit, like this is the call that's in front of me right now, this is the case that's in front of me right now. instead of maybe triaging according to their value, their likelihood of getting close, how good at communicating the client is and you know there's all kinds of different ways to kind of evaluate what's the thing that should be done first at the beginning of the day and throughout the day and so on. So but if we have some conversations about that at minimum for the next three months because that's what's being taken care of and if we talk about you know what your goals are what I'll do is go and solidify to and make sure that I've got some numbers for you to take a look at and compare it to what you're looking at already and see if I've got any more information than you see how I can help you be like okay this is your trajectory this is what you're doing um across the board in terms of so there's attorney fees which is our really the staple number that we're looking at. But there's also how many cases, there's also how many cases get closed, like the pace that they're getting closed. And obviously, you guys can't control when it's resolved and you get paid out, but we can't how long it takes to get closed. So just looking at those numbers and giving you kind of one-on-one insight into that and a little bit of a different perspective, then let's say Mark would have, I think that it could be something that would be valuable for you.
00:52:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Are you interested in that at all? Yeah, because I mean, the numbers and stuff is like just puts it right there and you can see everything. So I like the numbers because it's just easier and I understand like what's lagging or what's doing good. Yeah. And it's like a motivator, like when I see the numbers, like, I like the numbers.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to, the only reason I'm not going to do it right now is because I have to ask Mark, you know, I'm able to share and look at, um, just got a new, uh, report also, which is the best one that we've had so far. So let me look at it. When did you start again?
00:53:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
November 1st, 2022.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy cow, it's been not long already. Geez.
00:53:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Well, the first year was just like a blur.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we'll, I don't want to do last year. do equals this year. That was free by team. Yeah. For the year, I still don't know what I'm allowed to say. So I absolutely. Okay, that cannot be right. That one has to be wrong. That's the other thing. As our report is, it's in progress. And so we got to validate it, make sure that it's pulling the correct data. Because like it's saying, Nick's team for the year is averaging 1.8,000. And we know that that's not right. For an average of chummy fee. So I will, it's definitely wrong. But you're up there for sure. are in the game. And for being so new, I think that's something. Let me look at cases closed. For the year. That's interesting. Yeah, I just want to make sure these thumbs right. So I'm going to see what I'm allowed. to share and I'll check with Mark because I think that what drives you I think seeing these numbers would be huge for you and I think watching the numbers change would be huge for you and then some of the other things I'd like to do is talk about L.C. and talk about Cynthia you know how they're doing any patterns you might be noticing good or bad like I definitely want to know about good and in terms of the bad like we're not here looking for how to fire people how to get rid of anybody anything like that we're 100 percent here for how do we make everybody better and feel safer enjoy what they're doing more sort of the clients better and just just improve everything so I think it's really important to because sometimes people come in whatever and their agenda is how do we weed things out that's not what we're here for at all. Yeah, so that's what I'd like to do is just have some conversations. And the other thing though, Patrick, is like I was saying is that what happens is I'll ask questions and they kind of reveal other questions and lead to the next questions. So what I would be interested to know is if you, I would love for you to just take a little time and think about the conversation we've had today and see if any thoughts just kind of pop up that maybe hadn't before or they had that maybe you hadn't done anything with them. And if you're willing to, like, I would imagine you're not really a journaler.
00:56:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you want me to like think of a set of questions?
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, just kind of like, if you have a thought that you notice that was a result of this conversation, um, read it down and it doesn't have to be super in debt. That can be a bullet point, but it has to be written enough so that when we talk again, you'll remember and be like, wait, what was that about? Because I'm terrible. I'll write something down and be like, I can't even remember what I was thinking when I wrote down. So I just needed to be thorough enough that you could come back and go, yeah, I was thinking about this. Or like, if you're working and you're watching things going, you know what, I noticed this and I hadn't really noticed this before, because that's kind of all part of the evolution. But what that will also help me to do is know how your brain works, how what you're what you're kind of patterned are, because again, this is to be customized around you, like imagine, I don't know if you're like a Marvel dude at all. Which one? Marvel? Nope.
00:57:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
There's like a million characters.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Well, if I say Marvel, most people might say, are you a Marvel person? They're like, yeah, yeah, but like, just anyway, imagine you're Tony Stark, and we're building an Ironman suit, but it's just for you. Like his suit was built. for his strengths and for his weaknesses and for his mission, like what he was trying to accomplish. He kept trying. He kept iterating his suits, right? He had new versions because he's like, well, this one didn't do this. So I needed to do that. So my process is basically trying to build your perfect Iron Man suit. Like you're already great. Tony Stark was already brilliant and amazing, right? He was pretty powerful just as it was. But with the suit, you know, that was like multiplied many times over. So the goal here is to be like, what's amazing about Pat? How do we amplify that? And so it comes through probing, learning experiences. So everything that you think about and everything that you just kind of notice and observe, bring that back to the drawing board with me and go, okay, I can work with that. Let's do this. Let's try this. type of thing. How's that sound?
00:58:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I'm really open. I won't shy away from any questions. You have so pretty, like if you're asking something, I'll just tell you what it is.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, my goal is to help you hit your goals. Yeah, it does, it does, it does. But the energy with it, like I want you to come with your competitive side. want you to come thinking, all right, we are gonna figure out how I smoke these balls. I'm like, we're gonna figure out how I beat this list is like we get, we get all the cases and we get the best attorney fees and everything else. Like, that's the goal. But while also being a good guy that doesn't hurt people, that's not like plowing through people just to get to where he's gonna go, that you're doing that, that your team's winning, that they're getting higher bonuses, know what I mean? That incentive program is good, you know, and there's a way to help everybody. Like you could be the guy that helps everybody get paid more. And I think that'd be awesome. So. So I want you to think about that like, okay, I've got kind of this silent partner over here is going to help me win even more, but it's not just you winning. It's your whole team winning and it's all a sweet while winning. So, you know, think about it like that. then read anything down that you have. And we'll figure out, we got to figure out a time next week. You already told me what can work for you. I'll see. I have not heard back from Miranda. So let me check with Mark. See if we can get something on the books for next week for two of us. And then, you know, it's really fluid in the beginning. It's kind of awkward in the beginning, but it gets some legs on it and we'll get we'll get a flow. All right.
01:00:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So next week is not scheduled yet.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I, it's supposed to be you, me and Lorenz. I haven't heard from him yet. So. Will yeah, I'll follow up with you on that.
01:01:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's okay. Yeah, I mean, any time works for me like Monday mornings. It's just like Class of a waiting all weekend to call and select a little bit push, but Afternoons are probably best Okay, we can do that.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told me like any day after like at three or later one or or three any day at three I think you said Yeah, I prefer not to be that late I like to be done with calls by like two o'clock, but Monday's different because I started 10 and then I've got back-to-back calls until 130 so like two or three on a Monday would be perfect three o'clock on a Monday is perfect Because I keep a lot of the other days up and just for the actual work and not the beatings But I do need to get with Lorenz, but for you and I we can make it Mondays at three When so the one one once a month that it's just you and me so far we can do that so like a month from now same time we can get that on the calendar and then if you have any questions if you have any thoughts and be like you just want to shoot it out before you're thinking about it I would love it in real time rather than waiting until we talk again because then my brain gets to start working on it because I keep a small roster and I'm thinking about everybody all the time it's just the way that I work like this is my little team and I'm thinking about like wonder how Pat's doing like checking his numbers like how's things going and so if any thoughts come up I would just love it if you just shoot an email and be like hey I was thinking this okay I can do any questions um no I'm actually excited for this people about my thoughts and stuff so this is
01:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
different, you know, but I'm open to it, you know, Mark mentioned to me that obviously there's a value there, so I'm always open to trying because I trust him and um what he thinks is worth it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good to know. I'm really glad you shared that with me because like you're little stoic over there and just trying to read you and not give enough a lot with that poker face.
01:03:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This isn't me though, like so maybe I'll, I don't know if I'll open up, we'll see. It's kind of natural, it just happens. Yeah, it does. But good thing is I listen to everything you say, so don't think like this guy's bored out of his mind, it's just like, I'd rather just like when it's time to listen, I'll listen when it's time to talk, I'll talk to the thing. So don't be put off by it, a lot of people are like, well it's better than showing the emotions, like I listen to everything he's saying, you know, so.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will learn that too in, in the way that you should. and the conversation. thank you. That was really helpful to me. So now I'm really, I was already looking forward to it. I think you're going to do amazing, but I want to serve you well. Like I, you know, that's what makes me happy. So I'm looking forward to it. I've got somebody knocking at my door. I know my daughter needs me. So I'm going to go and I will follow up with the pool. I know. Thank you, Pat.
01:04:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I hope you have an amazing day. You
