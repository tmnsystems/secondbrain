Tina Marie: No, it's okay. It's probably just gonna annoy me, no matter what I do. Until.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Tina Marie: Now period. It's just irritated. I think I got it out. An eyelash.

Esther: You're good at stabbing yourself in the eye. Oh, no.

Tina Marie: I'm good at hurting myself. Um! How was your mother's day.

Esther: Um like Emmy and Mari's cousin had her 6th birthday. And it started at 9 Am. Cause they had a 1 of those um.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Esther: Their parents booked it at one of those. Um. Like industrial playhouses where there's just.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Esther: Trampolines for the kids to jump on foam blocks and stuff. Um.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Tina Marie: That is crazy, because Saturday was my nephew's birthday. He was 13, and they went to a trampoline park. We went to a trampoline park. So that's.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Esther: Yeah, that's so. I mean, I did trampoline because I was taking care of Mari. But Michael and Emmy definitely went down there.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Esther: And yeah, they also had a zip line. So they were like.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Esther: Shuffling kids onto the Zip line. Um.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Tina Marie: That's even better than ours.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Esther: Yeah, um, yeah. They got some really cool stuff out here. Um, you know. And then, yeah. And then, you know, we came back.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Esther: Took a quick nap, and then, about 3 30, we were off again to Michael's friend's house was like an hour from us. And there was a surprise birthday at his house.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Esther: Um. You know he's real nice guy, another Ortho um, you know his friend from med school, who's Ortho? Um and stuff. So we went to that um. Didn't get the kids home and in bed until 9, 30.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Tina Marie: That was late night.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Esther: Yeah, so, and then we had to be up the next day. Um for mother's day, because we're hosting.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Esther: Brunch at our house.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Tina Marie: No fun, now.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Esther: Um. And then after that. Yeah. And then you know his parents.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Esther: Um, you know, and Christy they they stayed um, you know. They went home to rest for a little bit. In the afternoon they came back for dinner, so. Yeah.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Tina Marie: That's a busy weekend. We. So we went up to Portland, which is about 5 h away from here, and me and my daughter.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Tina Marie: And so Friday night, yeah, yeah.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Esther: Did you guys drive. Oh, okay.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um. Well, it's. Yeah, 5 HI mean, it's we. Just there are certain drives. We just do a lot. Also.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tina Marie: We don't have a local airport, so the further, like the closest I could go to fly is an hour and a half, anyway. And by the time you go through security and everything else, it's just as fast to get 5 h anywhere.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Esther: It's the same. Okay.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so um. But it was my. To know today is my dad's 75th birthday. So Friday we had dinner with him and his wife.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: And um! It's my sister's dad. He's my adopted dad, but. My dad for like.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. You know I've got the stories, anyway.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Esther: Yeah, no, I was actually just trying to connect that in my mind, because what? Based on what you told me, I said.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tina Marie: My mom's 3rd husband.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Esther: Oh, she's also is Tina still in contact with that father? I was wondering what was going on. Well, I was wondering how that went, but.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Tina Marie: New Nope. Nope, not since I was 18.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh, and through DNA I found that I have a half brother. So he had another child that nobody knew about. So yeah.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Esther: Well.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Tina Marie: He knew about him because they left him on a hospital doorstep. But anyway, so then, so my sister and my nephews, and then my dad and his new wife.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Tina Marie: His sugar, mama anyway. Whole nother story. There. And then Saturday. My nephew had a.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Esther: Good for him. He found a sugar mama of 75.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well, you know what. She's a psychologist, a psychiatrist psychologist. I think she's a psychologist. And so he's actually grown a lot because he has taught him a lot of things.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Esther: Oh! Oh, good. Okay.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Tina Marie: So he he probably went in there. Kind of manipulative, and probably still enjoying that. But he's grown, and and it's good. So you know, things work out. But.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tina Marie: A Saturday, my next.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Esther: People are so complicated and interesting.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tina Marie: Girl. Yes.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Esther: Yeah, there's if there's anything I've learned is that.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Esther: You know I was taught. I was raised. To make general sweeping like sleeping generalizations about people.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Esther: And you know everything that I. Have come across truly, just.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Esther: Continues to. You know, be in opposition of that, to prove the opposite, that the opposite is true.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Esther: Anyway.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Tina Marie: That reminds me of something that happened. So my daughter and I um. This always happens, and and my girls and I do it. But.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, this lady came up, and we're talking about. She said something, she said we felt good, and I was like, Oh, I was just looking at how cute your toes and your shoes were, and Isabel said something about her hair and whatever I'm like, oh, yeah, and this is cute, and we just like complimented her up and down, and she left kind of blushing. She was like.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Tina Marie: But I was like, you know what you know. When I grew up it was, what could we pick on about a person? What was wrong with this person. What was wrong with that person? And I love that we are a family that just looks for great things in people, and compliments it constantly, and.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Tina Marie: Like if we're out. We're complimenting now. Sometimes I'm and Isabel said something. Well, you're not always like that. Sometimes you say something kind of negative.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Tina Marie: And I'm like, Yeah, that is true. But it's the exception, not the rule where it used to be. The rule. It used to be like. That's because that's how I was raised. We just always.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Tina Marie: Complained about people, and put them down and insulted, and whatever.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Esther: It. Can. I can relate? Yes.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And now I just love to look for the good in people. But it was a very intentional shift. And it was reading a Scripture that we would be judged according to the judgment with which we judge others. And I was like, well, I need mercy. I need kindness. I need patience and forgiveness, because.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Tina Marie: I am good in my heart. But my behavior oftentimes does not.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Tina Marie: Align with how I feel. You know, cause that medulla elongata, and you just like that lizard brain in there going.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Tina Marie: Reacting out of pain. You know, and um so.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Tina Marie: It was so when I had that thought, I'm like, well, how how do I. Judge less, and it was that I needed to see people differently. Well, how do I see people differently?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: You see what you look for, so look for the good. Um see people. As for me, it was. I need to see everybody as a child of God.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Tina Marie: But what happened was I saw everyone as a child period. As a child of God, but also as a child period. So imagine.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Tina Marie: All the powerful people you ever see, and you see them as a child like just wanting to be hugged, wanting to be on the playground. And have a friend, and go play, jump, rope, or play football, or something like that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Tina Marie: And really, at the end of the day, everybody just wants to be truly loved for who they are.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Tina Marie: Not used, not abused. They want to be safe. They want to be happy.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tina Marie: Um, and that was my premise. And so, as I started to see that I could see people's insecurities show up, I could see, and I watched. I think, kind of subconsciously.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Tina Marie: For those things, and like. Okay, there's a little chink in your armor right there, like you.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Tina Marie: You are confident, but you have doubts. Still you have insecurity still. And when I understood that it leveled the playing field, I'm like, okay. So.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Tina Marie: I don't need to put any of you on a pedestal. I don't need to put myself on a pedestal. I'm not better than anybody else. I'm not worse than anybody else. We all.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Tina Marie: Deserve respect and to be happy. Now some people. Also.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Tina Marie: Violate like we talked about innocence.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Tina Marie: That's different when you use what you are. To take away from others.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Tina Marie: But, barring that exception. To me. Everybody deserves to be happy, deserves respect.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Tina Marie: Deserves kindness, deserves. Um acknowledgement. You know those kinds of things, and so.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, that became a process. And now I just find it so much easier like. Last um Thanksgiving.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Tina Marie: My daughter and I were out driving around, and there was this lady and. She had all her bags and everything, and it was it was. It was Thanksgiving Day.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Tina Marie: And she was dark leathery, just you know. She'd been at it for a while. Not everybody. You can tell, is necessarily homeless. For a long time she definitely had a long, hard life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Tina Marie: And so I had $20. I don't normally keep cash on me other than to give to the homeless. And um.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Tina Marie: So I got out, and I gave it to her, and I just had this overwhelming sense of love for her. And I asked her if I could hug her, asked her she had the most beautiful blue eyes, like.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tina Marie: Light, piercing eyes. You know they were not dim. They were not empty. They were deep and light.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, she let me hug her, and I gave her a hug, and I just. But I it's so different from how I grew up.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Tina Marie: In a way, my mom had that in her, because I can also remember. Moving from Portland to Missouri.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Tina Marie: So we left all of our belongings. The only thing that we had was whatever could fit in the car. I lost my favorite stuffed animal.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Tina Marie: I just feel like crying now, anyway.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Esther: Okay.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tina Marie: We were just talking about this, and my daughter like. There are several times I had to lose everything.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Tina Marie: But on the way there. It was like midnight, and there was a crash.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Tina Marie: On the road, and. It's just me and my mom. We're women.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Tina Marie: And she pulls over to go take care of the person, and went and gave them a blanket. They had. Bleeding all over and.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Tina Marie: My mom ended up becoming a nurse a few years later, and she's a nurse, and my sister's a nurse. My mom and my daughter is thinking about becoming a nurse. So.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Tina Marie: You know it. It. The same thought that I had about myself was that.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Tina Marie: I'm a good person, but I don't always make good choices. How do I make better choices. I can see my mom is a good person who a lot of times just.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: Reacts out of that lower level brain. You know, but but has goodness in her, and wants to be good, and so that.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Tina Marie: Allowed me to. I had to keep space lots of space, sometimes 8 or 9 months, not talking at all. But always wanting to come back and just kind of be like.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Tina Marie: Are we trying to think a little bit better? Are we. Are you having a shift? Are you.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tina Marie: Learning something new? Are you at least open to some accountability and. What could be better, and having better experiences and.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. So it was interesting, this weekend, because. My mom didn't do. She did one offensive thing. So she looks at my chair. She goes. Oh.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Tina Marie: She goes. I couldn't tell from the picture that your hair is so short in the back, because it's little a-line like.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Esther: Mhm the Jennifer, Aniston.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Tina Marie: And she goes. It's shorter than I. Oh, she but she she goes! She goes!

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Esther: 9, Eric.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Tina Marie: It's shorter than I thought she goes. Do you like it? And I said, Yeah, she goes. Oh, are you going to grow it up?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Tina Marie: And I said, I don't know. The funny thing is, I didn't really love the haircut, but I have been complimented on it constantly, like everywhere I go. Oh, my gosh!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Esther: Looks, good.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Tina Marie: Cute. It's so sassy, it's so fun. It's like blah blah blah. And my mom is the only one like.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Tina Marie: Do you like it sort of than I thought, and I was like. Yeah, there you are.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Tina Marie: There you are! But.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Esther: Okay.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Tina Marie: She's and I. The thing that I've taught my daughter is. When you deal with people like that that are just.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tina Marie: Incessantly negative. They are their own worst enemies. You don't need to worry about punishing them or getting them back, or.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Tina Marie: Teaching them lessons because they are their own punishment. They can't have real love. They can't have real joy because they constantly sabotage it. They are their own punishment.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Esther: You know, that's really apt that you. Put it like that, because.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Esther: I think you know it just. It describes my parents almost perfectly. It's like I don't need.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Esther: Look. I don't need to be vindictive or anything like that. I've never been vindictive towards them. I'm just not that kind of person.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Tina Marie: Are you better than me?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Esther: You know. I you know I'm I'm petty sometimes in my own way, a little bit. Like, you know. Um, I.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Esther: For example. Um, my sister and her husband are going through a really tough time right now, because they work for. My research institutes that um.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Esther: That basically advise on government policy. And you know, with all the cuts and stuff like my sister's coming, 20% of her.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Esther: Of the company got laid off. They just, you know, and they're just going through a really tough time. Their jobs are. You know he has a Phd. She's got a master's. They don't have job security right now, and it's crazy.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Esther: Um, you know, and my parents, you know, like I don't know my dad. He probably didn't. He wouldn't admit it, but I know that my mom and her family all voted for Trump.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Esther: You know. You know, like Mom Tina, this is the woman who said to me 4 years ago that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Esther: You know, in no words or less, that Biden didn't really win the election. I was like, Okay, well, you know everything.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Tina Marie: That was my one, too. That was.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Esther: Reality is just out the window for you. I don't know what to say, you know.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Tina Marie: It's interesting how the bitter people like were attracted to him. Cause that was my mom, too.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Esther: It's very strange. Um! Anyway. Uh yeah, so. But I I am petty in in certain ways. So my parents they would sometimes message me, or when I went.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Esther: Um home to that to their house to help them with something a few weeks ago. They're like, Oh, have you talked to your sister and and Jake. How are they doing? I'm like. No, I haven't talked to them. They're going through a really hard time right now. And oh, do you know why, that is.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Esther: I would just. I, and I told my sister. You know I'm not usually petty like this, but that was probably I was. I wouldn't even be petty like that with how they've treated me. You know.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Esther: But for my sister and.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Yes, that's when I come out.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Esther: You know, I was just like.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Esther: You know, like twist the knife a little bit. I want them to feel guilty about it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Tina Marie: When you hurt my people. I I'm a whole different kind of beast.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Esther: Yeah, um. Anyway, it's very amazing. It's just again. You know people folks like that their own, their their own worst enemy, and.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Esther: I I think a really great um, a really. Apt example of that was essentially um. About a week ago. Yeah, my, my mom came over on.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Esther: Monday. Um, because, you know, some of the family was in town. And my cousin, Um, who was in town, came over, brought his daughter, his wife, and his daughter and stuff. You know his sister. We're all having a good time.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Esther: Um! My! Nanny was still here working that day. Our Nanny was still here working that day because. Um Michael's, you know. Michael's nephew still need a child care.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Esther: So, anyway. Long story short, the Nanny, my Nanny, told me. The next day she's and she was kind of in tears a little bit. Um.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Esther: It just sounded like my mom. Made some rude gestures, and not like profane gestures, but.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Esther: You know, like Nanny. Yeah, my Nanny, you know she.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Tina Marie: Insulting.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Esther: She can read people. She's not idiot right. You know, you know my mom saw my Nanny coming down the stairs. She would shoot my cousins away. Let's go to the other room.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Esther: You know, or stuff like that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Tina Marie: Like they're beneath, like she's beneath them, or something.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Esther: I know. And then my Nanny said, you know at 1 point you know um.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Tina Marie: Or what.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Esther: She was holding Mari and. I don't know um. But then my mom came up to her and said, Oh, this is my baby.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Esther: And took her away. As I you know I don't get to see her, you know. Like my mom's English isn't great. My nanny English is not my Nanny's 1st language, too. I'm sure there's stuff that's blocked.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Tina Marie: Is she Hispanic.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Esther: Station. Yeah, she's she's Guatemalan.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Tina Marie: Is your mom racist, or you? I think you've said something kind of like that.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Esther: But oh, my! Well, yes, of course, my mom's racist racist and bigoted in many different ways. You know. So I mean.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Esther: But I think for my mom, you know she kinda just sees the situation like we brought in this Nanny to replace her. Essentially so. I can feel her insecurity like ah, throughout this. But you know, I guess she was.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Esther: Her, you know, body language, and the way that she was speaking was rude in some ways to my Nanny and. My Nanny, she's just. She's just a very sweet woman. Um.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Esther: But she also is very like. Usually very emotional sometimes when she describes things. I don't know if it's the language barrier that.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Tina Marie: She's Latina. That's why.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Esther: Yeah. You know. So, anyway, so, but.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Tina Marie: Passionate people.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Esther: You know I didn't see it happen, so I can only take things at face value with a grain of salt, or whatever. You know, but you know the way that she was describing it to me is like, you don't know my mom well enough.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Esther: To make this up. Because what she was describing to me I was like.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Tina Marie: You're like you just described her to a T.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Esther: Yeah, that's actually, I was like, that's actually very on Brand. Um. The reason I believe you is because I don't think you have any reason to make this up, and 2 like you really don't know her well enough to make something up so.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Esther: Fairly accurate, you know. So. And you know it tracks with what I know about my mom, anyway. So again, it's a really stark contrast with how Michael's mom behaves around the nanny.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Esther: Michael's mom is very oh, thank you for everything you do. And you know Michael and Esther are so lucky to have you and.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Esther: You know so.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Tina Marie: Thank you for helping my family.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Esther: Thank you for helping my family. Yeah. And. You know, my mom and dad are just those kind of people who.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Esther: Yeah, they are their own worst enemy. They. You know, I'm like, Okay, well, if you choose to be miserable, I mean, that's that's your choice. I don't know what to say.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Tina Marie: It makes me think of a saying that really stuck with me several years ago, and that is, it is not. Happy people that are thankful. It is thankful people that are happy.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Esther: Oh, you told me that that last week, or one of our sessions? Yeah.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And it's, you know, it's really interesting, because you just demonstrated that right? Your mom is not thankful for the gift that she is for you, for the peace of mind, and for the help that she is to the family.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Tina Marie: But Fuji's mom is, thank you for this right? And. And you can see the difference in happiness. But I bet if you looked at.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Tina Marie: Gratitude across the parallels, right in in the parents. Um that you would see that. That's that's probably.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Tina Marie: An attribute that. Yeah, I like looking for.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Tina Marie: Confirmation, you know, for test proofs, scientific method, right of of a concept and a principle. Um for what I would call.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Tina Marie: Maybe even eternal truths or universal truths.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Tina Marie: Right that there aren't exceptions for. And that to me is one of them. It is that people that are thankful.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Tina Marie: Are happy. Um, even if they're not happy all the time, they have a propensity towards happiness.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Esther: I mean, no one can be happy all the time. Every second. Right? Yeah.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Tina Marie: Right. But but there's a correlation between gratitude and happiness. That is undeniable and.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Tina Marie: Constant.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Esther: Mhm, I agree. And I think there's a lot of.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Esther: You know different religions around the world, or spiritualities that. Um, that really, you know, revolve around the same or similar idea.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Esther: Yeah, and you know, and it's. And yeah, I agree, the more I see it, and the more I believe it, the more I.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Esther: Give myself to space to be grateful. Um! The more you know, the more I I feel it, too. Even my sister told me when she came this time. She's like Esther.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Esther: Like. The the atmosphere in this house is so. Different. She said.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Esther: From the times I've come before when you know Mom was here. You guys, are you.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Esther: You guys just she's like, you know, this arrangement with Dolora seems to be working out really. Well. And you know I just, she said. I feel like a lightness and a happiness, you know, and just like a.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Esther: You know, she says, you guys just feel so relaxed, and there's just not so much. Tension and.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Tina Marie: Ah, so beautiful! Esther!

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Esther: And it's so wonderful to hear her say that, because. You know, like I said, she's 1 of. She's really the only other person.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Esther: Like in my life, who knows exactly how my parents are, and you know the kind of. You know, kind of just like toxic environment. We grew up in and.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Esther: You know the the people that she and I have become, despite that. Um. So you know, it's really.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Esther: Great to hear that from her. And you know I told her I was telling her. You know what like.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Esther: You know. I told her that. Oh, I was telling her about some of these like new friends that I was making, you know just. And other moms I was meeting and stuff and um, you know, because I mean school and everything.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Esther: I told her I was just like, Oh, my God, I'm just so. I'm just so thankful. And and we were talking about how judgy our family was all the time, and I was just like, you know, I just.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Esther: I told her. Just I feel like. A lightness that I can appreciate and choose, like the people that I want in my life, that I have.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Esther: I know how to. Make friends, and like, make genuine friends in a genuine manner, and keep them in a genuine manner, as well versus.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Esther: How I was taught to make friends before. You know, which was uh, you know, which is terrible role, just terrible role model.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Tina Marie: I have to ask you about this, because. I felt that you had said, you don't make friends easily, so this feels like a little bit of a shift.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Tina Marie: Have you been making more friends recently. Or being more social.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Esther: Yes, no, I would say that I didn't make friends easily, because. I would say that more. Um!

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Esther: I was referring, I think, more when I was. Like a kid, or in my, up to my early.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Esther: Twenties, maybe.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Esther: And that shift started happening. After I left my Parents house.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay, got it?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Esther: You know. Um, I think I discovered that. You know I once I was away from that environment, and I had space to learn about myself and space to. Discover who I was.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Esther: You know, it just started naturally coming out more, you know, like my true personality was coming out more. And I felt like, you know, in the recent years, like Oh.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Esther: People actually, you know, like me, for who I am. I'm you know. I'm this way or that way, you know. I don't have to pretend to be nice to people. I just like being nice to people. I don't have to pretend to be, you know.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Esther: Anyway, it just, you know. But and it seems like these people are making friends with me and staying friends with me. You know. So yeah.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Tina Marie: I want to point out something, though, when your sister said that. So when was the last time she visited you.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Esther: So she visited me. Um. She visited me at the end of.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Esther: January. Yeah. So the last 2 times she visited me were the end of January, and.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Tina Marie: So, if you.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Esther: Oh, I think around. Oh, yeah. And then last year, sometime around the summertime.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Tina Marie: So the reason I'm asking is because.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Esther: Oh, yeah.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Tina Marie: So you already had Mari.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Tina Marie: And Emmy Emmy would turn 3 last summer. She's gonna be 4 this summer.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Esther: Yeah. So my sister came when Mari was 3 weeks old. The low, recent, most recent bid is 3 weeks old.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Esther: And then she came again. And that time my mom was still living with us, and then she came again.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Tina Marie: What I want to tell you. Why I'm getting at this.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Esther: Okay.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Tina Marie: Because. She wasn't the only one that felt the lightness shift.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Tina Marie: Your girls were in that energy, and in that space.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Tina Marie: And you. So it wasn't just taking them out of your parents house.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Tina Marie: But you took them out of your house. You took that energy. That might have existed perpetually.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Tina Marie: Because of how you felt, or your mom staying with you, or anything right. But that was a gift that you gave to your children.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Tina Marie: And it changed your whole home. It changed. Everything about their life.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Tina Marie: There's also my dog is losing his mind wanting to get back in. But.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Esther: You can let him back in if you want. That's okay.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Tina Marie: I I will in a second he can win. I'm talking. But um.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Tina Marie: And I'm I'm barely scratching the surface of this and wanting to understand it more. But. Our DNA expressions.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Tina Marie: Change over time, based off of. External factors, like the DNA we're born with is not the DNA we die with.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Tina Marie: And it can change through frequency, through energy, through light. Um through things in our bodies.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Tina Marie: So frequency is energy. So like if we get heavy metal poisoning right. But that will change the frequency. All all the things inside of our bodies. There's everything's energy, everything's.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Tina Marie: Frequency.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Tina Marie: When we. Dissonance, you know.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Tina Marie: That. Clashing.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: Frequencies, in music. Um minor chords or diminished minors.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Tina Marie: Um diminished chords. They feel a particular way. If you're familiar with. Are you familiar with binaural beats?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Esther: With what.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Tina Marie: Binaural beats.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Esther: No! What's that?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Tina Marie: So if you play one frequency, one tone in the left ear and one on the right ear, bi narrow right, 2 ears.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Esther: Uh-huh, yeah.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Tina Marie: A 3rd tone is created in the middle. So you're actually hearing 3 tones and the combinations of those frequencies.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Tina Marie: Can do powerful things. You can shift yourself just by any frequency, but especially across the binaural beats. Um! That.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: Can shift you through Theta States. Beta Alpha.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Tina Marie: Um, where obviously different cognitive functions happen in these different states. There's also the.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Tina Marie: Phenomenon, that if you have 2 tuning forks.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Tina Marie: On opposite ends of a room, and you. Ring, one.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Tina Marie: The other one very quickly will begin to vibrate at the same frequency as the one that you struck.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Esther: That makes sense.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Tina Marie: Because the sound waves but but are are traveling. But it's not just that. It's that everything wants to be in harmony.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Tina Marie: And. Dissonance is.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Tina Marie: Toxic to us. So we can think about it on a musical level, right? What it feels like. We know that that's dark. That's foreboding music.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Tina Marie: Something bad is going to happen. But when it happened.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Tina Marie: On a frequency level that cannot be perceived. Right? We know that there's a whole spectrum of light and sound.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Tina Marie: That is imperceptible. But that doesn't like to our conscious mind, but it doesn't mean that it's imperceptible to our physical being. I told you if I could have another degree. Be a Phd. In physics quantum physics, but um, so.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Tina Marie: These conversations that energy that you feel from your mom. When my mom would come to my home, my ex-husband would say that the attention was palpable. As soon as she walked in the door.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: My current fiance, he just if I'm upset if I don't feel good. It's very difficult for him to be around me, because I have very strong energy.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Tina Marie: It's difficult for anybody to be around me when I don't feel good. Whether I'm upset or just hurting, because my energy literally will fill up a space.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Tina Marie: They love it when I'm in a good mood, because it's a battery pack, they are energized after being around me. For hours. Um could be in a really bad mood, having a bad day, even physically sick. Spend a little time with me if I'm in a good mood.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tina Marie: They will feel better for hours.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Tina Marie: So not everybody has such strong energy. But when you have people who do have strong energy, you have strong energy. I'm sure your mom has strong energy. Otherwise it wouldn't have impacted you the way that it would have.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Tina Marie: Um that creates a a presence. Of energy, frequencies, vibrations.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Tina Marie: That could be felt by the children, but even could have affected. DNA expressions.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Tina Marie: That could go with them for the rest of their lives. And when I know it took a long time to get there and go full circle.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Tina Marie: But you affected them not just at an emotional level. You affected them at a physical level and not just at an emotional level. For generations.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Tina Marie: But at a physical, genetic expression, level.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Tina Marie: For generations by making those kinds of changes. That's how big it is.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Esther: Yeah. And Noah, I'm really glad you say that, because. You know, the more I see what's.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Esther: Oh, sorry! Let me just open the trunk for.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Tina Marie: It's okay. I'm gonna get the doggy, too, before he goes nuts.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Esther: There we go!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Tina Marie: Oh, come on, Hanson! Hold on!

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Tina Marie: Hey! Stop it! Leave for a while, and you. Stop, can you.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Tina Marie: Come on! Come on! Good boy, come on.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: Make up your mind. Do you want to open up. There you go!

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Tina Marie: Who's a good boy. Would you called him a cat yesterday.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Tina Marie: He says, oh, what a cute cat! I'm like this, my Yorkie poison.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Esther: He's he's uh. So this is Mari. She got a new toy.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Tina Marie: Oh, again! Cute! Love, her.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Esther: Oh, she is so! She is so cute! It's just. Incredible how she is like she just.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Tina Marie: And happy.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Esther: Such a happy baby!

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tina Marie: Oh, it's so beautiful! I can see both of you and her.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Esther: So there you go!

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Tina Marie: She kind of looks, I'm thinking she's got a little more Fuji in the face, or maybe that's the expression. At the moment.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Esther: Yeah, maybe that's the expression. Yeah.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Tina Marie: What do we think?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Esther: Um. But no, I going back to what you were saying. Um! I, you know, see these, you know, birthdays and stuff that we're taking me to, and.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Esther: Her hanging out with her cousins. You know, and I told Michael like.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Esther: I just feel so happy, I feel so much joy and so much happiness. That she can go to sleep at night feeling good about.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Esther: How much fun she had that day. And you know I ask her when she goes to sleep I tuck her in. It's like, Oh.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Esther: I mean, did you have fun today, or have a good day? And she'll like nod her head. You know um.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Esther: No one ever asked me that when I was a kid I don't think anyone ever asked you that. But you know I was telling, and I.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Esther: And I see, even though she's like, even when she's acting like. Acting out, and wild and just.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Esther: Having screaming and having so much fun like. You know, the most will probably say if they really get too loud. Say, okay, kids, let's, you know, tone it down. Use your inside voices, please.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Esther: But we don't reprimand them.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Esther: For having so much fun and. Every time I take Emmy out, or I see her having fun with her cousins going to party.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Esther: I just feel so happy that. She!

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Esther: Is not going through what I went through, which was. Suppressing fun right? And you know.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Tina Marie: Suppressing herself.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Esther: Herself, you know, and.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Tina Marie: And yourself.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Esther: I don't know how to explain it. It's just I remember again being a kid, maybe not as young as her age, but. Um as long as I could remember.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Esther: You know. Um, maybe by the time I started grade school and stuff just. Um like a lot of times just being afraid. The feeling of.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Esther: Being afraid that someone would see me having too much fun, you know, being afraid that my parents would see me having too much fun I always had to like. You know, like um put a certain kind of like, show them what they wanted to see.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Esther: Essentially, which was like a quiet, well-behaved, demurrer kid.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Esther: Especially they expected me to be ladylike, and you know just a lot of like. Lot of gender gender based. Um.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Esther: Stereotypes. Oh, girls aren't supposed to do this. Girls aren't supposed to do that. I just remember being really confused, because at school we had to sit cross-legged, crisscross applesauce right.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Esther: I thought it was really funny how, when we went to Emmy. And when I came home and sat like that.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Esther: I would get reprimanded for sitting. Cross-legged.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh, right!

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Esther: I'm just. And then, when I'm older, I'm just kind of thinking.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Tina Marie: At Lady night.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Esther: Why would you like. Why would you purposely sexualize, like a 7 or 8 year old for just sitting.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Tina Marie: I was 9, my mom was getting married, and so I got to have a pretty white dress and a white slip. Well, the white slip had lace. Here, and I felt very beautiful, so I was looking at myself in the mirror. My mother called me a slut.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Oh!

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Tina Marie: I was 9 years old. I didn't know anything, anything.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Tina Marie: The, and I didn't know anything until somebody forced things on me to even know like I was innocent. And um, just looking back at that because I had to. If you say a word, I don't know. I'm going to ask, since I was a kid.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Tina Marie: And so that was like. You know, that was that was deep hurt, like.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Tina Marie: How? Yeah, so, but that you know it. Um.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Tina Marie: Those kinds of things, but you know they're they were taught that, and by my mom was raped by her uncle when she was young. And rape is common.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Tina Marie: For women. In most cultures across most times.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Tina Marie: Or some sort of. Sexual abuse. When you add with that the inability to talk about things, because that's also part of the culture.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Tina Marie: And then shame! Right, which was used on purpose by anybody who wanted to control victims.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Tina Marie: Whether they be male or female, perpetrators.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Tina Marie: Um. It's a powerful tool.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Tina Marie: And then we know that we've got things like Stockholm syndrome, where. Rather than the victims, understanding that they're victims.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Tina Marie: They have this um unnatural. Or natural, actually really is what it is, but it's not healthy, unhealthy. Um bond.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Tina Marie: To the person that hurt them, because. That person also had power over them, and made them think that they were taking care of them and doing good, and looking out for them. So.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Tina Marie: They weren't even able to know what was truth.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Tina Marie: And and then we do what's familiar with to us.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Tina Marie: So we we pattern after that. And then. When.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Tina Marie: Culture suggests that. Tradition is the highest value.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Tina Marie: But the tradition is. Judgment, secrecy.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Esther: Mhm, Mhm.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Tina Marie: Shame. And tradition is the highest value.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Esther: Well, then, those things just follow. They fall under it.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Esther: You know, the reason I said that that was so interesting to me is because when we went to Emmy's teacher, Parent Conference. Her teachers, like, you know, yeah, he's doing really great. If there's and we're like, was there anything that we.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Esther: You um would like us to work on with her, that you know, or whatever, and she says. You know. Uh, she's like, Oh, did she ask? The teacher asked. Did she ever do circle time at her old school? I'm like.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Esther: I think they did so she said, Well, um, Emmy, still um. You know she could work on doing, sitting cross leg, doing her crisscross applesauce.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Esther: In my head. I was like.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my! Gosh!

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Esther: That's so funny how in school they ask us to all sit like that. But when I came home sitting like that, you know.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Esther: And so to me. It just struck me like. What a stark contrast!

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Esther: It is that the environment, that. I'm able to give my children is just so different.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Esther: And it's just I feel like it's a culmination. Of just years and years, more than a decade of work.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Esther: To get myself to this point. You know everything, you know, all the all the things I went through. And then all the milestones I've hit, and you know, in particular.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know the financial independence that I achieved finding the right partner. All the therapy work I did on myself, and it's.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Esther: Culminating in this moment, where my daughter can have fun and be herself without. Any shame at all.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Esther: You know, and she can. Have fun. Run around, shout, scream, and, you know, have fun without.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Esther: Anyone telling her that she need to calm her ass down, or something.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Esther: You know? Yeah.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Tina Marie: I I just had a thought. Um, because I remember having some conversations about.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tina Marie: Motherhood, and that you weren't really sure that you wanted to be a mother. Um at at 1 point, and then I was thinking about also the value of.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Tina Marie: Wanting to have the full life experience, and the thought that I had, and that I've had for myself, too, is that. Children, are.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Tina Marie: The the best way that I know of to have the fullest human experience, because. They are mirrors.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Tina Marie: If you want to know who you are and what you're made of, watch your kids. Now. They're not us exactly, but they're our best parts and our worst parts.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Tina Marie: I remember the 1st time I saw my 2 year old, my oldest daughter. We were leaving the grocery store, and she was 2, and she said, Thank you, bye. Have a great day. And I was like, I know where you learned that from, and she.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Tina Marie: We were walking into the grocery store. She's 2 and a half. And there was this thug little teenage boy, all like saggy pants, and tattooed up, head back, hat backwards.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Tina Marie: And chains hanging down, and she's like Hi! And she puts her hands up to walk with him, and we just walked into the store. He held her hand. And we walked into the store, and she was pure love.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Tina Marie: My baby!

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Esther: Oh!

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: Did not get to stay safe, because. I didn't choose a great partner, but.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Tina Marie: Um. It was amazing, and but I could also see when I had bad clients. You know, when I was in a situation of needing to take care of 4 girls on my own, and.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Tina Marie: Feeling like I couldn't risk any job, and I had to just take what I could get. I was stressed out all the time. And I'd be done, and be talked too badly, and everything, and be upset and come out. And my kids were noisy.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Tina Marie: And I just, you know. Get the order back in place, and it was not a kind tone, it was loud, it was impatient. You go, do this, you go do this, you go do that! Stop it! Blah! Blah blah!

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Tina Marie: And then what I did was, watch that bounce around my house, from that girl to that girl to that girl, to that girl. And I was like, Oh, this has to stop.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Tina Marie: So I didn't make any money for over a year. I went on food, stamps, welfare, and everything. Um, because I was making people millions of dollars going bankrupt.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Tina Marie: Being stressed out, and I said, Somebody's going to pay me what I'm worth. I'm not going to go bankrupt, and I'm not going to talk to people that make me feel like this.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Tina Marie: And I was still stressed out about the money. But I was a lot. More able to be kind to the girls, because.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Tina Marie: I wasn't letting that energy come in at me. But for you.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Esther: I think it's amazing, too, though, that you had enough self awareness. To recognize that and see it and realize that you had to make a change.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Esther: Cause some most people would just gloss over it and just be like, Hey, I gotta keep working, you know, you know, and maybe.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Tina Marie: And excuse it and justify it.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Esther: Close to excuse it. And you know, yeah, that's might be the easier.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Esther: You know the easier choice at the moment.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Tina Marie: But it's not actually, that's a lie. We tell ourselves it's easier, but it's a lie.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Esther: It isn't be. It really isn't. And.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Esther: Um! They they think that. Oh, you know um! Oh, my! Well, my! My children were misbehaving, or blah blah blah. You know. So it's a lot that's a lot easier narrative to build.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Esther: Than doing what you did, and recognizing that you had to change something.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tina Marie: I will tell you, though, that my fiance we've been together for 11 years, and because of my situation, their toxic mad and everything. It's just been.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Esther: Bye.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: A long road of. Rather than combining 2 traumatized families, you know, just.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Tina Marie: Living, our lives separate, but still supporting each other, but. He was a business associate. To begin with.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Tina Marie: And I apologized for my girls one day, and he said. What don't ever do that.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Tina Marie: Don't ever apologize for your children. If you feel like you have to apologize for somebody, you're doing business with the wrong people. You need to stop that.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Tina Marie: Now. No man talks like that, not in my experience. Ever, not before, not since.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Esther: Bye. Mhm.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Tina Marie: And he was dead serious, like he was upset with me, that I would feel that I need to apologize for my children, that they're everything.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Tina Marie: And that's his fault. I fell in love with him. So whatever. Like um.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Tina Marie: But it was a voice like that, and.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Esther: That's a great quality to fall in love with.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Tina Marie: I'm telling you um, and but he's got his flaws right, and they're really difficult. We all big people, big energy people.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Esther: Edit. One second.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Tina Marie: Are going to have big. Um obstacle qualities, you know.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Tina Marie: But, like I said before, our good are the same thing as our bad just applied differently.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Tina Marie: So. But my point is is that I would not have grown without somebody willing to step to my big energy.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Tina Marie: And say what I needed to hear. Because most people are intimidated by me, or.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Tina Marie: Just don't want to. Do, you know. With what it feels like when I'm unhappy with them, like I was talking about that before.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Tina Marie: So I don't love being corrected. I hate being corrected. I'm more open to it now, but I still hate it. So if you're in the room with me, and you tell me.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Tina Marie: Something that I'm doing wrong. 2 things are going to happen. Number one, you're going to feel like I want to kill you.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Tina Marie: I may feel like I want to kill you. But the other thing that was hap will happen is as soon as I'm able to calm that reflex.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Tina Marie: Of self-defense and protection, that ego.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Tina Marie: I am going to go inspect everything you said, and I'm going to expect the quality of the person who said it to me, and I don't let low quality people around me. So I'm going to give a lot of value to what was said to me.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Tina Marie: And I'm probably going to change at least something.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Tina Marie: I may on rare occasion say. Nope, I'm 100% feel good about why I did this.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Tina Marie: And I'll tell you why. But 99.9 9% of the time, even when I think.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Tina Marie: I am going to like. I believe in what I did and how I did it. However.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Tina Marie: I could be more aware of. How I do the thing.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Tina Marie: For you because I honor you.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Tina Marie: And I want to. I can meet my needs and be true to myself.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Tina Marie: And still. Create a space where, me being me.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Tina Marie: Doesn't impose upon you being you.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Tina Marie: Because I love you and value you and want you. And so learning that.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Tina Marie: And this is the thing I try to teach my girls. There are very few people in life. That will ever.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Tina Marie: Totally be true with you. Meaning.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Tina Marie: They'll they'll tell you what they really feel. As much as they are able to articulate it.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Tina Marie: And try to right, and they will. Be who they are with you.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Tina Marie: When they're not with you like your name is safe with them. Your being is safe with them. Your story is safe with them. Your family is safe with them like they're.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Tina Marie: Or maybe a handful of people ever in your life. That you'll get to know that much.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Tina Marie: Who will be that safe at all times.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Tina Marie: And I say at all times, because there's fair weather friends right? There are people. Who are safe up and until.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Tina Marie: They're in deep, deep pain.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Tina Marie: And they will assuage themselves. Over, protecting you.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: Because most people just don't have that kind of fortitude within themselves.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Tina Marie: To be able to endure pain.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Tina Marie: For the sake of integrity.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean. You're that kind of person. And.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Esther: I think that's yeah. I I think you make it sorry. Go ahead. You finish the thought.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I was just gonna say you're that kind of person, and I imagine that. You're because you're because you are aware of that.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Tina Marie: You've had this awareness, but having the awareness and the environment. Are not the same thing, having the awareness and the environment.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Tina Marie: Allow you to. Be what you want to be. Once you've noticed who you are, you know what I mean.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Tina Marie: So you've created that environment. Now, in doing that, you've kind of like amplified your frequency.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Tina Marie: Which then attracts. The others that are like that.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Tina Marie: So that you can have that, and that's all I was saying, but that you also will. By default. Teach that to your children.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Esther: Yeah, I mean, I hope so in the sense that. When you say children are like your mirrors, I.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Esther: Do see that, reflected. You know, the most obvious ways were, I think my sister recounted this funny story to me. Uh last time she came.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Esther: Um. I said something to Emmy at the dinner table, and she said. Well, she's like, well, okay, mommy, we'll we'll talk about it later. Okay.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Esther: It was something completely innocuous. I don't even remember what it was.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Tina Marie: She's like not right now.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Esther: I was like. Oh, my God! That's exactly what I say to her when I.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my God!

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Esther: I wanna deflect a question or. And my sister was just packing up.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Tina Marie: Oh, but that she was safe to say that to you was so beautiful.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Esther: Oh, I just thought it was so funny!

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Tina Marie: I love everything about that.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Esther: Like there's. There's nothing.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Esther: You know, and I want her to feel every day that there's nothing unsafe that she can. Tell us you know um.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Esther: And anyway, so. Oh, my God! Where was I? There was another- another! Thought I that was Harry.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Esther: Anyway, but um. I think it's very interesting, because.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Esther: I think, as our our kids grow up um! And you know, as your girls mature too. They'll also be able to.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Esther: I kind of start to suss out um who that short list of people are. You know um and.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Esther: It can be a slippery slope sometimes, you know, when. You know someone, even, you know, with good intentions like myself, like.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Esther: You know. Um, I find myself the tip of my tongue like complaining about Fuji, about something. You know. Um, you know, to my girlfriends, but.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Esther: You know, and I I don't think that there's any anything insidious about it. It's more just like, Oh, I need a lot of steam like Fuji did something that really frustrated me, but my girlfriends would never think that I. Like I I don't love him like.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Esther: Like completely. And I just don't, you know. But you know it's it's just like.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Tina Marie: They put it in perspective, and know what it is, rather than.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Esther: Yeah, mhm, you know. And with his family, they're just kinda, like, oh, I'm, like, oh, Michael, wants to do this, they're, like, oh, I'm sorry. That's your problem. Now, I'm like. But it's in. It's in good nature, right.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Esther: So um, and even just the things. But I'm I think all I'm saying is. The few people that will tell it to you like it is.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Esther: There's a nuance that I've discovered between people who say, like my mother, for example. Oh. I'm telling you this because you know, you know, because I care about you because I love you because blah blah.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Esther: But there's a difference between something like that. And being manipulative or gaslighting, and one of the re one of the ways, I realized that I.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Esther: I couldn't trust. What she was saying to me was she would pull out her trump card of saying, Oh, you're just like your father. And that is one of the worst things that someone can say to me.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Esther: And by then, you know, when I was a kid that really upset me. As I got older and I got more, you know, sure of myself, and who I was.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Esther: I was more like. No. I am not like him just because I am being in opposition of you with something, just because I'm.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Esther: You know, like you are trying to shank me with that line and twist the knife. I'm not gonna let you do that. And she would say like, Oh, I'm you know. I'm only saying this for your own good, that you're you know you're acting like your father, I'm like oh, no, no.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Esther: Don't go there so.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Tina Marie: My mom does that to my sister.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Esther: Right it. It's it's it's like. It's amazing, you know.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Tina Marie: It's trying to control you by telling you you're the thing that you know that you hate. She knows.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Esther: It. Yeah, exactly. And you know, it's manipulative. It's.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Esther: You know, it's all these different things. So it's it's been very, very interesting to.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Esther: Understand who I can trust, and I think for me like I. I knew that my parents. Um, were they? I I knew from a young age that I couldn't trust them anyway.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Esther: And I didn't understand why, because they would always say, Oh, well, we're your family. You can always trust us. But time and time and again, I you know, I realized just through everything all the things that have happened. I'm like no.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Esther: I can't really trust you like I you know I can. To some extent I can. You know, Mom, I can trust that you'll like not hit me, or whatever. But I can't trust. I can't trust.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Esther: The vulnerable parts of myself. To you I cannot trust. You know you know some of the other things.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Esther: To you so. Um! I hope that.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Esther: Like we will, you know, and as your girls mature and my girls grow, that we'll be able to. Show them how to suss out those nuances.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Tina Marie: My girls do um, and so I know that you will, because because.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Esther: Good.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Tina Marie: Even though I learned that so much later in life, you're learning it way earlier. But they.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Esther: I feel like I'm learning it way later than other people.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Tina Marie: You're you're not, you're not, I promise you. There are 50 year olds and 60 year olds that haven't even gotten where you are, and I've got a 15 year old and an 18 year old. That understand these things amazingly well, and lamenting over the fact that it's taken them so long.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tina Marie: And I'm like, girl, you have no idea how far advanced you are. I have this 15 year old. That's like you know what I don't. Want to do what other people.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Tina Marie: I like. I want to be my own self, and be comfortable, being um my own self, and use my own voice and my own thoughts. And I need to only be around people who respect that.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Tina Marie: And I was like, what did you just say? 15 year, old child? You're brilliant like. Girl. Yes, and absolutely and just. I'm like.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Tina Marie: And one thing my fiance points out, he's like, even with my older girls, who. Are really their dad is so toxic and such a liar. He invented cancer.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Tina Marie: He told that my children that they he was dying of stage 3. Stomach cancer was given 2 years to live. Didn't lose his fat gut, or his hair, or anything else.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Tina Marie: Just completely made it up. This was the type of thing that he did. So, to give you an example of the kinds of lies.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: And to allow children to think that he was dying. So that kind of manipulation hasn't changed. It's only gotten worse. So my poor babies don't even know what the truth is.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Tina Marie: We had a psychologist court appointed. Who said that she was afraid that my girls wouldn't.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Tina Marie: Danger of permanent psychological damage if they continue to have unsupervised. Was, it's with this man. And so.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Tina Marie: They think things that really aren't true, and they think it about me. It's really hard, but.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Tina Marie: Even still, they have amazing qualities in them. And.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Tina Marie: Somehow they'll be able to orient. I know that they will. They'll be able to orient and know what the truth is. But that example is that powerful? Because.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Tina Marie: I couldn't undo the lies, but what I did teach them. So my biggest thing was, I wanted to break the cycle and pattern of abuse. The the 3 girls that have paired off 2 are married. One has been with this boy for like over a year.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Tina Marie: Those men are not abusive. They respect women.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Tina Marie: Um, and they are not narcissists. If anything, my girls are the stronger energies of them.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, 1. 1 has some kind of issues, but. He. He lives with his mom and his mom kind of um.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Tina Marie: He. He loves his mom, he loves his grandma like he serves the family. And so they're all much better quality than any of the relationships that existed in my family. So.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Tina Marie: Um. This is a good segue, because we need to wrap up and make a plan for next week, but. You're you're you're so far ahead of most people who have lived the kind of life that you did, Esther.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Tina Marie: Um the fact that you have the wherewithal to choose a partner like Fuji. Who is healthy rather than repeating your trauma.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tina Marie: That was a huge victory. And so going back to the alignment of the people that will.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Tina Marie: When I, when I was praying for the kind of partner that I would have in my life, when I was ready to be single until my girls were grown. My my key thing was, I wanted somebody who would make me the best version of myself.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Tina Marie: We don't grow without opposition. So to become the best version of ourselves. We have to have somebody who is.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: For our better oppositional. Do you know what I mean? Like.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Tina Marie: Makes us um drop.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Esther: That challenges us.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, but but respectfully and good. You've done that, you you have. You created the environment for yourself to grow.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tina Marie: And now for your children to grow. And I'm telling you at some point eventually, maybe even your mom, possibly your dad.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Tina Marie: Um. But that's not your responsibility. It would be, you know, an added gift. And it's amazing.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Tina Marie: I could keep talking to you, but I have to get ready for my daughter, but what I would love to do. Is, I just want you to contemplate.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Tina Marie: What is something that you would like to work on next week? I feel like um. We would do well to to choose some structure.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Esther: I think so sorry. I just so busy this past week. I didn't.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Tina Marie: I think you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This this. Okay? So I will tell you, because one of the things I do sometimes is I take my transcripts and go to the AI like, okay, do you have any feedback for my coaching? Right.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tina Marie: And it will say, Well, you could be more structured. I'm like, okay. But here's what happens when you try to get structured on these types of conversations is. The growth doesn't happen. It has to be organic.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Tina Marie: And I feel like we've had some big leaps. I got goosebumps like emotional, just.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, there's been a lot of epiphanies in the. You, not knowing how to have fun, or how to want, how to want, not how to want.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Tina Marie: Um setting up your schedule that was around that included want. Time there has been to me a lot of growth, and it has been structured in the sense that it was around the foundation of.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Tina Marie: Esther's heart and mind. Which are the filters that all the thoughts will go through that have to do with anything.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Tina Marie: And I'm not talking about superstructure. I'm talking about what I want you to do. The structure that I want from you is just to contemplate.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Tina Marie: What we've done, what we've. Done what you've done. I want you to review kind of your notes.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Tina Marie: And journal again this week last week had a lot, you know. Mother's day was coming up birthdays. All these things. But I just want you to.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Tina Marie: Think about you and to journal and to write. That's all the structure there is. You can brain dump. There doesn't need to be more than that.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Esther: Okay.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Tina Marie: But what I want you to do is go. Is there a thing. Now that you want.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Tina Marie: Whether it's professional or personal. Like, where's the conversation going with you and Fuji? What you're working on.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Tina Marie: And also notice the pace. So this is part of the cycle.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Structure, amorphous.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Tina Marie: I wouldn't even call it amorphous. Just less rigid is what I would call it.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Esther: Okay.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Tina Marie: I don't think it's amorphous at all.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Tina Marie: Because I think that you are on a. Fairly linear path and trajectory of.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Tina Marie: Self-acceptance and love and freedom. And the evolution that comes out of it, and exploration.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Tina Marie: Right, so.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Tina Marie: That structure. To me. It's purpose.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Esther: Okay. Mhm.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Tina Marie: It's purpose driven. All that I want you to do is to contemplate it a little bit and say.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Tina Marie: These are the thoughts that I was having, that I want to focus on. I think that this weekend fed everything.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Tina Marie: For a good conversation and awareness, just. Getting to know what your sister said to you.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. I really hope that you celebrate that. Awareness, a lot and all that. It means.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Tina Marie: And I want you to think about. It's 1 of my favorite phrases. I think I might have told you. Um. But this is a good thing to end with is that.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Tina Marie: It's a quote that says any. Any fool can count the number of seeds in a single apple.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Tina Marie: But only God can count the number of apples in a single seed. Meaning that that seed grows, a tree grows more apples, grows more seed.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Tina Marie: Trees or seeds grows more trees. Perpetuate.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Tina Marie: And the acts and the choices that you make. They perpetuate.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Tina Marie: More choices. They send out ripples into eternity, into the universe. Because of you.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Tina Marie: It. It doesn't stop like a. You know you push the ocean, there's a ripple. How far does the ripple go out? You don't know.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Tina Marie: You don't know how far that impact reaches. So you continue to.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Tina Marie: Make these changes and these shifts. And.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tina Marie: They're with good intent. And there is good.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Tina Marie: Fruit born of it, you can tell. Your sister could tell. You can see it in your daughter.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Tina Marie: So just contemplate the changes that you've made intentionally. And contemplate, even though you can't measure.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Tina Marie: The perpetuating impact that it has across generations. Esther. Because of you, and then.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Tina Marie: What other kinds of changes would you like to make. What would you like, Emmy to look like when she's.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Tina Marie: All grown up. Without constraining her against her will. Right.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Tina Marie: What are the gifts that you would like for her if they are compatible with her desires? And for Mari, and for their children and their children.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Tina Marie: Um. And then also, what would you like for Esther.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Tina Marie: What what would you like for Esther plus Fuji, which is not the same as Esther.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Esther: Mhm, okay.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Tina Marie: You know.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Esther: Yes, thank you. It's always it was. It's always so.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Esther: Joyful talking to you. Always, even when I came in, I didn't have really have anything written down.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Esther: Today. Um, I was just gonna list out a few things that I started doing the past week. Um, you know, like. I always feel so good after we're done talking.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Tina Marie: I just want to give you a big hug. One of these days, Esther, and just gonna be like.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Esther: That's I was. Yeah. One of these days we'll talk about what the closest airport is to you, cause I we cause we're actually gonna. Think we're. There's 1 weekend.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Esther: In July, or or maybe August, that we're going up to Portland.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Tina Marie: What uh! I need to know what that is. I will be in Portland. I'll be like, Sis. I'm coming to visit also.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Esther: Yeah, for a friend. Yeah, I and I looked up your address, though, because you gave me your address the other day. I was like, Oh.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Tina Marie: Not the whole time. Pass.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Esther: This is far from work.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Esther: Yeah. And I was like, Oh.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Tina Marie: But I've got family in Portland, so you know, and they're shopping up there, and there's waterfalls, and we went to see waterfalls. I'll send you a picture.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Esther: Okay.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. So yeah, we we go up there and.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Esther: Okay, yeah. Let me find out.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Tina Marie: You're worth the 4 h drive.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Esther: Yeah, I think, yeah, let me find out when that is, I wanna say, it's like. Maybe the weekend of the.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Esther: 23rd or something.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Tina Marie: I would cry.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Esther: Yeah. Um. Yeah. So we'll we'll have to see. Yeah, okay.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Tina Marie: I agree. Yes. Well.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Tina Marie: Worst case scenario is, I don't get to go with my daughter because she might be with her dad. That weekend. But um! She'd probably love to meet you, because I always tell her about beautiful Esther. And also she saw the flowers.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Esther: Oh! Oh!

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Tina Marie: And she knows about Chona, and she thinks all my girls are so beautiful. She's like they're so pretty, and I think I know.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Esther: Okay.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Tina Marie: Inside out.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Esther: Oh!

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Okay, I gotta go because she's gotta go to school. But you're amazing, and I can't wait to talk to you next week.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Esther: I know. Okay. Sorry. You too, you too!

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay.
