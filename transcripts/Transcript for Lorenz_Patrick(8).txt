Hello.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. How are you guys saying? Good.
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Theotic but good. It's pretty much always chaos. I kind of like it that way though. My daughter's got me a hat that says Boss of the Chaos.
00:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're one of those people that tries in chaos?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Not really but I do take some joy in it from time to time and then I like 15% chaos and the rest of it is recovering from the chaos. But it's like a battery pack for me. I'm just like I don't want people. I don't want people. people. And then I get to my people and I'm like, Oh, like the sun and, and then I go home, I'm like, what did I say? What did I do? I just want to like relax and what to be or read or do like whatever work out. I have to get the physical energy out of me. Where's my Patrick? got my Lorenz. Where's my Patrick? Beyond Tom being anti social. This is not okay. Yeah, he might be on a call. I suppose we could tolerate that.
00:01:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let's see.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sweet. Oh, what's been well, actually, how, how, how is everybody recovering at home?
00:01:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. My son is done. just got his final checkup and he's got a clean bill of health. So, yeah.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And my wife, she's starting a steroid injections this week.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, hopefully that will help. mean, they're powerful. Let's see. Why is my windows not open? she is she mentally coming out of it a little bit? Like, that's a lot to go through again and Yeah.
00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's strange.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. Adversity is like that. It doesn't matter what it is. It's always this. It's a fog and it's almost like a echo chamber of misery like this. Give you a ribbon in the house of mirrors.
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything is reflected back to and it's like nothing else exists. But then you get out of it and you're in the real world again. I feel like adversity can be like that sometimes and trauma can be like that. We're like, everything that's in you is what's reflected back to you constantly. if everything that's in you is hurting. That's, that's all. your experiences and then all of sudden you come out of it and yeah so um what's up Patrick hello how you doing you get to fade on yeah I get it every week yeah what do you think I look like with a fade I'm already annoyed by how short my hair is right now all right okay um wait Lorenz remind me how old your kids are uh fourteen twelve nine and five are they excited for Trunka treating you guys do that well yeah we do Trunka treat then we do the our our neighborhood goes all out on Halloween's and yes my we do it we're doing a chili cook off next Wednesday and my kids are fourteen and seventeen but they're still hooking it up and dressing up and yeah yeah my wife told my fourteen-year-old that he was two
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
to, uh, to dress up and I was like, don't you dare, right?
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, no, there's, there's no such thing.
00:04:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Maybe this might be the last one for him.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it wasn't that one. No, it a Viking. I was like, what?
00:04:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last, last year he dressed up as Maverick from Top Gun.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:04:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Got a lot of girls looking out and I'm pretty excited about that.
00:04:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That'd be the cost.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Smooth, right? It has me like, what? That takes that out. That's funny. All right. So anybody been thinking about what we were talking about last week? Do you remember what we were talking about last week? I'm like, you paused Lorenz because it was your idea you brought us a table. Patrick, what were we talking about last week?
00:04:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Using Slack to find a way to organize tasks and checklists for the teams to go through. Only get cases.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So did you happen to have any thoughts about that after the fact?
00:05:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I think it would be helpful, but I would try to keep it as basic as possible. Because I feel like everybody has their own little thing that you can add. If we created an Excel spreadsheet and send it around the firm, I feel like it would just get very, very long as far as what everyone thinks should be on there. But I think a general checklist is good because we just get so many cases, or if somebody needs to step up, maybe they're not used to doing certain roles. And they can just kind of see what needs to be done at a certain stage. Yeah.
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you to run any thoughts about it since last week?
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so actually Slack does have a function task manager function. That's built-in, it's called lists. And you can use the project manager template. And it allows you to assign tasks to people, track the progress, can be working comments on it. It's pretty neat. I've been using it, rolling it out is going to take a little bit of time just because I have to create a new list, essentially, for each client. And I tried to do it during our review meetings. That's taking a little bit too long to do that, to do that live. So I'm going to make some time, I already scheduled some time during soccer practice on Thursday night to get going on those. But yeah, I agree with Patrick. Pretty simple. Otherwise, it just becomes another Mesh like we had with little I when I first came where every time You know a new a new case came on we have 22 emails and 22 tasks and It's just oh no one looked at him. So and The good thing with that is that you can Schedule tasks out So it's not all due today. It's not like and so And you can Grade the importance of the task so that if they don't get to it they can Get to it tomorrow Good.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I talked to Mark about it and he said that Lidify has workflow automation also and so we are gonna get on a meeting only I'm going to get to be able to be there too and we want to talk to somebody there about slack and see because the remember I told you this is going to be an iterative process. It'll be for the same reason that you talked about Patrick and also Lorenz is that we don't want to create more problems than it solves.
00:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We don't want to create a bottleneck that wasn't there before.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?
00:15:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's good. mean, basically when you do the file review, it's like our list, but you're just doing it kind of in your head or you have something that's basically what you're doing. You're making sure that, you know, based on how long we've had the case, certain things have been done or are pending to be done. So that's what I do. I go through and say, okay, this case, we just got it and so called done, okay, insurance request, liver, insurance, set up a treatment. basically what it's going to be for like the newer cases, middle of the case, usually it's about treatment if they're going to continue or if it's been done and it's a negotiation and I already know about that. And then the really old ones, it's more so usually me just negotiating, it's just taking a while or that's to go to litigation or something. So it's good, I still have to remind the team. Like if I see they haven't been contacted for a while, I'll just send a text message. I'm not like coming, send a task to the team and then wait for them to get it when I'm already in there. I can just send a quick text as the attorney and maybe that'll give the client a little bit more, you know, peace of mind. But it's good. Obviously things fall and get missed but that's why we're doing file reviews. don't think it's an optional task for the attorneys. I think Did we mandatory for everybody to do it? Because these are our cases at the end of the day. I personally like just a piece of mind knowing what's going on with each case.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like you have a better hold on your job and your team since looking at it that way?
00:17:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Looking at it, how?
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, looking at all the cases with that kind of frequency, looking at it with a list you've come up with knowing that these are all the things that have to happen, and then looking at the timeline of these things happening. So if I understand correctly, the pace for both of you have improved, and that level of detail didn't exist to the way that it does at the moment, even a couple of months ago. Am I right about that?
00:18:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure more so for me because the more experience you get, the quicker you are knowing what needs to be done at a certain stage.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the question is, how do you feel like do you feel like you have a better understanding and grasp of your team, which is basically a business within a business, business? Do you feel like that's improving because of the way that you are forerenzically looking at everything?
00:18:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
If I just think, let's say I didn't do any file reviews, it would probably be a nightmare on these cases because if no one's poking and saying, hey, what's going on with this is likely just going to keep going the way it is, if there hasn't been contact for three months, it's likely going to go on for five months, six months. So, yeah, I think now that, I mean, the team knows, like, I mess up. to lc daily cases hey where's this where's that so they know that it's being monitored i think that's another um kind of like way to remind them to do what they're supposed to do because eventually i'm going to go look and ask them hey what happened here um because you know when i started to mark a screen in my cases that's kind of how he would do it to me so um i was like well let me make sure like knowing somebody's looking over here it's older huh yeah i mean it's for the better right i mean these are all our cases and you know i'm not going to sit here and just delegate tasks and not do anything like so negotiate so well especially not if you want to be topped up right yeah like can't like give up control like i still write my own demands there's a difference between delegation and abdication that's the to you if you fail
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's still on me. I'm coming for you Education so application is I'm giving you all the power and It happens in business all the time. So for like in the world that I have a lot of times I'm working with very small companies. They work from home. They've been multi-million dollar A big deal but marketing is the life and blood of the business if there are no customers. There is no business So it doesn't matter how great your fulfillment is it doesn't matter how great your team is it doesn't matter how great your product is If nobody's buying there is no business if everybody's buying and you suck at fulfillment They're still some business. So What will happen though is a person, you know who's been just exhausted with having to do it all for so long hire some and they're like, oh, you're smart, just do it. Like, I'm throwing money at you, lots and lots of money, do a good job, that's not how that works. Money is not generally enough of a motivator for most people to do excellence. comes intrinsically, it comes internally, it comes from something that drives a person. The person who is driven to excellence will be driven to excellence, even if there's no external reward. That's the thing about intrinsic motivation. They're driven by something inside of them that requires them to show up and be the best they can. They're competing, even if there's no prize for competing and just knowing that they're the best, that intrinsic motivation keeps them going. You know what I'm saying? So when we have teams that we manage, getting somebody to do the job in order to help us reach the goal. whether it's a team goal or the internal goal, but generally it's gonna be an alignment of both, right? You have your own drive. It's probably not everybody else's goal to the level that it is yours to be top part in the company. They might be like, yeah, that sounds cool, but they're probably not thinking about it as much as you're thinking about it. They're probably not hungry for it the way that you're hungry for it, right? get a paycheck, I'm not the attorney. So to give somebody a task and expect them to be thinking about it and prioritize it and organize and structure their day and to be disciplined about it to the level that you would doesn't make any sense. And so you wanna make sure that you don't abdicate, give them full responsibility and ownership over everything. You hope that they will rise to the occasion and you hope that they will want that as much as you do but the reason. ideas people generally don't show up like that. So you do have to always keep your eye on all the things all the time. You are going to be the leader. There will be one leader. Now there can be co-leaders, right? But at the end of the day, only one person is accountable for all things. That will be you, each of you. So looking at that and being able to break it down, Lorenz, how do you feel like your just kind of grasp of things, the traction, how the team is behaving, like just what are what's the thing that you might have observed as we've been going into this? going to keep using the word forensically more because it's, you see, I think of forensics, think of looking at the like the anatomy, what's the makeup, like, what do you call it though? Magnifying the last like really Inspecting every detail rather than you know 30,000 foot view to like microscopic view, right? Um, that's how we've been really digging into stuff. How do you feel like that is having an impact? Um, mentoring day to day operations all that.
00:24:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, uh, You know, I'm the kind of person that's never happy. Uh, I always want more.
00:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Never happy or never satisfied.
00:24:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They're too very different. Never, never satisfied. I always, I always want more, always demand more of myself and my team. But, and so I have to kind of force myself to look at the 10,000 foot view and see which direction we're going. You know, we are going upward. momentum is upward and forwards. And so that's, I like to see that. I like to see that there's improvements every week. It's not, we're not leveling out, we're not plateauing. But yeah, of course I want to speed things up. I want to do more. I want bigger settlements. want to go from 20 demands a month to 40 demands a month. I want to, I want all my clients to, I want to figure out a way for all my clients to do their recommended injections, because that's what's going to help them feel better and get better settlement numbers for them. So I'm always, I'm always looking, I can't, when my wife and I sit down to watch TV at night, I have my laptop on my lap, trying to figure out new solutions and new ways to look at things. So, I don't You got some competitor in you, I see, I see you. I don't really worry about.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What other people are doing because I can't control that but yeah, that's I mean really that's the only competitor you actually have cuz You're the only person that is made with the same skills and the same stuff like Improving and beating your best is I mean like I said, it's it's the only true like experiment Because everything if you're looking at a scientific method right then you isolate the variables that means only one variable is Only one thing is actually variable everything else is fixed So but when you're competing against else there's infinite variables you you can't there's nothing else. So You would be That's anyway, that's it. I gotta capture this real quick. So you need to Need to remember that this report is wrong. It's not gonna work is it? Hold on The average resolution speed by team Is that that? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm an integration, capture, you can see it. There we go. Because I'm looking at this again and it's weird because it has average resolution speed is less than Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. For your team, your average days to close is higher than your average days to resolution, but for everyone else, go away. The average day to close is higher. And wait a you see this? So, like, we were looking at this before. Whatever this is, be the same ratio for everyone, this number, or is it? It is higher. Hold on. There's 64. Okay. Okay. This is the right thing. So, this is total close, and this is resolved. So, this is probably paid, and this is, we came to. It got settled. Resolution's probably settled. All right. That proportion is correct. That's interesting. This disparity is pretty big. It's not a month roughly, not quite a month, but then. The speed to act. actually closed. Now it's only really a week difference. Anyway, these are the targets. So this is last 90 days. Let's do the first quarter. Or for the gimme, let's see, equals last quarter is roughly the last 90 days. I don't want that. We'll just do this here. I feel like that number was higher, so, too many one. All right, Lorenz, keep track of your number and Sam's number, 319, 291, Patrick, keep track of your number. Even though we know that that's skewed and Tyler's number 301. So I'm gonna switch it back to 90 days real quick It's got it Yeah That's weird I would not expect that to go up, but it did for everybody I think In the last 90 days, I wonder how that report pulls data Hmm any thoughts guys Maybe like increasing cases Yeah, that's a significant jump though, so for Lorenz it was 346 versus what? three twenty three nineteen three nineteen so twenty seven days so less than a month but still that's a month and then Samantha's number change to you remember what her the number one I feel like it was like 200 something yeah hers was like two ninety something okay and then Tyler let's go switch that back again one more time and it was this year so let's everything up till now so three nineteen yep and then hers was two ninety one so she's roughly 20 day difference higher which is about what yours is right friends yeah and then Tyler's what was Tyler's is he's went down No, that should probably do. It's just an easy, different window side by side. Real one, watch out, 281. Okay, yeah, so here's one up. Here's one. Oh yeah, he did the opposite. So this actually went down. This is 90 days. Well, and where's the volume?
00:32:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Although I don't think that would be such a bad thing because it's across the board, we're all getting clients to get more procedures than they normally would have before. It will naturally extend the time it takes to resolve.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is definitely true. Do you feel like that's happening?
00:32:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It is for my team. I remember getting like two injections was like, were aired for my case book, but now like happens very frequently.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you, Lorenz? Is that happening for you?
00:33:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm getting good value out of my cases higher higher policy limits the Still struggling with my Hispanic clients, but actually I've been digging down with with Mike and Karen who's kind of a newcomer to the team and We're we parents been able to cases that are in negotiations right now She's been able to convince the clients to go back and do the injection so it can get more value out of the cases Yeah, we've had it for 10 days and she's already been able to change three clients minds a I'm wondering if Jessica just just because he's a little bit more shy and I'm not it's not the right word, but like she's not very like assertive when she's talking to clients. I wonder if she's not able to kind of like make them see the light, make them see that this is in their best interest.
00:34:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and that comes down to training in the same way that it's adjacent anyway to the same kind of conversation you had with Viri helping her to feel more confident and open up to you.
00:34:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just kind of interesting because Jessica used to be kind of the superstar on the team. She used to be like the the CM where you know she just runs with it and now I'm like okay I think we have to do a little bit a little bit of retraining because it's kind of throwing me off a little bit and management.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is so important, because again, human resources, things happen. People can go through traumatic experiences that can shake them. They could just have a really bad experience with a call. They can become apathetic. There's multiple reasons why somebody would pull back professionally or professionally in certain arenas. And so these are things that you want to try to discover in your monthly meetings with your team. You're one on one, right, where you can dig a little bit deeper. But also you always want to be paying attention to what people are talking about. You want to be paying attention to their tone and to their body language and be aware of what kind of day you're having. Mark, when we're on our calls, it's almost never on video. I can tell instantly what kind of day he's having, by the way that he says hello. Not everybody is going to pick up all those things. That is a particular skill set. But just being intentional about watching and observing how your team is doing is going to be helpful and impactful. The other thing is training, but knowing that you're watching things, knowing that you're measuring things, all of these things have an impact on how people perform as well as things that are happening in their outside lives, you know, at home and other things that they're going through. So even though traumatic things can happen, difficult things can happen, sometimes even mental disorders and struggles, just anxiety. to me, it's odd to call that disorder because that's just life for the majority of people. And whether or not debilitating, still can feel like disability. and disorder, you know, makes it seem like it's a disability, whereas reduced is all it takes to create a quality of life issue and a satisfaction issue and stress and not being able to sleep, which then has a compounding effect of all the problems because we're not sleeping good. It's so easy for like everything is related, you know, so as you're observing these things and looking at who's doing what and how and you might notice in this contrast that this person used to do better, used to do worse, whatever, you just want to address that as as a leader, as a manager, but more specifically as a leader, managers, know, manage, leaving is a whole different kind of thing. It's being interested in in the person and caring about the outcome for the company, but also for the person. anyway, I would love every week if you guys are noticing things, you know, about about your teams, about performance, bring that stuff so you can kind of brainstorm about it. what now that you have this awareness, Lorenz, what is your timeline? is your plan for doing something about what you've observed?
00:38:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, well, I've got a couple of things cooking. Number one, Jessica was she was preparing and playing her own wedding for the last couple of months. And so she just got back, she took two weeks to go on her honeymoon and she just got back yesterday. So I'm gonna, you know, kind of meet with her probably at the end of the week to kind of see how she's done, how she's doing. The second thing is, I'm gonna be, as soon as John is going on a paternity leave, well, any day now, whenever the baby comes. And so that's gonna be for two weeks, so she's gonna be subbing in for John as a CM. when John comes back, I'm gonna put her back in with Jessica. Heron is a very experienced CM. She did nine errors at Sweet James. And she knows her stuff really, really well. And so she can help, she already helped. She helped me go through Jessica's cases and kind of bring them up to date. And she's gonna help Jessica shoulder some of the load and get her back on track if there's any burnout or anything like that. Trying to get her, you know, I think it's... If there is burnout, if this is a burnout situation, it might be good to like give her a little bit more, give her some confidence by offering some help from an experienced CM who can shoulder some of that load that she might feel overwhelmed by.

I love that awareness. So I have lots of different thoughts about that. The first thing I'll say is that it's important to be aware when somebody shifts into a box ticking scenario, okay? Box ticking is, I did it, right? It's not how good I did it, how well I did it, it's just I did it. So somebody went through a divorce on the team and was definitely not showing up for a while and the numbers were showing on that team for a while and then all of a sudden that person noticed the dip in the paycheck and they're like, I got to fix this. There are different things that people can be aware of when they're going through stuff. So again, human resources, some of it has to be tolerated, but not without effort. So you can know that you're going to give somebody space for what they're going through in their life, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them up to be aware of the fact that they're not operating at the same level. So one of the things that you can do is be like, when you're here, I need you to be here. That doesn't mean you're not still giving them space for the fact that they may not be able to be fully there. So it's almost that you're doing two things that are at odds with each other. It's not. It's that you're doing your best. to pull them up in the middle of what they're going through, but knowing that it's a request, it's not a demand and a punishment. So the approach is what makes the difference. So sometimes we simply just need to be conscious of the fact that we're not being present and be told that we need to be present. Sometimes really that's all it takes. You'd be like, Jessica, you know, we really should be pushing for this. You used to do that, you're not doing it. I know that you're getting married. know your best stuff in your mind. While you're on these types of phone calls, can you try to be conscious of not taking the box and just being like, I had this call, but make that call be what it's supposed to be. And knowing that that phone call is actually the outcome of the case and how much we get paid, which is the whole purpose of this business, but also it's your job. for that person to make sure that they're getting the best care and the most care that they need to because once the case is closed even if they have any residual issues they're probably not getting taken care of and now it's out of pocket so you have duty to that person sometimes just helping people be aware like hey we're slipping a little bit I know you got stuff going on but I need you to try to do better that's different than you're slipping fix it or else you know what I mean you're still giving them space for being human and also saying do be conscious and try so just keep that tuck that under your hat the other thing is burnout okay so once you get to burnout burnout can be very difficult to recover from it's different for everybody so the first thing that you try to do is proactively avoid it one of those things is really about how we spend our time during the day. I think I talked to you guys about energy services, right? Right, doing the hard things, doing the good thing, doing the good things, hard things, the good things, right? So that's one of the things to being able to talk to people about how they manage their energy and making sure that your team members are energy conscious, right? Because so many of us have, we have people in our lives that are energy vampires, we have things in our lives that are energy vampires, they just drain us, right? But if we're on autopilot, which when people are stressed out and overwhelmed, autopilot kind of kicks in, there's actually a psychological term for it. And it's like called default, default system, I can't remember what it's called Lawrence, you started study psychology, didn't you?
00:44:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like 20 years ago.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the auto-pilot machine psychology, automatic processing? Yeah, automatic processing. rushing a T-thread. it's like, have you ever just, like, faded out and you're like, I don't even know what just happened over the last five minutes because you were zoning out, but you actually were doing something, you can be driving. That's called automatic processing, what most of us would refer to as auto-pilot. It can happen. A person can be on a call talking to a client and be in the automatic processing mode because they're not being conscious about what they're doing. So, when they're overwhelmed and stressed, that is what happened. It's kind of a defense mechanism also to deal with stress and anxiety and overwhelm. But it also happens when we're doing things monotonously. So, if you are not, this comes back to the motivation and the entrance. motivation. If when you show up, you're like, I got things to accomplish. I'm not just taking boxes, but like, I'm trying to be top dog around here. I'm trying to not get fired. I'm trying to not be stressed out. I'm trying to whatever it is, right? There's something driving you that is important that you're thinking about, not just like, this is the next task I got to do. Okay, did that? You know what I mean? So you'll be able to observe that you may go through those things. I'm sure you do. We all do it at some point. And your people will go through it. But just because it's the inclination doesn't need to mean that it's what actually is allowed to happen. So like, so I noticed, it kind of feels like you're taking boxes. And I know you're going through up but can we try to do better? Here is how you could do better. Don't have somebody to do better who's stressed out and overwhelmed and not give them a way to do it because if they're stressed out and overwhelmed, the mental load is what's overwhelming them as much as the physical load. So if you're asking them to try to figure out how to fix things when they're like, I'm mush, planning a wedding, going through divorce, somebody in the family being in a wreck, your brain shuts down and so even the thing that you used to be able to do on autopilot can be difficult. Your job as a leader first of all is to manage your energy the best that you can to manage your your mentality the best that you can and then to check your people and look at them and like how are they doing? How do they feel? Like what's their mood? Like get a read on them, look at their stuff. Are they On autopilot are they taking boxes or they is something meaningful to them? You know I'm saying That makes sense you guys so That is kind of that that is that is the reward of going through everything Forensics is your level of awareness becomes greater. So imagine that You're going into class for the first time and you remember those like times Like multiplication test that you would get they give you a sheet of all these different multiplication things And you and they were timed and you had to get as many down as you could before the time was up you guys both had that experience Okay At the beginning of the year and the end of the year what was the difference between those?
00:48:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
All right speed speed but also stress, right?
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, the first time you looked at that, palm sweating, mom spaghetti.
00:49:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just kidding.
00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're exciting.
00:49:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's like a challenge.
00:49:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. anxiety. Like, holy crap. Okay. So what's the difference at the end is experience, but it's also awareness, because what you went through that year was you learned the times tables. You learned one through 10, 11, 12, probably, and you memorize them so that the mental load was diminished because it was wrote practice. You did it on repeat so much that you didn't have to think about it. You just knew what to do. But you were thinking about it every time you went to class, you were practicing it, and you were thinking about it so much that it just became easy. So what you're doing right now is you're basically learning the times tables of your business. right? You came into it and you're looking at it and there's this overwhelm and like I got all the stuff to do. How am I going to get it done? Well, stress, anxiety, and then the end of the year is going to come where you've been like looking at one through one times two, two times three, nine times nine, eleven times eleven, all these things show up and you're like, well, I know how to solve that. I know how to make that better. I know that's going wrong. I know who's dropping the ball there. I know how to fix the fact that they're dropping the ball there. Your level of awareness has just increased exponentially. So your ability to get the work done, the same exact work at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year, right? A sheet full of all these multiplication problems and you're going to get through the end of the year and be like, I got this. My team's got this. That's what we're doing right now. So, but it doesn't happen overnight. You know, some people did really well with maybe the twos and the fours, but not so good with the sevens, right? There will be those aspects in your business, where you're like, okay, I got intro calls, but I've got distributions, where are my sevens? You know what I mean? Like, there's different aspects, your teammates are going to have different things over different types of things. But because you're looking at it, top to bottom, left to right,,000 foot, you down to the microscopic view, and because you're taking accountability and ownership and leadership, not just over the results of the business and the company, but over your people, you guys are going to get some amazing results, but you have to, once you get that awareness, you have to go solve the problem. So if you see somebody slipping, whether it be yourself or somebody else, You have to address it, and you have to teach the solution. Don't just go say fix this, do better. Let me give you some ideas and suggestions about how you could do it better. also before you even do that, ask questions. Anything going on that I'm not aware of? Because I noticed this, and I think that you're this kind of quality person. And you've had this kind of quality work, but you work. Right now it was not up to what I know you can do or have done in the past. first of all, what's going on? Is there anything you want to talk about? Anything I can help you with? And whether they do or not, at the end of the day regardless, we still have to do better because this business requires it. This is what the job is, and the job is a privilege. It is not an entitled thing, right? to earn the job to get it. You got to earn the job to keep it. So here's how you could do this and always put an emphasis on this probably be the process that will take the least amount of mental effort. Like always look for the optimized version of how they can do better without being so stressed out. So that's where our automations and workflow come in. That's where the checklist comes in and really like hey if you are struggling to even figure out like what should I be doing today which by the way guys know I was talking about earlier a quick and dirty version until we get to the automations workflow. I cannot think of a better solution. Feel free to tell me if you have better idea. But I think just a spreadsheet where we have so let me go through this real quick and it would be a big old spreadsheet and it could take a long time to go through so I don't know that maybe it's one sheet, maybe it's multiple sheets and you go by the status that the case is in, right, like the first I feel like it's roughly three months months where there's like the most of the flurry and then there's you know they're going through treatment and so we're not closed yet and then there's closed end to resolution where we're waiting for the payment. So maybe we have a tab for or open and active and then we have a tab for in treatment and then we have a tab for close but not settled or wait settled but not closed but what I think would be awesome is if we had a spreadsheet for each of you and here's all the things right and instead of who does this there's a checkbox or a status of like whether it's being done now I know you have litify and you can go through all of that here's the difference and so like I'll give you example and litify I've got reports and one of the ports gives me all the data that I want, but the way that it's laid out is linear and I can't wrap my head around the 30,000 foot view, which is what I really, really need. And so we put that into bar charts, graphs, pie charts, things like that, and in charts, so I can see what I need to see. The information is there, but if I can't mentally process it because of the way that it's laid out, if I can't process it like this, if I have to look at it, every time I have to look at it, I have to do some calculations. It's not laid out in the best way possible. So all of this is already laid out and litified. But if you can't go, scatter it and be like, very quickly, this was the last day that was touched, and this is the phase that it's in, and that lines up with what I know it should be, which you cannot do and let it by right now very well, I think. Do you think I'm wrong? Do you think you can do this and let it by well? you guys do it day to day so I sort them by category okay the case status I feel like yeah I think you can actually because I don't want to create more work but what I want to make sure that we're doing is really being able to as quickly as possible and and I feel like being able to just look at it room across the board like on track off track kind of thing which also that's something that I want to identify people about it with the workflow automations on track off track if we can have a red toggle button or green toggle button like you know Excel has conditional formatting where like if a number falls between a certain amount it'll turn red like it's a negative number You know what I'm talking about Lawrence? Okay, so like, what if let if I had this condition to where basically, let's say the last comment was longer than a week ago, red flag. So all you're doing now is looking for red or a particular status. That would be really helpful too. I want to make sure I make a note for myself to talk to a little bit about that, to see if we can have an on track, off track, on on pace, off pace, and maybe what would be cool too is if each of these could be a sub status. What do you guys think about that? Would that be helpful? But I don't know if it would be because some of them are overlapped. So maybe we punk them into groups, the ones that overlap. This. is where this kind of thinking guys is where we create the system that doesn't create more work. So really thinking about what that structure could look like, where it doesn't create more work. That takes a lot of mental effort, but it will save it in the end and it will keep us from overwhelming everybody while we're trying to figure out the system. The other thing that I'm working with, founders and CEOs. quite often we have seven and even eight bigger businesses with teams of just five. If somebody, this is phrase and one of my mentors gave me was like, happens if you get hit by a bus tomorrow? I'm like, that's terrible. I just got a shock at myself. Just even thinking about that. But when you think about the impact to the business, it's significant. For now, imagine it's you, like something happens to you and you are unable to do your job for weeks at a time, for some reason, um, you're going to have if you're conscious, you're going to have anxiety be able about what's happening. If your system is so tight that another attorney can come in and if you guys are following a relatively similar system, another attorney and your case managers, and honestly for the most part, the case managers and the assistant should be able to do pretty much everything. The biggest issue is that attorneys have liability and so you you perform at a higher level. We've had this conversation before, right? You are liable to the state, to the government for the actions that happen. Your case managers legally and your assistant legally are not liable for anything that happens in the case. have to like actually break a law. But you in terms of like just obeying the law and being compliant, you have liability. So anyway, not everybody can do everything, but for the most part, because you're pre-lit, most of this can be done by anybody else. So let's say one of you gets hit by a bus or one of your team members get hit by a bus. If running this system is so well documented and organized, and you can see where everything is at, at all times, and you know where it's at, and also you're following the same type of system to know where everything's at. God forbid anything bad happens to somebody, but life happens. Somebody else would be able to step in and go like, I know exactly where we're at, and we can all handle it. Imagine the piece that will give the person who's not able to work for a while, as well as everybody that has to work. Now nobody wants to think in such morbid terms, but... it's reality as things happen. I mean, we went through a pandemic, the whole world shut down and changed the way that it operated. This type of structure, anything that was structured like this was barely phased. So keep that in mind, we're over time, and I yacked your ears off already, you're probably like bleeding on the inside, like, okay, already, Tina, the same as alone, but whatever. I ain't apologize. I appreciate you, Tina. I love you, quiet guys. You don't have to be so quiet, but keep working on it. Keep thinking about it and bring your ideas. I don't really have any ways how you could use these processes and Or if you look at it and go, know, it would be great if I could do this, but I don't know how I could do that. Because I am going to, we are going to have that meeting. I would love to take your feature requests or functionality requests. So maybe it does exist and we just don't know how to use it to that conversation. And please be thinking about how we can use the tools that we have to go from, if we could zoom in and out from 30,000 foot view to the microscopic view, you would have a full understanding of everything all the time and the more that you understand it, the better you can manage it. And also the better that you can teach your people to use it, right? So just be thinking about what kind of structure and functions in your tools would help you to manage it more efficiently. and help your team to manage it more efficiently and bring any ideas to the table. Other than that, just keep doing the best you can and think about the kind of leader that you want to be and notice your people and take good care of them.
