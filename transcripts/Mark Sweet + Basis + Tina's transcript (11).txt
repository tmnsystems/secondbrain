00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Tina Marie: Hello! Are you there.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Tina Marie: It says you are, but I don't hear you. And you're not muted. But there's no talking.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
mark sweet: Okay. Can you hear me now?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Tina Marie: I can.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.000
mark sweet: Cool.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Tina Marie: How are you?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
mark sweet: Oh! Page.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Tina Marie: Any update on that 3 million dollar case that you had.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
mark sweet: We'll know on Friday.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Tina Marie: Friday. Okay. And just anything about the Lorenz issue.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
mark sweet: Uh! It's moving. Forward!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
mark sweet: Um. The Illinois firm hired uh their own attorney, which is good, and I guess has now been in some contacts with the. New Arizona firm.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Dan Ryan: The music, industry.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.000
mark sweet: But.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Dan Ryan: Think that they can blow up organically.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
mark sweet: I don't know exactly what's gonna happen.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Dan Ryan: This, without. 0 money.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Dan Ryan: That you are trying.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Tina Marie: What was that?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Dan Ryan: Some fucking video. I don't know.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
mark sweet: Them.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Tina Marie: Damn!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Dan Ryan: Someone sent me. I'm like, Oh, I shouldn't have tapped that. Someone that's upset on Instagram. Clearly.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
mark sweet: Everyone's upset, always.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Dan Ryan: As they should be.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Tina Marie: They should have dogs.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
mark sweet: Good.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Tina Marie: It'll help. Um. I have no idea where I got this from.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Tina Marie: That's interesting. Okay.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
mark sweet: Dan's chat, survey.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. That's it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Tina Marie: Yup!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Dan Ryan: New bots rolled out. Smarter.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Roll out! I want to say autobots, roller.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay, hold on. Where? Well, what do you guys want to start talking about?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tina Marie: Since we've had some emails back and forth. Sure.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tina Marie: Any preferences.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, I need to know stuff about the. I don't think I've really heard anything back about.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Dan Ryan: The new design stuff. Greg did so. He's sort of hanging, waiting.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
mark sweet: 3 stuff. Okay, let's take a look at that.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yep.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
mark sweet: We're just talking about the layout, not the language, right?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Dan Ryan: No, that's all the language that you sent.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
mark sweet: Okay, I just need a little uh star next to the get paid or pay. Nothing set up a period.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Dan Ryan: So. Okay.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Dan Ryan: That's simpler.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
mark sweet: Because in the bottom that means you don't pay any attorneys, fees, or anything else. But. You know, theoretically, if they're ever assigned sanctions or something, they're supposed to be responsible.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Dan Ryan: Got it. Asterisk.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Tina Marie: So. Do we have.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Tina Marie: Other feedback. Or do you have what you need to give to.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Tina Marie: Craig. Dan.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Dan Ryan: That's it. A star.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Tina Marie: Just to start.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
mark sweet: Um. Alright, I'm still going through this right now we're talking about it.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Dan Ryan: I guess. This is, this is the feedback Tina. So.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Dan Ryan: Strap, in.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Mark, are you looking at it now?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
mark sweet: I am. I don't. Know how nitpicky you want me to get like we've had well over.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Dan Ryan: Nitpicky as you like. It's yours.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
mark sweet: Okay. Well, we've had well, over 200 clients.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tina Marie: But.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
mark sweet: We've had like.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Dan Ryan: Uh. Okay.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
mark sweet: 2,000 plus clients.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, there, we go.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
mark sweet: I mean, actually, I can tell you how many clients we've had. Hold on. That's way. More than that.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Dan Ryan: Uh. Oh, I see your email, Tina, there is no system. The system is. I paid someone to go.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Dan Ryan: Cut and paste, every opening line of every conversation in that bot ever.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Tina Marie: Holy.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Dan Ryan: And then I went through them manually. The system is me.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Dan Ryan: Sadly.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Tina Marie: That not skip.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Dan Ryan: On a Sunday. No lap.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Tina Marie: Us.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
mark sweet: Who.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Tina Marie: Sunday.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
mark sweet: Uh! I'm. This isn't even perfect. There's more than this. But 6,370 people so far.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Dan Ryan: Sure. All right.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
mark sweet: A little more than 200.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Dan Ryan: Show up! Alright!

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
mark sweet: I don't know if we want to do the 10,000 to 50,000, but we. Certainly.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
mark sweet: Can. There's other.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Dan Ryan: Basically just want to do it. So the next step would be like, finalize, content, build it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Dan Ryan: So. The more final the I mean. Obviously the content can.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Dan Ryan: Get updated. Oh!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Dan Ryan: Once it's on the site, because that's an easy update. But. You know, if you wanted to launch.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: Also.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Dan Ryan: Virtually nothing wrong.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Tina Marie: That line with the clients, the compensation number, and the percentage of cases one that should be like right under the. Banner the what do you call it? Slider at the top? Whatever that section is.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Tina Marie: Hero, section. What does this look like on Mobile? Is there.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Dan Ryan: No.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Dan Ryan: No.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Tina Marie: Around.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Dan Ryan: Sadly. Figma does not do that. From a design perspective.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Tina Marie: Oh! 16 way 3, 5, I mean the.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tina Marie: We don't have the crazy images that are there now. But. The.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: Icons per the size of the box, like the ratio of imagery. To box size is. Not great.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Tina Marie: The text should be bigger. The picture should be bigger. Fill up that space more.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
mark sweet: Uh in terms of gross recovery. We're. Over a hundred 50 million.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Tina Marie: Where's growth? Recovery?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
mark sweet: The why choose us? Need some work.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Dan Ryan: In what way.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
mark sweet: Well, faster results. Our pre litigation process gets. Probably needs.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
mark sweet: A little updating.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! That might be my bed.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Dan Ryan: That's in the dock. So that. But that's the only one that's truncated. Yeah, I see that. Alright.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Dan Ryan: That's easy. That one. I can fix some of these. I can't. I'm not that good at Figma.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
mark sweet: On the old way versus new way, instead of saying just 9 months, maybe. Just say. Few months or couple of months, instead of just giving it the actual number.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Dan Ryan: Sure.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
mark sweet: Not sure why, but there's. The amount of white space kind of.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
mark sweet: Annoys me.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Tina Marie: Could we? So at the very top where we've got the logo, and then a space and then call. Now, could we.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Tina Marie: Duplicate, not remove. That 200 plus clients, 50 million.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Tina Marie: Compensation, or, instead of, say, 50 million, say the 150 million like. Gross return, because that's a bigger number.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Tina Marie: 99% of cases one, but. Also.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Tina Marie: Could we have it be a scrolling number, right? So that the dollar signs are just almost like a jackpot scrolling up to. That over a hundred 50 million.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Tina Marie: Like super quickly, obviously, but. So it catches eyes because of the movement and the big number.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Dan Ryan: I haven't. I am not sure what you're saying. All right. So.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Dan Ryan: This yellow banner thing a. We're moving it below. The hero. Right.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Tina Marie: Not. It's not yellow. Let me share screen to make sure we're on the same page.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! Okay. So going back to the yellow banner, you do want to move the yellow banner to below, right below the hero that that was true.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Tina Marie: Hold on. Okay. Not the one I wanted to move.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Tina Marie: So this right here.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Dan Ryan: That. Earlier. The one you said earlier is not that one.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Tina Marie: No this!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Tina Marie: But instead of moving it right below there. I think it should go.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Tina Marie: Scroll up man! Oh, wrong way. He went right here.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Tina Marie: And if.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Dan Ryan: Go below the nav.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Tina Marie: Where's the nav? I don't even see a nav.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, that's the header. The nav is just a call. Now. Button, yeah.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, then, between the logo and the call. Now, button.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! In the header.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tina Marie: Yes. And I don't want to remove it from here, but I'd like to see that. So the accurate number of clients.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Tina Marie: And then, if we can turn this instead of compensation, be gross. Revenue, or whatever it is, what do you call it?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Tina Marie: Mark.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
mark sweet: Settlements.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
mark sweet: Compensation, whatever you want to call it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Tina Marie: A 150 million. And then 99% cases one. But what would be really cool.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Tina Marie: Is, and I know you hate that. What would be cool if but.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Dan Ryan: We do?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Tina Marie: Um. But this is different. Uh.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Tina Marie: Because we want to capture their attention instantaneously, like, as soon as they land on the page. Um so.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Tina Marie: If this could be like a scrolling number, like a jackpot. You know what I mean, not look like a jackpot machine. But basically, have you ever landed? And you you see, the numbers are changing. Like, how many clients serve that that kind of thing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So 1st and foremost, we'll put it there and see if you like it there and then, if you like it there, then, when it gets built it can have the J. Query that will do whatever.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay. What do you think about that, mark?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Dan Ryan: Now did I miss here moving the yellow thing in general? I thought that was also a thing.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Tina Marie: I. That's it wasn't yellow. It was this.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Dan Ryan: No no no scroll up.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Tina Marie: Mm.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Dan Ryan: That one.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Tina Marie: No, that's not the one I wanted moved.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, so that one's fine.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Dan Ryan: Alright!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
mark sweet: This. The whole thing seems a little disjointed.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Tina Marie: I'll. Yes.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Dan Ryan: Ah, this is the layout that Youtube designed. So you can talk amongst yourselves.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Tina Marie: Huh! Well, without all this put together, it always will look different anyway. So it's just natural that it's an iterative process.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, so just tell me, like. You know, if you just think of them as blocks.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Dan Ryan: You can change the order of blocks, you can. You know fly!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Dan Ryan: That yellow for his example. That yellow thing's a block. It can move around. Practice areas block, it can move around. So it's it's just a matter of like moving blocks around.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Dan Ryan: And then within the blocks like making the icons bigger. That's just within that block.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Tina Marie: Almost there. Go back, back, back.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: I just wanna assume. What?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Tina Marie: Where is it? At? No.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Tina Marie: There. Okay, view. Zoom! Out!

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Tina Marie: I wanna see more of it at once. Oh, yeah, it's command.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Tina Marie: Minus. Alright!

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Tina Marie: I really want to see it like normal version. Dude. Can you not get smaller.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Dan Ryan: It'll never stack. So you'll you'll never get like.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Dan Ryan: Actual mobile view. For some.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Dan Ryan: Weird. Well, it's because it's a design.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Tina Marie: Oh, weird! That's like as big as it'll get. That's probably what you meant.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So like once, the once you have, like the. Block order. Let's call it. Then I can go to Greg and say, you can either take the extra step, say, Okay, now do a mobile view, and then.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Dan Ryan: Because, like, if you're moving blocks around, then he has to do it in 2 places. So we're creating like double work. So it's like, if you get the desktop view, then you go. Okay. Now give me the the mobile view.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so all this just.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Dan Ryan: Or you just build it, and you get the mobile view.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Tina Marie: All of us has way, too much space. So it like, we're talking about power items above the fold, and also just how much they have to scroll, how much they have to strain like this text.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Tina Marie: Should be filling up that ribbon. There should not be all this white space. Above the we get more clients in between here and and these things like they offered. We got them.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Tina Marie: That. Is too much effort to look at like it's not gonna pop out the way that we want to. And it almost.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's start there right. That should just be. Much bigger, filling up that space.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Tina Marie: Not longer right. It doesn't need to be so long. Um.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Tina Marie: Proportionately. Just.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tina Marie: Bigger, wider, bolder kind of things, including the text. But like they offered.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Tina Marie: Um. The colors aren't even really. Helpful, right? So like ours could be green. Theirs could be red, something like that where we're.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Tina Marie: Psychologically, instantaneously. Showing this is not appealing, right? Them.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Tina Marie: Versus us. They they offered we got them. It's not super clear.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Tina Marie: Everything needs to be engineered on a marketing and psychology level right to get. The biggest impact as quickly as possible in these little nuances.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Tina Marie: Do that. So like we could. What do you call it? Uh.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tina Marie: Sketch it up if that's what's needed for Greg, or if he could just take that feedback. Also, we can give the transcript as we go through this. Whatever is most helpful to.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Tina Marie: Get there! Faster. I don't know.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Tina Marie: But. There's just a whole lot of white not being used.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Dan Ryan: I got the reduced white space. Next.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Tina Marie: Well, but it's more than that. It's how to reduce it. Do you know what I mean?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Dan Ryan: No, I don't.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Tina Marie: I just described it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Dan Ryan: It's reduced white space. And then you see how it looks.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Dan Ryan: And then you also have to remember when this goes mobile. You can't have it super duper tight, because then on Mobile it'll look like shit.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Dan Ryan: So there's.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Dan Ryan: It's like you got, cause you're not gonna be able to. Change the the white space on Mobile as much.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Dan Ryan: Like. For Mobile.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Dan Ryan: But I get what you're saying like, so you can reduce line height. Increase font size. Yeah, we can definitely do that. Reduce the general white space in between elements.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Dan Ryan: Um. Totally.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Tina Marie: Alright. Oh, no, like. So let's just say this is the section that's on Mobile. And then we could make it.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Tina Marie: That. Excuse my drawing.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Tina Marie: And then the text. They write much. Bigger, so.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Tina Marie: If it's on Mobile, or just like. Filling it up, not just to fill it up right. This doesn't need to be bigger.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Tina Marie: But the imagery about more money.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Dan Ryan: Did I just happen to do it on Mobile? Then. Because it's gonna be everyone's gonna be on mobile.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Even if they don't, mobile, optimized version would still probably be a better desktop layout because the use of space.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Dan Ryan: But we're only going to see it as mobile. So you're all it's it's 1 of the like. We designed this in one or the other.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Dan Ryan: Like from the at the design phase. Right now we're designing on desktop. So we would. I would just have them switch it to. Mobile.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dan Ryan: And then it would be like, All right. How does it look on? Is the white space good on Mobile. Is the size good on Mobile, and then it will go up.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Dan Ryan: When it switches to desktop.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay, uh.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Dan Ryan: It should auto scale stuff. In in proportion to the.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Dan Ryan: The viewport.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Tina Marie: It's so weird that they don't have a toggle ability to look at both, cause that's old. It's been around a while.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Dan Ryan: Don't! They don't have it.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Dan Ryan: You gotta do. You gotta run a. Write a bunch of Javascript.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Tina Marie: Mark, dots.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
mark sweet: The vast majority of traffic is mobile. So I I get the reason why.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Tina Marie: So yes, we wanna look the design layout as mobile while we're working on it.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
mark sweet: I mean, it's not even like it's close to 50. It's like 90, 10.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, you're if it's gonna be on a billboard. The you know. Probably pull it up on their phone.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
mark sweet: With the billboard. We're gonna do our own thing for it.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Dan Ryan: You're what.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
mark sweet: Like we'd make its own creative for a billboard.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Dan Ryan: Like a landing page.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
mark sweet: No like what's actually going on a billboard.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, I'm saying, if they see the billboard, and they they decide to go to winner. It's free.com.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
mark sweet: They're going on their phone.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Dan Ryan: It would be. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Dan Ryan: Exactly.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. Can you put a QR code on a billboard. You can, I'm sure.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
mark sweet: So, technically, yes. However, it's a driving hazard.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Dan Ryan: I believe it.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but not everybody that sees a billboard is driving.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
mark sweet: So. I I know.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tina Marie: You're making your. You're you're making your injury cases.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Dan Ryan: Right.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. That's terrible!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
mark sweet: So the the signal answer is, Yes. But.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
mark sweet: Uh it's frowned upon.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Can you pass it through an ethics board.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Dan Ryan: Makes sense.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
mark sweet: Oh! Ethically. It's fine.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
mark sweet: I think there was worries about um. Being pseudo.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Tina Marie: Do? Do people not have passengers and and people walking like. That's the argument. It's not your fault that people are.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Tina Marie: Not responsibly driving. You assume that you're going to use a passenger or see it while you're driving. Or use the other methods that are on the billboard.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
mark sweet: That is adorable. Um.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no. Uh. The reason why is because it quote unquote, encourages distracted driving.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Tina Marie: Alright!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:57.000
mark sweet: Though you generally cannot put any nudity, profanity, graphic violence, hate, speech, or personal attacks. No advertising for illegal goods or services. No. QR. Or text codes.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
mark sweet: No statements that are verifiably false or needlessly inflammatory, and no footnotes, disclaimers, or fine print.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Tina Marie: I am. Did you memorize that, or have a list to read right away?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
mark sweet: No, it's on the billboard. Laws and regulations.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Tina Marie: You didn't answer the question.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Dan Ryan: He hasn't memorized.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
mark sweet: I haven't memorized. Sure.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
mark sweet: Uh. We looked at it because we thought that that was actually a good way. We could constantly like a B test things.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Dan Ryan: Hmm.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
mark sweet: So when we're doing the um, I forget what's called the digital billboards, because we keep swapping it out. We were like we just do one. Huge QR code.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
mark sweet: So you'll be like, ooh! What's that? And then scan it. Um.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah. And we were told, no, for that. Those reasons.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Tina Marie: So you can have a phone number cause that's not distracting.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
mark sweet: Correct.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: That makes sense.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Dan Ryan: Supposedly. Yes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Tina Marie: That makes sense, because writing down a number is not distracting at all. Perfectly logical.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
mark sweet: Now. I don't know if it's changed in the last year, but that's what it was as of a year ago.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Tina Marie: I would argue the shit out of that, anyway. That's just stupid. Tell me.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Tina Marie: How. Snapping a picture takes less time than a number or a text code. Why, you can't use a text code, but you can use a phone number.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
mark sweet: Don't make the rules.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Tina Marie: Cause. I know it's just stupid, whatever. I won't waste your call time with this. Okay.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Tina Marie: The other thing is, I just don't think that this is. Easy to read.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Tina Marie: A again a lot of wasted space. It's just stacked, and also. The just, the color combinations.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if these are supposed to be the eye. Friendly colors visual, but. The white, the red, the pink, and everything that hurts my eyes, all of it, just.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Tina Marie: Might just be me. So. How do you 2 feel about this section.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Dan Ryan: I have no feelings.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: Dan, what does your logical brain say? This is going to be received as by people looking at it. Do you have that function.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Dan Ryan: Ah! I? It's very eye-catching.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Dan Ryan: That's that would be my take. I mean it. I mean, if you actually, from a perspective thing, all those lines are pointing at the headline, so it draws your eye to the headline.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Dan Ryan: Um. Color wise. I think it looks good.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Mark.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Dan Ryan: I mean these the and these are the brand colors that Mark picked like the primary brand colors of purple and yellow. The other 2 are just accent colors from the.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Dan Ryan: From the designs. The whole design system.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Tina Marie: Mark.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
mark sweet: I completely get why, it is what it is I don't. Dislike it. I might work some of the language around a little bit.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
mark sweet: But. Uh! I don't hate it.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
mark sweet: Some emojis could definitely help it.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: And and actually. But but here's the logic with that, Dan. If you are skimming. And we already know, like, for example, search for a lawyer.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: Magnifying Glass. Pay. Have 3 retainer fees up front.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Tina Marie: You know, just. Dollar sign. Sad face, something like that like there's in fact, we could just run it through. Chat Gbt, real quick hold on a second.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Tina Marie: 2, 5. Capture.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Dan Ryan: But yeah, you can all that. That's all stuff you can add.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
mark sweet: Later, yeah.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Dan Ryan: You know, when it's getting built. I mean, the primary goal right now is to just nail the block order and the layout.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Dan Ryan: Now for Mobile, which is fine.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Tina Marie: Go away!

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Dan Ryan: And then I got all the notes.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
mark sweet: The practice area should just always be down towards the bottom. Just doesn't really matter.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
mark sweet: Why choose us higher up.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Dan Ryan: And it's gonna be a ginormous. Scroll because those are gonna stack as 16 blocks. So it's gonna become a.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Dan Ryan: Ridiculously long scroll.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah, but no one's really looking at it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Dan Ryan: No, I know that's why you would put it down bottom, because they probably won't get that far. Most people I mean, you gotta think. You're trying to get your message.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Dan Ryan: Across, probably. In the 50%.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Dan Ryan: The call, and maybe you have this a sticky nav. So the call now is always there. Right. So then, your second call now is in the how else we help box, which is.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Dan Ryan: Probably roughly. 50%.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Dan Ryan: Less. It's actually probably less than 50%, though.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
mark sweet: I know we're definitely pushing for phone calls. Do want anything where it's get your free case. Evaluation.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Dan Ryan: Well, we'll. An inline form.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Dan Ryan: Uh. But not have a button linked to it. Basically, just they get to the the form.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, and I would put that.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Tina Marie: Anyway.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Dan Ryan: Right below. How else we help.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Dan Ryan: Or or right below the Stat, that that stat bar, one or the other.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tina Marie: What is the you waited day one you called you one. I'll get that.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Tina Marie: Who won. What is.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Tina Marie: This makes no sense to me. I can guess at it.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Tina Marie: But. It's not very clear to me.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, Mark wrote that so you can talk to Mark.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Tina Marie: Mark.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
mark sweet: Do you call me one.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Dan Ryan: Where Mark Gpt. Mark Gpt. Wrote that.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
mark sweet: So it's you waited. They won, ie. They paid out way less money.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Tina Marie: They!

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
mark sweet: You you won.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
mark sweet: I would also just visually. Make ours a little more compact.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
mark sweet: And then just. You enjoyed like afterwards, just showing like there were still so many more steps afterwards.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Dan Ryan: I think that was the original layout, the original layout, that it was just.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Tina Marie: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Dan Ryan: The all the boxes were together, and then it was one arrow, so we. We can go back to that.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Tina Marie: This one has 9 boxes. This one has 6, but they're the same length, and they're not compacted together. They're spread out. So it. Doesn't have that impact of.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Tina Marie: There's less things to do.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Dan Ryan: Right. And I'm.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Dan Ryan: That's what I'm saying before it was compacted. But I think Mark. Had him asked to change it, or he just decided to change it. But it was definitely.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Dan Ryan: Compacted, so I'll go. I'll tell him to go back to. Impacted version.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Tina Marie: So. What is the you?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Tina Marie: Waited like I just. I would say, like you called us. You won.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Tina Marie: Or you something like, I think this verbiage is just way too weak. For.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Tina Marie: Like almost to the point of. Wasting time.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Tina Marie: Because this is the think you wanted to be the the strongest. Like you did.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: Whatever the old way, was right. Um.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Tina Marie: It seems to be prepared for social trial or face an uncertain journey. Ah!

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Tina Marie: Like me. Because is this almost more like litigation versus.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Dan Ryan: Well, it could be that. Uh.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: 3 min, dan.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Dan Ryan: The new way should end with you, get paid, which. Calls back to the tagline.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Dan Ryan: And then the other one could be. You get played.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Tina Marie: Well, it still goes back to the tagline because it's. Um when.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Tina Marie: What is it? Whenever it's free? Ah!

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Dan Ryan: So like the old way could be. You got played. And the new egg is you got paid.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Tina Marie: Oh, there you go! You got paid.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Tina Marie: I like that.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
mark sweet: Mean.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Tina Marie: Mark.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
mark sweet: And go with that.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that kind of brings it home. It gives the Tagline way more meaning all of a sudden.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Tina Marie: Okay. You'll remember that, Dan, to give to him.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Dan Ryan: Making all these notes. Girl.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Tina Marie: I ride just for the like a hair.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Dan Ryan: Little to Palooza over here.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Tina Marie: Okay, when a lot.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Dan Ryan: Right. Some of these I can do, and then I don't have to explain it to him. I'm like, oh, I could type.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Dan Ryan: Typing, right now.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.000
mark sweet: Um the call. Now for a free consultation. We just call now for a free, confidential consultation. Just get out, get rid of the with our attorneys, part.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Also way bigger. Call now button.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Tina Marie: Like. Fill up that whole block right there with big button. Big text.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Dan Ryan: It'll be big on Mobile.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Tina Marie: We lack big buttons, and we cannot lie. What just kidding. Alright!

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: Itty, bitty, tiny icons.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Dan Ryan: I already got that one.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Tina Marie: Alright, I let's see. Changing the client number even. That's what it was.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: Fill up more space. All right. Well, I think that's good for the 1st iteration. Yeah.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah, obviously, when you get all the same disclaimers and everything else onto it before we can launch it. But yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Tina Marie: That's not obvious to a designer. So.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Dan Ryan: Well, he, we don't. We usually don't do that. We just we do that during the build.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Dan Ryan: But what I'll do. The. Asterisk that Mark mentioned.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Dan Ryan: So then the other thing he did was the giant Czech people. What you guys got.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
mark sweet: Yeah. I saw that.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Tina Marie: Try not to jump it down too hard, mark.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
mark sweet: Hey! I just, there's.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
mark sweet: I don't like it. I just don't like it, is the short answer.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Tina Marie: What! What would you like.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Dan Ryan: Right.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
mark sweet: I'm cool with the checks. I just don't like the people holding them.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Dan Ryan: So you.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000
mark sweet: Because someone's gonna complain. It's not an actual client we put under. It's, you know, a model, not client. They're gonna say, all of it's fake.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
mark sweet: Just. It creates more headaches than it's worth.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
mark sweet: I'd rather just put the amounts.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Dan Ryan: On giant checks.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Tina Marie: That.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Dan Ryan: That's fine!

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Dan Ryan: That's certainly easier.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
mark sweet: I mean again. I wouldn't mind having large numbers coming out of a. Pot of gold.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
mark sweet: Or coming out of like. You know, Cena was saying, like a slot machine.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I I. We were doing this.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Dan Ryan: For. Potentially putting it on the site and on a billboard.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dan Ryan: So.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
mark sweet: Forget the billboard stuff for right now, billboard, we're just gonna do totally separately.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. So then we can probably just pause that if we're not gonna use it on the site. And just have just have a giant.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Dan Ryan: Check.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
mark sweet: Well, I do think there is value on having on our website some of our recent large settlements, because people.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
mark sweet: A 100% want to see that. And I, it's on like every website.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Dan Ryan: Alright! Well, so then it could be. A giant check.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Dan Ryan: And then. Like uh in the, you know, do like a super. No, like a.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Dan Ryan: A headshot like of a real person. Get the real persons from like the videos, grab their face. Put it in a circle, and have it floating over like down the bottom of the corner of the check, or whatever not part of the check, but like.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Dan Ryan: So it'd be like Elise. 1.5 million.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
mark sweet: Problem is, those 2 things don't line up.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Tina Marie: Well, here, I have a thought about it. I just gotta open that thing back up.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Dan Ryan: What doesn't line up.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
mark sweet: The people who did the review and the amount of money they got. It's not the same.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! Oh, the people getting the big checks! They're they're not willing to.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
mark sweet: Don't necessarily want the entire family to know. That they got a crap ton of money.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Dan Ryan: Um.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Dan Ryan: There we go!

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so, what if?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Dan Ryan: We definitely can't use a fake avatar for that, either.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Tina Marie: Hmm. One second.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Dan Ryan: Well so. But can you even use their name?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Tina Marie: I don't.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Dan Ryan: I suppose you can.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
mark sweet: You would not use their name, you would say, like auto, v auto, or something else.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, okay.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tina Marie: So what if we had something like this? Right? And they're. Not reviews right? But we. It's a story about what type of cases and a pic and a picture of the check.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Tina Marie: With the real amount. One. But you know we could say in their names, change for privacy. Um. Check is not real, but the amount of the case and the case description is, or something like that.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Dan Ryan: But yeah, I have no idea. I don't know. I don't know.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Dan Ryan: What? Would be perceived as to a viewer, as that's bullshit.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Dan Ryan: Right, so. To me, auto via 1.5 million. It's like man. I don't know that it needs to be on a check, but it can be.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
mark sweet: I don't know if these things have to be on a check.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
mark sweet: But we do have to. We should list them somewhere.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Dan Ryan: Yep.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
mark sweet: And whether that's the yellow bar, instead of trusted by 200 plus clients, whether it's a bar there that has the recent settlements.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Dan Ryan: I gotta do it. And then you just.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
mark sweet: Could be there as well. People like seeing big numbers.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: Well with dollar signs. I think that's the bigger thing. So, and that would be something where they have split testing. Do do they. Do they slow their scroll longer? If the dollar sign giant amount.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Tina Marie: Is standing there alone as a. You know, auto via, or whatever right or um in a case like in in a check.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Tina Marie: Which how much longer do people stay when there's or. Um.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Tina Marie: Cause. That is one measurement. But do we get more calls on the check version. That's what split testing is for is finding out those nuances and how powerful they are.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Tina Marie: Rather than guessing.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Dan Ryan: And then do it on checks, and then we'll see. Well, so we have the graphic. Then we can.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Dan Ryan: Decide. Where all of them do.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Dan Ryan: Well in the design, I'll have them do both, and knowing that one of them. Is gonna stay. And one of them's gonna go.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Mark.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Tina Marie: Are you thinking, or.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
mark sweet: I'm thinking, because I like both reviews and checks, because people do like to see the reviews.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, I keep reviews.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Dan Ryan: For sure. This would just be another block.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
mark sweet: Then I'd be cool with that.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, reviews will just pull real real reviews later, like from yelp and from like. And then update.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.000
mark sweet: And then do we want to put anywhere, especially up on top. I don't know if it's in the call now, or the where they fill out the form, just you know. See how much you can win today.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
mark sweet: Call to find out how much you can win today. So the 4 found out how much you can win today.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
mark sweet: You'll basically, it's just a different version of the settlement calculator.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Dan Ryan: But is it a calculator?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
mark sweet: No, they're filling out the form.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Dan Ryan: Or or do you want that to be the. Right that could be the form. So instead of the call was the call to action, then the form is.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Dan Ryan: See how much you can win today. Sure.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Dan Ryan: That's interesting.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
mark sweet: That would definitely make some good progress on this. Okay.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So are we done looking.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
mark sweet: I mean, I do like the Se. The steps of how it works like I think that is. Solid.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. This one.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Dan Ryan: Oh!

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's new. That wasn't there before.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that is solid. I don't know if we can do anything to highlight it a little more, but I feel like.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
mark sweet: Really solid.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Tina Marie: I think maybe even alternating purple and yellow. There. Um.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Tina Marie: Potentially like emojis or check boxes, or something. Like that. We handle everything fast. That's huge.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Tina Marie: All of it. Get real updates, not radio silence. Now that.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Tina Marie: Combined with the AI report. Of.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Tina Marie: Radio silence. Um.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Tina Marie: Something we want to fix, because you make a claim like that, and that inflames those comments even more.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
mark sweet: Hmm. Who are always gonna complain.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
mark sweet: People always complain. But yes.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Tina Marie: Um! That's very dismissive comment.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
mark sweet: It's also a very true comment.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so is your point. Don't do anything to improve.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
mark sweet: Uh, that's generally my go to. Yes.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Dan Ryan: Whoops.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Tina Marie: What the are we here for, mark.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
mark sweet: Uh yeah.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Tina Marie: It's so good I can't throttle people on zoom calls. Ah!

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
mark sweet: Cause. I don't think there's any way to hook up the AI Chatbot to what's going on, lidify statuses.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Tina Marie: No, and you wouldn't want to. That's definitely not secure. But.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no. That's also.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Tina Marie: And you, because anybody could go ask, Hey, this is my case. What's happening.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
mark sweet: Oh, but that's a better way to respond. Bond.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:21.000
mark sweet: If someone's asking, hey? Let's assess, in my case, to try to get them to call in, because there's. People are not the brightest, and think someone's just sitting there from like our office looking at every single chat.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
mark sweet: On a Sunday.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Dan Ryan: They do?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
mark sweet: Like dan yeah um. So.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
mark sweet: I mean we we can just do it, as you know, to protect, you know, client privacy. We request that you call in at this number to discuss your matter.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Tina Marie: Hi ed.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
mark sweet: Which gives them a much better reason of why they call in, rather than your person's not available.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Dan Ryan: It's weird that they don't. Go to call like, why are they even on the website.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
mark sweet: Dude. I don't know why people do what they do.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Tina Marie: Some people like me don't like talking to other people and don't like making phone calls. I will do everything I can to avoid calling people.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
mark sweet: But that at least gives a good reason why we can't give an answer over the the chat.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Tina Marie: Yes, but if their issue is nobody's calling me anyway, why am I gonna call you Mother Effers? If nobody will call me like you have my number.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
mark sweet: Would you like.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: You get paid. Why aren't you calling me.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Dan Ryan: Well, it would be interesting to know where they are in the process of their case. Like our.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Dan Ryan: Are they at the point where they should be asking, Are they still in like if you're still in treatment. They should know you're still in treatment. Your case is still in motion.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
mark sweet: Like the one from today. The guy is upset because the doctors aren't giving him pain medication, and we just talked to him on Friday.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Dan Ryan: But.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
mark sweet: Like. It's not a lack of communication, but.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Tina Marie: Can we. Would there.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Tina Marie: Would there be a way for a person? So we are not giving out information. They say, What is your name? What is your case? Okay. Your case has been located, your attorney has been contacted. You will be um you will. You will hear back from them within 24 h, 36 h, something like that.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Tina Marie: So. The incoming information may be case sensitive as long as it's a secure.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Tina Marie: Website. That should be fine. We're not giving anything, any information.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Tina Marie: And then this system goes and looks internally. Right, non accessible to the public.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Tina Marie: Says, okay, I found this. I realize you're reaching out. We want to reach out to your attorneys. If, for whatever reason they wanted to use the chat interface instead of. Calling or emailing.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Dan Ryan: No. It cannot.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Dan Ryan: See. Records.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And then I, we're gonna see if this one part works. So there's a lot of.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Dan Ryan: Take down this blog post, which. Mark likes to be on top of.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Dan Ryan: So I said.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Tina Marie: Quantify a lot.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Dan Ryan: The most.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that's always gonna elicit the most because they're already on the website. So they're filling out a form of, Take this down.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Dan Ryan: Um. So.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
mark sweet: Which is fine, and we'll always, you know, that's just part of our business.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Dan Ryan: Right. So in theory, you can.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Dan Ryan: Trigger automation up to 3 automations off of this. So the 1st one I set up. Is going to email mark and say, Hey, here's there's a takedown request. However, it's not clear to me.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Dan Ryan: If it will actually include. The information about the takedown in.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Dan Ryan: The thing that gets sent to Mark. And so the thing that gets sent to Mark is, let me know if this works. So we have to wait for one to come in.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Dan Ryan: Like a real one, and see if it actually does that cause? I don't know. It just really didn't make sense to me. I'm like. It's supposed to know. It's a takedown request, because I gave it a bunch of knowledge for that. But.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Dan Ryan: I didn't see a way to like. Insert.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Dan Ryan: Content, like. Dynamically. I'm like.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Dan Ryan: What is it gonna send like? I don't even know what it's gonna send. So we'll see um. But then it could be so. Then you have 3 that you can trigger.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Dan Ryan: One is that one is no Booker calls built in now, so that doesn't use it. And then I tried to set another one up for something else.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Dan Ryan: But so, if. If it was someone looking for stuff about their case, you could.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Dan Ryan: Send like an internal notification, which is what I set up for mark. To somebody that said, Hey, so and so is inquiring about their case.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Dan Ryan: Maybe. We'll see.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
mark sweet: And just make sure I'm CC'd on it so I can get on them.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that one I didn't set up yet.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
mark sweet: Okay. Oh!

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
mark sweet: Totally sidetracked note. But Yuri, the law clerk, we just found out he passed the California Bar exam. So that's a big deal.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: Yay!

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Dan Ryan: A o. That's.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah, so it's definitely good.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
mark sweet: You think we find out like tomorrow about Patrick.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Tina Marie: Yay, that was my next question.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
mark sweet: I think.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Tina Marie: I hope so. Come on, Patrick.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it'd be cool. Yeah. Tuesday, May 26, th no earlier than 3 Pm.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, Tuesday, May 26.th

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
mark sweet: For him.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Alright, not. May 6.th

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Uh, sorry. Tomorrow. May 6.th

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I was gonna be like that doesn't make sense because.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Tina Marie: Tomorrow can't be the 6, th and then a Tuesday also be May 26.th

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
mark sweet: Nope. So.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
mark sweet: We should see. That's good for him.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it is. Well. And you.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Tina Marie: Hmm. Mark.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tina Marie: All right. Let's see. Um Devin! What up with that?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Tina Marie: Damn!

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Dan Ryan: But.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Tina Marie: Nice.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
mark sweet: You want me to drag them into a phone.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Dan Ryan: It's like it's still not done. I asked. I uh he hit me up today and was like, Oh, sorry. I guess he's moving the office. I don't know something like that.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
mark sweet: Oh, no, they're physically moving houses.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Dan Ryan: All right. Oh, no, he said, expanding the suite.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Dan Ryan: I don't know what he was talking about.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Tina Marie: They're moving houses, and he's reframing it.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Dan Ryan: I assume that was the office.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Dan Ryan: But he said he'll have it done. This week.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Dan Ryan: And then I can look at it and see if there's anything valuable. There. What the frick.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Tina Marie: Does he not know how much you know, Mark, like.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Dan Ryan: I have no idea.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Tina Marie: Cause? What.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Dan Ryan: I have no idea if anybody knows who I am, and.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Tina Marie: I heard just.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Tina Marie: But that's how you like him.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Tina Marie: But. From what Mark just said and what you just said.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Tina Marie: It sounds like he's trying to sound like, Hey, I got an office and not like working from home. But really he's worked from home, which. Uh, you know.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Dan Ryan: Does he work from home?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
mark sweet: I mean, technically speaking, he is moving his office.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Tina Marie: That his Home Office.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I didn't, really. I I didn't really know what it meant. And I was like, Oh, okay.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Tina Marie: Technically his home office.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
mark sweet: Technically speaking.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh, dude! What what is the shame about it?

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
mark sweet: I don't know.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, neither, it's.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
mark sweet: People are weird.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Tina Marie: Whatever.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
mark sweet: Everyone's weird.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Tina Marie: People. People want to look a particular way, and they think that.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Dan Ryan: Oh!

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Tina Marie: Being fake is somehow better. But okay. Whatever um, call control training mark.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Tina Marie: What you got.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000
mark sweet: Not a lot for you. Uh, we did break the uh phone system with recordings. That was fun.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
mark sweet: You know.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.000
mark sweet: Uh, we found out that issue uh 2 of the modules kind of screwed up. So that was our issue last week. Trying to figure out why our phone systems kept failing.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
mark sweet: Uh, and it turned out that that was the reason. So um! That was fun.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Tina Marie: How did they fail?

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
mark sweet: And we. Uh, basically it ran out of memory.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Tina Marie: So like, were you not able to make calls or receive calls like, what did that look like for you? Wow!

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
mark sweet: Yes. Yeah, um bad? In the short answer.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000
mark sweet: So we had to just basically quickly dump all the recordings, which is fine. I mean, we'll have more recordings. Uh, but that was our quick solution to.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
mark sweet: Prevents the issue from lingering. Uh. There was supposed to be a module that takes care of this, that. Uploads it to a separate. I think Google, I wanna say Google drive or dropbox. I don't remember which.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
mark sweet: But that didn't work. So um, we are trying to work through how to make this actually like.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.000
mark sweet: Function.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Tina Marie: You have a a cloud based system. It's not a. Phone, like controlled.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Tina Marie: This is. This is not.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
mark sweet: Yes, we have an elastics based cloud based system because. From day one I wanted to have the entire building burned down.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
mark sweet: Could hand everyone a new laptop, and they could work at like 85 to 90% of what they were before.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:27.000
mark sweet: So I try to make sure as much of it is as redundant as possible. Something happens, we can fix it from wherever and move wherever.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:35.000
mark sweet: And not rely on like Ringcentral, who is gonna charge us. 4 times as much, and do a way crappier job.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that wouldn't have been what I was thinking. I've been like Lucent, or Ryan, or whatever they're called, like the physical.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000
mark sweet: We've tried like grasshopper. We tried some of the other ones, and the problem is. Every phone system will go down at some point, but just all do.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That is.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
mark sweet: And then, when you cannot fix it or do anything, it's. 10 times more frustrating.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.000
mark sweet: Then. Us being able to at least just like go into the system and just have all the calls go to like the after hours, call center, or whatever we need to do.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
mark sweet: In the meantime, while we try to figure it out. Um.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
mark sweet: It's definitely more work. But I yeah, I didn't see another way around it.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Tina Marie: Um in in the future. Do you have. Human in the loop kind of thing, checking capacity, making sure that.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Tina Marie: If you're approaching a danger zone, that things are happening.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
mark sweet: That got added to Isaac's list. Yes.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:41.000
mark sweet: Module was supposed to handle it, but I guess Paul didn't do it right. So that was one of the modules. Remember, we were working on for a exorbitant amount of time.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It still failed.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
mark sweet: Technology.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Tina Marie: That. Well, that's why the conversation about pacing and why we don't wait forever to get something started happens because. It. It never goes right the 1st time.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Tina Marie: It's an iterative process. You learn something when things go wrong, you know.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Tina Marie: Everything takes a while to grow. And establish, and to get to the point of maintenance where.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Tina Marie: You know, things aren't as difficult. Takes a lot of building, and you you can't do all the things all the time. So.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Yeah. Um. That's why it's important not to procrastinate important things. Because.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
mark sweet: But on the good news front Patsy is apparently coming back tomorrow.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: The.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Dan Ryan: Say she's pregnant.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000
mark sweet: I don't know. I like I stopped believing it, but apparently she's supposed to come back tomorrow, she told the staff. She's coming back tomorrow, so I assume she's coming back tomorrow.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Dan Ryan: Damn!

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:50.000
mark sweet: Um. And the 1st thing I'm gonna do is have her listen in on calls before jumping on anything else or anything, and start doing the grading, so we'll just do it manually inside. For the 1st couple of weeks.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
mark sweet: Because I don't want her to see how far they've. Gotten better or worse since she's been out.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Tina Marie: Will be interesting, too, to see how. In tune she is to it. Um, because being away from it like.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Tina Marie: You know how much. Degradation has happened mentally. She's been gone for months.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Tina Marie: That significant.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
mark sweet: Yep. But fresh eyes.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Tina Marie: Reduced fresh eyes like I get your point. But I don't know that you're fully taking into account how much gets lost. Hopefully, it will actually be a good way to get her. Um.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Tina Marie: You know, revved up. Faster, but.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tina Marie: That's why. The big issue is with us schools, and why? Um, why, other countries don't take a summer break.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Tina Marie: Because so much is lost. If you don't use it, you lose it. That's that's real. Ah! So.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Tina Marie: Just. Consider that and take it into account, and maybe even watch it.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Tina Marie: And see how you can evaluate that.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000
mark sweet: If they all come back as 5 out of 5. Yeah, that's.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
mark sweet: Oh! Good.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Tina Marie: Well, and if she doesn't have really great specifics to that are valuable. But also Patsy wasn't.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Tina Marie: The best, anyway, right.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
mark sweet: Correct, but. If we go down the sheet to check in right of all the different things they're supposed to do.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
mark sweet: Let's see how they're doing compared to the sheet like it. That's just a yes or a no.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Tina Marie: How did Patsy do on the sheet. Before.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
mark sweet: Uh! Well, she was the best one.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay, that that's helpful. That's good. Um! What's up with Gert? Dan?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Dan Ryan: What's up with it?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
mark sweet: Do you know, dirt is slang now? Apparently in like Gen. Alpha language.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Dan Ryan: 4.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
mark sweet: Oh!

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Dan Ryan: It's a bad thing, I take it.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:13.000
mark sweet: It's a common term. Let's see. Currently means great.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, well, there you go! We'll let Kurt know.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Tina Marie: That's not new, though.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Dan Ryan: I've never heard it.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Tina Marie: I've had teenagers for over 10 years.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It's an ironic slang term and spinoff of the Gert yo meme.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:40.000
mark sweet: It means doing something that's very smart, but also very dangerous. So. Yep. Now you know.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, uh.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
mark sweet: You'll never look at great the same again.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Tina Marie: The last update that we had was uh, that cannot be right. I had to have it on a different line. Sometimes I had a couple.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, the cleanup!

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. A um march.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Dan Ryan: They're doing it. I thought we were doing it. They're doing it. So I was like, Oh, yeah, you can do it. That's great.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Tina Marie: That's great. That's the wrong thing. Where's it's in there. Oh, yeah, 3, 24.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Tina Marie: Still hasn't got his 1,000 1,000 posts from Gert. Gert is going to send the first.st 1,000 posts to remove like. That's the last update I had March 24.th

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Dan Ryan: Yep. So they did send it, and they are removing them.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Dan Ryan: And I said, that works for me.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh Jesus!

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Dan Ryan: So they'll do a thousand. They're basically gonna do batches of a thousand. They might go higher, but.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Dan Ryan: Thousands need to be removed. Like.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Dan Ryan: If not tens of thousands.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
mark sweet: Yeah, as we got like a hit this weekend from a 2020 blog.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Tina Marie: So what? What's the last.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Tina Marie: What's. What's the last update that you got, and how many had been removed.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! Stacy actually does that? Let me show you.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Dan Ryan: Stacy gets all the SEO updates.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Dan Ryan: Let me go see, but I have access to their thingy, though. There we go!

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Tina Marie: Also. You have 4 min till you have to go on your call while you're looking that up. Mark.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Dan Ryan: Are you?

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Tina Marie: Colorado.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
mark sweet: Link. Yes.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
mark sweet: What about it?

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Tina Marie: Um. The.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Tina Marie: Is everything done for you to start sending. Are getting cases there.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
mark sweet: Just about um. We're still in the ghost. Fees, of trying to get other.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:50.000
mark sweet: Uh, what's it called other retainers. So we can know what we need to add to our retainer. So America's working on that today. She's given me. 2. So far I'm trying to get 3 or 4.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000
mark sweet: Just to see everything, and then. My goals have it done like by the end of the week.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
mark sweet: It should be done relatively soon. But I'd like to get that going and started.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Tina Marie: And is Walker gonna be where you get the 1st cases.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
mark sweet: Uh we're gonna ask Walker, monkey and.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Tina Marie: Or.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:22.000
mark sweet: Quantify if they can give us some volume. Cause we've already got. We've got agape and Fuji there, so at least we can always use them if we need to.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Tina Marie: Remember last week we're looking at, litify, and it looked like your cases were taking longer.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:35.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Tina Marie: And not just to close, which would have been self-imposed because of your process. But also to settlement.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Tina Marie: Did you. Talk to your attorneys about that. Did you see what they're noticing?

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000
mark sweet: We did. We talked about it at length. On our Wednesday meeting.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay, tell me.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
mark sweet: There's a couple different parts of it. One, was.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
mark sweet: The. Do believe that some of the cases are taking longer because we're getting more higher value cases.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
mark sweet: Which. I'm trying to go through all the data to see if it's actually true or not.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
mark sweet: Um have been some some large ones lately, which is good, but.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Tina Marie: Got it.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:27.000
mark sweet: You know. The the question is always on the smaller ones, the 2 fifties, the 100 plus. Those are going to take more time, and I get it, and it's fine.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
mark sweet: Um. But the smaller cases should be turned quick.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:43.000
mark sweet: Uh. They also complain that they have a large caseload, and so. We had that discussion of, do we need more teams? Or can you guys handle it? And of course they want to handle it on their own.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
mark sweet: So. We'll see, but that doesn't make me uh.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:56.000
mark sweet: Jump up and down. But they are cognizant of it, and we're working to try to push it through much more quickly.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Tina Marie: So. Okay, so did you set the parameters for? Okay, if you want to handle it, here's how you have to handle it. Number one, we don't get longer. We go, you know. Cases get handled within whatever last year's average was, or, better not, this new average.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Tina Marie: So. You could say, Okay, I hear what you want.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Tina Marie: But unless you can perform at this level. We're getting a new pod, which means you're getting less cases, which means your, you know, commissions whatever are going down.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.000
mark sweet: Correct.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you have to define what those numbers are, and. We'll have that conversation. But.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tina Marie: Did you discover anything that might point out? Why. While everybody else's increased at a particular pace. Lorenz's was better.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
mark sweet: Um, partly because. Last year's.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
mark sweet: Lorenz. Had taken over a lot of cases from when I was handling them.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
mark sweet: And those had obviously set out for quite a bit of time, so his was. I won't say artificially high.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:07.000
mark sweet: But there was definitely part of that, because of what he took over versus where he's at now, which I don't think any of them. Maybe there's like 2.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
mark sweet: That were.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Tina Marie: Wait. So your cases take longer or less.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
mark sweet: When I started it it was definitely taking more time, and then we brought him in, got him up to speed with everything else going on.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So so that actually makes his stats even better than they are. Here's my point.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Tina Marie: Everybody's. Um.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tina Marie: Time to close and settle got longer, but proportionately Lorenz's got less longer. Even, and and apparently it should have been skewed the other way, because he had longer cases.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Tina Marie: So what is he doing differently? That's making his stats better.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
mark sweet: Hmm! I don't think you're following what I'm saying.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Tina Marie: I must not be.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
mark sweet: Listen, everyone.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Dan. It's 1 on one.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
mark sweet: What I'm saying is his. Last year. Was.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
mark sweet: A little bit higher. So it's.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
mark sweet: We're trying to compare 2 different things.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tina Marie: Uh. Yeah, it's still not getting clear to me.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Tina Marie: Cause. We're we're tracking.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Tina Marie: Um average. Time to close.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Tina Marie: An average time to settle. Across the same period for everybody.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Tina Marie: And across that same period everybody's time has increased. But, like Samantha's, increased by 40 days, somebody else increased by 60 days, and Lorenz only increased by 20 days.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tina Marie: So. He he didn't get as.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Tina Marie: He didn't. He's not taking as much time as everybody else in terms of the increase of time. Even with the increased Caseload.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
mark sweet: Right, but he's still higher than.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Tina Marie: What am what am I missing.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
mark sweet: The other people.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Tina Marie: Higher, yes.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
mark sweet: So if we look at like average resolution speed by team. Is that 359.5.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Tina Marie: So. But I'm looking at trajectory right.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
mark sweet: Right.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Tina Marie: Evolving or regressing. He's improving.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Tina Marie: There's still something different. I mean, we we. Do. And and the and I'll go back to what Dan got from the AI of people saying nobody's contacting them. That, specifically, is an issue that we've been addressing. That's specifically an issue that has.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Tina Marie: A. Correlation to how fast the cases get resolved, because.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Tina Marie: Things were getting neglected. All I'm trying to find out is is that getting managed on the rest of your teams? I would bet that it's not.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Tina Marie: If you want your cases to be solved faster, it needs to be done.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
mark sweet: Yes, and so the 1st step is, they have to know about it right if they don't know about it, because they're not thinking about it, they. Can't begin to make changes on it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
mark sweet: So.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000
mark sweet: Last. Weeks conversation was more. This is what we're seeing. This is what's going on this year versus last year.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Tina Marie: Which is what is this?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
mark sweet: That we're taking longer, and we're getting less.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
mark sweet: Those are bad. Bad trends.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Tina Marie: And then.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
mark sweet: So. Of course they're like no, no blah blah blah blah! They always have an excuse. It's.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.000
mark sweet: The numbers are what the numbers are. And yes, I understand. We're only through the first, st you know, 4 months, or whatever of the year.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
mark sweet: But. It's a worrying trend.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
mark sweet: So what can we do to bring this. Far down.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
mark sweet: And by far I mean, what can we do to turn it faster? What can we do to. Increase our average attorney fee.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Tina Marie: And what was the response?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
mark sweet: Well, the 1st thing they did was blame second voice for taking longer.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Tina Marie: Are you kidding me.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
mark sweet: Nope. Of course it's what they blamed. Why does that surprise you?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay? What else?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
mark sweet: The 30 ish cases that we did second voice for is what slowed everything down. Of course.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
mark sweet: So I got annoyed at that answer. Um.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Tina Marie: If we track data better, this would be so easy to just go and pull it. And like I said, we need to have a column and lidify that marks second voice, because then we could go. Just take those.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
mark sweet: Very good.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Tina Marie: And go see what the average is for those, and be like bullshit. This is why we've got to have better structure of the data and better organizing of it. But, anyway, what else did they say?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
mark sweet: Um. That they have a bunch of big cases coming, and that's gonna help change the shift, which I mean, there is.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
mark sweet: Truth, to that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Tina Marie: Actually let me get to this. Did anybody say. What they do to handle cases and push them through quickly.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
mark sweet: No.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Tina Marie: See any problem with that.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
mark sweet: Lots of them.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Tina Marie: What are you going to do about it?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000
mark sweet: How much. Cause you can't do anything about it, because then they leave. And then we have other problems.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Tina Marie: Why? I beg to differ.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Tina Marie: Lorenz didn't.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Tina Marie: Why, why, why would they leave? If you're showing them how to handle things better? This is a management issue, but it doesn't mean that nobody's willing to do it, Mark. It just means that maybe they don't know.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Tina Marie: How to do it, and they haven't seen it. So Lorenzo's team pushed back for a little bit, but as soon as they saw. How much easier it made it. Then they got on board.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Tina Marie: Have you at least talked to him about his process, and what's happening and what has happened for his team?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
mark sweet: No.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Tina Marie: Why not?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
mark sweet: I don't know. Because right now I'm still pissed at him about last week's thing or week and a half.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Tina Marie: I get that. But before that even happened like you're paying, and I I need the bunny. I want you to keep paying me for the coaching like you're paying for this. Don't you want to know?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Tina Marie: What you're getting out of it like like that. That's what's actually making an impact. What it's like on his team like. Don't you want to talk to him and know.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Tina Marie: From his perspective. What's actually happening as a result of it, I've brought it up several times. Hey, we should have a conversation show you what's happening. Um.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Tina Marie: You know, like I don't. You're making these investments for a purpose. I think they're working. But don't you want to know.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Tina Marie: For yourself, and find out. And especially if there is something that's working that you could roll out to the rest of your team, even if it didn't mean me talking to them. You could just.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Tina Marie: Take it. Um. It doesn't have to be extra expense or time.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Tina Marie: But if you've got something working that you're already paying for, wouldn't you want to. Spread that to the rest of the the company.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Tina Marie: Hudson's crying at the door. Want to see you get.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Tina Marie: More out of what you already have you you. I know it's all on you.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Tina Marie: But. I'm not asking you for a lot.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
mark sweet: It just feels like every time. I just don't know. I'm frustrated.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Tina Marie: I know, but.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:25.000
mark sweet: Because it's just. It's just. The answer is constantly just shut the fuck up and let them do what they're doing because they're hitting their goals, and everything's working. That's just constantly what it feels like.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Tina Marie: That. That cannot be the way to manage your company.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Tina Marie: Because that's not you meant.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
mark sweet: But at the end of the day, if they are hitting their goals and they're hitting their metrics. Then why am I really really complaining?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
mark sweet: I'm trying to make them better. Yes, but like, how much can I really complain if you're hitting what my expectations of you are.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Tina Marie: Well. Hold on. Let me let this dog in because he's losing his mind.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
mark sweet: But I actually do need to get those agapes here. And they're waiting for me. But yeah.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Tina Marie: You know that all I want to do is help you get what you wanted to get, but I feel like there's conflicting. Goals. Stop. Sorry.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Tina Marie: I know you have to go.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
mark sweet: It's fine. Let's touch base when you have a little more time.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yes.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
mark sweet: Because I don't wanna rush this conversation either.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Tina Marie: Alright. Well, you tell me when you've got some time, and let's try to come up with something that doesn't feel like it's. Stressing you out and adding more to your plate, or or conflicting with.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Tina Marie: What you've got to do. But still helping you grow, because if the solution is.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Tina Marie: Ignore them because they're hitting goals. You're not going to grow. And then I don't know what we're doing, but.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Tina Marie: I want to know, and I want to know how to help you without making it feel like it's more stressful.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
mark sweet: We'll get there.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Tina Marie: Let me know. Okay.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
mark sweet: Okay? Bye.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Tina Marie: Talk to you. Bye.
