WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Jim zoom just shut down. I'm so sorry you have to call back.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Tina Marie: Hi! So sorry!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
mark sweet: I'm here. Don't know if Shawn is back yet.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Tina Marie: I know. Sorry. Are you hurting a lot today?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
mark sweet: No, that's what it is.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tina Marie: I'm sorry. Jonah. Huh!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
mark sweet: Oh, they should join back up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Tina Marie: Here she is! I am so sorry about that. I switched back to my computer and I was off on my phone. And then so anyway.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Pain Management: It's okay. I I was like blabbering.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Tina Marie: That was. No, you weren't. It was it was good. You're going through so much, and Maria is overwhelmed, and for her to be working in a psych hospital, and this to be overwhelming. And you guys even aren't at capacity yet like this is.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Pain Management: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Tina Marie: Let me. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Pain Management: Yeah, so I we can fill the I mean, I I'm really in a pressure to find someone. Now. I wanted to. I talked to Maria. We need to find someone now, but.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Pain Management: I don't post anything like I I told Dr. E. Is on board on it, and Dr. E. Is like, you know, it's very hard to find someone. So now. I don't even know if, because right now, Dr. E. Recently um.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Pain Management: Hire this company in Mexico to help us. With phone calls. So I don't know if I should utilize that, maybe because he did mention that one time we need one person, he said, do you need one person to help you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Pain Management: It's like I'm not sure I I feel I need one. Maybe I really don't. But Mark is telling me this. I don't know if Mark is here.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, he's here.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Pain Management: But he told me, honey, remember the 3 people you told me.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Pain Management: Oh, you! Busy.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
mark sweet: No, you just let this is your meeting, so I'm let you kind of steer it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Pain Management: Um. So. Um, you said. I will need Maria for more of the high end.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Pain Management: Um stuff. In.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:32.000
mark sweet: Hold on, let's real quick. So what we were talking about was structuring, moving forward as she continues to grow, and. How to put the right people in the right seats and what she might need to be able to not go out of her mind. Basically.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Pain Management: Yeah, so, yeah.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
mark sweet: And so go ahead.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Tina Marie: Well, just off the bat. Um! If phones are overwhelming.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Tina Marie: Phones is a lower level. Skill. Depending on what is happening on the phones. Right? So if there's not a medical assessment, if they're not taking.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tina Marie: Subjective notes right? If you can get somebody who can do the scheduling. That doesn't require that you have a nurse that doesn't require Maria's level skills.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Tina Marie: So as you start to grow segmenting the roles. Um, and having defined seats, helps. 1st of all, it makes hiring a lot easier.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Tina Marie: When you don't have to hire, you know. Somebody with extra qualifications and experience.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tina Marie: To handle a task that maybe takes. 10 or 15, or 20 or 30 HA week.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tina Marie: So if we start to break it down by. Um! How much time is actually spent.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Tina Marie: Scheduling or doing something that doesn't require medical knowledge or can be trained, but doesn't require medical. Experience. Um, that would be the fastest way to do it, because the more.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Tina Marie: Qualifications. You need to hire somebody. The longer it takes to find.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Tina Marie: And hire that person, and fill that seat. Although and this is important.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Tina Marie: Um. Th. Those types of qualifications aren't the only thing that. Can make a hire, good or bad.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tina Marie: Um. You want to make sure that whoever's doing the hiring is hiring for stability. Somebody who shows up consistently somebody that you guys have a good personality match in chemistry with. That is incredibly important. Culture values, these types of things.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Tina Marie: Uh, but it's still easier to find somebody who has all of those matches. With that. Don't have the um other, you know, qualifications right of of a degree or experience in nursing, or whatever.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Tina Marie: Than it is with somebody who's got that. On top of it. So do we have any idea how much time is being spent on the particular types of activities throughout the week.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Pain Management: So. So I was thinking not more of.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Pain Management: Cause I. This is where I'm stuck at, because we do. I I feel like I need someone who's versatile in a way, Maria, but not at doesn't have to be a nurse.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Pain Management: It can be a medical assistant, I guess. What I'm trying to say is. For example. Um.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Pain Management: We will have procedures. And.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Pain Management: If it gets busy and. Not if I guess I guess when it gets busy I wanted to make sure that.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Pain Management: That person is on top of Dr. E. On top of the patients. Having procedure, make sure they show up, make sure they have a follow up appointment, and Dr. E. Is doing the notes, because these are the higher. Stuff. So this person is not just gonna be answering phone calls, but someone who is.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Pain Management: Also Available. For to come into the office. If there are procedures.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Tina Marie: So let's talk about that. Just for a second. If you want somebody who's going to help you make sure that Dr. E. Is getting his stuff done, you need somebody who is not shy.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Tina Marie: And who is not afraid to tell the truth and say what is needed. That generally is not going to be a younger person.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Tina Marie: Um. So those are the things to keep in mind that when you're having the conversation with this person, you need to be able to gauge their willingness to just say what needs to be said. So you'll need to formulate your questions in a way that can reveal that characteristic. Does that make sense.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Pain Management: Yeah, so, yeah, so this is actually, what. Mark is saying that this procedure person also needs to be personable in a way, because.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Pain Management: Juani, what did you say again. Like the way you have a term.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
mark sweet: So what I'm thinking is, there's.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000
mark sweet: 3 people in total she needs. She has Maria, which is probably the hardest position to fill. She needs someone who's going to physically be at the Huntington Beach location, where the procedures are done.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
mark sweet: So that person is responsible for making sure that the patient. Doesn't leave for lack of a better term.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
mark sweet: Is put in the room promptly. And.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
mark sweet: That that part just goes smoothly because they're gonna get busier and busier on procedures as time goes on.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
mark sweet: And so procedures are important. That's also the highest.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
mark sweet: Literal pain, point. Um and figure pain point in this because people are freaked out to get injections.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:21.000
mark sweet: They're not freaked out to have a telemed appointment. Generally they're freaked out to have an injection. So it's someone who's personable who can report. If there's an issue, who can do whatever.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Pain Management: Click on the.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
mark sweet: They may need to do to make sure the person's procedure goes smoothly, and also. To some of a wrangle. Dr. E.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000
mark sweet: That could be just telling him in the morning. Hey? You've got these appointments or the day before, because he's not going to miss out on money. The second person is Maria.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:51.000
mark sweet: Who I would see transition to doing. The background for the client, the histories. Where's the pain? Everything else? So when Tona jumps on a zoom call, that's a 10 or 15 min call instead of a 30 min. Call.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
mark sweet: Because it's already pre-filled out. 3rd person is a scheduler. That's the person calling getting people on the schedule.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.000
mark sweet: So, following up, making sure that they're going to show up. Uh, you know, the night before the day of whatever that may be, calling, getting it set on the schedule. That is probably the lowest.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.000
mark sweet: Uh capacity person meaning it doesn't have to be someone super smart, just someone who can pick up the phone and schedule. So someone detail oriented. I agree with you. It's someone who's gonna be personable, someone who also knows that, hey?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
mark sweet: I've gotta make sure I get these things done for Chona in the office, and Chona's not in the office. She's gonna be surrounded by other people who are gonna be maybe not.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
mark sweet: Always super friendly to her or him, whoever that person may be. Um, but that person can also help with scheduling. If there's downtime.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
mark sweet: Or follow up.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tina Marie: Actually. So, speaking of gender, something to think about is that. Um.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tina Marie: Th. There's multiple things to think about it. And obviously, you know you, you have to be. You can't reveal that you're looking for male or female.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Tina Marie: But something to consider is a male might be less.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Tina Marie: Concerned with um. Female judgment might be less pressured.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Pain Management: Sounds good uh.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tina Marie: In the office situation. Might not have as much of an issue pushing back on Dr. E. And I realize there's 2 different roles that we're talking about, and the rule pushing back on Dr. E. To get stuff done is not the the scheduler.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Tina Marie: But that it is something to think about in terms of kind of balancing out. Your your team and the energies.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Tina Marie: As to how you feel that I don't necessarily have an opinion that it should be male. I'm just saying it is something to consider where they're going to be, who they're going to be working with.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Tina Marie: And what is the best likelihood of success for that person being where they're going to be. In the situation and the role and the environment that they're going to be in.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Pain Management: You know, I just haven't like an idea. And. Because we were talking about this, that scheduler, that person who answers the phone and maybe help us with that email as well.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Pain Management: Doesn't need to be here, cause I know Dr. E. Already mentioned this he recently hired that. Um answering whatever company from Mexico.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Pain Management: I wonder if we could just use that person from there who? I don't know how they're gonna be able to answer the phone hunt with the grasshopper. But then we will also train them with.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Pain Management: Answering emails, just saying. Answering emails and have access. Do do we want? We want them to have access on the Google sheet because they're gonna input it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Pain Management: Right, and then the person, this person that will be on the procedure will be in person. So I just need Maria. And then this person, another person for procedure, and.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Pain Management: Does that make sense? Am I articulating it? Well.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
mark sweet: I understand what you're saying. I just wouldn't rely on a 3rd party necessarily, because they don't have your interest at heart, and just.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Pain Management: Hmm.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Pain Management: That's true.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
mark sweet: Assuming that a 3rd party. Call center in Mexico can do what you need, or take your direction, or be able to do what you need them to do.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
mark sweet: The chance of success in my mind is relatively low. They're really good for.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Pain Management: Oh, it's true!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:28.000
mark sweet: Calling out, getting someone on the phone and transferring it over. They're good at taking messages. Those things you can do for an after hours type call center, and they're fine for that. But I I wouldn't rely on.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Mhm.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
mark sweet: I could be wrong. I mean, this stuff's come a long way, but.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Pain Management: No, I no, I agree. No, no, no, I agree. I okay. I erase that.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Tina Marie: So can I weigh in on this real quick.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
mark sweet: Yes, cause you. You're way better at this stuff than I.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Tina Marie: Well, so one of the things you can always make iterations and change the team according to what you want, but because your.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
mark sweet: Let's reaction.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Tina Marie: So. And I also, there are multiple currencies that we're that we're dealing with. And it's always important to take these into account. So we're always exchanging this for that, and it could be multiple. This is for that. And I'll give you an example. Right? So. A lot of times. We'll invest something because it saves us time, or we'll invest in something because it gives us energy or we'll invest in something because it makes us happy, right? And the other thing is we'll invest in something because it makes us money. So time, energy, happiness, money.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Tina Marie: Um. You could call it health. But health is really about energy also, and happiness. So we're making these different exchanges. So when we invest in something, let's say it costs a little bit more money to one currency, right? Money.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Tina Marie: To get somebody who is um, you know, in Mexico, and they they cost us money.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
mark sweet: That's true.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Tina Marie: But one of the other currencies, then, is energy. So. When you have somebody who doesn't have your best interest at heart, and you have to go clean up their mess. That takes time. That takes energy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Tina Marie: Right. So you're paying. A different currency. Not just money.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Tina Marie: In hiring that person. So my point is that when when we make a hire, you want to take all those currencies into account. In terms of what you're outputting versus what you're getting back. You want to get back.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Tina Marie: As much as you can for your investment. So if you hire somebody who.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Tina Marie: Is loyal, is consistent. Has. Your back is accessible, you can look them in the eyes right? All of those different types of things have an impact on how well they perform.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tina Marie: Um! How much you have to clean up after them. How easy you can explain something to them, demonstrate something to them, establish a relationship all of these different types of things. It is not impossible, remotely.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Tina Marie: Um. It just takes longer to do. So, taking those things into account, and knowing that you're in a in a season of building.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Tina Marie: And overwhelm is a big issue, right? So speaking, of energy, overwhelm, drains, energy. What you need to do is is grow and increase and protect.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Tina Marie: Energy. So one of the things to be considering with anybody that you're hiring right now is. Of these hires when you're looking at the person, and you're looking at how much you're going to be paying.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Tina Marie: I need you to think about your return in different ways. Of just you know what what is going to help you build in the business in terms of.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Tina Marie: Um, just being able to satisfy the the growth requirements, but also what it will take from you in managing this person. Are they going to be able to hold their own. Are they going to be able to problem, solve.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Tina Marie: Are they going to be somebody that you have to continually work to manage? Or do you pay a little bit more money. For somebody who, just, you know, runs everything by themselves eventually, like sooner rather than later, that type of thing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Tina Marie: So when you're looking at filling these positions, I want you to think about all of those things. And what is going to.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Tina Marie: Help you with overwhelm the most, because right now our biggest risk, our biggest threat. Is you deciding that you're not in anymore. Right? So early in the beginning, you're like, I just have to just do it. And then you keep coming to that. So we know that you're in.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Tina Marie: But what happens is psychologically. The question comes up again.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Tina Marie: Am I in, or am I out right? The door is open. You could do this, or you could not. But if you constantly have to face that question, or allow yourself to face that question, then it's going to continue to.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Tina Marie: Drain your energy so. That's something to take into account right now. So that is the biggest threat is the overwhelm.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Tina Marie: Might cause you to question, am I doing this? Is it worth it?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Pain Management: That. That's what I'm worried for, Maria. I don't want her to get overwhelmed, and in turn I notice I find myself.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Pain Management: Like being how do not say like over extending in terms of. That's fine. Just go ahead and do that, and I'll you know I'll get it.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Pain Management: So instead of you know. So that's. And I'm not getting efficient.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: So if we can protect her, if we can protect her, overwhelm also with a lower level person who takes some things off her plate that doesn't need to be her. And now you can preserve her and protect her right? So because she's an asset that is worth protecting.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Yes.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yeah. So that's how we want to look at this hiring is what can return this protection that takes away 2 of the biggest threats we have. You not showing up, or Maria not showing up, because then there's there's nothing to worry about. There's no business.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Pain Management: Right. I mean it. So then I think the most important need right now is.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Pain Management: Going to be able to. Um do the scheduling.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Pain Management: The answering of emails. And um.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Pain Management: Also the. In person follow up on that procedure.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Pain Management: That's why in my head. I I need someone that's closer to Orange County cause um, Maria lives far.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Pain Management: And it's fine. I don't need her to be in person. I just need her to kind of manage the back end. But hm!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Um. Something I was thinking about also is, I don't. I don't know who's going to do the hiring, but.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Tina Marie: Because of these things that are important. It is important that whoever's doing the hiring is taking to account everything that matters to you. So you should have a.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Pain Management: That. That's me. Yeah, I'm I'll be the. I'll be the one doing the hiring and.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Pain Management: Um. Mark and I were thinking about this, whether to let it go through. My Llc. Or Dr. East.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Pain Management: Like, we're kind of.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.000
mark sweet: So let me talk about that one a little bit. Um, just to fill out some of the information. So. An option. And I learned this because we're doing this one of the attorneys here. Uh, it just made a lot of sense. That's why I brought it to Chon was.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:25.000
mark sweet: There's a lot now of solopreneur. Payroll companies and everything else that are just designed for smaller businesses. Um, that aren't super expensive and massive headaches.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:40.000
mark sweet: Part of the issue with Dr. E. Is he offers basically 0 benefits? No, no retirement, no medical, no really anything. And you and I both know that to try to attract our quality people and to get them to stay.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:53.000
mark sweet: Offering health insurance, offering potentially retirement benefits. But really, really, health insurance is more key than anything else. Is huge, and so Chona has the the opportunity.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
mark sweet: Um, which I think would be fantastic to. Have her Llc.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
mark sweet: Have payroll so that way she can hire these people under her own Llc. So they. Don't even have a question who they report to.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
mark sweet: So very simple. They report to Chona because they work for Chona. 2. She can offer other benefits or incentives.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
mark sweet: That Dr. E. Can't offer in his current business, because he couldn't just offer it to certain people and not other people. He can offer incentives, but he can't offer, you know, health insurance to only 2 people right.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
mark sweet: You'd have to offer it to everyone. So this would be a good tool for Chona to be able to.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
mark sweet: Hire and retain higher quality. People.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tina Marie: Right? Um. And speaking of those currencies, you know, energy, time, training, people having to replace people. Um anything that you can do to.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Tina Marie: Increase your odds of being able to keep the person right because they're doing the right thing. The best thing. They're happy. Uh, you wanna make that decision for sure. So it sounds like owning it and doing it yourself is the best way to go.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Tina Marie: With a source or tool like that. What do you call it? Resource? One of those companies.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah. And they're relatively easy to set up. The only thing that's somewhat new for Shona is, gonna be, you know, they have to. Give their hourly like. They have to give their hours, which is.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
mark sweet: Unique, I guess, but it's not a huge deal.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Tina Marie: No, not at all.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:33.000
mark sweet: Um. And again, these systems are really easy to do online and everything. So as long as the money comes from Dr. E. To pay these people, which that's a separate little bit of a hiccup. Um. Then this should work very, very smoothly.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Pain Management: Wait. When you say this hunt. Are you saying that he needs to pay? It's just gonna go through me. To pay this person.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
mark sweet: That's probably the easiest way to think about it.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Pain Management: But what is the benefit to him? What I mean? I just wanted to make sure.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Tina Marie: The benefit to him is that you're still running this business that makes him money, and you're running it well, so it keeps making him money, and better and better money.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
mark sweet: It gives you more flexibility because you can offer them health insurance, which I guarantee uses some. Maria cares a lot about.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
mark sweet: That he can't offer, because you'd have to offer it to everyone.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Pain Management: Okay, let me uh, it's still very ironic to me that it's a healthcare.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
mark sweet: Agreed.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Pain Management: Company, and whatever. I guess this is more. I don't know if this is the conversation now that we're doing while we're growing, I'm I'm kind of like all over the place on this. It I don't know if it's the priority. My priority right now is just to find someone right away.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:40.000
mark sweet: I think you're gonna have an easier time trying to find someone. If you have these things that you can offer them. Rather than just. Here's $21 an hour, because they can make more working at Panda express quite frankly.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Tina Marie: Right. Right, and you don't want just a person in a seat. You want the right person in the right seat. That makes a huge difference.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Pain Management: Right. No, no, I agree. I agree. That's why I know I got lucky on Maria.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Pain Management: I I just I needed.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Pain Management: Um.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000
mark sweet: But also, how long is more? You're gonna stick around if she needs health benefits and she's got her Lvn. It's great that she got some work from home.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Pain Management: And her her hourly is very, you know, low.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
mark sweet: It's kind of low.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Tina Marie: Plus if she's burned out. She may love you to death, but that's not going to be enough to keep her, especially with a new baby.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Pain Management: Right. That's that's what I.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:29.000
mark sweet: I mean, that was always a big thing that I wanted was people to be happy and healthy. That's why we offer, you know, the 4 1 k division, the dental, the health insurance. Because I want people to be focused at work and not worried about these other things.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Pain Management: Bye. Yeah. And and like, recently, Mark had a free tickets for this very famous.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Pain Management: Mexican Band. And give it to my.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, you told me about that.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
mark sweet: I didn't have free tickets. I pay for those tickets. But yes.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Pain Management: Big yeah.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
mark sweet: Yeah, they're free to you. But yes.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Pain Management: No, I mean it's. So Mark I mean Maria and her husband. She showed me the video. The 2 of them are having fun. So it's like, that's good um, but it's you know. Again.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Pain Management: I know that. She mentioned this to me, that I think the reason why she took this to is because she likes working with me.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Pain Management: And and I don't want her to burn. Get burned out like you said. It doesn't matter how I I just. I don't want her to get burned out, so I. I always kind of like, but she's she's very good, but.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Pain Management: I'm just yeah, worried.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Tina Marie: Well as a new mom. She's going to find out where her threshold is, and it may be she could wake up one day and be like. This is the breaking point. I'm done. And there is no conversation or negotiation. It's totally possible. So you you have enough red flags that you've got to run in front of this as best you can.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Tina Marie: And by protecting her energy. We're protecting your energy.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Pain Management: Okay. Yeah, and I'm talking to her like before I called you like, before this conversation, like I talked to her. I kind of told her. What our plan is. This is, I include her, but I want her to be part of it in terms of if I want to offload this to you. You're going to delegate to this person.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Tina Marie: Right, so.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Pain Management: That's the plan, and he's like it's good to find one. Now, before we get very busy that way, we can train them. Her mindset is like very much.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Pain Management: In sync with mine in terms of you know she's owning it. She's like we have to train them before we get busy. So.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Pain Management: Again. We just really need to protect her. So we need to. Um, I need to find someone. But the thing is I haven't posted anything. I don't even know how. To post. This is indeed.com.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Pain Management: Like. I don't know where to post it, because in my head I'm gonna just find someone like how I found Maria. I'm gonna ask the current people I know.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
mark sweet: And I hate to bring it to you. Just posting isn't gonna get you the person.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Tina Marie: You should, you should go to a firm like Look, because if you get overwhelmed by some of this stuff online and let's go back to the currencies right? There's multiple currencies. So.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Pain Management: Okay, so then.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
mark sweet: Wasn't done.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Tina Marie: You learning how to hire online and where to hire. That's. Time. That's energy. That's additional overwhelm.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Tina Marie: If you've got the resource of money, use the money to go, get somebody else who's already good at this, and tell them exactly what you need give them. A list of negatives cannot be. This cannot be, that cannot be. This. And go get somebody to do the hiring for you according to your requirements. That would be the most leveraged way to go about it.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:35.000
mark sweet: 1, 2, 8. I would also immediately talk to the CEO lady um cause she's actively interviewing so many people right now.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Pain Management: One second.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Tina Marie: To see.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Pain Management: Oh, Carlene!

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Pain Management: It's not, it's not um.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
mark sweet: No, no, no, not not the bad one.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Pain Management: She's not bad. She's just, you know. It's the control. She she like questioned me about the um.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
mark sweet: Okay. It's the one that you can work with and wants to help you, and isn't gonna try to sabotage it.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Pain Management: Yeah, no, she. Yeah, I know it's Carlene. So she she actually just messaged me before again before this call.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Pain Management: She asked. She told me. There's a patient here that doesn't want to see, and a lot of providers, and asked me if I can. See the patient. And I'm like.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Pain Management: What if he doesn't like me too. But anyways, anyways, yes, I can definitely.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Pain Management: Help her, but he doesn't have a lot of. Power that much. It's still.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Pain Management: Um! What's her name?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
mark sweet: Again.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Pain Management: Cheryl.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
mark sweet: The. She's the one doing a lot of the interviews and meeting people she can.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
mark sweet: Say, Hey, this person might be a good fit for you.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000
mark sweet: This again comes into. Why, having your own thing. Makes sense because you're hiring them under your own company.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Pain Management: Okay, so let me.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
mark sweet: So no one else has a say on it, so at least she's out there spending the money.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Tina Marie: That's excuse me.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
mark sweet: Getting a bunch of resumes that's low hanging fruit to potentially get someone. It's not guaranteed. Obviously.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Pain Management: Yeah. Okay. Let me tell text her. Uh he knows. Anyways, she was helping me until I found Maria. No, no, I I meant time. She knows that I was hiring someone, and then Maria comes in. So now I'm gonna have to tell her we need one more person.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000
mark sweet: Knowing and knowing are 2 different things. Straight away.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Pain Management: Um. Okay.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Tina Marie: Just make sure that you are. You have, and this would be good for you all the way through. A very specific set of requirements about who you're hiring, not just what their roles are.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Tina Marie: Um. But the characteristics that you're looking for. And a negative match list of the characteristics that you do not want to have.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Pain Management: Awesome.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Tina Marie: So number one, it will just help make sure that you will have top of mind all of the things that matter when you're making a decision so that you don't get caught up with somebody, maybe who's charismatic. Um, or you just get impatient and be like you know what you'll work that kind of thing.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Tina Marie: And also, if anybody's helping you look, it makes sure that you're on the same page. And that they're looking for the right things and making sure that you don't.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Tina Marie: Um catch something that maybe they're the right in all the right places. But this one thing is a red flag, and we don't want it. Making sure that you don't get that. That's really important.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Tina Marie: So writing it down clearly will help prevent a mishire, and mishires drain you. They take a lot from you financially as well as time and energy. So you really want to make sure that you protect yourself against that.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Pain Management: Mhm. Also do I want this person to come in.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Pain Management: On on the office, or just. Be, you know, also flexible hybrid, you know, like.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Pain Management: Those are the questions. Dr. E. Is buying a new building in Lake Forest, and. It asked me if I want an office there. And before I said No, but now I think we do.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Pain Management: And that person can stay there.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Tina Marie: I think.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
mark sweet: Is that where the procedures are going to be done, moving forward.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Pain Management: It. There will be a procedure sent. Procedure. Area. There there will be, but it's not there yet, but the procedure areas will be in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. So either way, this person will need to be flexible to travel.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Pain Management: Wherever the procedure will be. So.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Pain Management: You know. And and obviously, we're gonna we're doing our best not to. Well, we're not doing. We will make sure that the procedure is not in 2 areas because doctor is not gonna travel to. We have to be mindful of that. We need to.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Pain Management: Take some control. You need to. You need to get a hold of the control as much as we can like.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Pain Management: At one time I traveled 3. Office in one day.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Pain Management: I I can't do that. I'm not gonna do that. So we're gonna have to just.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Pain Management: You know, even though it's a 2 day or 3 day. I mean, we wanted to schedule them within one to 3 days, and what we've been doing is we've been scheduling in them within a day.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Pain Management: Since we. Since we received the email.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
mark sweet: Yeah, 3 days is not a huge deal on the legal side.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I know. Yeah. So now, we wanted to just be careful. And.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Pain Management: Have boundaries.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Tina Marie: So so things to consider that most people don't have conversations about when they're trying to hire um, but especially when it's a small business, and every hire is so critical to the success of your business. Things to take in mind is that you want somebody.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Tina Marie: For the like. A mom with young kids is not going to be great because they're going to be having too many things coming up. Where it's going to keep them from being able to travel.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tina Marie: Um. You don't want somebody who hates commuting. You want somebody who doesn't mind it at all. Maybe it's because they have a smart car that does a lot of the driving for them. Or maybe it's because they love listening to audio books or making phone calls on the way. So you want to have conversations that somehow lean into discovering that and extract that information.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Tina Marie: Um understanding whatever the boundaries are about, what you can ask explicitly. Versus implicitly when it comes to Hr. And not getting sued, and things like that.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Tina Marie: But those are the things that you want to be able to have revealed while you're talking to a person. Do they like. Going to different places, talking to different people being on the road? Or is it something that there's some resistance and friction about? Because the friction is only probably going to get worse. It's not going to get better. But let's just assume that any friction point is is something that we don't want to have.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Tina Marie: So if that person needs to be able to be flexible and travel to different places.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Pain Management: No.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Tina Marie: You need that to be a quality that gets revealed. Immediately in the hiring process.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Pain Management: Right? Okay. We'll make sure I I um. I also like message, Carlene.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Pain Management: And and ask, is I? You're right. I forgot. I forgot that she's the one hiring. People, and.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Tina Marie: You also need Tona, whoever is helping you and having conversations like ultimately, no matter who's helping you, you're going to do the final interviews right.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay, good cause. I'm like anybody else has to be able to even comprehend. The ability and the nuance to have these types of conversations and get to it.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Tina Marie: And I don't. I wouldn't trust to outsource that anyone else.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Pain Management: Like, yeah. I think I'm not gonna be the final. I'm gonna be the 1st one. I I don't want to that no one is just no one is gonna talk to. It will be just me and Maria.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Pain Management: In that meeting. I want Maria to be in that interview. Um even zoom or something, because she's gonna be working closely with this person.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Pain Management: So in in, everyone, so.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Pain Management: Um is. I don't even need Carlene to Carlene. Just need to set up the interview. That's it. She doesn't need to pre. Screen for us.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Pain Management: I don't know. I just wanted to like see right away. But um.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tina Marie: So I was just thinking um a good match might be an older woman that.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Pain Management: I think. Uh-huh.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Tina Marie: Her kids are grown. Um, who's who, just, you know, likes working with other people. Maybe her husband works so she doesn't have to have a lot of money. Um, and really works for the socializing, and to use her skill, and to have some kind of.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Tina Marie: Extra money, play money that way. You're not concerned with. Uh, maybe too much of a good personality match. You've got. Young people spending all their time together can cause.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Tina Marie: Different types of conflicts, you know, workplace romances, even when you're married. Stuff like that happens again. Most people aren't taking these things to account. But it can be issues if there's too much of a good chemistry match between male and female in a small environment.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Tina Marie: But an older woman who maybe likes younger people doesn't want to dominate them, is an old and bitter. That type of thing might just be great support to Maria again if she doesn't have to make the money doesn't have to work, but just enjoys it enjoys traveling and meeting people that would probably be an ideal thing. And I fully believe that if we set intentions with clarity.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Tina Marie: Um. We can find the things that we're looking for. So just kind of ponder and contemplate. You know what would be the perfect person if you could create the perfect person.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Tina Marie: To fill this role. Um, what do they look like and be as specific as possible? Because.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Tina Marie: You're not gonna know that you found them. If you haven't even defined what that is. You know what I mean.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I just noticed that. And I think. Mark, and I remember, honey, when we were looking for that PA.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Pain Management: We didn't have a good experience with. Like older.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Pain Management: Honey, are you there?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
mark sweet: I'm here.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Pain Management: Remember that older um person.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Pain Management: Is, yeah, we didn't have a good experience.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Tina Marie: That's like old, old, but like my age, like my kids, are for the most part grown so.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Pain Management: It's, it's this, it's the same. Older than a little bit older than us. It's like it didn't work out because majority of them are high strung already, and they're obviously mature.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Pain Management: Um, it's very hard. The only thing. Again, it's a personality issue.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Pain Management: This depends obviously on a person. But kind of molding them, and being.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Pain Management: Having that open mind of. Mindset of learning.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
mark sweet: The other thing, too. Tina is like.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
mark sweet: Dr. E's budget is under $23 an hour. So you know, we're gonna be very limited.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Tina Marie: That's what I was saying. Somebody who doesn't.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
mark sweet: The pool.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Tina Marie: Have to work, but wants to. So they would not be like the person that you're describing probably has to work.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Tina Marie: And that's part of why they're bitter, because I'm this old, and I'm making this much money and this sucks blah blah. So I'm talking like.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Pain Management: Yes, I think so.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Tina Marie: And the odds that you find this person. I don't know how great it is, but they increase exponentially when you define that that's. Who it is that you want. They don't have to work, they're doing it because they want to. They enjoy the people, they enjoy the work, and they're just happy to be there.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Tina Marie: Those people exist. They do exist.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Pain Management: Yeah, yeah. I'm sure I'm sure they do. Um. It's just.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Pain Management: Finding them is gonna be.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
mark sweet: Start the interview process. This is gonna take you time.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
mark sweet: You got lucky with Maria, which is great. I'm hoping you get lucky again, but. It's gonna take some time to find the right person.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Pain Management: Yeah, okay? And also like, there's always positives and negatives. Obviously. And you know, and with Mark, obviously, you've seen that Mark had multiple.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Pain Management: Pas that change. Um.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Pain Management: Anyways just have to find that person.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000
mark sweet: You go through people it sucks, I mean, we don't have a ton of turnover. But yeah, finding the right people is hard and then paying them so they don't leave is hard, but.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
mark sweet: At least, if you have control over it versus something else, you can bonus them. How you want to bonus them. You can give whatever perks you want to give.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
mark sweet: Where, if it's under someone else, you're restricted and you gotta go through.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Pain Management: What do you mean like if they're.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
mark sweet: E, or shell, or something else.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Pain Management: If if yeah, if it's with Dr. Ian.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
mark sweet: I'm saying, if you hire them under Chona suite, Llc. Then you can offer whatever you want to offer. You can give whatever bonus you want to give to them and keep the people engaged.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:57.000
mark sweet: If it's under Dr. E. You know he is with payroll and cheryl and everything else. So. You're gonna be restricted in that regard. So this is a way that you take control of what.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:04.000
mark sweet: Happening. And you can keep these people because. Your success. Their success is your success.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000
mark sweet: And vice versa. So you know you want to keep them. Mo. In the right direction is the 1st 9 months of this is just the hardest part.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
mark sweet: Once it gets going it's going. But the 1st 9 months is the hardest part.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Pain Management: You have to talk to the. Have to talk to Dr. E. About.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Pain Management: Cause. He might also want to. Hire them under the.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Pain Management: That incorporated that we have to practice name on.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
mark sweet: He might. I don't think he's gonna care enough. Quite frankly.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Tina Marie: And just remember you don't want to give up any more power to somebody who's not willing to do the work that you're willing to do, and to.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Pain Management: Yeah. He doesn't.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Tina Marie: Build the quality of a that you want to, so I wouldn't go there if you can.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
mark sweet: It's.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Pain Management: Oh, yeah. Cheryl tried like even with Maria. She, you know, did I tell you that she talked to Maria like separately.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Pain Management: And try to impart her knowledge about the. The companies that they work with for lean. Again. It's a control power struggle.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Tina Marie: Mhm yeah, the.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Pain Management: And she tried to do that again recently, right? Honda.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
mark sweet: A subpoena thing.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Pain Management: The Sabina thing, because I told her I didn't ask, for you know we we did the whole practice thing. I did it with tabra, and we have a different practice. Um. I just texted her with Doctor. You, I said. We we have. Uh, I'm.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Pain Management: Bring. I'm I'm adding everyone to have access. So they're like, cause we, it's a new practice name. And she's like, okay, so does does that mean Dr. E. Needs to hire me on that.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Pain Management: New practice. And then also, who's gonna accept the subpoenas like.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you want to create as much um isolation as possible. Be, especially with that. I mean, that's just that's not good business.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Tina Marie: Um and.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Pain Management: And then Dr. A. Is like, Oh, it's fine! And then Mark's like. She asked. She, Cheryl said, you know. Ask your husband? Asked Mark.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Pain Management: Mark told me. That I can technically accept it. But.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Pain Management: It's better if it's just Dr. E.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
mark sweet: Oh, no! Mark! Mark had a much more strong reaction than that.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Pain Management: Again. She's so used.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
mark sweet: Marcus reaction had multiple. 4 letter words.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Pain Management: No, but I mean she's like the one again. She like pride herself as the. The coo basically.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Pain Management: Of the practice, and Dr. E. Needs her. For sure, for this other thing that you're doing.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Pain Management: But not for the lanes.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Tina Marie: If I were to put Cheryl in a house, I'd call it slytherin.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Pain Management: Let's see.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Tina Marie: Like a lot, just.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
mark sweet: There you go! Let's get out of it.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Tina Marie: That's the nicest thing I can say right now. I wouldn't.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:59.000
mark sweet: Again. This all leaves the power back to you in your control, and if God forbid some blows up between you and Doctor E. It's easy enough for you just to go plop down with someone else. That's always what this is. It just gives you the most amount of flexibility. Moving forward. Buried in the story in my mind.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Tina Marie: And you need control to protect your people. So let's say, maybe you get you feel bad somehow. Maybe you think you're being egotistical, or whatever.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Tina Marie: Your ability to protect your house is protecting your people, so if anybody. Is a threat to you and to your people. It has to be mitigated immediately. Dr. E's apathy is a threat.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Tina Marie: Cheryl's. Slitheriness like she's. She's just underhanded a little bit. I'm not going to call her a bad person, but she has qualities that are untrustworthy.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tina Marie: So that is a threat to you and a threat to your people, and maybe you don't care about protecting yourself as much. But I know you want to protect Maria.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Tina Marie: So whatever it takes to make sure that you make the best decisions. You need to build your own house.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Tina Marie: And keep. They can be guests at the door. They can, you know, but they don't get to come in.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I think, I think again, this. New practices that uh.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Pain Management: I didn't see it then, but it's like a power move on my end, because now she didn't know this happened. And now I'm the admin on that side, and I think she's trying to like. Say, but you're a contractor.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Pain Management: You don't. You're not.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that's what she tried to throw in. And then it doesn't matter for this.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Pain Management: Yeah, that's what she's trying.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: No, you're an employee, and I'm a boss. So.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
mark sweet: No, for the subpoena thing. She was trying to throw some at trying to which. Isn't actually true, so it doesn't matter.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, I'm not a fan of Cheryl, so I have to say about that.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Pain Management: Yeah, I I think I'm sure she's not happy that I also cut her daughter very quickly. But I did tell Dr. EI mean I don't mean for Bella to lose her job, and she's like Dr. E. Is like. No, no, I I you know we need people.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Pain Management: I said, that's yeah.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
mark sweet: It all works out.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Pain Management: I'm I'm glad. I'm glad that it happened. I'm glad it happened now. Oh, gosh.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, sooner rather than later.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Pain Management: I'm so glad that it happened. I'm glad that she freaked out, and she freaked out on me.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Pain Management: Early on, because I was very upset.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So I just wanna make sure before we we wrap up, I wanna speak to again the overwhelm. Um, you know, cause I was asking you like, can you borrow energy from knowing that those paydays are coming? And you're like this is hard for sure. It's hard.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Tina Marie: For sure it's hard. But this is one of those things, you know, like the door is open, you have to say, in or out, are you in.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Tina Marie: Or are you out? And and I'm telling you like I'm not saying it to you in a condescending way. This is what you have to tell yourself. Am I in, or am I out.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: Because it will be a while before you get to really reap the rewards and feel it. But you have to know, and you have enough experience with other people doing these kinds of business that.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Tina Marie: It does come, it is coming!

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Pain Management: It just takes so long.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Tina Marie: And you, yeah, but it's going to stay hard. It's going to be hard for a while, because you're building. This is the hardest kind of thing building. Um. There's only one thing harder than building, and that's fixing.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Tina Marie: And so you want to make sure that you're building it right? Because trying to fix something that's broken is definitely harder. But you're building towards maintenance. Maintenance is when it gets to be easier. And then you have, you know, sprints where you're doing more building. But.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Tina Marie: This is the hardest part, unless, of course, you build it badly, and then you have to fix it right? So. In or out. Tell yourself, just have this conversation. I'm overwhelmed, all right. You can. You can let yourself fill that for a little while, but then you have to tell yourself, in or out. Are we doing this? Are we doing this? And then.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Tina Marie: Whatever the reasons were that motivated you to do that, you just have to remind yourself of that list. And you have to literally focus on it. You have, you know, um, when you look at a picture.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tina Marie: And you've got a person in focus, and everything else is blurry. Behind it. Kind of it's called boca, but.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Tina Marie: Do you know what I'm talking about.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Pain Management: Uh, not much.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so look at a a portrait or AI really loves to do this. So if you have it, create a portrait of a person. You'll notice that the person is really sharp. And everything else is kind of blurry in the background.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Pain Management: Oh, in the background. Yes.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Tina Marie: Right right in the background. So.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Pain Management: Mhm.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: Think about your focus as that. So if you're focusing on. What is coming and what you're building.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tina Marie: Automatically. Everything else kind of loses its power and clarity and and pressure. Right? Because you're so busy focusing on what you're building that you're not really focusing on the overwhelm. And it may seem like it's not that simple. But it is. It just takes.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Tina Marie: Practice. So what you have to do is tell yourself, okay, I'm focusing on this. And then you also have to mentally push away the. I'm tired. This is exhausting, this sucks that sucks. I'm not getting paid yet. I want the money. Now you have to tell yourself to stop.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Tina Marie: Those thoughts. And eventually, Tona, you get good at that. And it really does happen. It may come up and you have to have that battle, you know, 5, 1020 times a day. But what happens is, the battle gets over faster.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Tina Marie: And you get back into the swing of things faster. So it doesn't mean that the battle doesn't go away. It just means that it has less of an impact on you.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Tina Marie: Because you win it faster. Does that make sense.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Pain Management: Yes, it does.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Pain Management: Okay. Okay. Well, I wanted to talk to you more especially with this.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Pain Management: Upcoming meeting with. Big James. Obviously not just them. It's just gonna help us kick start. But whatever.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Pain Management: Template whatever we do. There, that's just gonna be my gauge on. I plan to do a lot more after that, like in May. Like, do more lunch and meet with the different law firms that I talk to.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Pain Management: So.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Tina Marie: So you can.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Pain Management: I think we have time now. To do the comfort. There was a yeah. There was a a comment about.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Tina Marie: Good. Sorry. Go ahead!

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Pain Management: Why are we using Dr. East photo? Let me see 2 of you. I don't know when I thought. It's a question, but I guess again.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Tina Marie: Yep, I said it should be you.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Pain Management: Again. We have time to like. Make it better.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Pain Management: So, okay. Is there anything else that um.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: Um. Just just use signal or chat, and you can send me the voice messages you can tell me like I will work with you, and more throughout the week, even if we don't have calls scheduled. So if something's on your mind and you want to be moving this forward, just send me a detailed message, and and I will put my brain and energy on it. Um! So we don't have to just have. This 1 h week.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Pain Management: Okay. That sounds good. Thank you so much, Tina. Thank you. Han.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay. You're welcome.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:26.000
mark sweet: Okay. So I'll work on the payroll stuff for you and make sure we get that implemented. So I'll need a little information from you like bank information, but it's not too hard. Gusto seems to be the cheapest, easiest one.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Pain Management: Is he still there?

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
mark sweet: Um. It has some add ons for health insurance and other stuff. So.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Pain Management: Okay. So then, this, this person that I will be hiring will be through.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
mark sweet: That is good. Does Maria have a pet or no?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Pain Management: I don't know. I don't think so. She has kids. She has stepped kids from.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'm just saying, because you can also offer pet insurance.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Tina Marie: Oh, that's cool!

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
mark sweet: Theoretically, for super cheap.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Pain Management: Oh, that's important. That's how I got coaches.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
mark sweet: I know, more important than child Insurance. Um.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Tina Marie: The little Fur Babies are so special.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000
mark sweet: Soon. Again little things that are 5 or 10 bucks a month, for you can make a big difference in the hiring process.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Pain Management: Oh, yeah, they I mean, do you remember with dolce.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000
mark sweet: So you know these are the things that you gotta think of. Yeah, it was huge. It paid off gigantic for us.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Pain Management: Mhm, okay, bye, um.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Um. Is there anything else, Tina? While I got everyone on the phone with the dashboard or anything.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Pain Management: Alright! Talk to you soon.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
mark sweet: That you need to go through or no.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Tina Marie: Um. I would love to see it. And I was gonna tell you, too, like you can tap me also, if there's things that I can help out with with Jonah and this that you're doing for her. Um. You know I'm available to you, too.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Tina Marie: So I would like to see the dashboard. I we saw it, but you made some changes.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
mark sweet: I think you're shared on it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I mean, like you walk me through it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Pain Management: Wait. I thought that you're part of it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Tina Marie: Sorry.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: Ye? Yeah, yeah, the channel lean cases, if you want to jump on it right now. I mean, it's not overly complex. Okay? So the doctor. You dashboard, we added in procedures this year, and procedures this month, and then.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Tina Marie: I'm on it right now. Oh, wait! Sorry. I have one called Chona Lean, and I think it's the wrong thing. So we.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
mark sweet: Nope, channel lean cases.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay, okay, hold on one. Sec. Sorry. I thought I had the right one over time.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Pain Management: I'm on. I'm I'm Gonna ask you to go with your doctor.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Pain Management: Is waiting for me.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
mark sweet: That's okay. Tina and I will work through it super. Quick.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Pain Management: Okay. Thank you. Bye.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Tina Marie: Hi! Have a good day.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Pain Management: Me too.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Oh, there it is. Open open.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Tina Marie: Why aren't you opening? Heck!

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Tina Marie: On by, shared with me. This is so weird. It's just not opening up.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Tina Marie: Open Google sheets.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: That was really weird that I even had to do that. Okay, I'm in it.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
mark sweet: Alright, cool.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Tina Marie: Um sweet James? Louisiana. Yeah, I've seen this, you, but you said you made some changes. Go ahead. Sorry.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
mark sweet: So what? I did so this automatically updates which.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.000
mark sweet: Is good. That's why it's saying like, Expect. It's 285 which is crazy. But given that, it's only 2 days, and what it's added. It's not a smart, smart system.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000
mark sweet: Um. So if you go under suite. James added what we had talked about, procedures 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then their dates.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Mhm. Oh, yeah. Great.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:20.000
mark sweet: Um, so that part's in there, and then added into the other liens, although I gotta. I think. Loop it all together a little bit, so it's not quite perfect.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.000
mark sweet: But at least is mostly there. So those are the changes I made. I think it makes the most sense. So we did a dropdown on procedures.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
mark sweet: So that way it's easy. There's another just in case.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
mark sweet: Um, so that should help track all that stuff.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tina Marie: That. Yes, and we'll make the dashboards reporting much better. So the expected revenue. Can you tell me what that timeframe is for? Because it doesn't have a timeframe associated.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah, um, it's not smart. It's basically 600 times total visits.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
mark sweet: Like literally, that's all it is like. It's just.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
mark sweet: B 3 times b, 4.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So we'll want to separate that out, because eventually the revenue is going to start coming right? So. We want to have what's coming versus what's been paid, but also.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Tina Marie: If we could have that. Projected out by.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Tina Marie: The likelihood. So let's just say, our whatever the average is, whether it's 12 months or 18 months, or whatever. That we want to have, and we know that this is not accurate accounting right, but we.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Tina Marie: The the point of it. Mark is, I'm trying to get Chona to figure out where's a finish line? Not finished per se, but. Where's the money line that she can start? Maybe drawing energy from Ligan.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Tina Marie: 10 months from now. You're expecting a payday around this during that month. Right? We know it's.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
mark sweet: Here's part of the problem.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
mark sweet: I don't know these firms very well.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000
mark sweet: And I know what my average is. But my average is also way faster than.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
mark sweet: Most lawyer averages.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Tina Marie: Well, but maybe Fuji or some other doctors could give you an average of what theirs is, so that you could.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
mark sweet: Could try to find out from him. Yeah, I mean, my guess is, it's a year to 18 months.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Tina Marie: That's what I think it is for Fuji.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
mark sweet: Um. Yeah.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000
mark sweet: But again, we're throwing in procedures which drive these things on so like some of the hiring cases, for from the like, um.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
mark sweet: Commercial teams those are gonna take.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
mark sweet: At least 18 months, because they're bigger cases that take a lot more time. They may take 3 or 4 years because they're going to litigation.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Tina Marie: So what if we did this? Because I'm always trying to figure out. How do we help her? Mentally.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Tina Marie: Be prepared and energized.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
mark sweet: I'm just trying to have a really nice big number that gets everyone excited.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Tina Marie: Well, yes, but we also don't want it to be so far off that. She gets there and goes fuck this like, you know, I've waited this long. I can't wait any longer. That kind of thing. So you have to keep that in mind.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Tina Marie: So what if we had to like a revenue? That is non procedure.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Tina Marie: Number and a revenue that is procedure number. So the revenue that's non procedure will make that average like 12 to 14 months. So I'm pretty sure, for Fuji. It's closer to 12. Um. But but check on that right? So that we're giving a kind of a realistic estimate.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Tina Marie: And then we can separate out that revenue which will start to compound right when all those procedures when that money does hit. But we don't know when it's going to, so um.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Tina Marie: If we can separate that out and and do it as a calculator. Okay, 12 months after this month, right? So next April from this April and next May. From this May, that type of thing. Where we're looking at. Okay, you could potentially have a payday. And we definitely want to use that language potentially have a payday.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Tina Marie: April next year of X. Amount of money, and when when she watches April to May to June of 2026. Keep growing and keep growing, and we've got these numbers as we're plugging them in.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Tina Marie: I'm hoping. That that creates some excitement in her, but also.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Tina Marie: Hopefully. We're not borrowing against the money that hasn't been made yet.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
mark sweet: And.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Tina Marie: That's another concern. So I'm I'm concerned that I.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
mark sweet: 3rd concern. If the number is not what it says it's supposed to be, and it's lower. She.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Tina Marie: Great.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
mark sweet: Will react very poorly to that.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Tina Marie: Right? So maybe we have that internally for us. So we're kind of looking at it. We can figure out how to use that to create some energy. Without um creating a potential risk of borrowing against money that's not made yet.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Tina Marie: Or um.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
mark sweet: The goal of this was more for Dr. E. To get excited than her.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:50.000
mark sweet: But she's also looking at it. So I mean it's good for both of them. But this was so, doctor, he has very. Quick, boom, boom, numbers.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
mark sweet: Um, but you know. He's gonna spend 2 seconds looking at it.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and how much of that is his and how much of that? So that's this is for him. What does she get like? How? I don't know how the money is split.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
mark sweet: On the so on the initial visits, 50, 50. On the procedures. It's 20%.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
mark sweet: But.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Tina Marie: For her, and he gets 80%.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Tina Marie: So um. Well, what if we just.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Tina Marie: For our sake. Right? So we can watch our growth. And how we're helping support the business. I don't feel like that's out of integrity. You can check me if you think that it is.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Tina Marie: Um have some numbers where we can take a look at, you know. What's more real and likely.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Tina Marie: But not necessarily create a situation that. Creates problems for Shona.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000
mark sweet: What if we flip it? Hold on! I see where you're going. But what if we flip it? Because we know how many people she's seeing in each and every month.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Tina Marie: And hmm. Mhm.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:02.000
mark sweet: If we take that month and multiply it by the average, because I'm gonna let them mess around with what they're getting paid on average. Because I don't. I frankly don't know. Like Fuji's 450, probably on average. I put them at 600 and maybe too high. I I don't know.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000
mark sweet: Um, but what we could put as the expected revenue. From that each month. So if they saw a hundred 13.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
mark sweet: In April it'd be 113 times 600. That'd be the expected revenue from April.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
mark sweet: From March it would be whatever it was, and then we put it in that way which helps to break it down.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Tina Marie: Right. That's exactly what I'm talking about.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:35.000
mark sweet: It right, but instead of when you're expecting it to pay out. Because I until we start getting real accurate data, it's a complete shot in the dark. So this just says the expected from what you've seen rather than expected of when it's gonna pay out.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Tina Marie: Got it? Got it? Got it? Got it? Yeah.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
mark sweet: Do. Yeah. Cause I totally get what you're saying. If you had the data, yours is way better and way more motivational.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
mark sweet: We just don't have accurate data. And it I'm afraid it's gonna shoot us in the foot.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Tina Marie: Right. Yes, no. I agree with you completely. Okay. Um.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so is that something that you can work on.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's super easy.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, okay, cool.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It's a 10 min process.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Tina Marie: Um was there. Sorry I. My brain is just. I keep having.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:13.000
mark sweet: I was excited over the payroll thing. Um, because I think that'll help a lot and it'll help her in a recruitment tool and a retention tool.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:19.000
mark sweet: I think it'll just help her be less stressed out on some of the. Running the business stuff, which is important.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Tina Marie: Yes, and now that I know that. Maria could potentially be.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Tina Marie: Something that we lose, and Maria was like just a balm of healing for Tona. We can't lose her.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
mark sweet: Yeah. No.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:48.000
mark sweet: But I'm thinking, if I'm a brand new mom, we don't know if the husband has insurance or not. Um. But just to have some of those abilities, or have some of these things is huge, and the the actual cost to her is not that much per month.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
mark sweet: And then this keeps it completely separated from Doctor E.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Tina Marie: Oh, what if also there's some different deals that you can get like, you know, gym membership. But maybe or it's a Gym membership that has. Um. Uh! What do you call it? Like infrared therapy and saunas and things like that, so she can go get some like personal time.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Tina Marie: And it's 1 of those kind of fringe benefits, and maybe it's something they wouldn't spend money on, and it doesn't cost us hardly anything, but now that they have it, she's taking good care of herself, and you know what I mean, like those little tiny things, even like pet insurance. That it's a tiny expense, but somebody feels like it's a huge gift.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
mark sweet: Or putting in some money into a 5, 29, or something for a new kid.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yes, Mark.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah, there, there's some of these options.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Tina Marie: Yes, thinking about like that. How do you protect your investment in Maria and make it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
mark sweet: I mean, you know, for me this is a big thing for me, and somebody think a lot about, because for my own stuff.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, well, but also, yeah, you love to take care of people and make them happy. And this is one of those places where you shine.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000
mark sweet: Um. Yeah.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Tina Marie: Extra.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
mark sweet: But this will give her more ability. And again, it's taking it out of asking for permission from someone to do something to just doing it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Tina Marie: Also in terms of who we hire like, if it was possible to hire a woman who's. Past, you know, doesn't have kids at home because she's grown out of it, or maybe never did, but doesn't have to earn money, but likes those little Perks.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tina Marie: You know um. I know that it's not easy to find that kind of person, but it.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
mark sweet: And who can don't handle the technology. Usually those things don't all go together.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Tina Marie: They! I get that, I 100% get that. But they do exist.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Tina Marie: I've I've I work with them in my mission. So I know, like I'm like, I can't believe there's that many of you, and they want things to do so much that they like me. They're working for free for hours a week all the time.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tina Marie: Just because that's how much they want to do it. So.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Tina Marie: They're rare. But they exist. And you've got this kind of like magical magnet, and so does Chana.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
mark sweet: Right.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Tina Marie: So let's just put some intention towards that, and see if if we can.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:04.000
mark sweet: No, but look, we're gonna find a scheduler sooner or later. That'll take a large uh stress off of both Maria and Jonah. Uh which I think it's gonna help. The the person in the office is obviously ideal, but.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Tina Marie: I mean. Yes.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000
mark sweet: I feel like I can store weight a little bit. Or she can just bonus out one of the people who's already in that office like Letty. Just to make sure some of those things are taken care of.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Tina Marie: Also like, let me just so. Maybe it would be better for you to have a conversation with Fuji than me. Tell everything, but I'm sure he'd be okay with this part, and that is that.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
mark sweet: Um.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Tina Marie: The people that he has.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
mark sweet: We tell each other so much shit. It's ridiculous.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Tina Marie: That's I. That's what I figured. But it's different when I do it. You know what I mean. That's not my place.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
mark sweet: I know, I know.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Tina Marie: But but his team in Guatemala like. So when we started there was a huge. Disconnect between him and his team. Right they were, these people.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Tina Marie: Now they're his people.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Tina Marie: There's a lot of loyalty that's building in all of these things that he's doing like. There's real relationships that are coming out of it. But what seems to be exceptional about at least 2 of them.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Tina Marie: Um is that there's a lot of leadership in them. There's a lot of drive, and it doesn't take a lot of money to be able to pay for that kind of autonomous working, like just good reliable, does a good job, and that does have your back. They're hugely loyal.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. You give them a little bit of those perks and stuff, and they're like king of the castle where they live.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Tina Marie: And so maybe that is something that we consider is having somebody. Like that. I don't know what role, because you were talking about needing to have people in the office and things like that.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:38.000
mark sweet: So I think that's overflow after we fill these 3 positions. And that's probably the next 2. 2 people after that, because that's going to be more of a scheduling and follow up type, position.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
mark sweet: That doesn't have to be based in the Us. But for right now, as it's so nascent and so.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.000
mark sweet: Disorganizing, chaotic for her to be able to literally have everyone sit down at lunch and figure it out together. Is incredibly valuable, and trying to do all that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
mark sweet: Over zoom is gonna be very difficult for her right now. I think long term. It's a great solution to help save some money.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
mark sweet: And to do things a little better.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Tina Marie: What is. Sorry. I was just thinking. Think about Esther, and like other people like maybe returning to the workforce because people don't want to hire you when you've got a gap.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no. No.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Tina Marie: But that doesn't mean that they're not smart. They don't know technology, whatever. Um returning to the workforce for some reason, right? Maybe they were taking care of an aging parent or.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tina Marie: They did have kids grow up. I don't know. Anyway, I'm just trying to think of like, what are the types of conversations that we can tell people, hey, I'm looking for this person. Um cause. The more specific.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:41.000
mark sweet: Yes, but don't forget. A lot of people, too, are burned out in the medical field. They're tired of of dealing with some of the stuff, and this is not a.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
mark sweet: As patient, facing.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Tina Marie: So this, this is a marketing game as much as anything else, and.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Tina Marie: You, brother, this is you. Like you can do this good.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no, she's just gonna find the people. But so start looking now. So it'll happen. And you know.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000
mark sweet: They're they're not a capacity yet. It's just the systems aren't quite there. And they're trying to build the systems as they go. As all this stuff is. So it's just they're extra overwhelmed from some of this.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Tina Marie: Well. Yes, and they're not just building, but you have to take into account the learning.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Tina Marie: So, wrapping their heads around everything that is a lot of mental fatigue and mental fatigue is also emotional fatigue. It's also physical fatigue on top of actually all the patients that they're handling all the notes, all the other things. So this is stacked on them right now.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
mark sweet: Mhm oh, yeah, no. There's a lot of a lot of.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so anything. I wouldn't do it. I'll tell you right there. I'm not built for that shit.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
mark sweet: Shooting themselves in the foot.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Tina Marie: I would not do it. Don't tell Jonah.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Tina Marie: I like shortcuts way too much.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
mark sweet: Of course.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Tina Marie: I'm not built for that. That's too much. Um, so I anyway, they're they're exceptional, and all the things that we can do to build that support structure around them, like, you know.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Tina Marie: And you're doing uh, and she knows she's told me before. I would not be able to do this without mark. So.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
mark sweet: No, there's 0% chance. And that's okay. She just needs us to actually listen to me. Instead of fighting me every goddamn time.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Tina Marie: You're the hero.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
mark sweet: But yes, um.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Tina Marie: Look you don't. You don't fall in love with and love and marry a strong woman and not deal with your shit. Not getting listened to. That's just.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
mark sweet: I know.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Tina Marie: Part and parcel, son.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
mark sweet: No, it's not what I signed up for. It's not what I agreed to.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Tina Marie: You don't get to have the sassy, fiery, smart advocate.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
mark sweet: Uh.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Tina Marie: And then not deal with it. That's just not how it goes.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:51.000
mark sweet: I know it's fine, but it's making progress. But you know this stuff will work. It's just. A little nervous the 1st time you know, funds get a little light. But yeah, we'll work through it. And I think it'll be okay, um, because of running a business is hard, and especially for having to rely on doctor to pay when he's supposed to pay. To make sure her people get paid is.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
mark sweet: And a concern I have that she has no control over.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Tina Marie: Right. So I wanted to talk to that real quick. So I don't think it's an integrity issue with him. I think it's probably a. Administrative Task Issue.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
mark sweet: Yes.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Tina Marie: And timing right? So the best solution always is going to be to figure out how. How do you make it as easy as possible for the people who hate administrative stuff.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Tina Marie: To get the things done. So we're talking about like api integrations and achcrawls and all those types of things that make it as automatic as possible. And and so let's say, Hey, I don't want to get overdrafted. I don't want to get overcharged. Okay, well, so let's put in some parameters if it falls with under this threshold each month.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Tina Marie: And we automatically charge you under this threshold each month for this person. Can we just make that system automatic where we don't even have to check with you. We just report. This is what happened.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Tina Marie: More than likely you will get a yes, from those type of people as long as it's not an integrity issue.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.000
mark sweet: Yeah, yeah. It's it's not. I don't. I agree. I don't think this is an integrity issue. I think it's just. There's so much other stuff going on that he just.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Doesn't handle the Admin stuff.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Tina Marie: Right, so.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
mark sweet: So this should also help him. Be happier, because it's 1 less thing for them to deal with.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Tina Marie: Exactly. You take the stuff off the plate that people hate doing, but they know it has to be done, and they want to get it done. Where you make it as easy for them as possible. They'll be glad, and you get what you need out of them.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Okay, cool.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:39.000
mark sweet: Lots of stuff, but at least it's moving forward, and I think um. Again when you can visualize these things, especially for her doctor. It makes a big difference.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Did you want to tell me about your birthday friend? Or no.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
mark sweet: Oh, Loretta! Um. Yeah. Figure that one out a little bit better.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
mark sweet: Uh they run a chiropractic office in. Cino hills wanna say Chino Chino hills.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.000
mark sweet: Um. We've known him for a long time. Um! So Jadine, so they're married. Yeah, they're married. Um.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
mark sweet: So it's well she, I think kids before him. So he's like the adopted kids, anyway.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:25.000
mark sweet: Sorry we we got an interesting intake that starts referred to our office by friend of ex-wife's boyfriend. Um. So I guess that's good.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
mark sweet: Uh.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Tina Marie: No.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:48.000
mark sweet: I was just looking at the retail list. Uh, okay. So anyway, uh. They run a chiropractor office he's looking at potentially adding another one. The wife is probably the one that you'd be dealing with more. She's the office, admin. He's just more the practitioner.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
mark sweet: But it's another husband wife team which a lot of chiropractor offices are that.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000
mark sweet: Um, they do some advertising there on some of these networks and groups trying to like get cases through, but with varying levels of results.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Mhm.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
mark sweet: Um, and so. You know. Um, I can definitely see if they're trying to expand, you know.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
mark sweet: Someone helping them with their procedures. Is good. You've got people who have a very, very high.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
mark sweet: Base knowledge level of like, how the. Practical things, work which is really good.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
mark sweet: Um. So you don't have to like, go over. Okay? Well, how are we gonna fix like lean negotiations or whatnot? Um cause they they know how they're doing that stuff.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
mark sweet: But that's really. As much, I can tell you. They're really nice people.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
mark sweet: They're just really nice people.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Tina Marie: I like really nice people. Well, really nice, smart, entrepreneurial. You know all those things.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well. Just let me know as that goes. When's when's the birthday like? When is the.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
mark sweet: Oh, it already his birthday kind of passed, so I gotta give him his gift at some point. Is. I think it was a march. I know.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Tina Marie: Cable. Well keep me posted. If there, there's something happening, obviously, that we.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
mark sweet: I'll probably see them at the conference next week.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay, um, also. Patrick, is Patrick coming back?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
mark sweet: Shooting. I don't know. He's doing really well.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
mark sweet: You guys, team moving like everything seems to be going forward for him pretty well right now.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So if he doesn't need help, then we need to. Change, things.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Tina Marie: Um. Would you want to talk to him and find out like.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
mark sweet: Yeah, let me talk to him and find out what he wants to do.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Tina Marie: If. Okay. Alright then, and if not, we'll just figure out other ways.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000
mark sweet: We played an April fool's joke on Tyler. We took everything out of his office except his like screens and keyboard, got got really sad.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you guys are terrible! I hate April fools for that.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
mark sweet: See you. Well say, I wanted to move Patrick's car.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
mark sweet: Uh wasn't there. Yeah, we're we're semi bad people. It's okay.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Tina Marie: These are terrible. Don't do that to me. I'll cry.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know Tyler almost did. It's fine.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Tina Marie: I might sound tough, but I'm very sensitive. Okay, alright. Well, keep me posted on anything that I can help out with, I said. I have to change my alarm, but I have an alarm too.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Tina Marie: Show Shona how to set up the Zoom AI companion. Do you know how to do that?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
mark sweet: Uh! I've never done it, but I don't. I mean, I don't think that's gonna be very hard for me to figure it out.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Tina Marie: It's not you. Just go into zoom home. I will.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
mark sweet: It's probably just in the settings, and then just putting it off.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Tina Marie: It is, and it's easier at the like, the home screen level of the app or um when you're logged into it.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Tina Marie: And there's just the setting for it. But I I'll just go ahead and make that for her, and then you'll see you.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be super tough, but I'll show her.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Tina Marie: Cause. It is super helpful.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no, that makes sense. If we can pull it together for her, and one less thing for her to worry about.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Tina Marie: Heck. Yeah, she's got a lot. That's a lot. There's a lot of people, a lot of riding, a lot of driving a lot a lot.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
mark sweet: Yep. It's funny.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Tina Marie: It's fine. Alright. Well, I need some lunch, so I'm gonna go and.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
mark sweet: Okay, have fun.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, wait! When did you do? Or when are you doing the exosomes? And I forgot the other. Oh, stem cell!

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Tina Marie: Okay. How soon do they say that you'll notice.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
mark sweet: Don't know. I'll find out today.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, good luck.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
mark sweet: It's pretty soon like it. Hopefully, this is the last thing, and then. I feel better, so we'll see.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Tina Marie: All right. Well, I'm gonna say a quick prayer for that.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
mark sweet: It'll be fine. Okay, have fun. Bye.
