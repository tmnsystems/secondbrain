1
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.940
Dan: Yellow.

2
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.390
Tina Marie: Purple.

3
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.510
Dan: I know.

4
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.140
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh! I hate! I have always hated taking my kids to school because I hate them being there, and

5
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.690
Tina Marie: I would homeschool them if they wanted to, and I have done it with all of them at 1 point or another.

6
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.780
Tina Marie: But

7
00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:04.240
Tina Marie: this child she's like talking about one of her classes. She hates being in. She loves the teacher, but she's like there's so much cussing and slurs, and these people that just delight in trying to get people to kill themselves. And I'm like, what did you say.

8
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.990
Dan: He says, Yeah.

9
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:14.799
Tina Marie: They just sit there and they brag about how they, this one girl was so proud that she convinced another girl to split her wrist in front of oh, I can't. I'm gonna cry.

10
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.260
Tina Marie: really.

11
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.599
Tina Marie: Yeah, really.

12
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.440
Dan: Jikes.

13
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.780
Tina Marie: Like.

14
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.199
Dan: Yeah, he knew Oregon was so dark.

15
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.150
Tina Marie: I don't.

16
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:45.130
Tina Marie: Oh, it's not just Oregon. It's where I live. We rank in the CIA has a list, and it's we're in the top 5 in the nation for domestic violence, like, I live in a fucking cesspool, and you have no idea how hard it has been to be a person trying to grow my light in this place.

17
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.769
Tina Marie: I hate it, it destroys people.

18
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.220
Tina Marie: And I've got these babies here fighting

19
00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:04.870
Tina Marie: basically Satan's demon for a father who has corrupted to my older girls like, I'm in a battle for spirits on a fucking daily basis.

20
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.570
Tina Marie: and it is just heartbreaking.

21
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:23.650
Tina Marie: They're so smart like they've been at the top of their classes all the way up to. They get about middle school, and that's when their spirits just start to like, shrink and realize, like how bad everything is around them. The the kids that

22
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:35.700
Tina Marie: have really strong spiritual families and and big ones. They do well, because they've got a lot of guarding, you know, but it's just me I'm I'm the only one trying to do anything good in our

23
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.250
Tina Marie: in our house.

24
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.359
Tina Marie: and then they go to their dad's, and he is one of the filthiest people. He wasn't that way when I met him.

25
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.170
Tina Marie: but he just started down that path and just got darker and darker and darker, and

26
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.520
Tina Marie: anyway, 3 more years. I'll get out of here

27
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.719
Tina Marie: here, and I am doing everything I can for my girls. But

28
00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:07.370
Tina Marie: I'm counting on the Scripture that says, Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. Because

29
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.739
Tina Marie: right now there's a lot of departing.

30
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.570
Tina Marie: It's crazy, all these poor kids dealing with some insanity.

31
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.730
Tina Marie: So yeah, so that's why I asked you about Abel and Mary. I'm like, I'm just glad that they've got you

32
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:32.879
Tina Marie: like moms barely stand a chance, because it's just a natural thing for girls to be at opposition with each other.

33
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.420
Dan: Yeah.

34
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:43.819
Tina Marie: But yeah, so that that male role balance. Oh, there's my guy. I'm gonna have to

35
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.699
Tina Marie: text him. He'll call him back my Dexter. Oh.

36
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.759
Tina Marie: let me message him real quick.

37
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.230
Tina Marie: so I don't know how to do this with zoom.

38
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.439
Tina Marie: One thing in.

39
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.620
Tina Marie: Okay, let me switch off the car, did I? I still got you.

40
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.250
Dan: Yep.

41
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.129
Tina Marie: Okay, cool. Oh, wait.

42
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.979
Tina Marie: It didn't change until Speaker. Okay, cool already. Then

43
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.229
Tina Marie: I I'm gonna be I don't even know how many hours I'm spending at the terminal. I am like dreaming about

44
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:39.569
Tina Marie: being at the console in the middle of the night. I got up the other night. I had to use the restroom, and instead of going to bed, how to get in here?

45
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.189
Tina Marie: Walk to my desk, Dan.

46
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.251
Tina Marie: Okay, 3 o'clock in the morning, because I was

47
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.220
Tina Marie: like it was just the conversation just keeps continuing in my head all day long.

48
00:06:53.350 --> 00:07:01.470
Tina Marie: and so I woke up, and I'm still having it. I'm like this is my habit. I do that, and then I go back to work, and

49
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.220
Tina Marie: I'm like, Oh, no, I'm supposed to go back to bed.

50
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.440
Dan: For real.

51
00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:10.540
Tina Marie: Yeah, as A is a little weird.

52
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.989
Tina Marie: anyway. It's Claude. So you've got it. It's just like

53
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.999
Tina Marie: play with it, just to see what it could do out of curiosity, even if it's just a

54
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.450
Tina Marie: have ideas about how Eric might use it, because nobody thinks like you do.

55
00:07:30.177 --> 00:07:33.200
Tina Marie: They might get the applications. Norio probably would.

56
00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:37.860
Dan: Uses it. Norio's having. He's he

57
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.790
Dan: uses that with something else. And that's what he was training the sod. And those guys.

58
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.219
Tina Marie: It's only been available for 2 days.

59
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.830
Dan: No, no, he was using the original. Claude, he said, was the best one for writing code. Even before that.

60
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.400
Tina Marie: Right. What I'm saying is this, no, I know

61
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.080
Tina Marie: in the terminal it's so nuts it. It not only does. Okay. So it maps out.

62
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.740
Dan: I'll literally never use it. I can tell you that right now.

63
00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:06.425
Tina Marie: That's okay.

64
00:08:07.378 --> 00:08:10.240
Dan: 0 interest. I'm like, Nope, I'm not.

65
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.430
Tina Marie: I don't have.

66
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.950
Dan: Norio's.

67
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.079
Tina Marie: Well, I mean cause like like I said when I was 8, that's when I 1st learned how to code in basic. And so I've never been like

68
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.629
Tina Marie: the one that wants to sit there and read all the books. I'll just read enough to go do what I want to do.

69
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:35.510
Tina Marie: But yeah, it's fun, anyway. I better let me go get my notes. Trip over dogs first.st

70
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:44.569
Tina Marie: So book status 1st they were reviewing it. Have they got back to you?

71
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.179
Dan: No, but I hadn't.

72
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.750
Dan: This woman laid it all out like it's already done.

73
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.699
Dan: So I'm like, all right. If they've got.

74
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.870
Tina Marie: The designer girl.

75
00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:03.440
Dan: Yep, she's done. And then I mean, I think I get. If they have edits, then I'm gonna do the edits. If they don't have edits. Then I'm gonna go in and give her a final

76
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:11.259
Dan: round of notes like, Hey, put a page break here, and then there's 1 there's these call outs that I'm like, let's see what we can do

77
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.309
Dan: to make maybe highlight those a little more. But

78
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.439
Dan: see what she comes up with.

79
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:25.999
Dan: or there might be something built into the template that I I didn't really get too deep into the template, but the template had a bunch of parts already built that you can use that she did use.

80
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.989
Dan: So then that would be done.

81
00:09:30.438 --> 00:09:32.850
Dan: So I mean, it's like 95% done.

82
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.820
Tina Marie: That's awesome. Where am I?

83
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.999
Dan: I have not read it.

84
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.800
Dan: I'm like I've never read, I mean I read it as I did it, but.

85
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:54.139
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's funny how it changes when you look at it. You know, as a complete thing.

86
00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.420
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I read it once, and then that made me reorganize it. And then I was like, All right. This is more

87
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.500
Dan: logical organization.

88
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.670
Tina Marie: Okay, it's just loading my billions of tabs.

89
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.809
Tina Marie: How many there actually are? Does it count it?

90
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.400
Tina Marie: No, I bet there's probably 50

91
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:40.759
Tina Marie: in this browser. Any of my notes, though. Sorry. Thank you for bearing with me also. Let me, I wanna look at when my flight is cause. I was just thinking about it. I might be in the airport or driving next week, so we could at least have some kind of conversation and update.

92
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:48.320
Tina Marie: and that could managed to find a few questions to be like what you doing with that dancer.

93
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.660
Dan: Nope.

94
00:10:51.500 --> 00:11:00.590
Tina Marie: And oh, how's the have we got anything from Greg for what you did?

95
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.969
Tina Marie: Okay, hold on.

96
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.269
Tina Marie: So we had.

97
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.300
Tina Marie: Do you have the example sites for suite law.

98
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.530
Tina Marie: But did we.

99
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.470
Dan: Over today.

100
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.273
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, I haven't seen that yet. Okay, this is definitely not law for me.

101
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:26.320
Dan: Yes, that he it's the essence of what Mark sent for. Sure.

102
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.113
Tina Marie: Oh, wow!

103
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:36.589
Tina Marie: There's no trophy, but it definitely has a lot of free, a lot of a lot of free, a lot of feel get paid, not played.

104
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.630
Tina Marie: I wonder if he's seen that which.

105
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.519
Dan: I don't think so.

106
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.880
Tina Marie: Oh, I'm about to give him a second.

107
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.040
Dan: He usually no, he's he usually responds to me like really quick.

108
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:56.040
Dan: So cause he sent over something else separately to me and Eric, and then.

109
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:04.679
Dan: But it was like, we're getting this. So there was very limited communication. So I'm like he must be doing something.

110
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.459
Tina Marie: He's a busy boy.

111
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.954
Dan: He's really not. But.

112
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.500
Tina Marie: He busies himself.

113
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.439
Tina Marie: He is a busy boy. He's just doing

114
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:25.470
Tina Marie: lots of other things from home, and a lot of it is Channel related, or break in, related.

115
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.879
Dan: Yeah, exactly.

116
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.650
Tina Marie: It's not on. I wasn't saying he's a busy boy for Sweetlaw.

117
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:36.470
Dan: No, no, I know that's what Salka always is like. Mark's always. He's like he does all this other shit.

118
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.289
Dan: And a lot of it's Chona. He's like he does all this shit for Chona.

119
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.539
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's not the worst thing in the world to like.

120
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.450
Tina Marie: Try to serve your wife if you don't, wanna

121
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:55.969
Tina Marie: you know, be divorced, not saying that that's his job or his thing. But there are worse ways to spend your time.

122
00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.670
Dan: Oh, yeah, for sure.

123
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.909
Tina Marie: And now I'm working on the other end of it, trying to help the situation.

124
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.170
Tina Marie: She's doing really good right now, though.

125
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.749
Dan: She's still working at. What's his name's office, or whatever.

126
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.930
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. So she's got

127
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:18.970
Tina Marie: That really wasn't working out super. Well, there's lots of little issues about it. But he

128
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.220
Tina Marie: is a pacifist, basically.

129
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:34.060
Tina Marie: So he has to be strong armed into taking action. But Shona's got that in her. And so she

130
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:42.909
Tina Marie: hired somebody last Friday and basically is gonna start building her own things her way. But she didn't have

131
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:52.119
Tina Marie: the confidence to do all of these things like she's got a lot of breaking down of walls and

132
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.810
Tina Marie: negative beliefs that had to happen, and then

133
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:06.730
Tina Marie: self-discipline. But the self-discipline, a lot of it, was around the limiting beliefs.

134
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.525
Tina Marie: So

135
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:23.849
Tina Marie: This is the 1st time that she sounded strong for consecutive weeks, and it's been 3 consecutive weeks, like at no point since I started working with her in September. Has she sounded strong

136
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.499
Tina Marie: for multiple days and weeks in a row.

137
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.039
Tina Marie: and she does now, and I know that pattern.

138
00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:36.319
Tina Marie: There will be more valleys, you know, more issues.

139
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.450
Dan: Yeah.

140
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:46.999
Tina Marie: But she has established a pattern of. She will get over it and fix it as long as she keeps being supported.

141
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:54.420
Tina Marie: So I mean, I've worked with so many people, whether it's personally or professionally to know that I can

142
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.380
Tina Marie: trust that pattern.

143
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.520
Tina Marie: She's got Mark, and

144
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:09.320
Tina Marie: as long as they can keep working together and not sabotage anything. I think it's gonna be awesome.

145
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.279
Dan: It'll take a while, but it should be worth it.

146
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.940
Tina Marie: It would make me really happy to see that for him, too.

147
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.320
Dan: Sure.

148
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.540
Tina Marie: I like him not being Eeyore.

149
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.012
Dan: Yeah, that's definitely gone.

150
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.640
Tina Marie: Yeah. It creeps in once in a while.

151
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.040
Dan: Yeah.

152
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.300
Tina Marie: But it never lasts. Even the full call.

153
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.400
Dan: Right, exactly.

154
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:42.060
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's and it's crazy, too, because that really was his kind of mo.

155
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.470
Dan: Oh, yeah, like, the entire.

156
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:53.060
Tina Marie: So. Yeah, this is my favorite thing is watching people like literally be happier. Not that

157
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.740
Tina Marie: I did that.

158
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.440
Tina Marie: I just love watching it, you know.

159
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.770
Dan: Sure. Yeah.

160
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.410
Tina Marie: Okay, where's this?

161
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.180
Tina Marie: I'll ask, lead, flow, a book.

162
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.169
Tina Marie: What's today? The 27th to you?

163
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.369
Tina Marie: 27, no, not 2427, 25

164
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.660
Tina Marie: oops! That's the wrong one. Dang it!

165
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.150
Tina Marie: So!

166
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:29.780
Tina Marie: Oh, can I see a can I see what it looks like?

167
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:35.460
Dan: No cause. It's in designer, and

168
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.309
Dan: I don't. I can export it and send you a copy. I don't think I've done that.

169
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.030
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Please.

170
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.779
Dan: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm on my phone so I can't do right now.

171
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.150
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, I'll email you.

172
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:47.870
Dan: Yeah.

173
00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:49.599
Tina Marie: Please send.

174
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.820
Dan: How's Denise doing she's good, I would say.

175
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.500
Tina Marie: And Lisa.

176
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.520
Dan: My sister.

177
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.430
Tina Marie: Yeah.

178
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.089
Dan: She's not so good.

179
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.880
Tina Marie: Working on.

180
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.340
Dan: Hey?

181
00:17:13.614 --> 00:17:22.469
Dan: Because she can't get a job. I'm like, I hate to break it to you, girl, but you're 58. No one wants to hire you

182
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.859
Dan: you've got. That's your biggest thing, right? So she's gotten down the line with many a job.

183
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.540
Dan: and they all

184
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:38.380
Dan: she like at least 2 or 3 times. She's like, I'm gonna get this. And then they're like, we're gonna go in a different direction

185
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.930
Dan: kind of thing.

186
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.799
Dan: And I'm like, it's because you're 58, and they don't want to pay you

187
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.010
Dan: $200,000 when they can pay a 28 year old. Half that.

188
00:17:50.662 --> 00:17:56.990
Tina Marie: And they obviously don't really value your job or your experience, because they're making a monetary decision.

189
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:05.190
Dan: So she's doing that coaching thing. She did a coaching thing with her friend. They did it, I don't know in the fall or something.

190
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.390
Dan: and I guess it. I guess it was all right.

191
00:18:11.355 --> 00:18:17.900
Dan: So then they are.

192
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.814
Dan: So they did it in the fall. I think I think it was a live event.

193
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:40.730
Dan: Maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was virtual, but they're they're doing it again. So I think they sold like 15, and then they're doing one in the Uk. Or for the Uk. Not in the well, maybe it is in the Uk, but it it's for the Uk for sure.

194
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.820
Dan: So I mean, that's kind of working.

195
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.480
Dan: But I don't.

196
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:56.540
Dan: You know I was like, Hey, you need like a brand. And you need like a name. You need products like

197
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:08.849
Dan: you gotta think so. Then she went back. She started going through the Fletcher shit again, I think, and now she's like, Oh, I get it. Now, I'm like, Yeah, it makes more sense when you're, you know, have

198
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.120
Dan: something to apply it to.

199
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:18.300
Tina Marie: It's it's all perspective, right? Relativity. Like, she's never yeah, like you said something to apply it to.

200
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.279
Dan: Yeah. So I was like, look.

201
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:26.990
Dan: here's the deal like you should not be doing this with your friend. That's your 1st mistake.

202
00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:27.480
Tina Marie: Okay.

203
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:35.729
Dan: She's like. No, it's it's fine, I said. No, it's not. I'm like you're 58 in, you know.

204
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.009
Dan: Human years.

205
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:48.000
Dan: let's call it. But I'm like you're 20 in entrepreneur years, which means you're going to make a 20 year old's mistakes.

206
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:58.529
Dan: because even though you're 58 by the calendar, you're not when it comes to entrepreneurial experience. So there's every. I have every belief

207
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.180
Dan: that you will make Rookie mistakes because you are a rookie.

208
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:10.249
Dan: and you're making one. And that's partnering with someone that you don't really know that you've never like. You're that you're not thinking of the

209
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.780
Dan: the repercussions of doing this because everyone does.

210
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.790
Tina Marie: Welfare. You're gonna put above the business like.

211
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.400
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it's just. It's just a cliche mistake.

212
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:42.180
Dan: So I was like, you need to. You can do this, but you have to you should be building your own offer. So you guys do this together. And then you're you have an off ramp to your own thing. That's not so you guys can have this dual brand type type of thing. But then you're doing one on one coaching outside of it that she gets no part of.

213
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.220
Dan: and vice versa. She should do the same thing.

214
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.930
Dan: and then maybe it does work out, I mean, but you you just gotta be cognizant of that.

215
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.940
Dan: So I mean she was working on that. I was like, maybe like 2 weeks ago, or something.

216
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.580
Tina Marie: Well.

217
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.420
Dan: I think I did 2. I had like 2 calls with her.

218
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:22.300
Tina Marie: The offer is still on the table, and it probably would be even more powerful to do it, like all the 3 of us, because, you know, we riff off each other, you definitely have different ideas and thoughts and push back when I've got something that maybe I could be looking at differently, but likewise right.

219
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.500
Dan: Oh, yeah, I mean, I was like.

220
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.310
Tina Marie: For free.

221
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:30.410
Dan: It's like, build it in circle. Trust me, like, blah. Blah. So

222
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.700
Dan: yeah, I just I don't know when this next one is the I mean, it's like high ticket.

223
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.720
Dan: Think it was like 1,500 bucks or something.

224
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:47.999
Dan: I go. I mean, I'm like, you're onto something. You just need to dial it in. Then they showed me, like this competitor person, that

225
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.920
Dan: I think.

226
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.036
Tina Marie: Do anything. Sorry I keep cutting you off. Sorry. Keep going.

227
00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:00.699
Dan: No, I mean, I'm just saying they showed me, and I was like, I don't really understand what this person's doing like. I mean, I sort of get it, but I sort of don't.

228
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:08.909
Dan: But it they were in sort of the same niche, which is like women, probably 40 and up.

229
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:27.159
Dan: that are either professional and looking to go private or on their own, or they're professional looking to change jobs or like it's I don't wanna say like life change. But you know I'm like, you gotta you gotta dial in on that. And then

230
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:34.470
Dan: they got some really good feedback from people. I don't. I don't remember what it was exactly, but it was not what they thought it was going to be. And I'm like, Well, that's

231
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.069
Dan: that's the gold, right? You can't.

232
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.730
Dan: You can't predict.

233
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:46.540
Dan: but you can define your avatar, but you're you. You can really define your avatar by listening to them.

234
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.730
Tina Marie: Yeah, and then.

235
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.700
Dan: So there's that. So I don't know. We'll see.

236
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.460
Tina Marie: Well, what I was gonna say is that

237
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.030
Tina Marie: I think she, like most people.

238
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:06.370
Tina Marie: need to hear it from somebody who's not their family right, because there's a level of trust that

239
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.519
Tina Marie: maybe their family

240
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:18.270
Tina Marie: sees them differently. Sees them better than the rest of the world will see them or is oversimplifying, but also people just tend to discount

241
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.930
Tina Marie: their family

242
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:31.849
Tina Marie: and their wisdom and their knowledge. But the other thing is, I think women automatically don't give full weight to a man's perspective in business

243
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.270
Tina Marie: for good reason, but also bad reason. Right is that

244
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:52.619
Tina Marie: our experience is different. But a lot of the reason why it's different is because we see it differently rather than assume it could be the same for us. That's the thing that I have had the experience of. So

245
00:23:54.060 --> 00:24:13.270
Tina Marie: the business world does perceive me and receive me differently. But not all so in general. That is true. I won't be as respected automatically. I won't be paid as well automatically in general, on average.

246
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.909
Tina Marie: But there is a bubble Venn diagram right where none of that's true.

247
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:30.629
Tina Marie: and I don't need the entire circle to welcome me, to pay me all these things. I only need a portion of it, and that, I think, is what people overlook.

248
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:36.730
Tina Marie: They they wait their opinions on averages

249
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:44.419
Tina Marie: where the average isn't the goal wasn't the goal. In the 1st place, they're not the average. And so, anyway.

250
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.370
Tina Marie: but

251
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:56.819
Tina Marie: to hear that from one who's not her family, and 2 who's female might just take down enough of the mental walls and give her enough confidence. I'll give you an example. So

252
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.812
Tina Marie: Dexter would always tell me, and this is before we were anything.

253
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:16.799
Tina Marie: How smart I was, and how well I would do in like more of a corporate environment that I would get paid so much more that I was smarter than X amount of people, and that I was just really

254
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:24.900
Tina Marie: selling myself short, being in this. I am world where you know people, just whatever marketers world's just kind of accessible.

255
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.340
Tina Marie: and

256
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:36.439
Tina Marie: I took some confidence and value from that. But then a woman told me, she said, Tina, you're smarter than most of the people. I pay like 2 or $300 an hour.

257
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:42.889
Tina Marie: and that changed me immediately. I

258
00:25:43.767 --> 00:26:05.349
Tina Marie: had I just I just basically like my whole attitude and demeanor shifted. That's when I basically told Ryan Moran and his partner, who ended up, you know, being able to sell their company, that I helped them build and multiply very quickly. Matt gave me a testimonial for it, and then they they sold it for 10 million dollars, like a year later.

259
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.340
Tina Marie: from Startup, from scratch right?

260
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:08.940
Dan: Yeah.

261
00:26:09.254 --> 00:26:24.640
Tina Marie: Told them like my $15 an hour wasn't enough, and I wanted $40 an hour, and they're like scoffed. And and then, so I left, and then the next time they tried to hire me it was for $100 an hour, and I said no.

262
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.300
Tina Marie: and then Ryan tried to give me 30% of his company to come, manage it and run it in Austin.

263
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.120
Tina Marie: But my point is that it was one lady's comment.

264
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:44.689
Tina Marie: and it was because she ran business, and I believed her. That literally changed

265
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:59.080
Tina Marie: the way that I operated from that point forward. Not just my thoughts, but it came out energetically that basically big fuck you sign across my head. I know I'm swearing a lot, but so that's my point. Is that

266
00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:20.519
Tina Marie: I don't know, but anyway, I'm not, you know, trying to find a new client or anything. Lisa would not be ideal. I don't want to be paid, but I would, if she wants any support, and even just a couple of calls with the 2 of us together might help give her some momentum, and I would just be really happy to see that. So that's on the table again, if she wants it.

267
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.380
Dan: I mean, you can talk to her. I'm not going to perfect.

268
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:28.750
Tina Marie: Yeah.

269
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.280
Dan: Thank you, Jeff.

270
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:37.760
Dan: like you just said it might come better coming from you. I mean, she can hit me up anytime she wants right. So I'm like man, and she knows that.

271
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.969
Tina Marie: My, my whole point is just that us.

272
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:46.673
Dan: I don't know. I mean I I just don't. We're right. I don't know the answer. I don't know if she wants help. I don't know if she right. It's like

273
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.469
Dan: I'm not going to

274
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.500
Dan: if she wants. I that's the whole thing. If someone wants to talk to me, they just need to text me.

275
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.420
Dan: and I'll talk to them right. But I'm not.

276
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:07.269
Dan: I'm not gonna be like, oh, let's let me let me help you get this train on the tracks, because I, to be honest, I already tried to do that, and she

277
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.220
Dan: didn't listen to me. So I'm like.

278
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.110
Tina Marie: You should.

279
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:17.299
Dan: Been doing this the entire time. You've had a Sabbatical. You should have been chipping away at this for a year.

280
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.609
Tina Marie: You know what I feel that very much.

281
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.620
Dan: That you're now like doing the

282
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.209
Dan: the final paper cram, which is fine. I mean, you get it done.

283
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:32.799
Dan: But you, you know, in business. It's like you could have had a year of feedback a year.

284
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:40.029
Dan: you know. Potential lead a year of your flag being out there, being flown for people to whatever.

285
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.150
Dan: And I did tell her. You know I'm like, if you

286
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:56.590
Dan: you know, if you if you put this out there, it will come back to you. You just haven't been putting it out there. So like you have to do the work, and you have to put it out there energetically and like literally.

287
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.530
Tina Marie: Yes.

288
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.076
Dan: But you know, they built a website. It's terrible.

289
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.813
Dan: And it was like, they need the website the next day. I'm like, what are you doing.

290
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:06.720
Tina Marie: Oh, my

291
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.600
Tina Marie: gosh, you're right. Some people just really have to learn the hard way. And in fact, most people do so.

292
00:29:14.263 --> 00:29:19.370
Tina Marie: When they really want the help, and they're really ready for it. They'll ask for it. You're right.

293
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.960
Dan: Yeah.

294
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.560
Tina Marie: You're right. When you're right. You're right. Okay, I get it.

295
00:29:25.957 --> 00:29:26.819
Dan: Yeah, I know.

296
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.899
Dan: And so and I don't.

297
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.229
Dan: Yeah, I don't know.

298
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.729
Dan: And you know, I'm not trying to do anything new. So I'm like whatever. I'll help her? She asked. But I'm certainly not gonna go create a work for myself.

299
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.020
Tina Marie: Right.

300
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.559
Tina Marie: Dang it! I just had it in my brain. Hold on! Wait! I gotta go look at it again.

301
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.129
Tina Marie: No, it wasn't there. I just

302
00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:00.460
Tina Marie: had a freaking thought that I wanted to ask you. Oh, touch bot!

303
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.090
Dan: Yeah.

304
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.079
Tina Marie: Where are we at? With that mark has to do something right.

305
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:06.760
Dan: Nope.

306
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:12.920
Dan: So Eric Eric's building it in in suite.

307
00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:14.799
Tina Marie: Right? Okay.

308
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.550
Dan: I don't know where it's at.

309
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.029
Dan: We can. It's in teamwork, but I I don't know where it's at.

310
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.840
Dan: I know he's I know.

311
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.880
Tina Marie: Is it? It's not on your rocks, though, is it? Is it? On the spreadsheet? You guys go over on Monday, calls.

312
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.140
Dan: No.

313
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.510
Tina Marie: Alright!

314
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.710
Dan: Because there is not a basis thing.

315
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.269
Tina Marie: I wonder if I look up Touchbot.

316
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.990
Tina Marie: Right?

317
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:52.680
Tina Marie: Let's Bob. All products doesn't come up there. I don't even know how I would find it.

318
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.790
Dan: Me, either, because I don't go into teamwork ever.

319
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:06.440
Tina Marie: Let's see. Assigned to filter assigned to Eric.

320
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.860
Dan: I mean it would most likely be in suite law, and I can't imagine there's many tasks in there.

321
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.850
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, I know what I'm supposed to add. Oh, build, touch, bot, and lead flowy due tomorrow.

322
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.380
Tina Marie: No comments.

323
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.169
Dan: He usually just comments done.

324
00:31:31.954 --> 00:31:35.940
Tina Marie: Stacy asked me about something that

325
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.469
Tina Marie: she said was referred out to me.

326
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:40.705
Dan: Yeah.

327
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.759
Tina Marie: I'm gonna go read this.

328
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.330
Dan: It's literally referred out.

329
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.690
Tina Marie: Yeah, no, I'm reading it.

330
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.450
Dan: Oh, yeah, that was.

331
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:48.840
Tina Marie: Oh!

332
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.300
Dan: It's.

333
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:49.850
Tina Marie: Sure.

334
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:56.060
Tina Marie: but I don't know when that got referred to me, or how we're supposed to do this. Let's see.

335
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.479
Tina Marie: Robert circling by. We created a very simple

336
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.279
Tina Marie: refer out, lead information.

337
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.920
Dan: So it's like when Mark brought it up on our call. So it was like a task that came from our call.

338
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.849
Dan: like in October

339
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:20.919
Dan: 1st or September a long time ago. I mean, you could probably look at when that task was created. It was right around then.

340
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.790
Tina Marie: 3 months ago.

341
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:33.549
Dan: Okay. And it's Hey, I don't want them dealing with people that can be referred out. I want them to send the people that have the potential to be referred out back to intake

342
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.810
Dan: and intake. You know

343
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:44.290
Dan: I can't think everyone's name all of a sudden. But the intake people would be like, Oh, this is, I'm calling this person because they can be potentially referred out.

344
00:32:44.440 --> 00:33:04.100
Dan: So then they would call them up and say, Do you want us to send you another. Imagine this is how it goes. He didn't want Robert's people to be having referred out conversations, but they get people that in the conversation that they're in, that they're like, oh, this person could be referred out. So then mark one of those sent back

345
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.460
Dan: too sweet little.

346
00:33:09.506 --> 00:33:15.960
Tina Marie: I think you cut out. You said Mark wanted them to be referred out to Sweetlaw, or something.

347
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:39.480
Dan: He never responds, and I go, and so we kicked it back to you. So I'm like this is of that call like I don't know what else to do here, like I'm communicating directly with Mark, and he like, never answers, I'm like, Bro. What are we doing? So anyway? It's just sitting there. Maybe he doesn't want it, but every time I ask him he says he wants to do it. I'm like, Okay, well, let's do it. Let's close the loop.

348
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.229
Dan: and it's he has to talk to Robert. Robert won't communicate with Eric and I,

349
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.679
Dan: which is fine. I don't really want to talk to him, anyway.

350
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:54.039
Tina Marie: All right referred out. So it was created where to go.

351
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.450
Tina Marie: Originally, 6 months ago.

352
00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.220
Dan: Oh, yeah.

353
00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:02.110
Tina Marie: July 26, th 24.

354
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.290
Dan: Yup!

355
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.189
Tina Marie: Let me go here.

356
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:07.670
Tina Marie: 6.

357
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.960
Tina Marie: Now I'm not. 7, 7, 2624 updating.

358
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:21.739
Tina Marie: Oh, okay. So we will bring that up on our call

359
00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.380
Tina Marie: migrate, hit and run from Lp. To cornerstone.

360
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.350
Dan: Oh, that that's done!

361
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:32.739
Tina Marie: Okay?

362
00:34:36.539 --> 00:34:45.589
Tina Marie: I will reply to Stacy because she asked you. That's Stacey downstair. This is done.

363
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:52.169
Tina Marie: and then figure out how to back, categorize accident. New post that was done, too. Right.

364
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.814
Dan: Yeah.

365
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.750
Tina Marie: Well, not abhishek at Stacey.

366
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.579
Tina Marie: This can be a spout.

367
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.880
Tina Marie: So

368
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:15.860
Tina Marie: QR. Code for gift cards. That was something we're still talking about. I haven't been bringing it up, because touch bot has to be built first.st

369
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.830
Dan: Yeah, exactly.

370
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.680
Tina Marie: Website, Chat support data.

371
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.290
Dan: I think that's done

372
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.370
Dan: excellent. Oh.

373
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.190
Tina Marie: There's no comments on it.

374
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.620
Dan: It says we need to take it.

375
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:38.530
Dan: I think there were 2 tasks. Sometimes multiple tasks get created. And it's like, no, that's actually one thing so pretty sure he did it. Put it live yesterday.

376
00:35:42.072 --> 00:35:46.069
Tina Marie: Have a shag, jeez Eric. There we go.

377
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.989
Tina Marie: Abshek's name just wants to keep like getting selected when I'm.

378
00:35:53.533 --> 00:35:54.320
Dan: That's funny.

379
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.932
Dan: because I can never get him to come up with the letter a. I always have to do UNO.

380
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.770
Tina Marie: So, and then it but sorry.

381
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.970
Dan: No, that's what else.

382
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.890
Tina Marie: Typing Eric and Stacy, and his name keeps selecting.

383
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.800
Dan: That's funny.

384
00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:16.389
Tina Marie: Yeah, okay. Alright, that's everything for them.

385
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:27.530
Tina Marie: Now my doggies are gonna go bonkers. Oh, I bet you that's my other daughter coming home, bucks.

386
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:33.499
Tina Marie: They're gonna lose their minds until she finally walks in the door and hands on.

387
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.680
Tina Marie: Sorry.

388
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.900
Dan: Worse!

389
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:46.830
Tina Marie: Aphrodite. They just have such high pitched, and when they do that, when I'm next to them, I leap out of my skin.

390
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.060
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, she's there. Okay,

391
00:36:53.630 --> 00:37:05.439
Tina Marie: so is there anything going on with Socco? Like, we never talk about him anymore? I know you still talk to him. But like, are you still doing leads for him like what's

392
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.959
Tina Marie: what's going on there.

393
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.495
Dan: No, I don't really do leads for him like we. We tried to do some of these fire leads, but

394
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:38.059
Dan: Facebook is like they wouldn't let me upload videos to this ads account like at all. I was creating it. And I'm like dude. I don't. It just won't. Fucking work. There's no reason. I don't know why it just I upload the video and then it says it it. They're not there. They're not available. So like, I can't run the video ads. And I know the video ads are what work.

395
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:55.660
Dan: And then he was like, screw it. It doesn't matter that he's like it's such a. It's like a swarm of activity on the ground. He's like, we're not gonna get any leads, anyway. So that was like recently. And then but I haven't generated leads for him for like a year at least.

396
00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:03.100
Dan: I know that he's, you know. He's still. He works with Mark every week.

397
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:12.880
Dan: but he's like, you know, it's he's like I got it down to like 5 HA week, or something, and blah! Blah! We don't really talk too much about that.

398
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:22.059
Dan: and then he's you know. His dad passed away, and he's been dealing with. He had that. And then he's dealing with his mom, being a widow, and

399
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.170
Dan: Yada Yada life.

400
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.569
Tina Marie: Yeah, life be life. And on people hang on one sec. I'm gonna mute. So I can tell my daughter something.

401
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.045
Dan: Yeah.

402
00:38:31.764 --> 00:38:34.920
Tina Marie: It's 1 of those days, Dan, appreciate you.

403
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.880
Dan: Oh, no worries.

404
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.700
Tina Marie: Okay, thank you, Dan.

405
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:34.020
Tina Marie: And you know, launching kids is a busy time, and I've been doing it for the last 6 years. Do you know what else? I've been a mom for 27 years I've been raising kids for 27 years.

406
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.569
Dan: Lot of years.

407
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:44.929
Tina Marie: It's I'm fine. Everything's fine. I love my doggies. He's so cute. I have to send you pictures later. Okay.

408
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.609
Tina Marie: all right, Southco, though working 5 HA week with Mark. We don't know what he does.

409
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.540
Tina Marie: They do.

410
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.890
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I know what he does, but like it's

411
00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.930
Dan: he just he's like sort of that second voice, or whatever. And blah blah.

412
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.660
Tina Marie: Oh, does he do? Second voice.

413
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.740
Dan: I mean, I think they were a lot of them. No, no, he's like they run shit by him, and he's like, Hey.

414
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.410
Tina Marie: Oh!

415
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:14.310
Dan: He does like case review, I guess, and then he's also, you know. Then he runs that

416
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.350
Dan: litigation department with Nick, or whatever

417
00:40:18.076 --> 00:40:21.249
Dan: or whoever whoever the little his minion is.

418
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.940
Tina Marie: Yeah.

419
00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:28.690
Tina Marie: Where's some of my just oops

420
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:40.280
Tina Marie: things that for me to think about. Salco violence helps with mitigation and advice

421
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.320
Tina Marie: is Saco, he's married right. But does he have kids.

422
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.640
Dan: Yeah.

423
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.350
Tina Marie: How many kids does she have? Are they all grown.

424
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:52.310
Dan: No?

425
00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:01.860
Dan: 2, and I think so. Marley is maybe in 7th grade, and

426
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:09.510
Dan: Casey is still in elementary school, but he's he's probably like 5, th maybe 4, th or 5.th

427
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.910
Tina Marie: Oh, wow!

428
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.102
Dan: Something like that.

429
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:19.720
Tina Marie: Is he like? Does he spend time with his family? Is he like cause? He always sounds like a workaholic. That's why I'm asking.

430
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:28.495
Dan: Oh, yeah, he goes to all the events. And you know Casey plays basketball and Marley she

431
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:34.720
Dan: I don't know if she does dressage, or she just rides horses. They bought a horse

432
00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.550
Dan: so like he just they just bought a horse not too long ago.

433
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.379
Tina Marie: I must find it.

434
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.820
Tina Marie: They got more stuff.

435
00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:47.935
Dan: They go on like he's a skier. Well, not so much because he got his hip replaced. But

436
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.980
Tina Marie: Oh!

437
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.620
Dan: They go on ski trips and stuff. His wife's from Canada

438
00:41:52.990 --> 00:42:04.710
Dan: so but so sometimes they, the wife and kids will go to Canada or Mexico without him, because her parents are in either of those places. But he goes a bunch of the times, too, depending

439
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.419
Dan: And then his whole thing is like, you know, he he has, like a

440
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:17.015
Dan: co-working type deal, not Co working, but, like, you know, an executive office type setup.

441
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.199
Dan: So he has an office. He used to have a dedicated office, but he got rid of that or the building got sold.

442
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.139
Dan: and so he goes to the executive Office X amount of

443
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:35.309
Dan: time per week. And he's super regimented about working out. So like he does a bunch of work while working out. Essentially.

444
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.080
Dan: But yeah, he's.

445
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.699
Tina Marie: Figure it out like one of those just built differently. People.

446
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.680
Dan: Yeah. He's very disciplined.

447
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.250
Tina Marie: But he must have. I mean, there's a lot that goes with that, including.

448
00:42:51.250 --> 00:43:02.230
Dan: I mean. Andy runs his own, you know he has a firm, but he has 0 interest in like a mark firm. So he has clients, and he's also he also

449
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:07.120
Dan: consults for another firm like he does for mark where he like helps the dude

450
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.279
Dan: run the cases, or whatever

451
00:43:09.975 --> 00:43:16.624
Dan: it's an older pi guy that. And the guy wants him to take over the firm. And maybe he's gonna do it. Maybe he's not.

452
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.910
Dan: He's been. He's been helping that guy for years.

453
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.040
Tina Marie: Is he a genius?

454
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.300
Dan: He's a good lawyer.

455
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.020
Tina Marie: That's not the question.

456
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:34.069
Dan: No, I mean, I just think he's a really good lawyer like he's got a lot of experience, and he's got a really

457
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.850
Dan: great network because he's been doing it so like he

458
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:47.649
Dan: when he started and he worked for Sherman. So his dad was partners with Sherman. Who is this dude

459
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.270
Dan: Sherman was big in the mass port world

460
00:43:53.590 --> 00:44:01.970
Dan: early, and there were not a lot of people in that world. And so Salco worked, you know, under that guy in the late nineties.

461
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.130
Dan: and then, as a result of that.

462
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:11.809
Dan: you know, got associated and made a name for himself in that space. And then that's how I got involved with them.

463
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:14.679
Dan: And then he's a good.

464
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.440
Dan: He's a good lawyer like he's really good at like seeing shit that

465
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:28.820
Dan: other lawyers don't see, and and then and then he's like very calculated in, you know, executing it, or whatever.

466
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.880
Tina Marie: Was he ever in the military.

467
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.160
Dan: No.

468
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:33.770
Tina Marie: Oh!

469
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.429
Dan: No, he went to. I think he went to Ucsd.

470
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.549
Dan: and then I forget where he went to law school.

471
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.930
Dan: But you know his Dad was a lawyer, so then he, you know, became a lawyer.

472
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.740
Dan: He's an only child.

473
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.080
Tina Marie: That explains a lot.

474
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:50.695
Dan: Yeah.

475
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.560
Tina Marie: That actually explains a lot. Okay, not just 1st born, but only child. Okay.

476
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.351
Dan: Yeah. And then, like his grandfather, is like.

477
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.260
Dan: like old Hollywood, famous old Hollywood, to the point where, like.

478
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:14.620
Dan: you know, in the eighties, seventies and eighties. They people would hear last name, Salco, and they'd be like, wait, are you the blah blah Salco? And he'd be like, yep.

479
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:20.746
Dan: so like I think his grandfather was like President of, you know, universal, or some shit.

480
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.669
Tina Marie: Wow! That's crazy.

481
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.285
Dan: Yeah. So he's he knows tons of celebrities. He doesn't like that world.

482
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.299
Tina Marie: How did he and Mark meet.

483
00:45:32.128 --> 00:45:35.960
Dan: Mark work. Mark ran

484
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.650
Dan: that phone room. So even though Mark's a lawyer, Mark was not a lawyer, prior.

485
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.020
Dan: maybe Mark would probably hate me saying it like this. But

486
00:45:47.300 --> 00:46:02.822
Dan: even though Mark is a lawyer, Mark was not a lawyer at the law firm that he worked for before he was started, Sweetlaw, before Steve plucked him out and said, I'm gonna build a law firm with your name on it. Mark was basically

487
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.579
Dan: the head of intake with a law degree.

488
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.130
Dan: He did not represent clients.

489
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:18.410
Dan: so he sort of like ran the phone room. And then he, I think that's how Selco and he met, or they met

490
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.690
Dan: through some sort of event.

491
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.599
Dan: And then Selco, essentially.

492
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:32.489
Dan: Mark would never cop to this. But it's the absolute fucking truth. Salco took mark under his wing

493
00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:41.069
Dan: and was like, Okay, I'm gonna he basically mentored Mark and paid him thousands of dollars a month

494
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:47.530
Dan: to be there. And so they did that for years.

495
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:54.239
Dan: until Steve came up with this Cockamamie scheme about building a law firm around Mark.

496
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.750
Dan: which failed on its outset, and then he like.

497
00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:03.590
Dan: But like the the setup was this like when it was all going down South was like.

498
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:15.819
Dan: Steve is gonna fuck mark and leave him holding the bag and like just bail. And he did. But Mark managed to not manage to like pull it out.

499
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:24.880
Dan: It like Steve left with didn't give a shit whether Mark lived or died, swim, swim, or drown.

500
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:31.390
Dan: And Mark pulled it off because he had these couple vendors

501
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:41.880
Dan: that he had found right. The the plan was that Steve was gonna fund. The blah blah and most of the leads were gonna come from Google ads. And I was like dude that shit house

502
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:48.529
Dan: his. He does not know how to run Google ads. And they spend a lot of money on Google ads. And it did not work.

503
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.769
Dan: So then the numbers didn't look good to Steve right.

504
00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:02.461
Dan: So then he he bailed, and then he went and bought another brand, which coincidentally happened to have the word sweet in it, which was really funny.

505
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.539
Tina Marie: What? What was the brand?

506
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.740
Dan: That other firm that we're the billboard Guy.

507
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.689
Tina Marie: Not sweet, James.

508
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:15.389
Dan: Yes. So then then he went and bought sweet James.

509
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:20.080
Tina Marie: The the what's his face? The one that Steve bought sweet James.

510
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.000
Dan: Yes.

511
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:22.750
Tina Marie: Know that.

512
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:23.810
Dan: Oh, yeah.

513
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:29.240
Tina Marie: You guys probably told me this. But every time these types of conversations start, we're.

514
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.639
Dan: Well, it's hard. Yeah. It would hard for be hard for you to follow that.

515
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.260
Tina Marie: Yes.

516
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.849
Dan: Great train of thought, like as a wait. What? Who, what?

517
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:41.720
Tina Marie: The conversation is never linear, like it has been like, you've just been going over a timeline for me. And

518
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.650
Tina Marie: yeah, yeah, it's not

519
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:51.930
Tina Marie: happened like that. But that's really useful context, like, really, I don't even understand. If Mark understands how rare

520
00:48:52.120 --> 00:49:06.889
Tina Marie: his growth and trajectory is. Speaking of newness and entrepreneurship, and like I'm trying to explain to him how good Tona is doing, and of course he's always nothing's good enough, big enough, whatever, and I don't think that he realizes

521
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:12.469
Tina Marie: how much pressure that can put on somebody, especially a woman, and especially a wife.

522
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.819
Tina Marie: And it it's good in a way, right, because

523
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:29.920
Tina Marie: it will extract out of her something nobody else would be able to do. No one. And I think that that's the great thing about powerful partners. But it's all. It's a double edged sword kind of thing.

524
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:34.290
Tina Marie: But this is not anywhere near normal.

525
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:54.919
Tina Marie: like I've seen this type of thing over and over again. But I'm aware of exceptional that that I work with exceptional people like a huge reason why my results. It would be impossible for my results to be so exceptional without exceptional people, because they'll just do things differently. But that is not normal for him to have survived that.

526
00:49:55.230 --> 00:50:05.680
Tina Marie: then been able to succeed, and then to have the multiples that he's had especially well, kind of doing so little.

527
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.240
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, totally.

528
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.702
Tina Marie: This is just not normal by any means.

529
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:12.840
Dan: Nope.

530
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.800
Dan: Not at all.

531
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:20.369
Tina Marie: Well, I know that that felt like a probably a big tangent, but it actually is

532
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:26.810
Tina Marie: really helpful and revealing to me to understand even more

533
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.160
Tina Marie: what is possible, and probably more the value of

534
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:39.739
Tina Marie: Mark and the people that he talks to, because there's no way he would have been successful without

535
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:51.530
Tina Marie: you, without Salco like it's in him. But what is in him in in huge part, is who he talks to, and how he talks to them.

536
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.030
Dan: For sure. Yeah, yep.

537
00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.290
Dan: And I mean, that's why I always thought it was

538
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.279
Dan: funny that he does. He's so reticent to

539
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:15.060
Dan: like do something with Salko. I'm like, I don't know. I mean, you've been doing it with him, I mean, I get it like now it's like, Oh, the cake is already baked, or whatever, and I'm like I don't. You know.

540
00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:22.119
Tina Marie: It may also be along the lines of, I don't want to get married because we'll ruin our relationship. Type of thinking.

541
00:51:23.133 --> 00:51:28.740
Dan: No, it's more auto. Salco is a very

542
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:36.839
Dan: has a lot of presence, even though he's a small dude like he's not a tall guy, but he's like a he's like a little bulldog.

543
00:51:38.012 --> 00:51:41.140
Tina Marie: I got that on the one call we had together.

544
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.640
Dan: Is jacked.

545
00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:43.615
Dan: And

546
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:57.289
Dan: you know, Mark is romper room, and Selco is not romper room right, although Mark is moving away from Romper room. So I think that was really the thing is that it would cramp mark style.

547
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.710
Dan: But Mark's style is changing, so maybe that'll change.

548
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:07.800
Tina Marie: You know. What's funny is that if you look up, Richard Salco, sweet law stuff comes up the most.

549
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:15.389
Dan: Oh, yeah, Salko's not, doesn't really put himself out there as well. Everything he gets is referral. He doesn't advertise. He never has.

550
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.220
Dan: It's all referral.

551
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:47.959
Tina Marie: So like I'm looking at it, and I'm going to images, and there's him some other dude a yelp review, socolaw.com then, sweetlaw.com, then a picture, and that's Mark's hero image, then it's Mark's image, then it's Salco Law, some other dude. Then it's Patrick, then Salco Law. Then mark again like, and then Nick Tyler. No, I think that one's Tyler.

552
00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.560
Tina Marie: I'm gonna do.

553
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.010
Dan: Neck. It's Tyler.

554
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.029
Tina Marie: Big, thick neck. Well, I mean Patrick has a thicker neck than that.

555
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.210
Dan: Does, he.

556
00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.629
Tina Marie: Lives in the gym. He's such a cute little boy. He's like 28, or 29, but like

557
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.659
Tina Marie: I'm almost old enough to be his mother, he but he reminds me of my brother. Anyway, I'm just. He just looks like a little boy to me.

558
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.350
Tina Marie: cute little boy.

559
00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:13.120
Tina Marie: but he's a grown man. I have to remember that, and not treat him like a little boy.

560
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:20.750
Tina Marie: I think I might call him kiddo on calls sometimes it's probably not professional, but you know what Tina's a little different.

561
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.050
Dan: It happens.

562
00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:33.620
Tina Marie: It does feel like I don't know. I love everybody, and they fit in something. They're either like brother basically or kid and or sister, you know that type of thing. But

563
00:53:34.883 --> 00:53:38.610
Tina Marie: okay, so that was helpful.

564
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:47.820
Tina Marie: I know we're working on Touchbot. Which I think so, for Mark.

565
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:54.690
Tina Marie: it all comes down to the the, to the thing

566
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.490
Tina Marie: to focus on. For me when we're talking is

567
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:06.600
Tina Marie: what is optimizable, that we're not optimizing. And there is definitely room in

568
00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:10.619
Tina Marie: on the law side of it, right on on his team.

569
00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:16.290
Tina Marie: And I learn a lot about that every week from Lorenz.

570
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.650
Tina Marie: His stats are improving significantly.

571
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:26.889
Tina Marie: and I don't get to talk to his team, and we've only been working together 6 months, which you know, is mostly groundwork, right?

572
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:28.670
Dan: Yep.

573
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:40.759
Tina Marie: I think that this year's compounding is gonna be awesome because the things that they're doing, the way that they're the structure of their meetings. They're doing role playing for call control now.

574
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:51.539
Tina Marie: and they like it. So they used to not be on video. And they used to be very quiet. You. You've been on meetings where people don't participate, I'm sure, right.

575
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:53.269
Dan: Oh, yeah.

576
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.079
Tina Marie: Yeah, they're super productive. Right?

577
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:56.880
Dan: Yeah.

578
00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:17.540
Tina Marie: So now, because they're doing role playing and stuff they have to put their cameras on. And that wasn't going over very well. But then they really got into it, because Mike Mike was a ham, and Mike was playing, you know, the difficult client, and they just all just kind of like that was so fun to them.

579
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.670
Tina Marie: But fun in

580
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:33.670
Tina Marie: just, you know, the a good productive way, so like he had veery veery just never said anything. She came in. She did her work. She went home, but she was basically like a Chihuahua, just like

581
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:56.030
Tina Marie: shaking intimidated kind of energy, like she was scared of losing her job. Kind of like the way Lorenz was all the way up, until maybe just a few months ago. I think I'm finally starting to get him out of that. But when people are scared they're not performing in an excellent way. They're not performing anywhere near their potential because they're too worried about screwing up to try to play great.

582
00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:18.880
Tina Marie: So getting Lorenz out of his shell and building him up. And he's getting his team out of their shells. You know the energy is shifting. So Lorenz's biggest issue was pace. Well, I think the biggest reason he is slow is not his brain. I think it's his fear.

583
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:27.349
Tina Marie: and I'm good at getting people out of there scared, you know, and he is coming out and feeling stronger and better.

584
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:45.810
Tina Marie: He's always going to probably overanalyze things. But he's spending more time actually working and doing and learning that you can't do all the things that you think about right. So pick the one that's going to get you the furthest, the fastest, with the most compounding, most leverage all that stuff.

585
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.589
Tina Marie: and he finally just kind of hit that stride

586
00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:55.580
Tina Marie: were February really, last month. I feel like so

587
00:56:55.700 --> 00:57:07.649
Tina Marie: he was doing good, but then December just slapped him, and he's too sensitive to take a blow of bad numbers and not let it spill into the rest of the months.

588
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:31.629
Tina Marie: But they had a huge well. He's been measuring his wins right, and they've been starting to celebrate wins which is forcing him to pay attention to it and the whole purpose. The whole reason I want people to celebrate wins is because of the power and the energy. It's really difficult to stay depressed and focusing on the negative things. When you are in the practice of

589
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:52.780
Tina Marie: celebrating the good things like, even if you're faking it like the science shows that if you smile, even though you're faking it eventually it becomes real, and your body starts to produce the same type of chemicals that it does when you're actually happy. So faking it actually, you know, in that in that space works.

590
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.970
Tina Marie: But last week Mark second voiced for him

591
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.950
Tina Marie: and they got a 7 figure settlement case.

592
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:07.630
Tina Marie: So he's already met his 2025 goal. I don't think he did that. I don't know if he's ever done that.

593
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.000
Dan: Nice.

594
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:27.220
Tina Marie: Yeah. So anyway. And then and then there's Patrick, and Patrick is new. And I actually haven't been talking to him for the last 3 weeks, because Hank bailed, and Patrick got all of his cases, which put Patrick at having the most open cases out of anybody in suite law.

595
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.800
Tina Marie: How great do you think that that was? And I'm being completely sarcastic.

596
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.980
Dan: Yeah. Not great.

597
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.259
Tina Marie: Right, not great. So he's just buckling, and he's preparing to take the Nevada boards.

598
00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.600
Dan: Oh, really.

599
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.309
Tina Marie: Bar. Board, yeah. Bar.

600
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:43.020
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

601
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.189
Tina Marie: Bar exam, yeah. So he's got a lot going on. But

602
00:58:47.500 --> 00:59:10.290
Tina Marie: all that's to say, like, you know, talking about Mark and his team like. It is difficult to find the people to keep the people. And there are issues. But there's some great stuff going on, and a lot of it is Mark's willingness to invest in them to go get training. That Black Swan training definitely did something. The grief counseling training was helpful to them.

603
00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:17.519
Tina Marie: He doesn't touch a lot of things, and he doesn't touch them frequently. But what he does

604
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:25.253
Tina Marie: do has some good benefits. So that's good. Okay, let's wrap up with

605
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:33.390
Tina Marie: mom, really, I guess. Oh, another 71, just anything cool to report because it's been

606
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:36.249
Tina Marie: interesting, to say the least.

607
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:41.660
Dan: Just like.

608
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:47.639
Dan: So I had, I think I had the realization. I was like, Okay, well, we're doing like 35 a day.

609
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.380
Dan: And then

610
00:59:49.880 --> 01:00:02.310
Dan: it's basically like 50, 50, 67 to 87 more and more people are upgrading from 67 to 87. So like, we had 12 people upgrade last week.

611
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.059
Tina Marie: Oh, look at that, Jeff!

612
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:08.170
Dan: So. And that's like from inside the Dojo, basically

613
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.230
Dan: And then

614
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:19.788
Dan: so you know, we'll finish March. And then I was like, Oh, man. You know, we're not even in the high season. So

615
01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:24.339
Dan: we're not gonna know what's really happening until the end of August.

616
01:00:25.258 --> 01:00:33.259
Dan: So like, I was just talking to Jeff today. And I was like, I wonder if I could figure out what I think is gonna happen based on what has happened

617
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:48.499
Dan: right? If we got a 10% increase in the slow season, what is the normal increase in the high season? And then, if I just throw another 10 on top of that is that 40? Is that 38? Is that like

618
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.800
Dan: it's actually probably 38, or 39. Now that I do it in my head.

619
01:00:52.278 --> 01:01:00.939
Dan: Which would be great. But then I'm like, why, even bother doing that? I just have to wait. So subscription business equals waiting, that's all there is to it.

620
01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:03.250
Tina Marie: And then.

621
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:04.670
Dan: There's like the whole.

622
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:08.250
Dan: The whole idea of it, you know

623
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:14.070
Dan: the conservative estimate is that it will take 19 months to churn out

624
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.619
Dan: core 67 people that make up our customer base right now.

625
01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:26.850
Dan: So, but that number is even higher, because I tried to do that math on another 71. And I think I said

626
01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.870
Dan: I might have this wrong.

627
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:43.229
Dan: I wanna say, Oh, yeah, they're all gonna be gone by like last last November. But I actually think it was the November before. So like even when I tried to do the math of like when it would drain out to 0, it still isn't 0. There are still people in there.

628
01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:46.480
Tina Marie: Was it the one before, or the one before, that? It's been a while? Damn.

629
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.139
Dan: I don't even know but it I was wrong.

630
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.780
Tina Marie: Yeah.

631
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.610
Dan: So you I don't think you can actually do that math.

632
01:01:52.830 --> 01:02:03.259
Dan: Therefore the 19 months is conservative. At best. It's based on the perfect perfect world scenario, like, everything goes exactly according to plan or according to math.

633
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.029
Dan: So I'm like, okay, so what? You're 24, you're 28 months

634
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.730
Dan: from actually knowing what what this is doing now. Granted

635
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:19.197
Dan: by the end of August you can say we now have an X per year business.

636
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.720
Dan: you know I but I don't know what that number is.

637
01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:25.760
Tina Marie: No.

638
01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.239
Dan: So yeah, it's good stuff.

639
01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.790
Dan: That's what I was telling Denise. Denise last night was like.

640
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.689
Dan: so like, Are you retired? I go kind of.

641
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.190
Tina Marie: Kind of yeah.

642
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.730
Dan: I'm like, in a way like.

643
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.520
Tina Marie: I just do puzzles.

644
01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.560
Dan: Yeah, I'm like, sort of.

645
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:51.449
Tina Marie: Before we go out you're gonna come back. Okay? She wants to drop herself off. Okay, I love you. Can. I have hugs when you come back.

646
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.390
Tina Marie: Are you coming in? Okay, okay.

647
01:02:54.940 --> 01:03:02.350
Tina Marie: just making sure it wasn't the gas chamber I'm getting. I'm getting. Oh, Hi!

648
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:11.560
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh, Hi! That's my child. Okay, she's leaving to go get my other child. Yeah. So what did she say when you answered like that?

649
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.419
Dan: I don't, you know. I don't think she totally gets it.

650
01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:23.899
Tina Marie: Has she ever, though? Because, like the we don't actually like when you describe the money that you have.

651
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.950
Dan: Well, and then she was like, So are you. So you guys don't want to sell it. Now I go. No, I still want to sell it, but

652
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:36.079
Dan: we can't sell it for 28 months like we would be selling.

653
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:40.310
Dan: I mean, maybe we could. We certainly can't sell it.

654
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.630
Dan: Well, no, we can't, because we're

655
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.839
Dan: I don't know. I have to do the math. I have to figure out like, how do I actually figure out

656
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.807
Dan: there's the 35 customers a day thing, I mean, that's the other thing is in the.

657
01:03:55.407 --> 01:03:57.770
Tina Marie: 3.7, and have see how.

658
01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:06.629
Dan: Subscribers keep going up right? So I'm like, Oh, you'd have to redo that math, and then you'd have to do the math of like, what does it look? So I could do the math.

659
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.460
Tina Marie: I'll do.

660
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:17.559
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I mean, in August, I can do the math of oh, this is our ceiling. Our ceiling is really not based on 39 a day. Our ceiling is 4,800 subscribers.

661
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:23.729
Dan: And then I could take that and go. Okay, 4,800 blah blah, it's 4.2 million a year, whatever the hell it is

662
01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.820
Dan: so. But you might not be

663
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:34.190
Dan: actually getting 4.2 million until this other process underneath is churning out.

664
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:38.240
Dan: So it might be. You might have a 4.2 million dollar

665
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:45.550
Dan: business in the calculator. But you have to wait for these things to come to fruition like

666
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:47.479
Dan: you need that.

667
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.420
Tina Marie: Have those multiples like showing up for the valuation to work right.

668
01:04:51.672 --> 01:04:56.719
Dan: Yeah, I mean, or or you would have to explain it to someone to go. This is what's happening like.

669
01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.290
Dan: and it would show up in the numbers, because the number would keep going up, even though

670
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.950
Dan: the revenue should keep going up, even though the subscribers don't.

671
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:28.360
Tina Marie: And your ability to explain that to somebody who doesn't understand it, just increase exponentially with Grok, so that you know, rather than taking your word for it, something that they can't understand, and they would only be able to either take your word for it or not. There would be another source to go to.

672
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:33.659
Dan: I'm having a very deep discussion with Grock right now about

673
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:44.650
Dan: creating funds to sign artists to like basically to have like a private equity approach to working with artists under Mom.

674
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.670
Dan: So I've been talking to crack about that since last night.

675
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.259
Tina Marie: Haven't haven't gotten the math yet.

676
01:05:54.705 --> 01:06:01.269
Dan: I it's it's super helpful. I'll I'll read things and go. Oh, okay, I gotta consider. Oh, I should. I should mention this.

677
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:03.750
Dan: I'm trying to get to.

678
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.640
Dan: Well, and to me the play is

679
01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:17.679
Dan: so I'm trying to model this out. You could have multiple funds. But I'm like, well, you gotta start with the one that's got a the most potential

680
01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:32.970
Dan: or the one not even potential. The one that's actually cash flowing potential would be a new artist like oh, I love their sound, whatever! Who gives a shit? There's no numbers. You gotta start with the ones that got numbers. So like Lansdown a good example. Taproots, a good example.

681
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:36.319
Dan: And then it's like, Okay, well, if they're doing

682
01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:44.269
Dan: $4,000 a month in streaming. And I want to get an investor. I got to promise the investor 12 to 15% return

683
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.490
Dan: is 4 grand, even enough.

684
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.779
Dan: And then if I'm offering them 12 to 15% return.

685
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.009
Dan: That's over what period of time

686
01:06:53.260 --> 01:07:10.640
Dan: and then in a PE situation, usually you exit. But I'm like, we're we're not necessarily going to exit. Because if an artist really increases over time, then it becomes cash flow. So you're really building to cash flow, or you're building to a potential exit. So you'd have to position it like that.

687
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:16.220
Dan: because P. And E is definitely like, Hey, here's your money. We're gonna sell it in 7 years, or whatever.

688
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.220
Dan: So the question is, if I

689
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.590
Dan: take one of these distressed assets is what I'm calling in what's what's my floor

690
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:35.740
Dan: right there. There's a level of what it's not gonna work. They're making a thousand bucks a month. I'm guessing that won't plug into the model. Very well.

691
01:07:36.579 --> 01:07:43.759
Dan: And then what am I getting right? If I'm offering if I'm giving an investor 12 to 15%. Well, what does Mom make

692
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.580
Dan: from that? I don't know.

693
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.519
Dan: It's a lot of math.

694
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.110
Dan: So we're mathing it up right now.

695
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:52.850
Tina Marie: I like natural.

696
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:56.719
Tina Marie: Want to at least like big mess on a kid on that side.

697
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:57.650
Dan: Well.

698
01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:01.200
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, I just got probably more Dorky than I need to be.

699
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:08.590
Tina Marie: I like that. So let me just think for a second.

700
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:18.400
Tina Marie: I can't. There it's all it's it's 1 of those weeks ending where everything's in progress.

701
01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.010
Tina Marie: And

702
01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:28.759
Tina Marie: you're already working on it all the all the things. So I don't have great questions to ask you today, because you're in the middle of it.

703
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:29.880
Dan: Don't!

704
01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:37.970
Tina Marie: It's interesting, though, too, the one thing that I've noticed and this is

705
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:41.250
Tina Marie: hard to explain to other people.

706
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.159
Tina Marie: That it so how do I say this?

707
01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.359
Tina Marie: You don't get

708
01:08:51.170 --> 01:09:02.740
Tina Marie: Big Bang type conversations or actions for the most part, whether it be in business or life in growth. But what you get is like

709
01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:11.550
Tina Marie: catalyst points, and they in and of themselves don't feel like anything big or exciting.

710
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:21.870
Tina Marie: But what they are is the that little spark. But when somebody does something with it, it turns into something huge. And it's these

711
01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:27.737
Tina Marie: pivotal questions, but also

712
01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:40.949
Tina Marie: Then then it's the follow up research like. It's almost always that. So like, if I ask a question, your answer almost every time is, I got to go look that up. I got to go look into that.

713
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:54.550
Tina Marie: And then, and it's the same thing for me, like if I get a thought that it isn't the thought that does the thing. It's doing some research and then kind of starting down the path. And it's interesting to me because you can't

714
01:09:55.310 --> 01:10:03.020
Tina Marie: force those things to happen. They're not in a linear path. They're in an exploratory path.

715
01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:08.679
Tina Marie: and I find that there are people so like Fuji, for example.

716
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:22.279
Tina Marie: I talk a lot, and he wants to clip conversations. He doesn't do it so much anymore, because he's learned that he can't give me short answers, and he can't keep cutting me off because he would cut me off a lot.

717
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.750
Tina Marie: and I would say, you, you really need to let this whole thing play out or not be here because

718
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:55.079
Tina Marie: it's in this depth that there's stuff and it like I said, it's not linear like, you just kind of have to meander in the conversation. It just really annoys a lot of people. But that's really where something happens. And I kind of think that that's the magic of the entrepreneur brain, because generally they're Adhd types and they aren't linear.

719
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.270
Tina Marie: And they.

720
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.870
Dan: Yes.

721
01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:03.510
Tina Marie: Get annoyed by the linear rather than the other way around, anyway. Just kind of like

722
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:17.800
Tina Marie: having kind of a new awareness or a new, more, I guess, specific words and language and understanding like you have kind of that awareness in a ambiguous.

723
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:23.920
Tina Marie: like an internal understanding way, but being able to

724
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:27.720
Tina Marie: put words to it, label it, and

725
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:48.930
Tina Marie: consider the the behavior like. What are the signals that people give that say I am this type of person, and I will behave this type of way versus the ones that say, I am this type of person, and I am incapable of operating that type of way, but like potentially and not for sure. Elisa, right, who

726
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:56.060
Tina Marie: went from? Who, who, for all intents and purposes has been a

727
01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:01.019
Tina Marie: company person. Right? So the company starts with school

728
01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:14.069
Tina Marie: because we're bred to be that, and then secondary school. And then corporate world right like, that's that's what we are. And a lot of times. Those employee type mindsets are just.

729
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:20.539
Tina Marie: I don't know. It's hard to explore, and they can't always

730
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.640
Tina Marie: break out of that, either, because of the way that they think.

731
01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:30.410
Tina Marie: meaning the way that they're wired to think as an ability or lack thereof.

732
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:37.810
Tina Marie: or the way that they think because of the way that they've been trained to think, and the fear of thinking otherwise. Does that make sense.

733
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.020
Dan: Yeah.

734
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.699
Tina Marie: Anyway, I was just contemplating probably are the ones.

735
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:49.109
Dan: Oh, yeah, I'll go talk to Grock, and it'll be like, Thank you.

736
01:12:49.260 --> 01:13:00.660
Tina Marie: I'm annoyed with Grok Grok wasted my time, and I had to correct it, and I'm like how stupid I should not be out thinking you on this. You're a coder. I'm not. And they're like, Yeah, you're right.

737
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:07.629
Dan: Yeah, I think it's just really good. It's the best I've seen for data analysis. It's insane.

738
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:22.079
Dan: How good it like I got it to do something yesterday. And I'm like, if this works I'm gonna fucking. This will blow my mind. Chat, Gpt. I can't even get to count the number of words correctly like, how many words does this appear in the spreadsheet? They can't do it.

739
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:36.110
Dan: This I was like. I gave it 3 spreadsheets, and I noticed that one spreadsheet was missing, a column that the others had, which was the Tiktok, the actual Tiktok URL.

740
01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:41.399
Dan: But the scrape data had these other Urls that were from the scraper.

741
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:49.590
Dan: and I looked at those, and and I realized, oh, the very last bit of the URL after the final dash

742
01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:55.440
Dan: is actually the Tiktok video. Id. So I was like, Hey.

743
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.099
Tina Marie: Oh, you need that.

744
01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:25.339
Dan: I go, hey? This is you. If you look at this, the the video Id is here in this in this column, and I go, and you know it. It knows it knew the structure of what a Tiktok URL is, which is Tiktok user, username video Id. And I go. And if you look, here's an example of it working from the other sheet I go. Can you just build the Urls now? And it was like, Oh, that's a really good catch. Here you go.

745
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:32.210
Dan: and I was like I was like, give me one and see, I'll tell you if it works. And it went out and it worked. Okay, now give me all of them.

746
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:38.500
Dan: I was like, thank God, I don't have to go re-scrape this fucking thing which I was dreading.

747
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:47.679
Tina Marie: Why, cause I haven't ever done any scraping of anything. But can't some of the tools the AI tools just do that now.

748
01:14:48.770 --> 01:15:00.000
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I that's I use some scraper thing, but I don't know why this one call I must have accidentally deleted it had so many columns, and I and I like

749
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:09.559
Dan: must have deleted it by accident. I didn't realize it was missing. I was like, why, and then I went and looked at the original source, and I was like, shit the columns gone.

750
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.830
Dan: and then I was like, there's no way for me to get that back.

751
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:13.950
Tina Marie: Oh!

752
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:22.539
Dan: Other than other than to rescrape it, and I did not want to do that because it would take forever. But it built the Urls. They all worked, and then I moved along.

753
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.460
Dan: Oh, okay, so it's time consuming. That makes sense, though. Oh, yeah.

754
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:38.179
Dan: it would take like, you gotta go. I got to another software run the script, set it up, run the scrape, wait for it, download it. It's like when the data was right there. I was like, oh, if it could do this, it would be great, and it did it.

755
01:15:38.720 --> 01:16:01.690
Tina Marie: I'm trying to see what pydantic with Archon and Lane Graph can do together, because there's some autonomy in it. There's a lot of strategy pre-built in the libraries. And at least that's what has been around for like the last 2 years, and they've been improving it for the last 2 years kind of quietly. Well, not a lot of people knew about it.

756
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.320
Tina Marie: But

757
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:17.030
Tina Marie: yeah, but I but I don't know until I experience myself, because you know how people like to hype things up. What's also interesting to me, though, is how people like, oh, this one's so good! I'm firing the rest of them like. Do you understand that they all have different skill sets.

758
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.290
Dan: That's what it yep, totally.

759
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:46.480
Tina Marie: Yeah. And I'm like for you to just be like, I don't want to pay $20 a month, or I don't even want to pay $200 a month. I'm like, if you can't make that thing earn you. Your money back. And I'm talking about these are, you know, supposedly 7 figure earners. I'm like, you're really looking at it wrong, like you're the same person that wants to pay somebody $5 an hour for something that is worth, you know, thousands or even millions to you like that. Just that's such stupid math.

760
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.010
Dan: Yeah.

761
01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:59.339
Tina Marie: But you know how I feel about these things, anyway. Okay, I will be quiet. You, sir, have a good day and a good weekend. Thank you for your patience and your flexibility. Appreciate you.

762
01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:00.460
Dan: Do you.

763
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:01.990
Tina Marie: Have a good day.

764
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:02.960
Dan: All right. You, too.

765
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:03.980
Tina Marie: Purple.

766
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:05.760
Dan: Yellow.

767
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:06.670
Tina Marie: Bye.
