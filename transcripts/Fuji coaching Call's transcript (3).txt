00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Esther: Can you hear me?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Tina Marie: Yes. How are you?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Esther: I'm good. I'm in Mari's bedroom that hasn't been set up yet.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Esther: I was going to take the call from my room, but she's napping in the closet right now, so.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Esther: Didn't want to wake her up.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Tina Marie: Are you feeling good yet? You sound like you're still sick.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Esther: Um. I'm still like. I still have a I'm still a little bit congested, and I'm still like.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Esther: Having coughing fits when I go to sleep at night a little bit, but it's getting better. Yeah. Usually my coughs like linger for a good couple of weeks. Um!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Tina Marie: That's exhausting.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Esther: And then um my my girlfriend and I um bff and I. We went to a concert on Monday night.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Esther: So that set me back 2 paces, too. But it was.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: Worth it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Esther: It was worth it. Yes, absolutely.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Tina Marie: What'd you go see?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Esther: Um one of the Bts members. J. Hope he um. It's doing a solo tour right now. So we went to see him.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Esther: He's incredible, so talented. It's amazing.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tina Marie: You're like, definitely worth it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Esther: Definitely worth it. It was wonderful. Um! How are you after it sounds like you were. You've been traveling.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Tina Marie: I have been traveling a lot this month, and then yesterday I drove over 400 miles, cause I went to go buy a new car.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Esther: A lot. Whoa!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Tina Marie: And it was the end of the Nissan year, and it's also the tariffs are coming, maybe, but just in case like, I'm not trying to deal with those car prices. And I've been making the plans for a while.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Tina Marie: And then it just happened to be that the. Um that I got to ride in one in an uber of a car, that it's in the 2025 model of what I've already had.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Tina Marie: And I love the tech package, and I love how it wrote and everything. So I was like making calls like a crazy woman for 3 days straight, trying to find.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: Somebody that has the model I want, and the colors that I want and everything else. And I found it. But it was like 200 miles away. I'm like I don't care. I'll be there. Let's go.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Esther: Oh! Where? What did you buy.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Tina Marie: So. It's a it's a Nissan rogue.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Tina Marie: And it's a 2025, and it's got a platinum package, and they've got um pro pilot assist, which does a lot of driving for you. So on those really long drives. It's way less exhausting to get that help.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Mhm.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Tina Marie: And it just rides so nice, and it is almost impossible to beat the features that it has for the price that it has.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Tina Marie: Plus my last rogue. I had 0 service issues in the 8 years that I had it 7.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Esther: Oh, good! Good! Okay. So oh, does it? So it does. Does it have like a.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Tina Marie: Yes, and my daughters will be excited.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Esther: Autopilot feature, or something.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Tina Marie: Basically yeah.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Esther: Oh, yeah.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Tina Marie: But only really so only on the the fast roads, and you have to have really good lines painted on the roads.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Esther: That's fine!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Tina Marie: And I live in Oregon, and it is really poorly run. So.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Esther: I see.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Tina Marie: Um. There's a lot of times that it doesn't work, but. Yeah. And then so like, I have diabetes. But.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Esther: Oh!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Tina Marie: It's mostly that I my blood sugar goes low, like I've always dealt with hypoglycemia.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Tina Marie: And every day after breakfast my blood sugar just crashes, and it'll crash sometimes like a hundred points. In less than an hour.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Tina Marie: And it feels like death. So I'm hot and dizzy and shaky.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Tina Marie: And I thought that I am like, what if I have some vinegar like? I'm trying all the different things to. Help my body.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Tina Marie: And so I thought it was great. I was like, Yay, let's go have calls. And now I feel it. So if I start chugging vitamin water, basically sugar, water. Don't mind me. Okay.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Esther: Okay, no worries. Please do what you need to do.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Tina Marie: Life is fun. Bodies are fun, aren't they, Esther?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Esther: They are. I mean.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Tina Marie: As as you cough.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Esther: Like I'm you know. I Fuji wrote me an order for an MRI for my wrist cause I don't know what I did to it, but it's starting, you know. It kind of hurts a little bit.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Esther: Then I've yet to call um. Like our network here.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Esther: To see you know how much the MRI is gonna cost um like. Oh, is it worth it? You know, because it's all going to the deductible first.st

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Esther: You know so.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Tina Marie: You make enough money to not think about these things like this, and this is something I I want to. I want you to understand.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Esther: Okay.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Tina Marie: Always invest in energy. Always invest in knowledge, always invest in tools because tools help you maximize. The knowledge. Knowledge helps you maximize the energy. Your body is the best tool that you have for all of your life experiences.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Tina Marie: Understanding what you can sooner rather than later. 1st of all, gives you a baseline. Let's say you've got bone spurs. Let's say you've got osteoarthritis developing, or some kind of precursors.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Tina Marie: Whatever it is, let's just get an idea of what's going on. And so. When you've got access to the tools that give you information. Aka, knowledge.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Tina Marie: About yourself and your body. Take that. Take that time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Tina Marie: And and use it because it will multiply what you earn.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Tina Marie: And I want you to also think about everything as currencies. So money isn't the only currency we work with. Time is a currency, and it's fixed. We all get the same amount of time.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Tina Marie: Energy is a currency. Happiness is a currency, because these are things that we exchange for right.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: We exchange something for happiness.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Tina Marie: We exchange something for energy caffeine. We make an exchange. We exchange things for time. We pay other people for their time.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Tina Marie: And for their skills to do work for us. Right? So these are all currencies.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Tina Marie: So don't ask yourself, don't limit the equation. To only the currency of money.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Tina Marie: Include the currency of knowledge. Energy, potential health, you know. Like, if you know something that allows you to heal that faster.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Tina Marie: As a result of the MRI, or also helps you to prevent injuries in the future. So let's just say. Maybe you've got tiny, tiny veins, and your carpal tunnel is small. So now you know, you have to manage inflammation. Maybe you want to make dietary changes earlier rather.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Tina Marie: Then later in life. So you can avoid inflammation, because that's really the biggest issue.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Tina Marie: We're made to work. Carpal tunnel is. Mostly just inflammation.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Tina Marie: In in that area. Um as a result of ergonomics as a result of diet. As a result of.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Tina Marie: Something else triggering that inflammation I mean you. You were made perfectly sized.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Tina Marie: We just do different things in life that causes that to be an issue. You know what I mean.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Esther: Mhm yeah.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Tina Marie: So, anyway, I know I just got on a soapbox, but.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Esther: No, no, no, that's fine!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Tina Marie: As a mama especially. You want to be optimizing for energy in everything that you do. So always include that in the equation.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tina Marie: If it's going to take energy to do something. But in the end it will multiply your energy. For example, yesterday I drove 400 miles.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Tina Marie: There and back. That was an exhausting, you know, long day, but the car is going to multiply my energy every single day on longer trips. I'm not going to have to be taking it into the shop for.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Tina Marie: Years. Right? So it actually is going to save me energy over and over again. So, rather than trying to have the convenience and spending extra hours to figure out how to get a car delivered to me, making all those extra phone calls.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tina Marie: I just want where it was, because it's going to save me. Time and energy in the long run. Make sense.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Esther: Yes, it does. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alright.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay, you said. MRI. And Tina went woof! Sorry.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Esther: Oh, yes, I'm just yeah fuck it. I'm just gonna go to Sutter, you know, like I don't wanna deal with Simon Med and that should be enough to to make the decision easy for me.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Tina Marie: Right energy, right? So if you don't want to deal with a pain in the butt person, you take my money, I'll be there to the good people. Right? Everybody else.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Esther: Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Tina Marie: Never settle.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Esther: Mhm. I agree. I mean, this is why Fuji and I.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Esther: Pay for the things we pay for. You know? Um, I yeah, like I pay for things that my mom like would.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Esther: Freak out about. You know. She would never pay, you know, and I get it. They didn't have that kind of. Income, you know she would never pay someone I offered her several times. Mom, let me just.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Esther: Pay someone to come clean your house, so you don't have to vacuum, and she refuses. I'm like you're 65 years, 68 years old.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Esther: You know you don't need to be. I know you're a clean freak. You want everything clean, but you also live in a 2 story house.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Esther: Too much square footage to like drag a vacuum cleaner around.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That's the conversation Fuji and I had about you needing to have clean dishes at the end of the night, so it doesn't sit on your shoulders.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Esther: You know.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Tina Marie: You feeling like you've got to get up in the morning, or whatever like he's like. She won't go to bed unless the dishes are clean. I'm like you need to get that taken care of her like.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Esther: Well, that's why he always tells me to leave it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Tina Marie: Take it off her plate.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Esther: And let the nanny do it in the morning. And I've kind of started to let go of that, at least on the weekdays.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Esther: You know, but there are days where you know. If I do. The dishes, you know on, you know, on the weekend, those when the nanny is not here. I want it done.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Esther: You know, so you know it. Just it just feels good for me. But I do a lot of it. I do a lot less of it than I used to.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Esther: So we're getting there. Um, yeah, I'm having a chef or a cook. Come tomorrow.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Esther: To make us food, you know, and I look for recipes and stuff.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Esther: Um. You know that I think we want to eat, and then I just give it to the nanny, and she'll like prep it when Mari's like asleep. So a lot of the food stuff is not so much of a.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Esther: Headache anymore. You know, I just think. Mari and Emi and Fuji will get bored, eating the same thing over and over again.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Esther: So, and I don't want to like order out all the time, because I just don't think restaurant food is like all that healthy.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Tina Marie: It's not.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Esther: Isn't um, so you know I'm.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Tina Marie: I'm big on convenience, and I want to order out all the time. But I look at that, and like we feel terrible. We feel inflamed like.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Esther: Yeah, like, you know. So I mean, I think it's already kind of a lot that we order out a couple of times 2 or 3 times a week already, or we go out to eat.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Esther: Or something. So I'm just trying to at least. Keep it a little bit more balanced.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Esther: Um. But yeah, it's um. You know. On the whole, though I would say that I feel.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Esther: A lot less busy than I do. Most of my. Peers and counterparts, honestly.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my! Gosh!

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Esther: You know. Um, and you know that's a little bit of where um.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Esther: My guilt comes from, too. So I think today I mainly wanted to talk about. Personal stuff, like motivation.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Esther: Um. I struggle a lot with motivation. Um, you know cause.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Esther: I think part of it is, I think, in the beginning, when we talked I said. I don't know how to want.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Esther: And I don't really know right now what to do with myself. Especially when a lot of my motivation growing up is was on a reward. Punishment.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Esther: External type of thing right? I do things to avoid certain passions, or I do things to gain some sort of external reward. And you know, maybe that's a lot of us.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Esther: You know, with boomer parents, or whatever like, have um that sort of upbringing. But it's also something that's difficult for me to.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Esther: Talk to people about, because. You know, when I look at my life now.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Esther: I feel like I've achieved. What a lot of people only dream of.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Esther: I've gotten so much further than I could even. Imagined, and then it's like, you know, when you reach it.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Esther: What do you do afterwards? You know, like I've checked the boxes of money, marriage kids and house.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Esther: You know? What do I do now? Um. And it's kind of hard to talk about like I don't have anyone to talk to about.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Esther: Um it because. With for me and Fuji. As we move up the income ladder I feel just more and more isolated.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Esther: From my friends right even like you know, from my mama, friends, or like. His sister, or relatives or stuff like that, because.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Esther: Um like we just don't. Struggle with the same things.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Esther: Like. How can I talk to them about? Oh, man, I don't know what to do with myself when they're barely keeping their heads above water. They gotta.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Esther: 9 to 5 job. They got 2 kids as well. I have a fucking, Nanny. You know, and sorry. I will say that. Um, I do. Um. I swear a lot. That's how I communicate. Actually. So I if you're put off by that a little bit, just let me know, and I'll try to tone it down. Um!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I prefer not to. But I will tell you this. Sometimes we get in.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Tina Marie: We get in something, and I would rather you not feel like you have to filter yourself when when you. Sometimes those are the words that matter. I will drop an F bomb and all kinds of other things at times, because.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Esther: Okay.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Tina Marie: I'm like I cannot find another word that conveys it. And also sometimes people just don't understand it. I'll use it as contrast. I'm pretty sure the Lord will love me still. But even if I could choose better words, but sometimes it is those words that convey.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Tina Marie: It's the shock factor that lets somebody know. Oh, you're you're really feeling something that is not what you normally feel when. So if I drop that word. People like what you know what I mean. Anyway. But I don't want it to get in the way.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Esther: If if I drop an F bomb, it's just my normal conversation, you know.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Tina Marie: And that used to me. I do prefer not to, but I don't want it to be an issue where you feel like you can't be yourself with me.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Esther: Yeah. Okay.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Esther: Okay.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tina Marie: So, however, that comes out.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Esther: Thank you. Um. Okay, that's good to know. Cause I I never know who's like comfortable and who's not, you know. But that's good to know.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Tina Marie: I'm not going to be offended. I'm not fragile, it's my preference, and I take it as such.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Esther: Okay. Okay.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Esther: Great wonderful. Um, yeah, anyway. So long. Story short, I'm.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Esther: I feel more and more isolated. I felt that way when I was.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Esther: You know, running the bigger company, because I'm up there making decisions that other people.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Tina Marie: M.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Esther: Like aren't making you know. Um. Like I didn't have any other like.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Esther: Female CEO friends and stuff that I could. Talk to, I think, before before I met Fuji, you know I had.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Esther: I worked in the tech industry. So I had coworkers that I could connect with and. You know, but my life now is just so different from everyone else I know, like I don't know, like I feel just very.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Esther: I think lonely a little bit. You know. Yeah, um.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Tina Marie: I have to. Yeah.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Esther: You know, in the last few years I had so little social interaction with people. Because I was so busy running the company. Then I was became stay at home, mom, everything's just so crazy.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Esther: Um. So I'm struggling, I think, like I told you my 1st meeting to really like find my footing. You know um.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Esther: Yeah. And then you know the for for a couple of weeks there, when I was kind of, you know, thinking about what to do with the Ben. The bend thing, you know. I'm kind of just like the ball's in his court now. I'm just waiting for him.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Esther: Um. You know it kind of gave me something to latch onto. It. Kind of gave me something to do. Right um it kinda.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Esther: Help me to find some sort of motivation for something. Um. But it's also just like, Yeah, I've.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Esther: Achieved all these things I've been expected to achieve. And now I don't know what to do with myself.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Tina Marie: Looking for a notepad. So because I want to make sure that I'm not. Interrupting you, because I think it's important sometimes to get a.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Tina Marie: You know. Kind of everything out, and a lot of times I will pause if we're working on a technical thing. But when we're working out personal stuff.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Tina Marie: Where are all my notebooks? I usually have, like a stack of them right here. Um anyway.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Tina Marie: Working through that personal stuff that's on your mind. I don't. I don't want to interrupt your flow while you're doing that.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Esther: No worries. Yeah.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Tina Marie: So I'm gonna try to remember um. Oh, I can use my.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Esther: I'm also writing a lot of this down, too, you know. Um.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Tina Marie: Good well, and and I have AI companion taking notes and everything so.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Esther: So. Cool, sure.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tina Marie: But. Also my brain, my my sugar is crashing, not not too fast, but sometimes I it's a little.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Tina Marie: I. I have to work a little harder to to pull the word, so hold on one sec.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Esther: Yeah, it message, it messes with your energy levels. Yeah, mhm.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Esther: Oh, I hear totally understand.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Tina Marie: So there's a lot there's there's. Several things I want to touch on. That's kind of nuanced.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Tina Marie: And and they're almost um. Polar opposites like, there's this dichotomy that you're going to continually experience.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Tina Marie: And actually, there's several of them. So number one is in one way. I will tell you.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Tina Marie: You need to get used to being your own. Companion.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Tina Marie: You're going to be lonely in a lot of ways, being great. Is lonely, even when you surround yourselves with other greatness.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Tina Marie: I just felt this, and I'm I'm going to say it, and I know that. You are um at oppositions with with religion.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Tina Marie: But your name and your namesake. Oh, we gotta get emotional.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. You know Esther was incredible, and when Mordecai said. Perhaps you were born for such a time as this.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Tina Marie: She had a role that no one else was able to fill. But she's not the only one. She's just the example that we have. Now, of course, there's like this many people in the world who are ever.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Tina Marie: Step, into. The role that they were born to. But we all.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Tina Marie: Have because of where we're born, who we're born to. The things that we're born with, the people that we know, the people that we're neighbors. With all of these different things.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: We are each uniquely qualified to perform certain tasks in life that no one else could do as well as we could. That increases exponentially.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Tina Marie: As we. Um. It also bothers my asthma, by the way, and I had to look it up and find out. It's because the stress response constricts airways.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Tina Marie: So on top of that I have less oxygen, which also adds to the brain issues.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Esther: It was good.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Tina Marie: Bodies are amazing. I'm just like, um. Yeah. Anyway. Um, but as you.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tina Marie: Step up and. Be willing to.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Tina Marie: Be uncomfortable right, and rise above the status quo. So crabs and pots. Right? So, 1st of all.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Tina Marie: We're dealing with throughout our lives. People who want to reiterate the status quo and tell us.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Tina Marie: To be happy with what you have. So we're bred that way as children.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Tina Marie: Just be thankful. Just be thankful. Absolutely we should be thankful, but we should not just be thankful.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: My ex used to say, you're never happy with anything I'm like. Actually, I'm pretty much happy all the time. I'm never satisfied with the same thing the next day and the next day and the next day, there's a big difference between being happy and being satisfied.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Tina Marie: I'm satisfied. What I'm satisfied with today is not going to satisfy me tomorrow. My spirit requires evolution and growth.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Tina Marie: That is not true of most people.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Esther: Wow!

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tina Marie: I also always been on the the. Presumption, and this was one of the ways that I was able to.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Tina Marie: Get a lot of my work done is is to realize that you know, people people want to be happy. So. When I would ask them what their motives were.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Tina Marie: And I would say, Well, why do you? They'd come to me. I've got to make a million dollars by the end of the year. Okay? Why. Well, because this, because that because this because that.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: When you take it all the way back, Esther, the real motivation is because they think whatever they want is going to make them happy. Nobody chooses that. So they think.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Tina Marie: Um if they get respected. It will make them happy. They think if they make enough money and can buy these things, it will make them happy.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Tina Marie: Like, if you track it back. The real motivation is.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Tina Marie: Because we think it will fill us up. Make us happy, even if we think it's going to make somebody else happy. Why do we care about that?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Tina Marie: Because then it'll make us happy. But then I heard something that I actually really believe is true, and it is that most people don't actually want to be happy.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: Most people want to stop feeling pain. They're not even considering pursuing happiness.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Tina Marie: And then I thought about Maslow's hierarchy of law. And human needs.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Tina Marie: And I thought. You know, if you're at the bottom.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Tina Marie: Where most people are. They're starving for something. They're either starving for food. They're starving for love and affection they're starving for, or they're in pain. Right? So starvation is the example.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tina Marie: But it's really suffering. People are suffering. Everybody, almost.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Tina Marie: Is suffering. There are some people who just. For whatever reason don't seem to be, but I also find that those are not.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Tina Marie: The great people. I think all great people.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Tina Marie: Suffer. I think that all great people have a high level of awareness of something. They may not be so like.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Tina Marie: Elon Musk. I don't think that he's super emotionally sensitive. But he's super intelligent. I think that some people are super emotionally sensitive, and they may not be as high level intelligence, but they definitely have a higher perception level.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Tina Marie: In the world. Like highly sensitive people. So those are not the norm.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Tina Marie: That's 20% of the population is highly sensitive. It's even smaller that are highly intelligent. So we're.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all just built and wired differently. So that separates us from a lot of people.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Tina Marie: How we're wired, and I say us I mean all of us. We're all separated by our wiring. Then we're separated by our culture. Then we're separated by our. Economic status. Right? Then, we're separated by our intelligence levels.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Tina Marie: And then we're further separated by values. So you.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tina Marie: Have high level intelligence. High levels of aspiration.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Tina Marie: And ability to lead and do hard things that separates you. But in that world. Most the women who are operating in any kind of.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Tina Marie: Um comparable, level. Are not moms.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Tina Marie: They're not moms who want to stay home and. Raise their babies and.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Tina Marie: Grow them, and and give them the best life that they can, so that further separates you. From all of your other counterparts.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tina Marie: And to that end. Which is why I say. Get comfortable, being alone.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Tina Marie: But don't settle for it. So this is the dichotomy right.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Tina Marie: Be okay with it, because otherwise you're going to get caught in. The woe is me kind of mentality. And that will suck the life out of you.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Tina Marie: It's very easy to feel sorry for ourselves. It's okay. For a moment or 2.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Tina Marie: To be sad and grieve the loss of even what you've never had. I grieve the loss of a mother. I have a mother, but I never really had a mother. I was the mother.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Tina Marie: And so I've contemplated. I'm like, how am I going to feel if my mom dies? Am I going to have regret that people say you're going to have regret because. This didn't happen, or this didn't happen. And I come to the realization I'm not going to.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Tina Marie: Because I've already grieved her. Have already grieved what's been lost.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Tina Marie: I love her and want the best for her. If you look on my bucket list, probably 3 out of 20 things are about. My mom and her sisters, and wanting to take care of her.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Tina Marie: And making sure that they've got. Time together, and that they've got, you know.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Tina Marie: A good life. Um.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tina Marie: But I I don't spend more time with her because of it, because I can only spend a certain amount of time because it just. Weighs me down. She's she's negative. She looks at things really differently.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Tina Marie: And it's just kind of toxic. It's always been toxic. It's going to continue to be toxic. And as much as I want it to be different. I can't make her a different person, so I can love her where she's at.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Tina Marie: Um and be okay with the fact that I'm never going to have a mother that I can go to for comfort.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Tina Marie: I don't have anybody, really, that I can go to. For the kind of comfort that a child could go to a parent for.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Tina Marie: Right where you can completely submit yourself.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Tina Marie: That's a hard thing.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Esther: Right? Yeah, I'll just say, as an aside that I feel exactly the same way.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Tina Marie: I would love that. I.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Esther: Never had that from my parents, and I think you made a. Really good point. I've always wondered to myself.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Esther: If my! When my dad dies, am I gonna feel anything. Probably not cause.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Esther: I never, never thought about that way that I've already grieved. The loss of something I never had.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Esther: You know, and as wonderful as Fuji's parents are. They are not actually my parents, and.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Esther: They can't give me, no matter how close I am with them. It's different, you know. I'm I'm.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Esther: Grateful beyond all words that I even get to experience. You know the love that they can give me like, even though I'm not their actual biological child. And I'm just like, Okay, well.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Esther: This is my lot in life. And okay, that's that's fine. Yeah, I'm already like so fortunate to have them. So you know.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Esther: Yeah. But anyway, I just wanted to say that I understand. The feeling. Um, yeah.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so. Coming to terms with the fact that I can never fully submit myself to anyone.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Tina Marie: Because, like even my partner doesn't have the capacity. To.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Tina Marie: Be able to be as open and as vulnerable as it would take for me to be able to do that. But he's still fantastic, and he's still.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Tina Marie: Just the best person for me. Right wonderful! So we have to come to a certain point where you realize that.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Tina Marie: It just is, and you can keep feeling sad for it. Or you can grieve.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Tina Marie: And complete the grieving to the extent that grieving does so. Grief stays with you forever. There are moments where this sadness and when I talk about things it's visceral, so like.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tina Marie: I feel sad again, and people will be like, oh, I'm so sorry for you! I'm like no. I allow myself to feel my human emotions.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Tina Marie: Because I want to be human. I do not want to be dissociated from these things. This is part of my experience. But the grief passes.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Tina Marie: I don't hold it in my body. It's released.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: I release it through tears? Did you know. That if you look at tears under a microscope.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Tina Marie: They look different, and they have a chemically different makeup. Depending on the emotion.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Tina Marie: That evoked the tears.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Esther: Oh, that's interesting! But that also makes sense.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Tina Marie: Isn't that fascinating. We are literally releasing chemicals.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Tina Marie: That our body needs to release. Out of our tear, ducts.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Tina Marie: Different, according to the mood that.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Tina Marie: We booked them. In the 1st place, isn't that amazing?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Esther: Yeah, wow, that's really cool. I never thought of it like that. Oh, that's something you chew on.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Tina Marie: Look it up. There's a photographer that she was curious about tears, and so she looked at different types of tears under a microscope, and what they look like is amazing, and every tear is as unique as a snowflake.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Tina Marie: But the chemical composition is different according to the emotion that. Initiated the tears in the 1st place, and I thought.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tina Marie: How fascinating! You know, because you would think like, think about saline and.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Tina Marie: You know our body. But even still and I'm I've been going through trying to figure out how to manage glucose levels. And I'm remembering 10th grade biology and learning about permeability.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Tina Marie: And osmosis, and understanding that the solution. Right? So our blood levels have a certain amount of. So inside the cell is sodium. Outside of the cell is potassium.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Tina Marie: I might have that reversed, but I'm pretty sure that that's the way it is. Anyway, one's positively charged one's negatively charged, and according to how much potassium or sodium is in or outside of the cell.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Tina Marie: Impacts the permeability.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Esther: Yes. Yeah.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Tina Marie: Well, so. If the permeability is reduced, that means the cell can't accept glucose.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Tina Marie: Can't get the fuel and the energy of the glucose. So it's just hanging out.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Esther: Mhm, okay.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Tina Marie: Right? Um the same thing with insulin. So insulin there's receptors, and so salt is crucial.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: To the function of the body. But as much as we are good at homeostasis, do we not get cold.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Tina Marie: Do we not get fevers. So, how much.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Tina Marie: Varying degrees do we have by the levels of sodium that we have in our body? And how much do we impact levels of sodium every time we drink something, even if you just drink water, you dilute your sodium levels.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Tina Marie: Every time you eat something that has salt or doesn't have salt. Well, you sweat. So I'm just thinking about holy Cow. How complicated are we? But also.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Tina Marie: You know, we think that. Oh, you know 98.6 degrees. Well, 1st of all, that's wrong. It varies throughout the day, by person, by hour, by like. There's so much we don't know, and this comes back to where your time is going. Esther.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Tina Marie: There's so much to learn. Having a goal or purpose, or aspiration.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Tina Marie: Doesn't have to be. Something with a finish line.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Tina Marie: Or measurable. To the average person, for sure.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Tina Marie: It can be just getting to spend more time learning. And.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Tina Marie: Increasing your knowledge, so. A lot of people think that we are what we are when we're born like we just have. You're either smart or you're not smart, right.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Tina Marie: You could be high IQ or low. IQ. But even that has been debunked.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Tina Marie: Because every time you learn something new. You create a new neuron.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Tina Marie: And that neuron synapses and dendrites then reach out to the rest of your neurons.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Esther: Okay.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Tina Marie: And increases your neural network, which increases your intelligence, capacity. A person who will choose to use whatever level intelligence they have.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Tina Marie: Can increase their intelligence, level. Not just what they know. Right? That's knowledge.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Tina Marie: But the capacity to understand. Can increase and does increase.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Tina Marie: Every time we learn something new. Most people just think that they are what they are, and they have that. So.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Tina Marie: Where you're at right now. You it! Um!

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Tina Marie: It's lonely, because, especially as women, we want to talk through things. We actually.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Tina Marie: I will tell you that for the most part. I give people answers, but a lot of times. It's just me asking questions.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Tina Marie: They have an epiphany I could have never got to for them. Because it's all inside their brains. They already have the answers. But while we're talking.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Tina Marie: They'll go. Oh, I never thought of this before!

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Tina Marie: And their brain solves the problem. They have that idea. That's what happens when we talk.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Tina Marie: Well, if you're not able to talk with somebody. Who can just stop talking about what it's like to pay the bills.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Tina Marie: Just stop talking about being exhausted, about taking the kids to school. All the things that they're focused on. You're over here.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Tina Marie: And they can't get out of.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Tina Marie: We'll call it the Sandbox right.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Esther: Right.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Tina Marie: And you're trying to climb the Eiffel Tower. You're trying to climb. Mount Everest. And so that does become difficult. So one of the things that you can do is.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Tina Marie: Look for ways, and maybe it's going to events with Fuji. Maybe it's finding Facebook groups. Maybe it's Linkedin.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Tina Marie: But explore. With the intent, because I really believe that we attract.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Tina Marie: The things that we want energetically. Almost like a force field that we can't see, but that truly exists in the same way that atoms are attracted or repelled from each other right.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Tina Marie: By their charges. Ah! Have the intent of finding women.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Tina Marie: And you could say people, but as a married woman it really behooves us to. Kind of keep it within the female realm.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Tina Marie: Um, we just don't even want to invite. But you know what I mean. Other issues. You're a fantastic woman. You're gonna attract other people. If it happens to be male, you've got a whole new set of issues. But you know what I mean. That's the reality.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Esther: Okay.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Tina Marie: Um, I. I believe in guarding the family as much as possible, and understanding that human beings are human beings, and.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Esther: It's hard to connect with guys, anyway. Well, I mean, I've always connected well with men, but. Again, being becoming a mother and becoming a wife, and and stuff like it changes.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know I can still connect with my guy friends who are dads. Now.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Esther: And it's different. But I'm just like you. Can't bring anything to the table for me that I need.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, like you, you don't get doubled over in pain like every 4 weeks and like bleed for a week. And all of these things. You know what I mean like. There's things about being a woman that.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Esther: Which is someone else with a hindred understanding.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tina Marie: Make a difference in everything but.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Esther: Anyway. Yes.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Tina Marie: What I would love you to do is set, set an intention of and and explore.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Tina Marie: Online or through, go to events like, look up. If it's a marketing event, a business event, a leadership. You know, really. Look at women leaders.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Tina Marie: Because they're going to think differently, but specifically, who are mothers? Maybe mothers around the same age. Asian mothers that are in the same. Now you don't need you only need, like one who can really relate to exactly where you're at. And you really don't need that.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Tina Marie: But what you do need is somebody who represents different people who represent all of the things right. So women, in business.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Tina Marie: You the village right.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Esther: No.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Tina Marie: We all. And here's another thing. We've watched friends. We've watched all these TV shows where people have these perfect companions. And this house full of people that they're super comfortable with, and spend all their lives together.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Tina Marie: You know, that's not reality for most people.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Esther: No.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Tina Marie: But you can find, and I tell you this because I never had it. But I set this intention a few years ago, and I find that I have it now.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Tina Marie: This village of women all over the world. Um all over the country.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Tina Marie: And they have different personalities, different values. Some of them are members of my faith and super irreverent. Some of them are members of my faith and just super.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Tina Marie: Uh! I'm very irreverent like I love God, but I crack jokes, inappropriate jokes constantly. I think it's hilarious. I. People say I have a nickname for being called trouble. I'm still a really good girl, but I'm also trouble, like I'm just.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Esther: It's good. Yeah.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Tina Marie: But finding the people, um. I love having women who are older, who have been through all the seasons of life.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Tina Marie: Because they can. They can teach me a lot of things. That I can watch out, for. They're the ones where I learned.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Tina Marie: That I needed to be ready for empty nesting, because if I wasn't it would break me. Nobody told me. It happens way before the kids even leave.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Tina Marie: Because they're they're kind of got like. A foot and a half out the door. By the time they're 15.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Tina Marie: By the time they're 1617 18, like they've got like half of a toe in the door. On average, there are definitely homebody kids that will stay there forever. Right, but that's not the majority of them. If you, if you raise them strong and confident, they're going to bounce and go out of the house, and it happens long before they turn 18.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Tina Marie: So um the Asian culture. There are things that. You go through.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Tina Marie: That, and stories that you've heard. That were told to you, and and the the values, and even the manipulation and the language.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Tina Marie: That is used that is going to be very specific to your culture. And just to know that somebody understands that.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tina Marie: What it feels like to battle that, and to overcome it like.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Tina Marie: How great is it if you run a race like let's say you run a hundred meter dash, and you broke your time, and there's nobody who saw it happen.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Tina Marie: Like it feels amazing, but it also feels disappointing at the same time, and it shouldn't feel disappointing. Why does it feel disappointing? Because there's nobody to celebrate with you who understands. What you did. We are communal beings. We need somebody who understands what we are overcoming.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Tina Marie: To celebrate with us. We need that energy. So.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tina Marie: Believe Esther. That you can find the people that you want.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Tina Marie: Somewhere and set that intention, and over time you will accumulate them. You will find them.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Tina Marie: They may not be people that you can reach out and touch. They may be on the other side of the world. But you can communicate with when you have the connection with them, though.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Tina Marie: It will be. It will still fill you up as though they were right. Next to you, you'll be able to feel them.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Tina Marie: Even when they're not with you. Those connections exist for you. Even if you haven't come across them yet.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Tina Marie: So believe that, and then do the work to find them. It will be joining groups and activities, and then, and part of it will be.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Tina Marie: You know, maybe you explore going back to school, and maybe it's just taking a class and not getting a degree. But maybe you really wanted to know something about philosophy. Anthropology, archaeology, anything. There's so much that you can learn about life.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Tina Marie: And the world. Um, I would highly recommend, if you haven't studied it. Psychology classes, human growth and development. As you're raising these children.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Tina Marie: Those 2 classes are huge.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Tina Marie: Um for understanding some of the things and going. You know what. This stuff that's happening is not my fault.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Tina Marie: I can do the best that I can. But these things are going to happen, and they have nothing to do with me.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Tina Marie: So I can remove the shame and the guilt and the pressure about it.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: And just go through the experience. The best that I can. And know that whatever comes out of it.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Tina Marie: Is going to be a little bit what I do, and a whole lot of nature that has nothing to do with me. But you'll understand the mechanisms of it.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Tina Marie: You'll understand better how to persuade and influence. Things that are happening and a healthy level, you'll be able to recognize certain things.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Tina Marie: Parents aren't taught. We're told there's no handbook for parenting. Well. There's a lot of knowledge, that kind of kind of helps with that. And it's found in psychology.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Esther: Mhm, okay.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Tina Marie: So anyway.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Tina Marie: I just. I just put a lot in there.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Esther: I think that. Um, I have thought about going to networking events and everything but. You know, there's also like.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Esther: You know, a lack of a confidence level there for me, too. Because I feel like in the last 2 years I've been just so.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Esther: Far removed. From about the last. Yeah. Last year in general.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Esther: I've just been so far removed from work. You know that, you know. I think I told you like.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Esther: This. Um, you know, this potential opportunity with Ben was more just trying to gain my footing again, kind of remind myself that. Of all the things I I did, and I can do.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Esther: So you know, Fuji has encouraged me to go to a networking event or a marketing event. And, oddly enough, I just don't feel the confidence to put myself out there.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Tina Marie: Let me let me let me speak to that right now.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Esther: Okay.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Tina Marie: Let me tell you a couple things. 1st of all, you don't get confidence wishing for it.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Tina Marie: You get confidence by pushing past your comfort zone. And going where you'll get it from.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Tina Marie: You have to show up to get the confidence.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Esther: Okay.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't build itself. It builds itself like a muscle.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Esther: Okay.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Tina Marie: You don't build a muscle by wishing for it. You build a muscle by working it so hard it rips.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Esther: Okay. Okay. Oh, okay.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Esther: Oh, got it!

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Tina Marie: So you only get the confidence after you do the thing.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Tina Marie: You have to show up and realize that somebody's going to accept you. And and you're gonna have a conversation.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Tina Marie: And but I'm gonna tell you this is the other thing, Esther. When you give yourself permission to do things that you feel unqualified for.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Tina Marie: And trust that you'll learn and become qualified through time and effort. You're going to put out this powerful energy that will be.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Tina Marie: Palpable and perceptible to everyone around you, but especially other women. Who are going to take your queue as permission for themselves to do the same.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Tina Marie: And that will give you a level of confidence that you can't even fathom right now.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Esther: Mhm, okay. Oh, that's a very interesting perspective. Okay?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Esther: You know, and I think that also leads me to. Kind of something I've struggled with ever since I was a kid.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Esther: Is, you know. This idea that I have to show up.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Esther: Great and perfect already for people to accept me. And that was like that for my friendships. For the first.st

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Esther: Like what? 20 something years of my life, because. That was how I was raised. You know I had a hard time holding on to friends.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Esther: Because I thought that. People would only be my friend, based on how impressive I was.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Esther: You know how smart I was, what good grades I got if I was better than them. Um, and that was a lot of that. That was, you know, from my dad and his like.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Esther: You know, and his terrible inferiority complex. It was really, really like. Like seeped into me.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Esther: Um, and I realized that you know, at least in my friendships. Um, I've kind of. Broken that down and taken that apart already.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Esther: But I realize now that. You know we're talking about, you know, just a scenario of going to a marketing event. I'm like, Oh, my God!

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Esther: I have not dismantled that in my. Professional, live my professional mind. Yet I feel like I have to show up to.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Esther: This networking event, or whatever it is. Um, you know, with a really impressive resume, or whatever it is.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Tina Marie: Let me. I don't normally want to interrupt. I gotta tell you this.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Esther: Be to be accepted.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Tina Marie: Because great. Greatness is messy.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Tina Marie: It is flawed. What makes it great?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Tina Marie: Is the willingness to be wrong out loud. Because it's willing to fail fast.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Tina Marie: And make mistakes for the sake of the knowledge. The people that you see, who are meticulous and pristine, and look like they make no mistakes, will never.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Tina Marie: Be the greatest people, you know. With the greatest accomplishments.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Tina Marie: Because they are held back. And limited, extremely.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Tina Marie: By their need to look put together. If you see somebody incredibly put together by all things.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, it's slightly neurotic. This is not a. Judgment. It's just fact.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Tina Marie: Second of all, they are hanging by a thread where that. Neuroticism can just cripple them. If anything goes wrong.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Tina Marie: They are not flexible. And because of that they are easily broken.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Esther: Okay.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Tina Marie: Don't be that person.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Esther: Um.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tina Marie: To be great. And powerful, is to be flexible and yielding.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Tina Marie: And to know that what makes you great is your ability to build. And repair, and to pivot and to change.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Tina Marie: Not to be pristine and perfect.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Esther: Okay. Oh, my God!

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Esther: Oh, my God! Okay. I've never thought about it like that.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Tina Marie: Think of the examples in your life I want you. This is your homework for this week. I want you to think about the people that accomplished the most real things right.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Tina Marie: Have the most freedom, are the most happy, have overcome the most things.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Tina Marie: They're probably people who sometimes don't shower for days, sometimes literally stinky. Sometimes just disappear for months at a time, who you will see like. If you pick it apart, you'll see all kinds of flaws.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Tina Marie: That's because their focus isn't on how they look. To the rest of the world, but getting where they're going.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Tina Marie: Artists, great chefs, disaster areas. Their studios are a mess.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Tina Marie: Their kitchens are a mess. Businesspeople. Their businesses are a mess.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Tina Marie: It's. The mess isn't the point.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Tina Marie: How it looks isn't the point. It's the progress. It's the growth, it's the knowledge, it's the strength, it's the experience, it's the service. It's the delivery.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Tina Marie: Life is messy period. But when a person spends all of it trying to manage the appearance of it.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Tina Marie: They lose access to the greatest. Most exhilarating parts of life.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Tina Marie: Think about how many people avoid having children because they don't want to destroy their bodies.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Tina Marie: They're focused on the the appearance rather than the experience.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Okay, oh, this is.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Esther: Really profound for me. Okay.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Esther: Oh, this is okay. This is a bit to chew on. Yeah, I think this is what the you know. I think this is the crux of what part of the struggle is.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Esther: I was raised to be a perfectionist, I was raised to. Like, really care about.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Esther: How I show up in my. Appearance, you know. Not necessarily my um, you know, like my physical appearance, or whatever it is, but.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tina Marie: And how it reflects on the family.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Esther: How it reflects on the family, how it reflects on my. Self, and you know, and.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Esther: Um. Yeah. Um. I was.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Esther: Raised to judge other people.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yes, me too.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Esther: Thinking that thinking that other people are constantly judging me. You know. Um, and you know I've let go some of that throughout the years. I'm not the kind of person who.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Esther: Feels like my house needs to be beautiful or pristine anytime someone comes over. I'm just like. Alright, yeah. Sorry, guys, this is a little bit messy sorry, but not sorry, really. Just.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Esther: It's a little messy. I got 2 kids, you know. It's April, and my Christmas tree is still up.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Esther: You know, whatever it might get put away sometime this year, or it might not, and it just stays up until the next Christmas rolls around.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Esther: You know um. Yeah. Um.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Esther: So.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Tina Marie: You will also find that the people that accomplish the most in life are the least judgmental. So if you find people who are incredibly judgmental.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Esther: Okay.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Tina Marie: I can tell you what you already know about them. They are not the ones getting the most things done.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Um. Okay.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Tina Marie: They're the ones spending all their time judging.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Esther: You know, it was really interesting. One of Michael's. Cousins. Well, his wife.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Esther: Um she. Um, you know, she and I, you know we had some heart to heart on our ski trip and stuff and.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Esther: You know we're always talking about. Oh, my! And her, you know, funnily. Her her name's also Tina.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Tina Marie: We're saucy.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Esther: But he is always like the tinas in the world are just amazing, you know. Um. But yeah, she, whenever she puts together.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Esther: Parties and stuff. It looks like. It looks like an Instagram Post.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Esther: You know she's. You know, effectively, just.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Esther: Productive accomplished is amazing in so many ways. I have a very hard time.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Esther: Finding flaws in her. At the same time, though um.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Esther: You know. I know that, you know, and she had mentioned to me, you know. Oh, the most I can do is just do things so well that I'm you know, just do what I can, so that I'm not so that I'm above reproach. You know, and I'm like, Oh, you.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Esther: Seem like you. My mind just was like, Oh. Is that a healthy way to live.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Esther: I don't know like. Um, and who knows?

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Tina Marie: A lot of pressure.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Esther: I'm not sure if that's a healthy way to live like. She, you know people are just like, Oh, my God, she's so amazing! She's so great! She's blah blah, you know. That's Tina for you. You know she put all this stuff together for the kids, and I'm like holy nuts. You know this is fine. This is not who I'm trying to be.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Esther: But it's very interesting, like, you know, when I see someone like her. Yes, she is to be admired. There's a lot about her that's admirable, and she's just a wonderful person.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: Right. Yeah.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Esther: Um um, but at the same time. I'm I think for me, it's like, Okay.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Esther: You know, if I was a little less wiser than I am now. She is someone that who I would be trying to emulate. But I know that that's not me.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Esther: You know, that's this is someone who. You know, you know, maybe she doesn't chase perfection, and that's just how she operates. I don't know um, but I'm not.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Tina Marie: Yep, and we never know.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Esther: I I would never know. And you know I don't spend that. I know it's not like I really spend, you know, time thinking about it.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Tina Marie: We never know.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Esther: But I just thought to myself, you know I'm not trying to.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Esther: Be someone who does things so perfectly that I am above reproach.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tina Marie: I want to wrap with that because I've got shown it in 3 min. But you've learned something, and I really want you to repeat this, because this was so liberating for me.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Esther: Yes. Yes.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Tina Marie: I can look at people like that, and look at all their goals and accomplishments. And I can say I can do that.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Tina Marie: So that's a trap, because sometimes we can. Doesn't mean we should. But the release comes from. When I go. But that's not for me.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Tina Marie: I have a lot of talents. I have a lot of gifts. Anything I put my mind to I can do and do well.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Tina Marie: But I'm not called to do everything I'm called to do just a few things really, really? Well. And so to be distracted by trying to do all of these other things just because I can right, and because it would be impressive, or whatever.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Tina Marie: Then I become not only out of integrity, but out of happiness, and I begin to sabotage myself by diluting myself across these different things because I can.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Esther: Okay.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Tina Marie: So the fastest release. Sentence, I can say, is peacefully and with love and gratitude for the fact that it is for this other person. That is not for me.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Tina Marie: And I am okay with that.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Esther: Okay. Okay, thank you so much.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Esther: Um have a wonderful session with Chona.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Tina Marie: That's amazing.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Esther: And yeah, you've given me a lot to think about. So thank you.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Tina Marie: You, and please feel free to talk and and journal, and all the other things. Usher, I. Adore you. Truly, truly, I feel so much love for you. I know we don't know each other, but I don't have to to know you, and to love you.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Esther: I don't.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Tina Marie: And that love will just grow. But it's true, and it's sincere. You're a joy to talk to you. And do set that intention to find your women to create your Esther village.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Tina Marie: And also know that somebody needs you and is looking for you. And there's several of them. So it's not just selfish, but put yourself out there so that you can be found.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Tina Marie: And find who you're looking for, and keep me posted on everything.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Esther: Thank you so much.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Esther: All right. Have a great session with Chona.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Tina Marie: Thank you. Talk to you soon.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Esther: Oh, I said, Hi! Right.
