00:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well that was fast. Hey Alexa, 10 minute timer.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just need to take my chicken out in 10 minutes. You said you're chicken out and I thought like chickens, like lights. I used to have a coop right out there until my dog murdered them. Well let's see, dog murdered a couple raccoons slaughtered, all of them.
00:00:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, raccoons. Yes. Oh, what was that? Did you hear that? I just made a sale. Went to change. Oh my god, that's so cool.

You did?
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay. That was good, then, that I didn't have to do it for you.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I would have started sooner if it just had occurred to me to just do that. So in the future, if you give me a download, I'll just do this myself. Thank you. Well, because you're doing so much work in the production end of it, and they're getting people. So I've got to get to this. Thank you.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
do do do do. Equally yoked. There's no such thing as perfectly equally yoked and things that there's definitely show up and do your best. And that's what I want to do.
00:03:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that equally yoked. Yeah. Go to this classroom. go to go to one you need to try with blank and first come out um too long i got to export it to pdf and my blood sugar it's so annoying to me because like i haven't eaten since 6 30 last night what but hadn't eaten 6 30 last night yeah nice in the 90s and then i went to bed and it just started going until like 134 just way too high for fasting numbers and i didn't eat bad i ate good food and yeah so i was listening last night when i couldn't sleep because i sometimes go to bed too really but it's that doctor again um and she was talking about how yeah really like you're doing all the right things obviously you know probably more than me but it was interesting how she said it depends what you eat something with that can determine the blood sugar as well. Like she said for eating at with a carbohydrate can be a good team with the carbohydrate even better. Yeah. Yeah. So did you ever end up buying her book or anything like that?
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but I had gestational diabetes with both my girls and my blood sugar was perfect. So I know what to do, but sometimes the body like hormones and my biggest issue probably is cortisol and stress because that's actually why glucose rises at night and because of the correlation to stress in my sugars, I know that that's what it is. But when you in order to help you get going in the morning, your body rises, raises the glucose levels to get you out of bed. And but it also pumps cortisol into your body. So if some else is pumping cortisol into your body, your body responds with glucose. there is a liver component and there's a pancreas component both produced and are impacted by hormone. So there's a lot to learn about it. And in some ways there's great rhyme or reason, but in others it's not. Which is even weird, more weird because so when you have gestational diabetes, yeah, the placenta, not the pancreas insulin. And so the placenta is, you know, female hormones, it's all over the place. There is no rhyme or reason. The pancreas is actually pretty steady, it's supposed to be pretty steady. But that is not what's happening. So, but I have lost three and a half pounds and I think since I got my diagnosis. you know, it's to me, it's just a matter of time. I for sure will figure it out. Let me do this.
00:07:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm so intrigued about it myself that I'm thinking of getting one of those monitors just to see it.
00:07:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just sounds so fascinating. It's a great idea and it really did not I cannot tell you and I'm very sensitive, very sensitive skin so it did not hurt at all. I do feel it from time to time like I'm aware of it. I'm also like I said I am extremely sensitive but it doesn't bother me and everything bothers me. I can't I can't work jewelry. can't most of the time anymore. I used to be able to do it but I can't I'm going to share a screen with you.
00:07:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now that's the right one and so we're going to go through multiple steps. I'm actually going to put all that I'm going to do but. that work planned. really wanted to like surprise you with it today.
00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That it wasn't done in time, so it's okay. Okay, please take the temperature by the audience. That stands out as evidence of that temperature.
00:08:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm trying to let it say big view as the tool, because that was the biggest tool. got excited about because you could smooth out your skin. You can make yourself look thinner and you can fix your eye contact when you're reading a script.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What the hell?
00:09:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:09:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What did you say to me?
00:09:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's what that's what I demoed.
00:09:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're like, oh my god, they were like, it's shocking.
00:09:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this is also why we're going to compare the AI tools. Because apparently, Claude is better at, I don't remember what it was.
00:09:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, you know what? I recently, because when it converts to Canadian dollars, it gets to be, you know, adds up because I get a lose in the exchange rate all the time. I was trying to be 4.0 forever, but I actually, for the last probably 30 days, I've just been using the free version. I'm not paying the monthly anymore, and I'm using the free version of Claude. And I'm getting along fine, to be honest, without paying.
00:09:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use it probably, I just use too many credits because I use it a lot.
00:09:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got you all the
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
time and for really long things.
00:10:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, you know, on a sidebar note, this is ever of interest we can buy, invest in it, because it could help make 20k low ticket funnels faster, easier. Alexa, stop. There's this guy that sells, I think it's for 197, a whole AI prompts, like pretty intense prompts of creating the whole low ticket funnel, like the sales page, the video sales letter, the OTO1 sales page, OTO1's video sales letter, etc. so anyways, I didn't buy it. I did buy just his $27 front end, but he does seem to be the real McCoy.
00:10:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm unhappy with every single prompt thing I've ever purchased from people, because I write credit prompts.
00:10:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's why I didn't buy it. Yeah, same thing. But but I did join his little community to see what he's doing and he's good. Like I'm not gonna lie, he's good.
00:10:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I just couldn't handle paying 197. When I spent my watch out TV with Dan, buys like all kinds of things, he's like Tina, you're better than everybody I've bought stuff from. not selling anything, but that could be that we sell also. But anyway, so I am excited for putting this together and formatting it, and then, yeah, you but you did really good. So I would also like, do you feel like you've covered anything differently or that there was anything that stood out in your Wednesday call?
00:11:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I might have in the Wednesday call, started, I repeated the same thing, but I actually gave them the whole process at the beginning, just, you know, just give it to them and say, okay, we're going to dive deeper in it because, you know, sometimes like a open loop hook.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow.
00:11:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I would say Saturdays was the best because I think the aspect of it being the first of my my excitement was even higher because, you know, the second time you teach it gets a little bit more boring or something and then some of the same people attended, so you didn't have the same reaction. Right so so I I wouldn't even bother running through the second time teaching it because the first one I think was So good cuz it really caught everybody's reaction the questions were more spot on and on yesterday's or two days ago One girl comment dominated a bit with questions in a good way not a bad way, but she teaches sleep You know how to sleep better so she's like well I don't think I could do YouTube them because it's not about making money online and so we used hers Example of the demo which was really cool. So I was like no, I know someone who teaches a low ticket funnel About how to get better sleep and he throws rocks against CPAP machines And he has a YouTube organic channel and he gets five to 15 sales every day From that low ticket funnel from organically from YouTube.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah That's amazing Yeah, there's a guy that Dan works with this does binaural beats It's all YouTube and then there's wedding planning and yeah, the wedding planning had me right Sales pitch for them, but wait, I know beats actually selling them because I used to sell them like 12 years ago But they're so available for free everywhere now even Spotify and I don't sell mine anymore Everyone's won't give it away for free for some clients, but yes And that's probably why it doesn't do very well It does make sales, but also this a lot of the free stuff that I find and I want longer playlists and he's And Yeah, there's different there's different Things that get in the way, but almost every even the paid apps There's something I don't like about it And so the one thing about a creator who will create for the audience or create longer playlists for Teach better or whatever there's definitely nuance to it especially if people like me, they find it and it's paid for and they don't want to shop around, I will pay money. I don't care because I found it and if I found it, it's because of your marketing, the SEO, the keyword targeting, you managed to find me, right? So I could find you and you saved me hours of research because I'm like, this actually meets my needs. There's a lot of that and I think people don't take that into account that they're like, I found that I'm done.
00:14:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I agree because I still pay $47 for some other guys membership and even though I sort of know a lot of what he teaches, I just enjoy probably twice month just going in there and seeing what he's teaching now and he's very much into the same things I am into and so he's like, does 21-day challenges now in the membership and he tells you to get the self-adgeo music going was like, hey, that's what I do and but he's now he's one up to me. because this is so brilliant. He actually goes to the parrot, he teaches to create your identity and chat chibi tea, and he gives you the prompts, and then work on it until you like what the new identity says. Then you record it like on your voice recorder, but play a sulfegio music vinyl vinyl audio in it, and use the parrot app, which was free, and I still get to do this because I just watch this thing today's go. It's a free app, then I repeat that to you can listen, so subliminal stuff, but you listen to your own voice and about your own future identity, but with the binary audio, I'm like, oh, that's next level, that's good.
00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's pretty cool. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So many ideas.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, actually, did I stop screens? Well, there's even another new idea, but I didn't give you the YouTube video because you get mad at me because it was just like so cool. No, because it's just really good YouTube channel, where they talk about they are startup companies themselves and a guy owns swell.ai. Which is an AI tool we may want to use in the future for content syndication But he gives away all these free ideas how to create a million dollar business, and he's like his latest one is using AI avatars instead of He showed Google trends User-generated content means the top Google trend right now like for business people and he said you got paid a lot I'm gonna make you a 60 second video of user-generated content for your your store Or maybe your e-commerce company, but he said you you can use Hagen now and he showed and he showed he showed the example of his video that he put out on Twitter about how to use Swell AI, but he had the Hagen character just saying the script and then he he's a really good video because he said you use the the problem solution agitation kind of framework and that's all he had hate the Hagen avatar use and they said so my idea for you if you want to make Million dollars in the next year is create a agency offering These are generated content videos like this, but using AI avatars, but finding adding ads that are out there, what story formula are they using? then model after that, because I personally don't know what AI tool helps you find it, but I've been hearing about this from Alan Sitanic as well. Someone's making a lot of money right now running some kind of agency where he can search all the ads and find out which ones are the top performing right now. And then he'll use the same AI will figure out the story framework of it. And then you can pop that into another like a agent to create a similar app for yourself.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Similar web, let's see. Let's see app that tells you what ads are performing as well. I think it's, yeah, I thought it was similar web.
00:17:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. maybe that's for three.
00:17:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see I'm rash.
00:17:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I can ask, sorry, go ahead. I get so excited about it because I need new trim, but this is where you got to stop me and put me back on the right racetrack, because the guy was really cool. He said, look, if you guys get stuck on something, just DM me. Like if I say something to do and you don't get how to do it, just DM me. So I might just DM myself, okay, what's the tool people are using to find the winning ads?
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what's similar web will tell you is a lot of this, right? So remember Alexa in the old days that told us page rank and like how pages rank according to this. it used to be what runs where?
00:18:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, what runs where, yeah.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then between similar web and SEM rush though, because you'll see ads and you'll see where they're running, but what you'll also see is how long they've been running.
00:18:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So if you know something's been running a long time, you know it's a win.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, but let's do stay focused because I'm with Dan at 12. That's, it's all good ideas though, because anyway, we are doing marketing and business growth, right?
00:19:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we've got to be of that. I thought about for us, like when we get to run ads, thought, because he's like, when you know how to nail this down, you can create a thousand variations of your ads with using AI and Hagen, like he just changed the hook. Like, it just, it blew my mind and I was just like that.
00:19:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's all the more reason to actually stay focused on these. So I love like having a few minutes to talk about like what's, what's new, what we've discovered news so that we can look at, okay, what might be one to implement. But as we've discussed before, AI is something I definitely think is a massive leverage. I like playing with it. And so we can spend a lot of my time actually figuring out the tools, using them implementing organizing, sorting, while you're creating our content until we do AI, right? or generating traffic, and then combining that together, we are making sales and making profits. So I think that's finding a good split and also letting us both get to have fun in our playgrounds because you love the marketing aspect of it. And I love the technical execution of it.
00:20:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So where are the Trello board business HQ? Do you want me to put that to that YouTube video for you to watch then about it?
00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So was it that it was, hey, Jen, right? I put, right here, hey, Jen, you do see. You could just change that and add it in here.
00:20:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry, I'm looking at the bottom. YouTube profits for offers, okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll just stick in the past, amazing YouTube video AI avatar watch, should I take you or now? didn't take you on it, but it's there.
00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay, because I'll be in here more and more and probably at some point, because really I would like to be making traction every day. I have so you know what it just dawned on me like I went and I didn't my math and I was like I'm making $150,000 a year with four hours worth of client calls a week.
00:21:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amazing, amazing.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like anyway because I got myself into that taking care of other people I didn't know how good it it was because I was awesome. But I was like that's pretty amazing I don't really know anybody else that does that.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, that's huge.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In all the time and but I also you don't really want to be talking about it because you know.
00:21:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah they're like oh yeah I don't want to pay you so much your existing clients.
00:21:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No no no I really I've learned like I used to be a tell everybody everything kind of stuff and people are just not safe with all of your information.
00:21:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah yeah.
00:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You that there are lots of other people that watch and yeah anyway there's just some
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
prudence in keeping things to yourself.
00:22:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I've learned that it's been a painful lesson for me, because I'm a bit blurter. But I think Heavenly Father has wanted me to learn that, you know, pearls and swine, right?
00:22:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't just tell everybody everything.
00:22:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, but I thought, what a blessing that is.
00:22:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, and I've got 12 hours a week that I get to my mission, but that's my like, it's amazing. That's my late night hours.
00:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so my prime work time, there's lots available. And I love that we're getting something very specific for me to sink my teeth into and put some energy into so like we could go faster. I'd be okay with that. got, I'm excited about all of this. Okay, so what I'm, so what I'm going to work on and have ready by Tuesday, I'll tell you, but this is where I'm going to be spending a lot of energy. wanted to surprise you, but that's not how I'm this work. It's not a good idea. So what I like to do, what my plan was, was to go through your transcripts and your emails and anything that I've seen you share. And you like to keep things in Google Drive. So if you have anything around YouTube, rough profits that you've been storing in a Google Drive folder, if you could share that with me, that'd be great also. what I want to do is I'm going to take the transcript and find all the goodness that I can take out of it in the best possible format. And I'm also going to try to build some sales copy out of it. No, based off of what you shared, based off of the anecdotes that you sold, it's shared some of the stories you shared, the way that people have responded to you, some of the testimonials that might have been found in that. But I'm going to run it through chat, GPT, and cloud. So that's going to take me several hours. But then, I'm I'll show you what I've got, and if you like the outlines and the things I've put together, then I'm going to go hire Maui to make it look good and create some stuff and start putting the course together. by the next week, we might have something we can actually put into a school group and walk people through. The other thing I might do is see if I can go take some of your exercise training. So you're not working again. And then you might go make supplemental videos, okay, say like in video one, I taught you X and maybe that was webinar. But let's go deep diver and I've never shared this before, right? And all new, exclusive to you guys, blah, And while I'm working on that, go, oh, that's something that's an SOP that she talked about that I can put into the SOP process and into the Trello Board and whatnot. So like I've got hours and hours and hours and hours of work based off of what you've already done.
00:25:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. SWELL.AI may be something else that's like that when you said CAPC and the other things to repurpose all your content. It's, uh, no doubly.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not SWE, or lack of shame.
00:25:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is the guy that does that YouTube channel. maybe just go for it. It's relevant to what we're talking about.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why. Oh, it's all one part..AI.com. Sorry. Yeah. That's cool. mean, because I already paid for the other two.
00:25:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:25:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyway, yeah.
00:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just thought I'd share that with you. I also have, I'm not really impressed with it. The crop was a column. have to ask Dan because I paid for it. But it's an AI book creator and it creates.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's just a thing by the audible guys. I'm the steep Michelson guy.
00:26:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, designer. have designer too. Yeah. Yeah. yeah. We talked about this. all of these.
00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can repurpose. So, and this is what I was talking about. Like, if you wanted to do a couple more webinars just so that we can sell it. Or maybe even only one until we can get up a funnel, a simple funnel that we could just drive profit to. Yeah. Anyway, so my, my sole focus is going to be repurposing all of the content that you just made in your webinar.
00:26:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Love it. So, yeah, and I don't really have much of a Google Drive, just so you know, because it was just whatever I shared on the thing, but I can put it all into one Google Drive. and start putting stuff there and then maybe in that list due to profits for offerkers put the Google Drive there and share it with you and all that jazz.
00:27:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, should we make it for offer creators and affiliates or affiliates and offer creators? Because I think that there are way more affiliates than offer creators and I think Well, that's an interesting question.
00:27:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's let our subconscious go to work on it, but here's why. People now are understanding digital offers and digital marketing. They don't necessarily know the word affiliates yet until you explain what it is to them, depending on where they're at.
00:27:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're first of all, I think that we don't want newbies. I think we want somebody who has a clue. Oh, okay. Second of all, there is a whole bunch of people who are teaching this and has been teaching this for years. And there's a bunch of stay-at-home moms, like this doesn't normally come across our path. because I don't think we're looking at it but but there is a lot of it.
00:28:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah I used to have because you're gonna have to make 7k my street cred thing yet. I used to have a product age go called affiliate speed profits and really be $9.99 and it was so cool to see in my pal Paypal the Kaching Kaching Kaching $9.99 buyers right but um yeah it's a natural anyone who does digital marketing like should be doing it like even if they're not saying they're affiliate marketers a lot of them are like oh hey use my link to use active campaign or to use ClickFunnels like yeah you're right actually was just on Dean Holland's page only remember him but I was just talking to Sally um I'm not going to off topic here but I referred her because she has a full-time work for me and I like to pay her more but you know I don't have full-time work for her but um there's a guy that is making like about 80k a month on his low ticket funnel he's teaching people faceless videos and he's reselling Instagram yeah Instagram reels and all that stuff but he has a high ticket um program I don't know if it's three or five K and he was looking for a female sales rep. I referred, salad him because he's on the Elton mechanics mastermind group that I'm in. So Sally literally just had to call from today and is looking over stuff and she's like, you know, Maria, he's really just teaching kind of what, do you remember Dean Holland back in the day? Like I even made 4,000 from Dean Holland, Maria. And it's kind of that model, he's teaching them how to become, once you get into his on a low ticket, like faceless marketing and stuff, he's teaching them on my ticket course to learn how to be like an affiliate marketer for his course to resell it. So he's teaching, you know, TikTok, whatever, social media, I think if you should go Dean Holland marketing, but I don't even know if he has a side up yet or not because this is I'm talking like, yeah, internet profits, founder of internet profits.
00:29:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was a YouTube video from 2002, yeah, yeah, anyway.
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyways, that he was the first guy, maybe that started that like not teaching affiliate marketing. No, that's like law History, but I mean he created a funnel and it said hey, I'm gonna teach you how to make a hell of a lot of money Just selling my stuff.
00:30:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so you basically teach a marketing, you know, how to get traffic, right? wonder if we back to copy, shop, this was the first company I turned into. Tell me that was that affiliate marketing? It was one of the things that they taught for sure. And it was the way it made its money was that.
00:30:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I mean, I'm certainly open to that. mean, because you're right, it's an easy way to to get in because then you don't have to worry. Well, see, I keep going to the state home mom, the newbie, but then they don't have to build a whole course if you're teaching them. like marketing, you know, it's they just focus on one piece of but no, no, no.
00:31:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't, I don't want to teach any of that. We're teaching a marketing channel with YouTube. And then we're teaching marketing and business growth. don't want to teach affiliate marketing.
00:31:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it's for marketing marketers.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. the disconnect. It is a marketing channel that you can use for your affiliate business.
00:31:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's going to make my chicken and put it in the fridge. Yeah. Okay.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:31:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can still hear you want to talk?
00:31:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just actually thinking right now. So what's today is the seventh, your, um, your tasks were to create the SOPs to give the VAs and to, and, and to create. systems for hiring VA's. So did you talk about that on your webinar?
00:32:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
00:32:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, step three and four, we ran out of Thomas and I put the members area instead. Okay, perfect. So since that's not something I can capture, why don't you work on that and bring that back on Tuesday completed, like your first version of it completed and then I can take it and clean it up from there and use it to create the Trello board. But I do want to make sure that if we set a deadline that we work really hard to hit the deadline. So let's only set ones that actually work for you. that work for you?
00:32:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Tuesday?
00:32:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do have a piece to hire a VA?
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:32:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's that Wednesday? Because Mondays were Remembrance Day and in Canada. Amanda has that off.
00:33:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I might take half the day off on Monday. Okay. And then can you also do this? Because they go hand in hand, which is creating the system for hiring the VA.
00:33:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what do you look for?
00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. if you have those two and we get that done next week and at the same time I'm working on basically productizing what you did in the webinar. By the end of next week we could have draft one of the products.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:33:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which would be awesome. Because now you can get a Black Friday offer and you could even start a teacher with them right now. Like hey, I've already taught most of the stuff. This week I'm putting together the rest of it. It's going to be available on x-day version one. going to be available on x-day. Early movers get this benefit, but here's the cost is it's not graded yet. So know that in advance, do not buy this if you're going to get upset that it's not done yet. Yeah. But that that's your benefit. But what you do get in part of the early mover bonus is that you get to ask me questions on Boxer for 30 days or something like that. I don't know. Me and Tina are in a school group and we will support you. And then those people might want to move up to the you know, they could be our first hybrid coaching clients because they liked it. And we measured the heck out of them. So instead of making it be, well, I don't know, like something else that we have to create for them, it just could be super support.
00:34:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. That is cool.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's all I have in my brain because I until those things get done, I don't I don't see anything else that's more useful. We already figured out that just putting it in a school account would is the easiest way to fulfill it. It's also a good way to attract existing people and one of those sales pays for school each month. So if it's any time.
00:35:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So two questions. One, can you help me sort how to create the trellibord that I'll give to these people.
00:35:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm going to do it. Oh, I just I just need you to do these two things.
00:35:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I will create it. The which two things the create SLP is good to VAs and the create system for hiring days.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:35:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:35:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can just put that in Google Doc. I will I will project manage to tie as that.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Wednesday is so good, but I'll try to get it done for for Tuesday.
00:35:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then Wednesday's fine too.
00:35:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one is fine.
00:35:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, let's keep Wednesday, but I thought I was supposed to do the trellibord too. That's what I was like. No, no, no, no.
00:36:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So, so, the SOPs could be aces really of the whole process. So that's good, because even myself right now, I'm like, I do love doing the research for each of the videos, but it would be freaking amazing to wake up knowing, knowing like, you know, say Saturday morning or Friday mornings, my time blocks for recording videos, to have like in the Google sheet already filled out the videos I'm supposed to do, to have the script already there loaded in my big view, like, that would be pretty amazing.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, we could start by finding somebody and hiring somebody to do one of those first to let us test our process.
00:36:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. And that's where I think I have to show, okay, this is what I'm putting up work in the description. is how, yeah. So, next, the second question is going to ask you, coming back to the school decision school, though, is monthly, but within almost you do a free school, then the courses can be inside school. Does that where you're thinking that our thing will be free and then the courses are inside or we make something for $5 a month?
00:37:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could do either, whether it's a cheap school group and maybe there's a separate one and it's YouTube specifically because we were talking about it being a keyword rather than the marketing with Maria is specifically marketing and I think that that fits for what we're doing in the future. So, you know, you could charge $5 a month for that, $10 a month for that, but each of the products levels inside of it become, you know, the course access is charged for the course. The one thing to keep in mind though too is that, well, a couple things. First of all, we're talking about moving everybody to high level where we can have a better nurturing experience in the future. So, this is the rudimentary version of it and we're as a trade-off for speed of implementation, yes, it costs, you know, $100 a month, but for speed of implementation just to get there right now, and also high level costs more than that when we're looking at an agency level and all the other things that we're gonna do, or how the level costs the same, right, it's still $100 a month, either way. So yeah, speed of implementation, also existing audience pool, so yeah, we could make it free and just ascend them up into the product, and then if we wanted to have a group access, know, there's Discord and Boxer and all kinds of other things that cost less money, where if anybody wants to pay more money to get support, we can do that. I'm just talking about what's the simplest way to house the information and sell it and capitalize on existing eyeballs.
00:39:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is what's in school, both in your group, just and the school plot, looking for who else is in this group and what other groups they in and that kind of thing.
00:39:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. Cool. I just wanted to get away from a $99 month thing because that's a hard sell to go through topic. I think we're finding that out, whereas, yeah, versus just sending them to a low ticket offer, ascending like, Hey, here's this for 97. Here's the order bump. Here's the upsell. One upsell too.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you could make it like we could $5 a month, $7 a month. I would bet that with five and seven, the conversions are probably the same. Anything under the $10 threshold or whatever, but you that the conversions are almost exactly the same.
00:39:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But the difference that it makes to us adds up way faster. Yeah.
00:39:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
when you're talking about potential customer support issues that come up whenever and it just kind of pays for itself there. and we can And we can split test it, you know, how conversions go, but, um, so I would do like, either, a dollar to nine dollars, basically a dollar. So we capture a credit card and we know that we don't, we don't get the tire care. Um, yeah, I'd be, um, uh, let's see, how many I wonder if can see it's school groups that cost nine dollars. I can't find it.
00:40:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Continue to free to know. I want to see what happens with that.
00:40:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sean, nice.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a lot of sense.
00:40:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thanks for leaving a cool show.
00:40:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, my engagement goes unranked. Um, um, well, this is Sean, nice to you guys.
00:40:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Just realize that. Yeah, that's why I said Sean.
00:41:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so how April 18. I wonder if you did. So let's go see what his grip is. Um, Sean, I guess.
00:41:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Quantum leap to me for 99 month. Crows clothes, group clothes in public. This is inner circle pricing only. So it looks like he doesn't have a free one or $9 one, unless, unless he drives someone someone else owns it.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what? did you? I saw I heard these mother suckers that was loud. Uh, I see these groups and ships. Oh, memberships. Oh, duh. Four hundred and nine dollars a month.
00:41:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. So he probably has that as less than as a webinar or the email list or whatever.
00:41:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You probably either got rid of a free group or just upgraded it out. Let's go see how old this one is. If we can tell 44 members at five hundred. in our dollars a month. That ain't too bad. John, almost at $22,000 a month. School engagement training.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
look, yeah, click on school engagement training. Where's that going to go? Sam Kart, oh, so he's taking the low ticket funnel. And he could have a private, like a non-discoverable group. That's true. Yeah, but if he's got a group for seven or nine bucks a month, he's going to want it to discover both, so.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. OK, so let's just go back to the original search and see. Move Zoom, $9 on ship, monthly, course. I'm interested in this. That's now I'm not sending through those. Can't see it. I'm free, um, joining this group with $9.00 from month, I should price it starting on school with white pricing, white pricing on like being under $9.00 a game, change our, change our own school months ago. Yeah, so this thing and they reference stand store. Oh, wait a minute, how the price of school growth. Yeah. Anyway, I think that $9.00 per group, one of my mom and I will sign.
00:44:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I wonder if under discovery you can search by price.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you go back to school, well that's growth works, flutter, just got a vacuum piece.
00:44:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there's a filter there, and then can you enter $9 there?
00:44:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I if you did $9 slash month with that filter, I don't know, yeah. We'll just do all public, private. Yeah, that's really weird. Yeah, you should be able to go with sending, descending, all that stuff. Yeah, it's not very good. Searching 299 or 100 members. mean, this is interesting. It just says paid. It doesn't say how much. Five dollars a year for nine a month. I mean, a yearly fee is something also. So like $49 a year instead of.
00:45:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, oh, yeah.
00:45:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we do that?
00:45:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can. That's why I was going. That's right.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's a new functionality. If I recall now, right? I don't know. They've had it for months at least.
00:45:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, that because what I do now is like $5 a month or $25 for the year, but I do like this aspect of.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look how bad this search function is because I said paid. Oh, no.
00:45:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How are you?
00:46:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Anyway, 97, 55 a month, $4,000. This is world simulation.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Manifestation.
00:46:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really? Whoa. Wow. Now members that remember some people might have had three then just converted it because like mine was free up to two hundred twenty.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's true.
00:46:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:46:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
now it's a.
00:46:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's interesting is how many have, I mean, again, like you said, you don't know. And some could show that they're free, but you don't really get access unless you bought it somewhere.
00:46:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:46:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a really smart market is not going to show you everything that they're doing.
00:46:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Mm hmm.
00:46:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just think you can't just go funnel hack them. Which is another reason to not be on school and grow a really big business because then you get these guys. Studying you and telling everybody what they're seeing Yeah, yeah, well Yeah, and I think our short-term play here is it makes sense like Alan even talked about it recently how I think school is like You can make a lot of money with it But it's like getting get out because I don't think after a year is gonna be as good at all because the attention It's never sit when you're on there because there's so many other school communities to join and then they like Facebook Yeah, yes, so short-term I think it has to be paid so we don't get spam You know nine to nine dollars monthly or you know 67 a year whatever Take something see see what happens But the bigger thing will be in and how great we teach and can show the value And and that it's an over in our cost. Yeah, and that will be we do with the evidence with the feedback And then the other thing is we want to make sure that you're following up with people and saying, okay, who's implementing? are you doing?
00:48:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are your results report? Yeah? Yes, that's what's hard about a community. Yeah, sorry.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, no, we'll build that in and it could be private Want to hear and we we would love to just share your results without sharing your secrets We don't even have to identify you. We just want to say hey, you know, this works because we want other people other business owners to know that that they can find success and Really talk about the economy and sewing like goodwill, you know, like imagine what would happen if I didn't teach you what I know Like yeah, with other people what what works for you that type of thing.
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I want to wrap up because I got a mentally get ready for for talking to Dan
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But so having the plan in place for if you're in and will you remember to to work on these and that will you remember these assignments? Yeah. Okay.
00:49:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I just want to make sure. Oh, thank you to keep me blinders on.
00:49:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And here's another thing. Open the card. So you should be able to set reminders for yourself if you want to.
00:49:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not going to just put in my calendar time box because because even if it messages me like I have so many emails that go to my inbox that it gets lost.
00:49:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So whatever your system is for making sure that stuff is done on time. That's what I want to apply to these things because this, like what we're building also should give you lots of freedom so you can play with the things that you want to. I just want you to prioritize this that we're building it because think of this as this is the freedom box. This is the one that pays for everything.
00:50:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is the one that's scalable.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the one that delivers you like just gives you this is the vehicle for everything that you want to be able to do. It builds your platform. So like if you've got a message you need to get out to the world. This is what we're building. And it'll be both of us. So it's the financial. It's the sharpening our saw. It's a following that we could make offers to. And everything that could be most useful to us. And I'm just as a reminder I'm the person making out there $50,000 a year with four hours worth a week. That's faultless to be still like all that was designed. That's what I tried to do. But it still blows me away. Anyway, but the reason people do pay me that much money is because I teach them how to do this type of stuff in their own business. hour with me a week, they're getting the same kind of stuff, way more money, hardly any time working in comparison. So if we stay with this and stick on track, that's what you have is just lots of time with Amanda and your mom and dogs and plenty of money, but still play time and enjoying business and loving the people that you work with, that's what you're going to start having all the time.
00:51:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay!
00:51:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I get to have it because I get to spend time with you and see your amazing brain and your awesome energy that just makes me happy and your Bible scripture studies, I love that too.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Yes. All right. All right. Well, say how to dance for me. Okay. All right.
