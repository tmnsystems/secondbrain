00:00:16.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Started to text you a couple hours ago to remind you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Tina Marie: Hello!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dan: Hello! Hello!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Tina Marie: Did you remember?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Dan: Yeah, I was uh. It's changing the toilet paper role in the bathroom because.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Dan: My lovely daughter Mariel. It is hilarious. I take pictures of it. Because.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Dan: A she never does it, but she'll like. Sometimes. Uh, she'll like I went in there one time, and if she had lived it's like a slide up. It's like a.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Dan: Cantilever them, or like a light lever, or whatever. But like she puts the toilet paper on top of it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Dan: Next to it. I'm like, Oh, my God! But you can't put it on the actual device. No.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Dan: So then today I'm in there. I was in there, and I look over, and it's just an empty role I'm like, Oh, my God!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Dan: So you used it. You used it all up, and then you decided to leave it. Completely empty like. Oh, this kid is killing me!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Tina Marie: That's it's not only most kids. It's most people, you know, that.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Dan: It's true. No, really.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yes, really.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Dan: Oh, I had no idea. I I just chalk it up to teenage brain the other the other day I went in there. I'm like you've got to be shitting me. She like dyes. Her hair.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Dan: She like bleached out a spot. And then wanted to diet like, you know.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Dan: Change it right? So it was blonde. She's making a purple.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Mhm.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Dan: And then brand new. Counter like sink built in or countertop, white.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Dan: Just covered in purple dye um, and like stained. I'm like dude. Are you shitting me like? What are you doing?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Dan: 0 reaction, and she goes oh, it comes off. I'm like, how do you know that? Oh, I did it before, and I go. How does it come off.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Dan: Because you just put so you just leave soap on it and it lifts it up. I'm like you better be right.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Dan: So apparently she did clean that because it's no longer there. But I was like. You have got to be kidding me. The purple splotches everywhere.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tina Marie: I get them on my rugs, which it does not come out of on the walls, on the doors. Cause. I have 4 daughters, so I've been through it a lot.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Dan: Yeah, it's on the wall, too. But I'm I'm in processing. Peeling that paint off.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Tina Marie: Hence the giggle day and.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Dan: Mhm, oh, I knew you'd know.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Tina Marie: Ah yes! But also I was that girl, too.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Dan: But then you contrast that like we went and saw Evelyn over the weekend. And Ebelin is like.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Dan: Like I was impressed. I'm like, Oh, my God! She is like. Dialed like she's got a plan.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Dan: She's executing. She's. Clearly doing the research. She's clearly looking into this stuff right? So now she's like.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Dan: She really is. Gonna go down this Od path and become an optometrist like that's what she's doing. And I was like, okay. And then she's like, I'm gonna get out. I'm gonna become an associate. And then in like 5 years, maybe open my own practice, and I was like, uh.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Dan: Okay. I did not expect that. And I'm like, Where where are you? Gonna go? I don't know.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Tina Marie: Where did that come from?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Dan: She went from. I want to go to Europe and be a translator to. I'm going to go study. Oh, I forget what her actual branch of biology is. But she's like, I'm gonna study. She's basically.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Dan: This is what you told us when I when we were up there, and I didn't know this. She's like, I'm basically pre-med.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Dan: Basically is what I'm doing. And then I'm gonna go into Od, and I go. Where are you gonna go? And she's like, I'm gonna try to go to Uc. Berkeley. It's the best one in the country.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Dan: And she's like I could probably get in there because I'm going from one Uc. To another, and then she's working angles to like look good to them. I'm like, Okay. And then she's got 2.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Dan: 2 other schools picked out. One is in. Think one's in Massachusetts, and one's in Illinois.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tina Marie: It was like, I'm bouncing hard.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Dan: Well, yeah. And then she's like, and then I'll I'll you start out making like a hundred grand a year.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Dan: What I thought was funny is, I was like, oh, it's cute that you think that's a lot of money.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Dan: Yeah, I didn't want to break her bubble, but I'm like a hundred grand. Ain't shit.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Tina Marie: It's so funny, too. Like, yeah, how. It's weird, because, like I, when I started making so much more money, and then.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Tina Marie: It being I. You just think it's a lot. 1st of all the taxes, but also I pay tithing, and I pay tithing off the top. So that's 10% automatically gone. Before expenses and taxes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Tina Marie: And then but but I hear it, and I see people's eyeballs pop. I rarely talk about it. So if I do talk about it's like with close family or something where there's a reason to discuss the amount. But the eyeballs bold, and I'm like it's not what you think. It is like. You don't understand how.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Tina Marie: Much people, just. Tolerate like bad food, bad health, bad all these things.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Tina Marie: Because that's where the majority of the money goes right is actually taking good care of myself and the family.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Dan: Sure.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Tina Marie: But once you do that. You know, like that's that's 3 times the the average living, what people are doing just to be healthy. So any luxury is above and beyond what they think is already excessive.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Tina Marie: Like. It's just not that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Dan: Yep, yep, totally.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, it's interesting. Oh, good! Oh. My, let me grab this real quick. I just had a door dasher, and if I leave the food out here in my house it's fine, but in 90 degree weather, not so much.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Dan: Yeah, no doubt.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Tina Marie: Thank you. Alright. Um, so any I wanna put this in the fridge real quick. But um, any epiphanies this week like anything to update me on.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Dan: Um. No.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Dan: I mean, it's it just seems like. It's very likely almost everything will be done for Fan Flowy on time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Dan: Which I wasn't totally sure about.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Tina Marie: Sweet.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Dan: But it's like, now it's it's all like coming together here in the last 3 days. I'm like, okay, the book is definitely going to be done by like. Tomorrow, um.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Dan: Well, other than like other than me, going in and literally taking stuff out like.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Dan: I think I have a worksheet. In every chapter, but I don't think that's actually going to be the case, or I will go. You know what there is going to be a worksheet in every chapter.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Dan: Um. So she, her and I worked on the layout stuff. Yes, so we did all the edits, and then I added some. I rewrote a part. I added 2 things based on.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Dan: Johnny, and uh, I'm sorry uh Mark and Shawn's feedback. They all their edits. She implemented. She's changing the font, I added some layout to some elements. There's like.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Dan: There's like, I think there's a throughout the book I put in artist spotlights that like show how an artist used that idea like a famous artist. And then there's like 7 sort of call outs that are like you should try this.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Dan: And then, at the end of every chapter, is like a series of reflection, prompts. The worksheet, and then.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Dan: Something else. I forget what it is. So we worked on the laying out of all those elements so that it's not just one continuous mass of text. I was like, we gotta break this up. And those things.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Dan: Aren't really the text. So I'm like, it looks like they're. Integrated, and they shouldn't be.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Dan: So, anyway, her and I worked that out last night like she was up late. Uh and then. Now she's gonna go, put all those in, and then change the font to get rid of that issue with the Ampersands.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Dan: And then then it'll probably just come down to page breaks.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Tina Marie: Where is this lady from?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Dan: Fuck if I know. Africa.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Dan: Think.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Tina Marie: Um. I have a thought. I want to say it before I forget, because I have other questions, too. But you were talking about. Having worksheets in every chapter.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Dan: Yeah, there is. I mean, they're there. They just don't exist.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Tina Marie: Right? Okay? So anyway, here's the thought, though, is that what if you kind of build in a. Mechanism for identifying P, like extra talent and um, I don't know that this would work really well, because now my brain is going well, the creative types don't. Um.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Tina Marie: Necessarily fill out worksheets and stuff, but the super driven do and. You know, if they, if it's not just an artist, but a band, you know there could be the the superpower Creator right? And then the almost the integrator, right? Because it almost seems like there's 1 of those personalities.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Tina Marie: In any collective group. Once you start going like there's that's the person who's like kind of their business manager inside of the. The um group. Now I'm not talking about.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Tina Marie: Average. I'm talking about. What if you build a mechanism to. Help kind of maybe.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Tina Marie: Find. Outliers, and it's through.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Tina Marie: The book in A, in, in that you ask particular types of questions, or in your worksheet sheet. Maybe they submit it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Tina Marie: To you right? And and it could be an AI thing, because I don't think you're gonna have a ton of people. So it could be a person. But um where you look for the answers, and you look for outliers in the answers.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Tina Marie: Including like your onboarding so like. What if there's a. Artist profiling that you do that I think you're probably already doing that right. You've got all of this stuff coming in. But in addition to that, these worksheets that get more into the nitty gritty. So first, st you know, they were willing to read a book.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Tina Marie: And second, that they filled out the worksheet and creative or not. Superstars, for the most part, are people who are willing to do work.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Tina Marie: And anyway, what if you just have. You build into this? Not just. It's artist development. But what if it's.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Tina Marie: Artist. Um. Kind of scouting.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Tina Marie: Where you're looking for. Different types of answers on top of a combination of, you know, some of their songs.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Tina Marie: Oh, it would be really cool, too, if you could. What would be cool if no, but if you, if there would be kind of like an AI analyzer of music to go, hey? I've checked all their songs, and this one has the patterns that. Hits like typically have. And there's different patterns right? And it's across different genres. But.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Tina Marie: Anyway, never had that thought before. So there! Just what.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Dan: Yeah, I get what you're saying. Um.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Tina Marie: To come.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Dan: So I don't know if that I mean. It's almost like you could have a point system.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Dan: Attached to their. So I I realized. 2 days ago.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Dan: I was like, oh, we don't. Well, actually, I don't know if we can do this. I thought I was like, Oh, we shouldn't have a mom sub account. They should all go into Fan flowy. But then I don't think you can do that with high, level.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Dan: Because if the. You can only have one business name.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Dan: So then the business, or or you make the business name, mom. Cause. Then I was like, oh, we should have all if we just had them all on one contact list. Then we could.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Dan: Cross offer tag them blah blah blah. Pull data from circle and append it to their record in there, and like start to.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Dan: Score them. Basically, like you were talking about. Figure out what we think matters, and score them if they buy the book.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Dan: That's 1 thing. They join the community. That's 1 thing. If they book a phone call, that's another thing, right? Like, are, what are they doing? If they have. 10 songs out. That's another thing like.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Dan: I did see one yesterday that I thought was interesting, where. The this person. I think it was a girl. She was like.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Dan: She had answered, oh, you know, I want to get. I want to get more exposure and get out there. Last song released 2 and a half years ago, like, I think you got a different problem.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Dan: You don't have a product like if you haven't released a song in 2 years, you're barking up the wrong tree. So you would look for that right consistency of releases.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Dan: Um one of the bands that's on the platform. This band called Anaria, like they're adopting all of it. It's very interesting. They are consistently releasing a song like every 12 weeks.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Dan: They're consistently building their fan list like they're becoming like the case study. They want us.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Tina Marie: That is so. Fun.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Dan: They want us to sign them they've asked for. They're like we wanna be in whatever you guys are doing, we wanna we want it all. I'm like, Oh, okay, but.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Dan: Yeah, I don't know. I I hear what you're saying. I I just don't know. It's gonna be one of those things where, like you start to see it and you go. Oh, oh, okay, wait a minute. We should be doing this, but I am trying to set everything up. To capture.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Dan: Per usual as much data as possible.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I. I think that that's probably one of the most exciting things about what you're doing. So I I love it for.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Tina Marie: You know how it happens like I have a thought, but then, like a hundred of them all stack on each other instantaneously, and then I have to pick which one actually gets to come out of my mouth because they can't all come at once. That's where we're at right now, Dan. But.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Dan: Well, yeah, I'll tell you. One interesting thing that happened was. I think it was Monday.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Dan: Um mark. Texted me, and he's like.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Dan: Rami wants your brain. On his brand.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Dan: Blah-di blah-di-bla. And I'm like who the fuck is. Rami, like.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Dan: I'm like laying in bed. I'm like. Who's Rami? So.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Dan: The only Rami I could think of, and I knew it wasn't him was Rami Malik, who played. Freddie Mercury in in Bohemian rhapsody.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Mhm.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Dan: I was like. Oh, I loved him in Bohemian rhapsody, and I sent a picture of Freddie Mercury and Mark's like. Not that Rami. And I'm like, Yeah, I know. But I don't know what you're talking about.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Dan: So anyway, it's this dude. I can't remember his name, but if you search Google it's Rami, he'll be. It's like Rami something or other. He's a producer. But.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Dan: I they had mentioned him before years ago. Um, and I guess he's back on the scene, and he's seeing Fan flow, and he's hearing what they're doing. And he's like, I need this. I need help with this kind of thing.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Dan: This dude like wrote. Fucking. Hit me, baby one more time, like his resume.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Dan: Ridiculous. It's. Ridiculous. So Mark's like he wants your brain on this. Can you put some time on it?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Dan: So of course, I'm like who and I'd look it up. And I go okay. And I start looking around. And I whipped up like a social media plan for him in like 20 min. I'm like this is what we do.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Dan: Just do this. And I was like, I just looked at his. I looked at stuff that he's on. All he needs to do is behind the scenes and tell stories. Period, and I'm sure he's got stories from Miles. If he was working with Britney 20 years ago.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Tina Marie: I mean, he's got a if I'm looking at the right place. He's got a face for social media and just talking.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Dan: Yeah. But his Instagram is like.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Tina Marie: Time.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Dan: Him and his kids. I'm like, Nope. Nobody wants to see that.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Dan: Sorry, Buddy. I mean it's nice and all. It's sweet. But no, but if you scroll through his Instagram all of a sudden, it'll be like Charlie Puth. Um. Oh, who's the other guy that it's sick? It's a crazy. The people on his Instagram like it's him in the studio with them. I'm like that.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Tina Marie: I mean, and his wife is.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Dan: Post, Malone. I'm like.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Tina Marie: Danny.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dan: I know Post Malone uh Charlie puth some other dude. But the if you scroll through all the only things that really get engagement is that? And then, if you search his name on Google. He comes up a bunch. But it's in the context of somebody else's content. But I'm like, Okay.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Dan: That content. And it. It's some of the top performing content for that brand. I'm like, the reason is the content. It's the guy and the story. So like, you just need to do that.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Dan: And then I then I came up with um. He could do a thing called Rami's rundown.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Dan: Where you offer to, he randomly pick songs that you submit. Oops. But they have to be. You have to be on spotify because we want to know that.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Dan: The song cannot be released, because there's nothing you can do about it after the fact. You can't go recut it. I mean you could. But nobody's going to do it. So it has to be like an unreleased song.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Dan: Not necessarily fully mixed, or whatever. And then he randomly listens to a selection of songs and gives feedback on them. And then that's content, too.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Dan: I'm like that would crush, and we would get a shitload of leads. Mark's like you just came up with that. I'm like pretty much.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Tina Marie: Welcome to my brain.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Dan: Yup, but I'm like we need to do that, and then I go. He could be on fanflowy like, why not? And then we can move Daryl on fanflowy and like they can start building email lists.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Dan: And then have, you know. Follow up things.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And that would be amazing for getting people on fanflowy to have somebody like that. There.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Dan: Oh, absolutely! And then we can put them in there.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Tina Marie: These kids are the cutest.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Dan: We could put them in our advisor panel, or whatever it is. I forget what I called it. But something like that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I love that. Um. And when the air conditioning kicks on here it is so loud it's very effective, though.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Dan: Open.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Dan: And needed.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and go outside for 5 min. I'm like, Yeah, this is great. I love the heat. I'm like. Coming back, in.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tina Marie: Uh, but it's good um. Okay. Anyway, I mean, that was a whole new thing. You just destroyed what I was already thinking about.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Tina Marie: But just that I love. This for you.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Tina Marie: But I love this for people, too, because just. The the systematic strategy of it, without the.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Tina Marie: The filth and the soul selling. That is, you know.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Tina Marie: Part and parcel really with the industry for the most part. Not that they're not going to get exposed to it, or whatever. But you, you make it possible for so many other things, and for them to just. Have new thoughts like, Hey, there are people that you know. I could just do business with.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Tina Marie: I mean booking gigs is a whole nother thing, and I think that's a huge part of the soul selling. But. Anyway. But I love that you. You get like analyzing the data of all these people coming in. So it's like a puzzle that has.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Tina Marie: However many puzzles are. Are the artists right? Anytime? You're just like, hmm. I've got some extra time. Wonder what I could do today. Just go start analyzing.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Tina Marie: The artists that have come in and. Look at the data that you're collecting, and then look at the patterns, and then, whether you just go improve the system or go look at a particular artist that maybe you want to go.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Tina Marie: Play with right for lack of a better word puzzle, just like.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it's.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Tina Marie: Put your brain on.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Dan: It's everything in my power to not do that. I know that's where it's headed. But like today, I was like, All right. If I get all this done. I got to get feedback like I told you last week. I'm I'm already building the book funnel, even though I'm not supposed to be.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Dan: Like I'm not supposed to be according to who uh me. So.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Arbitrary.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Dan: Yeah. So I sent that to Saad. Uh, I gotta hit him up. And I'm I think I'm right. I just need him to confirm that I'm right.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Dan: Um, or tell me what the solution is. So. But it's like.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Dan: I don't. I'm trying to get this across, Mark, like we don't need to make the mistake of like. Going and digging another hole.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Dan: I'm like, just because the book exists. Like, if people start buying the book. Yes, I want to turn on the book funnel, but.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Dan: The sales, pipeline. Wasn't working as far as tracking.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Dan: I think Eric and I figured that out. Uh, like Tuesday. And we built some stuff. And now we need data to go into it to make sure it's working correctly. I'm like, okay, if that's solved, great.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Dan: But that doesn't mean I should go turn on a new lead source and start pumping leads into a sales funnel. Because Mark is the only sales Guy.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Dan: And his calendar's full. And then I hear, Mark, I was thinking about this today. I have to dig into this because I can't remember.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Dan: Maybe you remember it. I don't even know if this has a name. But it's like we're hitting. This next quarter is like a transition point. It's like everything's gonna launch. And it's like, Go start doing sales get leads, but like don't go crazy. You gotta do more of the same.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Dan: And then maybe more of the same. That's similar, which is my spotify scraper thing, and that's it. And maybe start effing with the book.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Dan: Maybe like, get a little deeper in with Maria. But you can't really launch the book unless you have a sales floor, and we do not have one. And it's not easy to spin one up.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Dan: So on that front. Like next quarter. I'm starting to think, okay.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Dan: We need to start looking at like. That. Okay, how are we gonna do that? And also the idea of. And this is the thing I can't remember.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Dan: There's this concept of like when you're hiring the mistake people always make is they hire people to do the thing that's close to them. But you're supposed to do the thing that's further away from you.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Dan: Right. So the the. And close to you would meet.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Tina Marie: You mean hire somebody to do the thing that's further away from you.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Dan: Yeah, instead of people tend to hire close. So mark.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Dan: His inclination would be, hire a sales, guy, and I'm like no dude. You should not do that. You should hire someone to do other shit that you do like. Make a list of the shit you do. The thing that you're best at right now is sales.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Dan: And then you have all these other things you need to hire. The thing that's further away. Sales is the thing that's closest to you. Don't hire that. And and that's everyone's inclination is like, I'm gonna hire a sales guy.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Tina Marie: Well, what if you switch the language a little bit, and and I'll and I'll tell you why.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Dan: But do you? Does that sound familiar.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Tina Marie: Yes, Dan, but.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Dan: Okay, I'm like, that's a thing right?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Tina Marie: But but but but the words, the words matter for.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Tina Marie: Everyone. So what what I like to use, though, is genius zone, because number one ego kicks in. Actually, that's not number one. It's it's this, it's the side effect that they in us. Certain personality types need that.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Tina Marie: Um. But the other thing is because it. Implies value. So when you say closest to you, that doesn't imply any value when you say higher away from your genius zone, right? You. The word genius implies a lot, but high value.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Tina Marie: Is definitely their unique. Is definitely there.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Tina Marie: And so.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree, yeah. And I'm gonna use myself in this example. Like.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Dan: I made the mistake multiple times. Thinking I could hire someone that would think like me.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Dan: I I can't do it. It's not possible. It just does. It's just not possible. And then it's also I also learned.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Tina Marie: I told you that.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Dan: You're never. It's not going to get the same result.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Dan: They're never going to think like me. They're never going to be. They're never going to be driving down the street going. Oh, I got it. And why they're they're just not gonna it's because they're not me.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Dan: And it's like I can't ever hire that out. And I've learned that. Yeah, you don't want to now. Granted with in his scenario. Yes, you can eventually hire out sales, and you do want to.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Dan: But you might not ever be totally removed from that zone. Because you're you're kind of the one that's creating that whole thing for this project.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Dan: I'm not creating it. Could I go in and develop a sales team? And yeah, I've done it. Am I the best at it? No, probably not. I mean I've been successful with it.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Dan: So. But I want to try to. So I'm gonna you know, get with Mcgrack and Gpt today and talk about this. But I think that's the thing we need to identify that for.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Dan: Everyone right. Another one for me is like. I am now working with Eric to be like, you need to start doing all the automation stuff.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Dan: Like. So on Tuesday. I. I started giving him instructions, and he was like dude. These instructions are awesome. I'm like, Okay.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Dan: I can take 20 min to come up with the scope and then give it to you. And then sit here with you and work it through and like.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Dan: You know, Eric's like we're going through the thing and I go. Oh, well, you know, you could do it like this. And he goes. Yeah, dude, this is, we just need to do this because he's like you come up with shit like right away. And he's like, I didn't even think of that. But yes, that makes total sense. And then we borrow stuff from other stuff. But I'm like, that's me saying, Okay, that's not.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Tina Marie: Hello!

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Dan: It. It's not necessarily in my genius zone. Yeah, I'm good at it. Yeah, I've been doing it this whole time, but it's time I I gotta let that one go so that I can. Now what's coming next. I need to free up the brain space.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Dan: For what's next, and I don't know what's next exactly, but I know that. Everything is iterative that I do.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Dan: And we're about to. And each quarter is basically the start of an iterative iterative phase. And it's coming up in several days.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Dan: But it needs to happen to everyone like I don't know what. Johnny's doing all the time. I don't know what Sean's doing all the time.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Dan: But I know that they're all doing multiple things. And it's like, okay, this is how we start to build a team by hiring.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Dan: Outside that zone. Um. And it's also happens to be things that would have.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Dan: Minimal effects. If they go bad. Whereas if you hire a sales guy, and they suck.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Dan: It's devastating which.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Tina Marie: They actually they have an example in House of the. Kind of compounding effect of doing this with Johnny, because in the beginning.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Tina Marie: Johnny was tapped all over the place. There was no rhyme or reason, it was draining him. Um. He didn't. He didn't feel as valuable. He he didn't feel respected, but also he didn't get to.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Tina Marie: Develop any of the skills that he was working on. And I don't know how many tasks he's doing now, but I know enough from our conversations that he's getting more.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Tina Marie: Um into specific type.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Dan: Still, he's still the janitor.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Dan: But I think I think less of the janitor because they don't have. They're not out there doing random bullshit.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Dan: And so, and they is Mark.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Dan: So Mark would go rustle up random bullshit business, and then it's Johnny's job to. Field whatever go, make this. Epk, go design this website.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Dan: Go! Do, Johnny, go! Do, Johnny, go! Do that! So, I think. Yes, there's less and less of that.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Dan: Um. But even with him. Like. I know that he's doing all the ads.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Dan: And he does some of the onboarding. I think Sean does some of the on board. It's not really clear to me who on boards. I think him and Sean might tag team it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Dan: I don't know. I I would say neither of them. I think. Like onboard, someone a hundred percent. It's like, Sean maybe does.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Dan: The face. 1st couple steps, and then Johnny takes over on the more techy stuff. Maybe.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Dan: I think it's something like that, and that's part of. That's part of what I want to resolve next quarter is like, really.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Dan: Get that dialed in, so that. And that um, we should be able to do that, because that's I'm waiting for that code to go live like right now.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Dan: Uh, and then. It would be like, Oh, can you? Can we hand off onboarding like I feel like that is probably something that could be executed. If there's an sop.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Dan: And and we can build some automations around that, too. As long as I can get feedback from the people that are are doing it, and like.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Dan: Are these the actual steps? Like I had to map out the steps? I'm like, Okay. Eric and I are gonna build that.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Dan: And then you're going to tell me if these steps are correct. And then we'll see.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. It's coming together, though I think I think so. 1st things first.st Right order of operations. That's where you're going is.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Tina Marie: Um having this conversation. This is this is early on in terms of actually having a business with them in need. Flowy. Because it was for the way that I'm looking at it is everything up till now has kind of been Mvp.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: Right. So they've been offering.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Dan: Yeah. Totally.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Tina Marie: Versions of it, so it hasn't really fully existed while it's been being mapped out and developed. And um, which is great. But in order to.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Tina Marie: Maximize what you're creating and doing together, like, if they want to have a version of the freedom that you have. And and maybe that's the part of the pitch, right? Because they're not getting younger.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Tina Marie: Is um. That that the more that they segment.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Tina Marie: Their roles and responsibilities into genius zone. And let's say, genius zone adjacent. Um. They'll the time that they do spend working will have.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: The greatest impact. On revenue, on growth, on.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Tina Marie: Maintaining momentum. And then um.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Tina Marie: The the odds that their genius zone is going to be non-profitable is is small, right? Because we've got Mark. I would say his genius zone is sales persuasion. It's just.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Tina Marie: Bring. It's it's a acquisition of some sort, whether it's talent for the team, talent, um for other people or um venue sales deals revenue, whatever it is, he can acquire it for everybody through his charisma and just drive and energy. The sean with his.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Tina Marie: Just ability to identify everything magical in the music industry, plus, he has the brains for. Operations and um structure, and just knowing that there has to be a business and being a voice of reason with that which you also you're the primary one. But um! He! He's got that kind of in house for them on the.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. I don't. I don't know how to say it, but I would say, in house you guys are all together, but they've they've had longer relationships.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Tina Marie: And then Jim, with a video and. All of them with music. What's the word? They don't.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Dan: I don't know. I mean, that's what you got me thinking is, I don't know um.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tina Marie: I don't. But, Johnny, hold on, Johnny, from what I've.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Dan: No, I meant with them all wanting to do music. I'm not sure if that's yeah, yeah, I don't know. I would say yes, but.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, yeah, I know. But I that was that was the least. That's the least important thing for what they're doing, though, other than Shawn's ability for his musicality, and and be able to find, you know, gems um! And and knowing who's got a hit, and who's got that type of thing right.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I well, yeah, you got me thinking, is that like, hadn't thought about this? Um.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Tina Marie: But if they.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Dan: But. I'm gonna ask Bobby about this. So you know, with.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Dan: With Eos. You do the Vpo. Right? So we just did this with Jeff, Jeff, Bobby and I.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Dan: Are doing a are doing a Vto for that, and, like.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Tina Marie: Is that a 1st time.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Dan: Mm, uh, it's the 1st time in. 6 years. It's since we since we.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Tina Marie: Started.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Dan: Like. Originally it was like launch the subscription blah blah. So we did that, and then we did sort of the.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Dan: The not sort of we did the supplement. And Bobby was like, All right, like this feels like we're move. Now. We're really moving into another zone, and. We have date like we didn't have any data on the subscription, so we couldn't say.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Dan: I mean, I had like a 90 day thing, right? Like, okay, 90 days. We gotta be here. But that was just to be. Hey? We're good. But I wasn't predicting, hey, this is gonna happen 3 years on right? So.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Dan: You know. Then we had a pandemic, and whatever. So we did it.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Dan: Uh in December and January, I think. Um. And then we mapped it all out. And it was like, Yeah, we're gonna sell it.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Dan: Um, we came up with like, we're probably gonna turn. We're probably gonna re-architect our Mcq software because. It needs to be like an app. We're we're gonna look at amplifying certain segments of the exam. Um of the product.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Dan: Uh Yada Yada! Yada! We came bunch of stuff. And then it was like getting up to X amount of subscribers. I forget what the number was, but.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Dan: Sadly, we're gonna hit that in August. So.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: Sadly, is that.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Dan: Yeah, sadly, we're gonna have to adjust that. Um, but then it but then it was like.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Tina Marie: Darn it, Dan.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Dan: Yeah, I know we're gonna have to change that. But. So now I'm thinking, listening to you like, okay, so we need to do like a Vto with them. But.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Dan: They will give me. Fake answers.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Dan: Because it's. It's how, how can they give me a real answer?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Dan: Right. I can give real answers in the context of another 71 and Ninja, because it's I know what's going on. Right. We have all kinds of data floating around. And you, there are things to look at. There's tangible results right?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Dan: With those guys. It's all like, there's intangible stuff. It's. It's like subjective. It's back to. We want to be a worldwide brand. Yeah, no.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Dan: Right. I mean, I think there's a part of that. So. I'm like, I'm gonna ask Bobby this. I doubt he's ever done this, but it's almost like.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Dan: You want to have them do a perfect day exercise individually, completely separate from each other. Don't. Tell each other what you're putting down.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Dan: Because that will get to some of the stuff that you just touched on. Is it, Sean saying, I want to wake up every day, and I'm making music.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Dan: Okay? So there's a path to that through this right to your point of you want the freedom that I have. Well, what would you do with that? Freedom like? Where? Where is it going for you? And where is it going for you like? Is Mark.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Dan: What is Mark's? Is Marx making music? Or is Mark gonna say something about signing artists? And you know he's always backstage at shows. He really seems to be into that.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Dan: Uh, is that really? What you want to do? Is that is that something you want to do more of. Is Jim just me.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Tina Marie: Or is it ha! Or and this is the question to ask, or has that been a means to an end? That you thought was.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Dan: Videos. Right.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: If you don't ask it that way, they may not be able to answer.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Dan: Well, I'm not going to ask anything.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Dan: I just want to give them the exercise and say, What is your answer? Because I got you know I did it. I thought it was stupid, and then I did it, and then I made it real. Right? So I'm like you can make this shit real except for the golf.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Tina Marie: But I need to stress to you how? How again, Dan, how differently your brain works from everybody else's.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Dan: One heritage. No, no, I know. Yeah.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Tina Marie: You fill in gaps that people can't. So to get the most out of the exercise. I feel like adding some words to it can help.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Dan: Well, what I want to do is have them do that, and then do a Vto.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Dan: So I want to see what their answers out of that. I want their answers to that. So I can understand. Where. What is it you really want out of this. I could tell them what I want out of it. I want to fucking. Get this to work.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Dan: To make some money, and then, so that I can. I plan on selling my business, and then I'm only doing this and what I would love to be doing is like making music with people, helping people grow their careers like. Just putting my brain on.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Dan: Music helping artists. Maybe working with artists.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Dan: That's it. And then, you know, running a subscription based business. That is helping all the artists right?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Dan: But and I and I, if I made a bunch of money at that, that'd be great. But I'm already gonna make a bunch of money, anyway. Um. But with them it's like.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Dan: Where? What do you really, you know, like. When I did it with Aj. And I was like, Oh, I want to live by the beach, and, you know, walk to work and have a golf cart. I don't want to hear it. I haven't done that yet.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Dan: Um, I I did. I did like 85% of it. Right? There's just 10 or 90%. There's 10% left.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Tina Marie: I know I'm like, Stop!

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Dan: But. And and then I did that in like.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Dan: I mean, this is the difference. I I did that in like. 8 months. I was like, I can do that right now.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Dan: They can't do this right now. But. I feel like if I knew their answers, and I really knew where they wanted to go.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Dan: It would be helpful, and then you go do a Vto. And then the Vto is like.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Tina Marie: Damn! I don't want to talk about all this existential stuff.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Dan: The numbers. Right? Yeah, exactly. I I mean, that's part of it. But it's like the.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Dan: The I mean. I said this to him on Monday. I was like dude. We you just can't lose focus of building a subscription based business. I can't express to you how life changing it is. And how just the model itself is so powerful.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Dan: Um, and we're doing it. But it's because, you know, they get they're gonna get. They get wrapped up in like signing this artist signing that artist like. Jeremy and Mark Rivers got on the phone, and I was like, Oh, boy! And it was like a love fest, and.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Dan: Mark was like Jeremy's got this client that basically needs fanfloy, which is very weird. But then, again, not because this is my life. Um. Yeah.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Tina Marie: Right. Your people are your people.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Dan: Yeah, Jeremy's actually listening to me now, which is hilarious, like he's building a.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Tina Marie: I mean, it's been like, how many years.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Dan: I know. And he said that too.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Tina Marie: You rub off on people.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Dan: He said that, too. He's like dude I'm I get I don't know what. So he total aside, but like. And you know what this is funny, because it's.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Dan: This is basically. What I'm talking about with these guys. I just didn't think about it like that. I didn't have Jeremy do the perfect day exercise, but.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Dan: He! He's like so manic he'll he.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Dan: He goes off on these tangents, where he. Builds these Rc. Tracks in his neighborhood.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Dan: And he'll go out there and like build the track, and like. It's they're they're.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Dan: Literally great, and then the kids come out and use it so, but he gets all into it. And I go, and I think it was like in December, January. I go, Jeremy. Why can't you.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Dan: Build an Rc. Track for yourself. That's not an Rc. Track.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Dan: That's a business. And for whatever reason that connected, and all he talks to me about now is.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Dan: The Rc. Track. He's building.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Tina Marie: Hold on!

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Dan: And he's building, and one track is for him making music. And then his wife said to him one day. They were hanging out, and she goes. If you could do anything.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Tina Marie: What does the hosting stand for.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Dan: Uh remote control. So it's a remote account.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Tina Marie: That's what I thought, but I don't.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Dan: So those gnarly, remote control cars with like the knobby wheels that like go super fast. He builds these huge tracks in dirt.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Dan: By hand, spent. Oh, yeah. Spends hours and hours and hours, I'm like, why can't you put that sort of energy into your own shit?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Dan: So he is now grinding like 1012 HA day building up this business and he's using. He's using lead flow, and he's like, Oh, my God, this is so great! I'm like I told you that 6 years ago, dude.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my God! Wow!

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Dan: I know it's crazy. So then his wife asked him one day. Couple weeks ago. If you could do anything.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Dan: Anything. What would it be? And he's like, I want to make music, and she goes. Why don't you do that? And then he called me up and he goes. Can I? Can we make music? I go, of course.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Dan: But you have to treat it like an Rc. Track like there's a process you have to learn the process. There are steps, I mean. I can teach you all the shit. So in that thing. It's like.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Dan: If I had a better understanding of, like what those guys want to do. And where they're spending their time, which is what I'll get.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Dan: Next. I'm gonna ask them that on Monday, like, you guys gotta make a list of where you're spending your time. Just put everything down, and then we're going to reorganize it.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Dan: I'll come up with, you know, genius to non genius, whatever whatever Chat gpt, and I come up with. Um, and then have them do perfect day.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Dan: Cause. I don't think I don't. I think they're gonna have. Vastly different answers.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Dan: Especially Johnny, like Johnny's, not married. No, kids. You know I don't know.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well, okay. So back to language.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Dan: And then I'm like I'll fly Bobby up to Boston, and like we'll go sit down with them and do the thing. Just go there for like 3 days and be like we're doing the thing.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Tina Marie: Bye-bye. I think you'll get way. Better results if you do that. But listen.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: So language again um. You use perfect day exercise. I've told you I like.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, ideal. Work day and ideal um work week, and I'll tell you why. Because.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Tina Marie: Some people's brains. When you try to go to the exercise, they come up with the contingencies and the buts, and they don't, and so then they try to give you an average instead of the perfect and the ideal. And that's a problem.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Tina Marie: Because they're undershooting. So. The language that I'll use is okay. So.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Tina Marie: You know, some weeks are different, because that week you're traveling. Or it's a holiday, or you're sick right? That whole week. And that whole day is gonna look different. People try to um.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Tina Marie: Compensate for those types of times in these exercises, sometimes. So that's 1 thing to look at. The other thing to look at is like.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Tina Marie: They will. They're only able to look at it from where they're at now. So one of the versions one of the ways that I ask it is.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Tina Marie: When your business is all grown up right. So. Just by saying, all grown up. They've imagined the stages of infancy and teenage years, and then adulthood and maturity.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Tina Marie: It implies something that they are not even necessarily consciously aware of. That didn't exist. When you don't frame it that way.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Tina Marie: Because what it allows them to imagine without a whole lot of direction. Is that my business is is a baby or right. Some adolescent type stage.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Tina Marie: And it's on a track to get somewhere that I have. Kind of allowed myself to think of and and dream of so.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Tina Marie: So what they need to do is draw a line between their perfect day and that adult business, because if they're trying to frame the perfect day, according to where the business is now, which is what a lot of people do, because they can't. Do otherwise unless directed. Then they're they're modifying what is ideal based off of what exists now. But that's not.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Tina Marie: The way that it works right. That's not how you build what you want to get to.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Dan: I think you almost have to. It's almost like you should have them do 2 things.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Dan: So you should say, Hey, I want you to tell me what the purpose.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes, what's your business look like when it's all grown up first? st

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Dan: Well, or you say I want you to tell me what the perfect day is like, irrespective of work. What is the perfect day? I'll bet the perfect day for everyone is you don't work.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Dan: Okay. Great! What does that look like? Tell me what your perfect day is.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Tina Marie: For me. Does it really look like that for you?

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Dan: No, no. Uh, yeah, I don't work. Tina.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Tina Marie: Right. But that's okay. But again, language matters.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Dan: Yeah, yeah. But but but here's what I'm saying. It's like you have them do that, and I don't. I don't really give them any parameters, I say, tell me what the perfect day is, and then see how much work seeps into that. Then go back to them and say, now tell me what the ideal work day looks like. So it's like, Get the.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Tina Marie: Because.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Dan: Get the big picture in the perfect day, and then go. I don't care if there's work in their it's unrelated.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Dan: They're 2 separate views. Then say, Okay, now, I want you to tell me what your ideal workday looks like. And but you can't. You have to do them in that order? Because if you do in the workday and then the perfect day, they'll bring work into the perfect day. So you go big picture down to Little Picture, and then you take all that, and you go to Vto and say, Okay, now.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Dan: We're going to build. Now, I'm going to build a plan. Because it's a good point a per their their ideal workday will.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Dan: Not be making music right it it'll be more practical, whereas. You know, the perfect day will be impractical, but it's not impractical. It's it's it's.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tina Marie: You married the 2.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Dan: It's a destination, right, as I would call it.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, I think that you'll find that that's something that you can find. Your own version of that iterates because you talk.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Dan: Oh, I can! I can make one absolutely.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Tina Marie: You can actually do. Well. But what I'm saying is okay to the point of Jeremy. And 6 years later, like, you're not going anywhere, you're not going to stop having these types of conversations. And you're not going to stop having the kind of impact that you do on people's lives. But your impact has changed.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Tina Marie: It's always been holy. Crap, you know. Dan changed everything for me. But back to the whole.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: Snarky, existential comment that I made that came from Sean.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Dan: Yeah, who just didn't get.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Tina Marie: Make that about what we did right? Is that it? That's that is what it is. So rather than you just blowing people's minds with any kind of you know. Business thing. Now it's and it's always been business and quality of life. But I feel like.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Tina Marie: You. You have the framework for, and also. You live it now. Quality of life.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Tina Marie: And have for a few years that. Your perspective for that, and your ability to give it, and to know what the framework is.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Tina Marie: Um that I that's more recently acquired. And but all of these people have been with you and following you for so long. And so you you have the opportunity to.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Tina Marie: Give that as well. But it's going to happen. It's happening already as in just you being you. But what I'm saying is, if you start to notice. Um! How you present it.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Tina Marie: And just start paying attention to. How people respond to it, and then.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Tina Marie: Do what you do, and they're not even aware of it. The next person, or the next time you have the same conversation with one of those people. You just tweak it a little bit. Well, what if I try it this way or that way? Because. You're always going to want puzzles.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Tina Marie: People are puzzles. If you're just applying. You know these types of frameworks underlying in in all of the conversations that you're having. The results of whatever you're working on, whether it's.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tina Marie: Music or business, or just. I don't know cohabitating with anybody. Right? You'll you'll notice that you can apply these these things to people, and just.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Tina Marie: It's not like you have to. But anyway, it's just interesting to see. How you can help people shift and just kind of unlock them.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Tina Marie: But in terms of like motivation, why would anybody do it? It's really amazing and rewarding. And I think you know, this. When you have people around you who are just.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Tina Marie: Freer and happier, and and you can have different types of conversations with people who are freer and happier, you know, like it improves your quality of life to be around people who aren't. Imprisoned and shackled by all this. I have to do this, and I have to do that, and.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, I always say.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Tina Marie: You have people around you.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Dan: Yeah, I tell people all the time there are no have to's. There are very few. There are very few have to's in life. Um, and everything is sort of a decision, right? So.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Mhm.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Dan: Alright!

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tina Marie: Trade off.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Dan: Yeah, exactly. Totally.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Tina Marie: It's all trade offs. Yeah, I like that. So um. But then, you know, that's also something that you can embed into. And I don't know if you did into your book. And it, you know, or the the next level of artist development.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Tina Marie: But what kind of music do people create when they feel free.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Dan: Uh.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Tina Marie: Unshackled, you know, like there's definitely a lot of good music from pain.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Dan: Well, yeah, yeah, totally. Well, that's I mean, it's funny. You say that it like. I just wrote a new song.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Dan: And like everyone's like, Oh, my God, dude! This is the best song you've ever written. And I'm like, Oh, thanks! And it is.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Dan: I mean, I just write the most depressing things. Denise is like what is wrong with you. I'm like, I don't know. I don't know where this this comes from. It's like.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Dan: It's weird, it's weird, but it's like a couple. Words just come out of my mouth, and then I go. Well, what is that about.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Dan: So this song is basically about. Being burdened like people being burdened with regret. And it's like.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Dan: You know what it, what that it'll catch up. It's eventually gonna catch up with you, or or that you have to let it go and. Whatever. So I'm like, oh, that's interesting! And then.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Dan: Jeremy and I wrote this song, and although Stacy gave me a really good compliment, she's like, Oh, my God! You sound like! What did she say? Mike, whatever this this singer she's like, Oh, my God, dude! You sound like so and so. Oh, okay, thanks.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Dan: And I got to finish. I'm gonna actually take it. I was listening to it yesterday, but God only knows what it's about. It's like somebody mourning loss.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Dan: I'm like, I don't really live a life of loss. But that's what the song's about.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Dan: Okay.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Tina Marie: But there's all kinds of different loss. There's there's loss of dreams that that feel. People can get attached to things, and they can have a real grieving period over a dream over something. They wanted, a child that they never had.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Tina Marie: Things like that.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Dan: Yeah. Um. Right. But and then for me, I'm I'm just always trying to. I guess I'm just like into the idea of the story. So I'm like, what's the story?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Dan: Um. But yeah, but I mean, so you can write songs like that when you're free.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Tina Marie: Right, yeah.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Dan: You're right. It's like, it's, it's free time.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, just just to be able to create and like, like, imagine characters, there's so much. Anyway.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Dan: Oh, we wrote one with Stacy.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Dan: I hope I hope she can sing it. Yeah, so. And it was her and I, and.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Dan: I forget who it was. It was somebody else. But we were hanging out after our monthly meeting, and we I'm like I always play guitar.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Dan: So I was playing guitar and. Stacy was sitting there, and I go, Stacy, just start singing. She's like, What am I going to sing? I go. Just you just start singing. You start mumbling.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Dan: So she's she's trying, and she can't come up with anything right. And then I go just. No bullshit. I go just start reading the text on your phone.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Dan: So she does, and she's texting Renault, her fiance husband. Guy, right?

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Dan: And she starts singing those. But like a melody emerges. I was like, Oh, that's a good melody, right? Like, Okay, great.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Dan: So we're just screwing around.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Dan: I've kind of got the guitar part. There's kind of a melody.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Dan: And then there's kind of words. And then I take all those, and I.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Dan: I transcribe them the next day, and then I look at them and I go. Okay, what's this about. You would never, you would never guess. I mean like, I know the texts are not that.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Dan: But it basically just sounds like this woman who's left home alone. By her husband or boyfriend, or whatever with her kid, and they're waiting for him to come home.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Dan: And then you find out at the end it's his birthday. So this girl is like Sing, and it has to be a girl that sings it. I sing it so it doesn't make sense. But there's 1 line that says all we have is bread and cheese, and everyone is like, Oh, my God, dude! That line is so sad, and I go, or it's a grilled cheese.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Dan: It's like. That's how you look at it.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Dan: That was the context of the text. The text was, We have bread and cheese. Go make a grilled cheese.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Dan: Because it was Stacey sending it to him. But now in the song it's her saying it to the guy like, Oh, we're here alone.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Dan: All we have is bread and cheese it so it's hilarious, but that song's like. That's the story. It's not true.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Dan: Sounds, true. We need a girl to sing it. That's not a teenager, otherwise it won't be believable.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Tina Marie: Right. That's just wild like that makes a crazy story, too, for.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Dan: But yeah.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Tina Marie: What you're doing, like, how.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Dan: Well, what? Yeah, what's what's really crazy is.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Tina Marie: Go ahead!

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Dan: These like Stacy doesn't get it. And then my buddy in Louisiana oh, I gotta tell you this other story. That's crazy. My buddy in Louisiana doesn't get it. I'm like these songs are going out.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Dan: You. You wrote a song. Like. I don't care if you realize that or not.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Tina Marie: B. Louisiana.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Dan: Dan, my buddy, Dan. He was in a band.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Tina Marie: Dan, Dan, I was like, it's a name that. Yeah, okay, Dan. It's the other day. Okay.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Dan: So this is. This story is great.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Dan: And I'm not going to lie to you. I'm like I knew.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Dan: It was going to happen. I knew it. I'm like, I know, this is going to happen. So him and I wrote this song like, It's a it's an instrumental.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Dan: And we wrote it like last July. And I've been sitting on it because it's an instrumental. And I was like I don't know what to do with it.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Dan: And so he wrote the parts. I arranged it, I wrote strings for it, and then I wrote, I. Programmed all the drums, and then I, you know, cut together an arrangement.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Dan: The whole thing needs to be re-recorded, because I'm like cutting things and moving them around. But it's it's it's a Rad song. It's like super heavy in parts. But when I was.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Dan: Writing the drums. I was thinking of 2 drummers. I was thinking of a drummer named Dave Abrzizi.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Dan: And I was thinking of Jimmy Chamberlain. So Abrazizi played for pearl jam in like the early nineties he's on like 2 albums. And then Jimmy Chamberlain was the drummer for smash pumpkins.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Dan: So. Oh, 2 weeks ago, a week and a half ago. Dave Abrazi is posting on Facebook.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Dan: Hey? I found some old photographs back in the pearl jam days. I'm going to autograph them and sell them, and then donate the money to charity. So I was like, oh, that's interesting.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Dan: So I I'm like, I'm just gonna DM, this guy. So I DM, I'm like, Hey, man, that's cool. What you're doing with the photographs. What's the date? Get Dave Dave Abrzi to play on your track. Fee. And lo and behold, Tina, he emailed, he and I go, of course, if you like the song he he dms me last week.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Dan: He goes dude. I'm down. I love doing music. Send me the song.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Dan: And I was like, Oh, my God, this is really gonna happen. I send him the song. I don't even change it at all. It sounds it's like super demoy.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Dan: Send it to him. He's not online. And while I'm sitting there I watch him come online. I go. Oh, God! He just came online. I wonder if he's going to listen to it? He text me back, dude. I love it. Give me a couple days. I'll get back to you.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Dan: I'm like holy shit, this dude. The. Drummer from pearl jam is going to play on this song.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Dan: But I I knew it in advance. That it was gonna happen. That's what's so crazy. I'm like, I'm and I'm like, Oh, yeah, of course.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Tina Marie: But it's not. You have this is.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Tina Marie: I don't really get to meet many people that have intuitive like powers like you do like I do like. I just know. Things are. Gonna happen. You definitely do you know, you do like, it's not crazy anymore, Dan, it's just you.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Dan: Yeah. I know, but I'm still surprised by it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Tina Marie: I almost think I don't. I don't. I think I'm starting to think.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Tina Marie: I again the the thoughts fight, but. Rather than me knowing something's gonna happen. I feel like I create things happening.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Dan: That's what I feel, too. It's like it's not knowing. It's like this is gonna happen. It's like a certainty. It's a weird level of certainty.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Tina Marie: So I'll give you an example like. When I am thinking about somebody really hard in a particular way, so like um worried about them or missing them, or um.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Tina Marie: Something like that, like kind of nurturing uh in. I'll get messages like or or I'm like, I'm supposed to message somebody, and I don't, because I'm exhausted. And I don't want to look at my phone, or something like that. Within 24 h they will be reaching out to you. Man, you've been really on my mind for the last day, and like well, I.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, that happened to me recently. Yeah, yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Tina Marie: The other way around. You were feeling me, and and it happens all the time, and I'm uh. I'm noticing my girls have that too. And I'm trying to get them to understand. Like you really are a powerful creative like. Be careful what you say. Be careful what you do.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Tina Marie: I don't think everybody is like that, but like my energy, if I walk into a room, people can feel it, even if they don't know what it is yet. If I'm in a bad mood that's felt like it's palpable, and it's weird.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Dan: No.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Tina Marie: And I used to feel bad for it. But I'm like it's not my fault if you get to enjoy my good energy. You have to deal with my bad energy, because it's not my fault.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Tina Marie: But the whole creating like. Energy is.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Tina Marie: How like, how far can it span? I'm like I can. I can think about somebody on the other side of the earth, and they can feel that. So just because he doesn't know you doesn't mean he didn't feel you and feel this magnetic draw that he can't. Identify. But when the opportunity comes it's like, Oh, yeah.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Tina Marie: Of course, that's what I'm doing.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Dan: Yeah. Yep.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Tina Marie: That makes sense. Yeah, cause, you.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Dan: And and I'm gonna be like, Hey, dude, you need a website. Oh, Ps, I have this thing called Sam Fluey.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Tina Marie: Dude pearl dam, and then uh hit me baby one more time. What's his name? Rami? Whatever.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Dan: Rami. Yeah, on like 2 weeks, which I hadn't thought about that. That is kind of weird.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Tina Marie: Um dan your magnets showing.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Dan: Well, yeah, that's like, I mean. It's it's like, I know. Some of these songs are good. I know it.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Dan: I don't care if other people like them. But I'm like, I know this is good, and then I I.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Dan: I sent. I think it was Jeremy. Jeremy just texted me out of the blue. He's like dude. I can't stop singing that song, and I'm like it's not even done.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Tina Marie: I. We gotta wrap up. But this is what I think we should start doing.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Tina Marie: Is, I think you should have an exercise like this with Denise. For you guys, for her, individually.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Tina Marie: And then you, as a couple like what are your? You know. Years look like in the future without kids, because the.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Dan: Are already happening. So yeah, it's like one big trip a year in June. So I'm already. And I go, where do you want to go? And she's like, I want to go to the Greek Islands. I'm already doing it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Dan: It will be booked in June, so like. Or in July, June, or July. So we're doing this Italy trip.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Tina Marie: But perfect day, like. How is she spending her days day after day.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Dan: Well, I mean, that's hard. I think that's harder for her to really see. In the con I mean.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Dan: We now have one gone right. I think it's harder.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Tina Marie: But you can plant the seed of a perfect day exercise, and then do it again next year and do it again the next year, because she'll need a facilitator. From what I can understand on what you shared about Denise, that facilitation process will be huge. So you don't have to keep talking about it or thinking about it, but plant the seeds of a perfect day as a free woman.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Dan: No.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Tina Marie: Who has money, who has a loving companion, but doesn't have a clingy. I need you all the time companion. Doesn't have kids like, what? What does that look like?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Dan: Yeah, okay.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Tina Marie: And what it looks like now is gonna be different than what she even perceives as possible next year, and then, you know, Mary will be gone in a couple of years, right? Maybe, if she goes. Um, but.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Dan: Yeah, exactly. There. That's in question.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Tina Marie: Right, and and if she doesn't, you know but but her doing that also, if you have that exercise, and maybe you do it with Mariel, too, and just be like. Put some um.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Tina Marie: Goal right, some some momentum towards purpose. Because without purpose.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Tina Marie: People just struggle and they drown because this world will keep you busy. You can be busy doing nothing, and it's sucking your soul out, and you don't even know it, because you're busy. Right so anyway.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Dan: Oh, um! Uh remind me to send you the prompts that I found.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Dan: This dude is dropping these crazy prompts, and some of them I'm like, Oh, this is so, Tina. But also, if his prompts are good, I'm like the the way that he structures them is, I'm like, Oh, okay, yeah, I feel like you could take his prompt structure and say, Hey, look at the.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Dan: Structure of these prompts. Turn this into a template, or whatever that you could then say, Okay, I want to write a prompt around this structure, this framework for Xyz.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Dan: And then, but his prompts are nuts. I was like, this is this guy's crazy.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I would be interested.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Dan: But I and I saved like 6 or 7 of them.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Tina Marie: Yes, okay, I'm gonna send you this message email or text.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Dan: Email.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Dan: And then like, so I have, do you? You have a Mac now, right.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Dan: I mean I can share them to you as notes, and then you can. Take the note and put it in your own notes.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Dan: Because I'll probably eventually move them out of notes into something else. But they're in notes right now.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Tina Marie: I feel like. I haven't really got to work with AI or anything for the last couple of weeks, because of.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Tina Marie: All activities happening and traveling, and not but I'm excited to get back to it because the things the structure is coming together so well on top of the tools and the things that I thought I had to build for myself. I don't have to, because they're releasing, you know a version of it every day and improving it. So now I can go back to okay. What? What would be the. Use, case specific.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Tina Marie: Versions. I want not right, not the general tools that allow it to happen, but the specific scalpels. More, you know, with the business applications that I want to use. And anyway, the structure is fun. So probably.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Dan: No, I mean, that's I mean even what we just talked about. I'm like I should do that. I should take this dude's thing and say, I want you to build me.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Dan: An ideal workday, prompt. Right? So could I could just send it to those guys and say, Load up this prompt answer it and send me the results.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Right. So then what you could also do is say, um.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Tina Marie: Like, what if there was like a a pre survey? Right? So before you give them the perfect day exercise you profile them, you get you create an avatar, so have it. Ask a few questions first, st to say so that you can understand. How does this person need to hear the question to get the best results. And then here's the version for your avatar.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Dan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's interesting.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Cause. Then you don't have to like. Try to figure it out. You can have it.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Dan: Well, yeah. And then it's baked into the prompt, and they can't see that it's baked in. But it's baked in.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Tina Marie: Exactly.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Dan: Yeah. Okay. Oh, boy.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Tina Marie: We're gonna be so nerdy this year.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Dan: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm on it all day, every day.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Tina Marie: I was until the last couple of weeks. But yeah, I'm excited to get back to it. All right, and my blood sugar has dropped 100 points in an hour. Again.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Dan: Alright! Thanks. Arizona.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Tina Marie: I hate it! Yeah, it's not even that. Like, it's just.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Dan: Where are you? By the way, are you in Phoenix? You're in Mesa, where.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Tina Marie: Phoenix. Yeah, actually, Scottsdale.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Dan: Okay. Yeah.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's nice and cold.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Dan: Denise used to live in Mesa.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, well, it's like all kind of jumbled together here. It all looks the same.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Dan: Chandler. Yep, all of them.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, Tempe. Yep, all of it.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Dan: Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's where no, she lived in Tempe. My bad.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Tina Marie: Peace. Yeah. That's where.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Dan: Meal have. I've been there a couple of times.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Tina Marie: I like it. I could. I could be an Arizona girl.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Dan: I don't think I could.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Tina Marie: I'm a desert girl. I lived like 7 years in Nevada. Um. And I. I live in high desert in Oregon, because it's like right on the Southern California border.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Dan: Yeah.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Tina Marie: I like the heat.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Dan: Good for you.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Tina Marie: Except I gotta go get some sugar. I would like pound vitamin waters all day yesterday and pineapple juice, and I still couldn't keep my sugar up.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Dan: Bye. Cool, cool.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna be one of those freaking steel magnolias having a. Seizure, because I can't keep my sugar up.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Tina Marie: It's not fun, anyway. Send me the prompt email right now. You have an awesome day, and I will talk to you on Monday with Mark.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Dan: Cool, cool.
