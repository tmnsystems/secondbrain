is there?
00:00:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
Hello.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good. How are you? Well, actually, I'm a little sick, but good.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When I'm good, my baby turned 15 today. So I'm a little going through the fields. I've been a mom for 24 years, and my last little one is not a little one anymore. And then later today, we're going to register her for a pageant, and that is all kinds of big girl stuff. And I'm just like, everything's fine. It's fine. I can't handle it. I can't really handle it. I need babies. I've got the dogs. I'll have to double that. How are you, Patrick? They're good. Who's that?
00:00:59 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
Are you feeling better?
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yeah, but it's going to be winter. I'm going to be for a while. I do not like the winter. cannot wait until I leave. I mean, they're going to Nevada or Arizona. And that's it. That's how that's going to be. So let me go open a note real quick. Okay, there's a sunshine over here. You trying to get on my list, Lauren?
00:01:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Just saying.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying you need to be careful what to say. Because I'm just bitter and angry.
00:01:41 - Lorenz Schuerch
just kidding.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I'm actually going to be in Phoenix on Friday. So that's okay for a few days. Um, um, note, okay, so Lauren's and Patrick. How hard to heart with team members about the need to follow through on tasks. want to make this for me. it. That's not the right one. Oh my goodness. Resizing my windows. You know what I need is I need two screens. I never thought I did, but now I do. But the needs of all three one tasks in order to serve clients, maximize case outcome, preserve job satisfaction and security, and told them we need to get it. like it. Did research on minor conservatorship for Arizona? Okay. We'll talk about that. John's struggling to follow through on older tasks, sending yourself reminders to follow up with tasks with him every couple of days, care and being a little underutilized by Mike and Jessica spoke to them about the importance of her case management skills. Holiday means clients are a little more demanding than usual, making sure to stay on top of communications even if there's no update. Good. Patrick, able to get another client you How can the treatment get an injection after she had refused to do so? The offer reflected her lack of treatment, so after discussing the health and monetary advent of its injection, the client was willing to get them. I have questions. Cynthia has been out, so taking the lead of saving documents into clients' folders, what's she doing? You would prefer to do that instead of LC to make sure she has time to enter calls, love that. Holidays are coming up and clients are extra sensitive to get their settlement loan. Missing a call or two from them could be to a sub-out, nice awareness, guys. LC is doing a good job of setting up the new cases. are getting, i.e. calls, setting up the treatment, and ensuring we find coverage. Love the updates, very good job. Do you feel like you summarized your weekly performance like that before, like in your meetings? Thank Do you see how this could give you that a few months from now?
00:05:05 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that you'll see that. So I wouldn't really, then, I mean, there's always room for improvement, but I'm very happy with the quality of both of your notes. It's interesting to me. Just how thorough both of you were and even the timeline. I wonder how much of that is doing the work together or anyway, and it's just interesting to me, but I love it because you're both, you know, coming, coming at a really great pace. With the kind of evolution, you know, of what we're discussing and how you're reporting it, how you're observing it, and also how you're managing it. I'm I'm really happy with that. I think Mark is happy to with the things that are happening. I was we were looking at your numbers, Lauren, specifically because Patrick, yours are still skewed. So and they will be for a while, which kind of unfair to you, but it's also the process, like everybody's gone for it. But we I showed him what we've been doing when we look at your numbers and we looked at time to close cases last year, and then this year, and then last quarter, and then now, and it's a 30 day improvement since last year, and he was really happy with that. So just letting you know, I'm tuning your horn, but mine too, because you know, good.
00:06:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, know me, I'm never happy anyway, but I appreciate you tuning my horn.
00:06:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's growth and also I showed him what, you know, what your reports are, and even better this week. So I'm looking forward to showing him that. But yeah, I think that he's really coming around on the pace of things and that it's more of a kind of slow and steady, but it's the consistency. And you guys both really show up consistently. So I don't see how that's going to be anything but awesome. Okay, so let's just go down these things. I'm in this document if you guys want to just follow along. Hard to heart with team members about needing to follow through on tasks in order to serve clients, maximize case outcome, preserve job satisfaction and security. So and need to kick it up. I would love for you to elaborate just a little bit more about what that conversation looked like with your team and how it was received.
00:07:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so you know, I was, I was talking, came to John very and I was uh let's see I have notes up here yeah I was looking at some of the the tasks and it's like we were I signed the same tasks to them last month when we reviewed reviewed those cases and it's like oh we haven't touched it and so I was you know I I wasn't I didn't like yell at them or anything like that but I made them know that I was pre-disappointed and that you know this impacts not only you know the client and the results we get for clients but also you know it's gonna impact it's a pipeline so if we're clogged up with those old cases where we we keep not doing the tasks that are necessary to close those cases you know mark is not going to give us
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
awesome cases. We have to take a question and pause you for a minute. Do you remember how last week we were talking about the power of questions?
00:09:07 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:09:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ask them any questions about this other than, did you do it? But like, did you ask them questions that elicited them, their accountability?
00:09:20 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah. told them, okay, I have a note here that John, you were supposed to own why wasn't this followed up on them? I just, you know, there's a kind of an awkward silence. I love awkward silences. That's when the work is happening.
00:09:41 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
So I guess it fell through the cracks.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guess it fell through the, do you notice that language? There's zero accountability in that. It fell through the cracks. Not, I failed to do anything. am distanced from that. you, like, is no me in it. That's anyway, that's language to pay very close attention to you. Because that is removing myself from being accountable and not fully in many things. I would love to hear the rest, but I might interrupt you and break some stuff down.
00:10:20 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so I went through why that's that's really important because if we don't complete those tasks, there's no reason why Mark will assign us the good cases with broken bones and stuff like that and not give them to him instead. And then that means less money in all of our pockets. More stress probably because they've already settled. We're not stressed. thought about the statute of limitation and we just we move on to the cases where we can still make money where we haven't done our fee but the problem is we have 20 cases right now on your team that are just been in purgatory for several months because we're not following up with Medicare or Medicaid because we're not you know we we send an email and we just say okay well I send that email I'm good until next month you know and I gotta pause you I gotta pause you right here and you may already go on but I have a cardinal rule I don't allow and tolerate box ticking in my world not on a personal level and not on a professional level if you are a box ticker you are not a grower you're not an evolver you are what can I do to skate by what is the box to take
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not invested in the outcome, you're not invested in the quality, you're invested in ticking boxes, zero room for that in my life, personally or professionally. If I feel like I'm somebody's box to tick, personally, you know, you're like, I just felt like I needed to catch up with you that kind of thing. Don't bother. You don't need to do anything. Bye. Bye. Don't feel obligated. If you don't want to talk to me. Now, if you don't want to do your business, if you don't want to follow up with client, if you don't want to resolve their case. There are people in Sweet Law who do those people exist. You guys are those people. You want to complete your cases. You want your clients to be taken care of. I would have a real heart to heart about that kind of conversation to box ticking doesn't belong in Sweet Law. We do a job because we care about the job, we care about the clients, I know Mark cares about the clients. I know you guys care about the clients. That has got to be part of the culture is we care about getting the job done, getting it done well and getting it done timely. And that will show up in every case that you handle, no matter how annoying or old or long or tedious or broken, it may be. Do you agree or disagree?
00:13:36 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, of course I agree.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So if you even get a whiff of a person who's got a box ticking mentality, you need to nip that in the bud. But here's the thing, generally speaking, along with integrity and other types of particular attributes, the e of the intrinsic motivation. or they won't. They will either care about it or they won't. Now it may be that they've talked themselves into not caring about some cases and maybe they do care about others and so maybe it's a matter of perspective which can be handled with coaching. Okay, but as a frustrating as it is to hire and train somebody new if you have a person who is a box ticker, okay, that is a like a disease and it doesn't get better. It just doesn't. It means that I will do enough to get by and that's the stuff you catch, okay? That's what you also need to be aware of. If you see that behavior show up, that's what you're catching. I promise you it shows up in other places. So what you have is complacency and apathy and apathy is a deadly disease. It does not belong in the workforce. Box taking is an apathetic approach to getting a job done. Do you you agree? Disagree? can't disagree. Patrick, how do you feel?
00:15:21 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
No, I agree and I used to be that way too. But basically, to come to terms that you're just preventing the inevitable right, like whatever task you set an email on. Okay, you set an email in two weeks. You're going to have to go back to it. So yeah, might as well take the perspective of this is the task I need to complete and whether it's one email, a phone call, a follow up tomorrow as well. Just until that case is like dotted off your list, it's your responsibility. So there's no point in just postponing it.
00:15:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So back to the question. that I like to ask. One of the questions I ask people is, why are you here? And a lot of the times they'll answer with the question of, well, I have to do this. I have to pay the bills. Okay, is this the only way that you can do that? And do you think that that's a reason? And now, and then the other thing would be, well, why should we keep you here? Now, that sounds threatening, but it is. If we're having this type of conversation, because I told you a month ago, when you're a grown grown person, and you have a job to do in a month ago, and you still didn't do it, you should be a little worried about your job. That's an unacceptable amount of time. That's written warning level amount issue to me personally. Now, if we haven't been working to that standard, and I know I wasn't reading the way that I needed to, I wasn't paying enough attention. Then I'm going to admit that first of all, and I'm going to be doing my job, but that means my job is I'm going to be looking at you extra close and making sure we do this and I would tell them I care. I care about every single person that comes through. I care about the reputation of this company. I care about it because I have integrity, but I also care about it because the reputation of this company affects job security for every single person at Sweet Law. And every single person's dependence who is supported by the earner at Sweet Law. I care, right? So I'm going to be stepping up and watching this more carefully. And here's all the extra work that I've been doing. Here's all the extra effort I've been putting in, but I need you to know you don't have to be perfect. I'm not going to expect you to be perfect, but there are few things that cannot happen. I cannot have a conversation. with you 30 days later, that is a repeat of the first time because that feels like kindergarten to me. You should be able to look, you have a list of cases under a certain amount of numbers, less than 300 cases. However long it takes you, there is no reason, especially because we do use together, we have all of these things, you have the same access to it. There is no reason that those cases should not be touched within the one-week timeframe that we've agreed on. No case goes longer than a week without being touched one way or another. Now, we also have to have a rule and I don't know if we came to terms with this, but if we don't hear back from somebody and get an acknowledgement that we have reached out, we do something more actively to get it to move forward. We're not box taking, okay, I touched it. Great. Was there any outcome of that? Should there have been an outcome of that, whether it's the insurance company or the doctors or whatever or the or the client, do we know why nothing's happening? nothing is happening simply because they're in there in treatment and we know they're going and we know that they're on track and we've had some sort of acknowledgement back from them, yes, I'm still in treatment, whatever. That's something there should not be a, I wonder what's happening for a month, right? One of the things that I'm trying to work on with Mark and this, I don't know how long it'll take is some kind of automations and follow up with these types of things and conversations. So, but in the meantime and even when that happens, everybody should be aware of where their cases are and everybody should know like there should be some kind of bi-directional conversation, meaning not just I sent a message out, but I got a ping back because I know what's happening and what's happening is what should be happening. Make sense? If they're not willing to show up to that level, that is the minimum level that should be here, is that we are nurturing the case all the way through. That should be a minimum requirement. That's not even talking about how skilled you are on the phone, how well you know the law, how effective you are at communicating, or any of that, which should come into effect. That's just whether or not you show up to play the game and get off the bench. That should be minimum requirement. So, no, we just thought it was like line one. We're 23 minutes in and I got on a box for you, sorry, but but that's a big deal. That is that. That's a really big deal and I'm sure you felt that and you're managing it and but I have learned that there are, I mean, I don't even know, probably a couple hundred people I've hired, fired, worked with in between all the companies that I've worked for. I don't really have to fire many people and most of it comes down to perspective and accountability and but here's what I've learned is that most people don't know how to ask accountability questions to get the real accountability answers. I will sit there with somebody uncomfortable and when they try to give me what I call as a political response which is saying a lot of nothing that sounds good. I will hold them down if they a response that doesn't put them in it a little bit, right, is accountability. Then I will say, well, no, it's not this, is it this or this like you know what like yes or no close then questions all the way down until we get to the real answer so why are you here at sweet love because i need a job okay well we require more than that we require somebody who needs a job wants a job wants to do the job well do you want to do this job well and it's like well i guess you guess like somebody will give you that answer or i mean of course well is it of course i mean do you ask yourself when i'm handling this case like am i doing a good job do you care about doing a good job with all the cases or some of the cases do you want to do a good job with the easy cases or also the hard cases are there some types of clients you don't care about because you don't like how they talk to you? Because that's a real thing. You know, you could just be like, I really don't like this person and I don't care about the job. Now, the issue with that and the way you can coach around that is like, okay, you're not doing the job just for them, right? You're doing the job well for suite law and the employees at suite law and the dependents of the employees at suite law. Because how well you do that job potentially affects the reviews that we get, which potentially affects how many more clients we get. So doing a good job isn't just about the client that we're serving, but it's about serving suite law and everybody there. And that's a real, you know, team vibe and we live in an individualistic society. This is not collectivism, right? don't live in China. We don't live in these other cultures where people can't a good. Here we live in a community of me. hopefully that's not what we have in the work environment, but it's possible that it exists. It's also something that you want to identify. You guys care about the team. You have people that care about the team. I don't know that everybody actually cares about the team. Matter of fact, I know at least of a couple people who don't. So you want to identify who those people are, because long term, people that do not care about the team, like to the point of working for the team when they don't want to do it for themselves. If you don't have those people, eventually you're going to need to replace them. Because again, that's an apathetic type of disease. And it can be contagious. Can you guys think of any time where that's shown up for you, where you've seen that kind of attitude? Number one, turn around and improve. or to just lead to somebody leading somebody with them?
00:25:13 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
I haven't noticed on my team yet. Hopefully never, but I mean, I could definitely see those things coming up because, you know, you can only fake it for so long, right? You know, eventually you may not say it, but in the work that you put in and after you put in a show, whether you care or not, you know? Yeah, so far everything's good with the team, so fingers crossed.
00:25:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. How about you, Lorenz? And not necessarily in sweet life. It could have shown up in any other kind of community that you've been in because it's a behavior apathy that can exist in any type of community.
00:25:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I mean... I think I've been doing this long enough, I've seen it in case managers when they get burnt out. I think there's a tendency for case managers who care deeply about what they do, there's a tendency to overdo it, but there's also, and so there's two cans of burnout lab noticed. There's case managers that overdo it because they care too much and they just can't spread themselves around enough to take care of all the clients the same way, but there's also the box trackers who they run out of steam, they run out of motivation, there's not enough money in the world to keep them. to keep them engaged in what they're doing and growing. And I don't think that's the case with John, though, because I see what you were saying, but I have seen in the last three workdays since we've had that conversation, I have seen a market improvement, and he is staying on top of which is good, but there's also the facts, it's how they be, know, things.
00:27:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wasn't talking about any particular person in this conversation, it's just wanting to have awareness for sure, because you said hard to heart with team members, I wasn't on the John line, so I wasn't thinking about anybody specifically, but it is something that you wanna watch for. the other thing is, so I'm gonna flip it to the, I said. Some people, so it's a difference between like intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, but burn it out can affect that for sure, and burnout can be external, not internal, it can be both, it can be a combination, oh my gosh my dogs, sorry, it distracts my brain, I'm terrible, I can't even think. Anyone daughter must be home. Yeah, my brain's all right. Yeah, so one of the things that you can do with helping them, so this is actually a prime example, there are things that affect our brains and make it really difficult to concentrate. There are physical things that happen. I'm perimenopausal, that made a huge impact. I had to figure out how to manage it. Stress, we'll do that to people's sickness, depression, fatigue. Um, John's going probably through a lot of that right now, the, the, uh, fatigue, but potentially depression, but, uh, exhaustion, it just, the emotions of having a new baby, um, and all the things that you're facing and raising up a new child in the world that we're in right now, there's a lot of emotions, you know, so sometimes it's just a matter of being like, okay, here's the, here's the tough love part. This is a job. This is not really family per se. This is not unconditional love. are conditions. They have to be met, but it's with purpose. This is a purposeful work that we do. We're taking care of people, um, they've gone through hard things. They're not all nice people. They're not all not patient. They're not all grateful. They're not all awesome, but We have a job to do and also we have each other to serve and doing a good job means that all of us can keep jobs, which means we can keep taking care of our families and not have to do with looking for a new job on top of Giving you this checklist of these are the things that happen in every case right and so let's and we talked about this last week. And I think that that's something that we can we can work on and prove even though we're I have no idea how long it's going to take to get some kind of workflow automation through that if I but I imagine probably several months. But if one of the things that we can do to help people with burnout is just make this checklist and then have. the cases, it could be tedious, I don't know, but we could try it out and go, where is this case on this list? So maybe the way that it looks like, let me go share my screen and see if I can find that. It's off that we were working on. That's not it. Okay, wait, now that's not a healer. I have some nice sweet wild dogs. What did we call that? I think I got a little sheet stuck for the dot com. Unmento por favor, yes, And I'm just focused on this, is that it? No. Is it this? Oh, yeah, it's this. Okay, share screen. Okay. So if 14 stages. So we could basically have all of this going across the top here, right? Oops, don't do that, Tina. Like drag the cross here, right? And then, you know, format it in such a way that it's not taking up this whole long thing. And then you guys have all of your cases on the left. And and so I know you have it in litify. And I know that this seems like rework. Here's what I would love to try the experiment for 60 days. My experience is that how we view the data makes a huge impact on how we view the data. So the physical way that we look at it, like how easy it is to get a zoom out basically from 30 thousand foot view to the ground view, right? Lidify doesn't allow me to do that. Lidify only allows you to get a ground view case by case. This could allow you to get both views at the same time. So here are all the cases here. Like imagine all the cases over here and then you're seeing these things, right? And then you're seeing the dates of the last touch. And I would imagine that it only adds maybe a couple hours more work throughout the week. what I am now is that it will reduce your coaching hours and it will improve your resolve time significantly. It will be much harder for people to go under the radar if you look at the data like this. Would you be willing to, especially because it's holiday times, it's a little bit slower? Actually, was looking at yeah, they're actually not that slow. I think it feels like...
00:34:34 - Lorenz Schuerch
it's not slower for me.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it does slow down actually, end of January till about March, but it's not slower now. So anyway, but would you guys be willing, it's not worth doing if you don't do it for a sufficient amount of time, because you won't get enough data to make any kind of realistic assessment. If you do it for a couple of weeks and you're like, this takes way too long. It's absolutely just driving me bonkers. I see zero value in it. I'll take your word for it and trust you. If I structure this for you and set it up, would you guys be willing to to try it and see if it helps you feel like you have a better overview of where everything stands and how it's moving. And repeat what we're trying to carry out. So you can go and solidify and scroll through the cases and see what the dates are and where it's at. But here we have a list of stages for the case, right, that you know it has to go through. We know that there's some overlap in these things, but we know that when we get to a certain area like treatment, whatever, what I'm thinking is that this will just give you a much faster overview of where things are. I think your reviewing will actually be faster this way. It may not actually take you more time, but I don't know, but what I do think is that you will have a faster way of seeing that everything is on track if you look at it this way, according to these phases, basically, of a case. I'll create the document.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch
I'll create it. can I can commit to it, but like creating it, it's going to take me forever. I'm not an excel.
00:36:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will take me minutes. like 20 tops. Um, so yes. Okay. And so I'll create a version of it, Patrick. And then you can take a look at it, um, before you say yes or no. And then maybe it's a, you know, a bit of a touch between the two of you to see how things go. But I really think it'd be better to to try it. So let me, um, email this to myself. I'm going to go and set it All right. Yeah. I guess we better get back to the whole. We've got already 40 minutes in here. Let's talk a lot. I guess that might be in a draw, but. Let's see. Okay, going. Did research on minor conservatorship for Arizona? Was there something that came up like the case that?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, no, it's just Mark and Mary have been compiling a checklist for California, and so I wanted to get something similar for Arizona, so got that done. I just need to go through the cases that have minor conservatorships and see which ones we can move forward.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is the checklist for that they're doing in California?
00:38:48 - Lorenz Schuerch
just about conservators. For the my understanding is that the litigation team is going to take on those minor conservatorships, and so it's for them to be able to It's for us to be able to transfer those cases to them so that everything they need is ready to go. They don't need to go chase all that information down.
00:39:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Love that. Okay, and for your reminder system for following up with tasks with John every couple of days, what's your system just kind of quickly running down for me?
00:39:21 - Lorenz Schuerch
I just put it into Siri. Okay. Remind me to follow up with John on case XYZ in two days.
00:39:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How was this conversation about Karen received with Mike and Jessica?
00:39:43 - Lorenz Schuerch
Really good. Yeah, they were like, yeah, you're right, because they were just having her do records. And I've done records and, you know, the way one of my CMs described doing records at one point was I'd rather shoot myself in the head. to do records. And so, uh, I don't want her to feel that way.
00:40:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'll burn you out.
00:40:08 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah. And especially since she has more experience being a scene than they do. So I'm like, uh, guys, she can do intro calls. can do, you know, difficult client management. She can do, uh, you know, anything you do, she can do.
00:40:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would follow up with that conversation. No longer than two weeks from now and be like, okay, how did you use her? And if they didn't do it well, then I would ask them for a game plan right then and there and make sure that they stick with it and it needs to be a good one. Here's, here's the reason. Um, it may just be, they don't want to, they're busy and they're not taking the time to organize and plan out how to use her. it's just whatever pops in the head. Okay, go do that. because I don't have to think about it, right? It's the same reason people put iPads in front of their kids. Like, I got other things that are more pressing right now if I don't have to deal with thinking and solving a problem. Generally speaking, it's the solving of problem that people will dodge. They want to be on autopilot. Autopilot is easy. Autopilot is comfort-free. Autopilot is checking boxes. I do what I do because I do what I do and I'm doing what I do. You know what I mean? When you're trying to figure out how to use somebody new, that's problem-solving, that strategy, that's higher level thinking, it takes more mental effort, which by the way is a huge part of why we try to reduce mental strain and mental effort and mental lag time through the systems so that when we need it for higher level functioning, which is optimization, they're not optimally using care. Okay. Optimization isn't a default mode. Autopilot is default mode. It's literally, you studied psychology, right? Default mode is a literal state of being that we have. Autopilot is another word for it. And it, and default mode is, this is what I do. So like, it's why you can drive, and you can check out and forget about the last 10 minutes of the trip that you had, because you were in your head. You didn't even notice this happened or that happened on the road because your driving was in default mode. It was on autopilot and your brain was doing other things. So this can happen in work. And so when you're trying to improve how you're managing things, you need people to step out of default mode and ask, am I doing the best with the resources that I have? Did I have you guys read? Portal Ren's mood.
00:42:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
Multipliers, do we talk about multipliers? Yes, we did.
00:43:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so Multipliers is just making leaders of everybody around you. So everybody has their spheres of stewardship you want everybody to be in charge as a leader of what they manage. So if they don't manage Karen per se, but maybe they manage How they use her you want them to be great leaders of that, right? Okay, so Just Don't let them get into default mode Make sure that they're thinking proactively and strategically About how she does it and make sure that their system is not to just Pawn off whatever they don't want to do, but actually be what is the best way for sweet law to utilize Karen Not about them. It's about the which affects them. Okay. And what's good for the company, best for the company, should be best for them. that's where that's the sweet spot where we find what's best for them and for sweet log that's the ideal place to be, right? Because if it's the best thing for them also, then they're going to be more energized, more productive, more happy, less stressed, all of those things. So imagine like this is a Venn diagram, right? What's best for my congestica? What's best for sweet log? That little overlap right there? That's that's the ideal kind of choices that we want to make, right? And you can use a Venn diagram and show them like if it's not in this little area, think again, try something new. Um, holidays means kind of more demanding than usual, making sure to stay on top of communications, even if there's no update. So what is
00:45:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
do you pitch them as far as what's the benefits of doing that and why they should get that's just that's something I noticed today that I added okay and you know I've talked to a couple of clients already there a lot but can I have my do you think I'll have my money by Christmas or do you think I'll have my money by Black Friday uh I already and uh and I'm like usually I say no yeah my straight up answer my uh because if I say yeah maybe or I'll try my best I'm help to that you know they're gonna say you said I would absolutely get that money by by Christmas so usually my answer is no probably not um especially if I see too many intervening variables then that becomes too complex to control and so but yeah I think, you know, generally speaking, you know, I've been doing this, this is my 10th year doing this, there's going to be, you know, there's going to be more stress, more stress from clients, my, my team, you know, this is when they start getting sick, this is so the stress levels go up. And so I think to preempt that, I want to make sure to tell them, look, even if you just copy and paste a text to every single client, telling them we're working on your case, we plan on having an update for you by next week or something like that, then that will help reduce that, that, that holiday stress.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I agree with that. So, not just their stress, but the client stress and how much stress comes into their day. So it's, um, it's a problem. and then find something to complain about. I'll pay these attorneys, no you don't. But that's what's going to be in their heads, right? They're going to listen to me and I'm going to complain because I can't go tell my wife what I really think about her. kind of think. But that's the reality, right? get what's the word displacement? It's not displacement, but I don't something like that. Anyway, you know what I mean? Lauren's now you then both of you. OK, so Patrick, able to get another client to go back in the treatment. That was awesome. Great job. So anything that you want to discuss about that, who it was, how it went, like.
00:48:47 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you want the name?
00:48:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like who was what you said we, like who on the team of that conversation?
00:48:55 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
I've got a way because before we started the process of. closing out the case, LC at the conversation with the client, and they weren't interested in the injection, and then two days ago, I'm negotiating the case, I gave her an updated offer, I was like, look, is the offer, because you didn't go through with the injection. It's still fairly, the recommendation is still fairly new, so I gave her the option again, I was like, hey, just wanted to, you know, triple check that you're not interested in getting this injection, you know, it's going not only, you know, resolve any pains you're having, but it's going to help this offer, go up, and she was like, well, what do you think? I was like, yeah, if you're still feeling pain, I would go get it, and she's like, okay, you know, I want to get an injection. So, sometimes it does take the client to see the offer in order for it to really hit them that, you know, we told you, you know, We're not going to get more than, let's say, $11,000, but before they actually get that number, they're like, well, just try and let's see what we can get.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that because we can make that into kind of part of the process is, do we get a low ball offer? Is it likely because we didn't get enough treatment? Immediately go back to the client, here's the offer. you so hurting? Yeah. Because you can go get treatment and it will improve the offer, but you're handling it very ethically, right, with are you still hurting? Here's the offer. Are you still hurting? do you like this offer, right? Are you still hurting? Because this is our last chance to go make sure you have every opportunity to help be recovered from this thing that happened to you, right? So I love that, but just making it almost like checklist type thing, right? This is what we're talking about in the, Yeah, that's right. There's phases, but there it's almost also kind of like a checklist for our stuff. why we did this. Like, has this been done? Where are we at with it? When it's done? That kind of thing. In my mind, this was also kind of a checklist. So that could be something is okay, received offer, demand letter, negotiating file settlements. I don't really know where we would put that, but that could be a step in and of itself is report offer to client, check if it's a lowball offer. Basically, if we haven't met policy limits, period, even if it's not lowball, but if we haven't met policy limits, do you still have pain? This is the last chance to go get treatment. I think that we should put that step in here. I'm going put it, where would this go, guys? I set up for treatment. Um, so probably 15, like, going back to treatment, I would put that as, like, after nine, probably.
00:52:14 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, between nine and 10, or, or after 10. Yeah.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I need to do this, um, this, um, go down, oh, you won't never mind, I did it the wrong way, so I need to do, is that right? Is that right, guys?
00:52:53 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
Are you looking at the, which ten are you looking at?
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, oh, the number, ignore the numbers now. Oops. The whole thing um Talk to me about lines not the numbers now. So preparing demand letters.
00:53:06 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
What's the next thing? Negotiating and finalizing settlements.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me move this down here so I can move this up there Wait a Okay, and then that's where I would after negotiating I would put Getting back into treatment is Offer to Not policy, can you be a policy limits even if you didn't get all the treatment available Yeah So let's say, see if in pain and wanting more treatment, especially if offer is low. how you are. Okay. So this, if you remember, everything is an iterative process, right? So we just keep working at it and improving. Um, Cynthia has been else even taking me into the room instead of L.C. And we should have time to answer client calls. I just, this good. This is good leadership. Both of you guys. Oh, I just got mama there. Emotional. is just giving you big hugs. I'm of you. guys are good. like you. Okay. L.C. doing a good job of setting. the new cases we are getting, i.e. enter calls, setting up treatment, ensuring we find coverage. So the last thing I would say is, um, my, my, I have a, a tender mama heart. I have a feisty, I'll beat you down heart, but I also have a tender mama heart. They're, they're one in the same and they can go really fast. But I want you guys to take good care of yourselves. Um, you know, there's, there's a, there's real, uh, pressure during the holidays, all kind of things. know that, um, this time of year, highest periods of side rates after the time change, and then the, the winter solstice and the, just because of the darkness, less, less on, um, the holiday pressure, there's lots of things going on. then sometimes it's directly, and sometimes it's indirectly, and sometimes it's you taking on the burdens of other people because trying to help them and their energy seeps into you so please please be mindful of yourselves please take care of yourselves get the rest that you need get all the good things that you need because you're important and you matter and you are good leaders and the people that you take you take care of they they need you to take care of yourselves you're important you matter I'm not going to cry anyway you guys are important you really may please take care of yourselves and then with that energy that you have because you're taking care of yourselves please take care of your people whoever your people are whether they're work personal professional whatever um and just just be mindful of that okay okay now okay you like our surrogate

Really good job on the reports. Just, there is not really any assignment at the moment. I'm the one that has an assignment, but please give me another report like this next week.

00:57:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Thank you.
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have a move. You too.
00:57:35 - Lorenz Schuerch
Are we meeting next week?
00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have no reason not to. I keep such a light schedule, so I'm changing my Monday calls because I'll be flying, but other than that, does this work for you? I think we did talk about it last week.
00:57:49 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think usually we, he lets us all at two o'clock, but I usually It usually works. I work through the day, honestly, because I can't take two days off and leave early the day before, so I'll be there either way.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, um...
00:58:12 - patrick (sweetlaw.com)
Why don't you do that? Well, I do that.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, why don't you guys just do that? Do this. How about you just send me your report? Okay, so fill out your journal, and if there's anything pressing or anything like I feel like, Hey, I want to ask you questions about that. I'll ask questions through here, and we'll just do a text or email through this type of communication. I don't think, you know, we can totally take a week off. will probably plan on doing that Christmas as well, especially because I'm really happy with the way that you guys are handling things. So, yeah, take the week off, please do the report because that is sufficient traction, and it really helps just kind of. Keep the cadence of the work that we're doing. It's really easy for things to slip a little bit, and also, it gives you an outlet for what you're thinking about and observing. So two weeks, a lot can happen in two weeks. A lot of degradation can happen in two weeks. All right, good question. So I'll go ahead and update the calendar. then I don't get you guys for two weeks, so I'll have to like big air hug and talk to you guys in a couple of weeks.
00:59:30 - Lorenz Schuerch
