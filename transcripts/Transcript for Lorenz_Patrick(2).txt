Hello.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me? Hey, how are you?
00:00:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good. are you?
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a migraine that is growing by the minute, so I don't know how effective the meat this is going to be.
00:00:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been dealing with that for the last week. Feel the pain.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's just allergies, but it's really disorienting at the moment.
00:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You need to postpone?
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want to because there's too much going on, and I think that it would be better just to have a short but useful meeting because I know that you guys have a lot of work to do. Patrick had a new client meeting today, so he won't be here. But you guys did both leave good notes and Oh, um, that's that's something that we can focus on. Man, I know it was going to be a struggle, struggle to think. Brains, not something for granted, man. Oh, how is Carrie?
00:01:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's better. Um, she's, uh, I mean, you know, she hasn't done anything extraordinarily straining, but we're we're going to be driving to the Christmas party tomorrow. So we'll see how she does with that big drive.
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she got a shot, right? Like last week or how?
00:01:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last month, you know, how's that doing? It's okay. Word is just a provider was, uh, less than, um, ideal. They like, she had a reaction to the county. Yeah, so she's not down to do anymore, but I think we'll be able to settle up her case.
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, maybe ask Mark if Chona would consult and offer her thoughts and opinions because his wife does pain management.
00:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she really, really, I work with Chona actually, Mark hired me for her, but she really cares about her patients. She, she's just very smart, and maybe she has some suggestions that hasn't been provided to you yet.
00:02:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. You know, the problem is she just wants to be done, so I'll have her down with Chona at the party.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I guess she's going to be at the both the attorney dinner.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you care. Thanks, Chona, and just let her know. And so that maybe she could just be super inviting. Chona is having met her.
00:03:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure you've met her. Oh, yeah.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just, I mean, easy, easy. because I know it's hard when people close themselves off to help because of fear. And so maybe that's something Chona can help with also.
00:03:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, let me talk to before you text Chona because I don't want put Carrie on the spot.
00:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or sure, that's why I'm asking.
00:03:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you know, you could get the Holy Ghost to help you out, make that decision. So that's useful. But anyway, I'm not trying to butt in. I just village, you know, we're a village.
00:03:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We need each other.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Hard things are hard and the adversary is not not slowing down.
00:03:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nope. Yeah, things are trying to pick up a little bit. The team is, I felt like last month, you know, all those absences kind of like it throttled our speed a little bit. I do have one assignment for you.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go ahead. What I would like you to do is give me a list of how many cases you're struggling with in terms of holding the old cases that are closing out. I have an idea of number and so I can do kind of just crunch the math to do those calculations to see if we throughout the outliers, how are we doing?
00:04:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:04:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Because I think that will probably make you feel better, but it will also be some And I can use with Mark, although I don't I don't think he needs to have this explain to them, but it's always nice to just get that weight off and go, you know what, that wasn't something you didn't just suddenly drop a ball, right? You're just being impacted by a ball that's been coming at you, and you didn't have a lot of control over. But, and but then we can also look at it and go, was there something recently that we could have been doing that we shouldn't have been doing that we didn't do. That type of thing. So I would like a list of those cases that have come up and are in the process of, you know, affecting the stats again still because you're wrapping up. Um, adjusters are pushing more a lot, a lot back on valuation. So Mark, we have this conversation because I actually saw. Hold on a minute. Your notes on the ninth. top offers. He is going to work on creating a document that tells us what those numbers are for second voicing. But ultimately it's still more profitable practice even if somebody actually pushes back because first of all the adjuster turnover rate is pretty high. So that's going to impact where new person new tricks kind of thing. But ultimately even if somebody tries to play hardball their ability to negatively impact is so jumpy. Wait, am I supposed to meet with Fuji today? No, I'm not. Okay, hold on. Let me fix this real quick. Sorry. So it doesn't keep happening to me. the two-six every Monday. Okay, sorry. Thank you. Man, that just rattled my brain. Um, anyway, so that was the conversation that we had is that ultimately it's still more financially profitable. We do have to take in the stressor kind of account, but ultimately that's the biggest thing that we're dealing with.
00:07:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, um, yeah, I guess I'm, um, yes, it's the first, first adjuster that's told me that I haven't had any other pushback. Um, but I, some, I'm a little bit worried about, you know, how much leverage, uh, I can put on, on these, uh, on these adjusters if they know that, you know, they're gonna, they're gonna talk to someone else anyway.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but you know, I, from a business standpoint, so when I get it, yeah, we're getting, I would be like, look, if we didn't hit policy limits, I'm going to, I got to do the best I can for my, my client. And, and that could be the approach. So the other thing that Mark is doing, and it's going to take a couple of weeks for him to even just make appointments, but we've got three different call control companies that we're looking into. Two of them are really intake oriented, but one of them is an AI listener. So it can listen to the call, it can listen to the tone of the call and make a suggestion and basically analyze them and you and make suggestions as to how you could handle things moving forward, but with a library of psychology to run that through. So, um, it'll be interesting to see what we can learn from that.
00:08:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That may be a problem.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Attica just went to AI training a month ago and they told us we absolutely cannot record calls with clients Well, whatever mark will do I promise you will be compliant it may just be that you well Um have a conversation with them We but but he he's not going to do anything that's going to break uh rules, um Yeah, I'll I have a hard time thinking that As long as the calls are recorded and or that are recorded stay within a compliant and secure area, I don't see how uh Uh as long as the client is aware that it's being recorded depending on what kind of party state you're in like
00:10:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oregon is a two-party state, but only one of the people has to know their recording, which means the person making the recording is all that's necessary to know that it's being recorded, which is- Yeah, same in Arizona, but this is more relating to attorney-client privilege, and they're talking about AI and the state Supreme Court is kind of leaning away from AI-recorded calls like on Zoom, and things like that. When calls get recorded on Zoom, there's been a couple of rulings so far that are saying that that does breach attorney-client privilege. I did- I told Mark after I took the training and he said, that's good to know, so he's aware of it.
00:10:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He'll take your consideration. Let me look at this. Well, we'll see either way we're working on learning strategies for all the types of calls that we have.
00:11:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:11:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's wonderful. That's one thing that my team has all agreed on is that that's what they need the most is.
00:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So I'm pushing for that and we've got three different things that we're looking at. One of them is the AI one, the other two are, are not and they, they're intake specific, but I made him aware that it's not just the intake team, but it's the, the legal team. It's everybody that has any kind of phone calls. We all have weak spots, right, where there's personality types that we struggle to converse with efficiently. And so we need somebody who can coach and improve that. So that is the goal. Now, the thing is generally speaking, one solution almost never takes care of everybody. There's always something left on the table that needs to improve. So like everything else, it's an iterative process. So you might get, you know, 25% of the issue is improved, then we go to the next solution or the next iteration. So just make sure that you people understand that we don't have as much as we would wish. There's no kind of magic one, where it's just progressive growth. So, but the efficacy of what we do is improved by how much they even just contemplate the issue. The biggest thing that happens And we have this conversation really early on just awareness, increased and intentional awareness of an issue improves how we deal with it. So, by having the awareness and the desire to improve call handling, they're likely to be able to create some of their own solutions or bring specifics to the table that allow us to coach and improve and help. So, keep that in mind also.
00:13:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And following up on that.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome. It's every week. That's part of the reason we take notes, but also because I'm working on so many things with him. I kind of have to balance out what's on his schedule, what's on his plate and all of these other things. So, the time difference because the time just shifted. And, but you guys had meetings before, but we started a lot of them in the summer that like.
00:14:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and, you know, I've been, I've been, one of the issues too is that, you know, a lot of those California people, they have a long commute and they have kids. So very has kids and has kids. And so they have to drop off their kids and then commute to the office. So they don't get to the office until like, you know, maybe 930 or 10 sometimes.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so you were having really early morning meeting.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And so we were having a meeting up 10, but now the first 10 o'clock meeting gets pushed back to 11. And the following meeting gets to push back to 12, which means that lunch time, you know, that some people are on lunch. You know, some people, you know, it's kind of rush hour because that's like when clients get off of. work for their lunch. So that's when they can call us back. And so it's kind of a little bit of an issue. And I've talked to my team today about it, and we've agreed to roll it back 30 minutes, that kind of as a compromise. So we'll test that out, see how that works. I'm trying to, you know, if not, we'll have to just do every other day. But that means I have a meeting every single day, basically.
00:15:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which sucks. So one other alternative solution is for half of the year, one set of the team bucks up and the other half of the year, the other set does. And you leave the time the same. So well, I guess you guys never change time. So whatever it is for you, it stays at.
00:15:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So that's not it.
00:15:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, I think that half hours probably the closest compromise that you can make. Um, I, I think you should do everything you can to persuade them to manage their time, rather than you having an additional meeting? Yeah, I mean, they're, I'm a parent too, and I understand that things are hard. You're right, four kids and a wife that's struggling. So, you know, I'm not a fan of excuses. Do you want the job or do you not? Like, this is a basic thing to be able to have a consistent study, meaning you didn't, you didn't choose a work-from-home career. You chose this. This is where you're at. I need to not have to, like, bend over backwards to try to find time that works. This is reasonable. It's within the work day. don't... Yeah, I have a real hard time understanding why that's, there's legitimate excuses between nine o'clock and
00:17:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and 12 p.m. Yeah. And you know, the other thing is, you're on the Arizona team. If you're on the Arizona team, you're on Arizona time. know, that's, that's, that's what I think, you know, like, like, yeah, we, we have a good team. We have, you know, good, you know, um, camaraderie or whatever. But at the same time, Arizona comes with different responsibilities. And part of that is you need to come in early in the, in the winter time.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And have you said that to anybody?
00:17:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, for the last couple of years.
00:17:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what do they say?
00:17:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They say, yeah, we'll try.
00:17:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll do better. Okay, that does not work. Are they replaceable? Everybody's replaceable. You're the hardest one to replace. Everybody else is not.
00:17:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's one of the hardest ones to find.
00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find everybody else. And I'm not trying to be. hard Lorenz. I'm just saying where there's a will, there's a way. if so, here's the thing. People fix the it's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil, right? If it's their daycare provider, being some kind of way and the daycare provider is harder to deal with than you, guess who they're going to try to please. If everybody else is harder to deal with than you, they're going to try to please them and be like, well, Lorenz is cool. You have a job to run. You have your own energy and stress to manage. You manage the team. Yeah, I mean, maybe I don't even know if you'd want to bother more or anybody else with that. don't know who to consult with because I can be a bit of a hard- sometimes, but I don't think that is being hard at all or unreasonable.
00:18:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me try the... 30-minute thing, if we're still struggling and I see that I'm going to be spreading myself too thin, but it's just meeting every morning, then let's go the hard out, I think.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing that you might do for consent, you can talk to Mark if you want to be placed on another team, but if you hear this is what's happening.
00:19:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think that's a fair expectation because I do too.
00:19:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think Mark as much as he loves to make people happy and give them parties and things like that. He also thinks you get the fun because we work hard, we play hard. Where's the hard work?
00:19:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah. I think, you know, yeah.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, do you think that they could just go anywhere else and just get exactly what they will?
00:20:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm this isn't McDonald's. don't get it or I'm interested how Patrick deals with deals with Missouri because that's even a bigger time difference. And so I'm wondering how he handles that when clients are calling in at, you know, what would be what, five in the morning for them? He's young with no kids.
00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He might just handle it, but I, yeah, ask him just in case he's got, this is, this is the great thing about working with other people and sometimes they just do have something that works for you and sometimes not.
00:20:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:20:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even it might just be comforting to have him tell you the same thing and just be like, what is their problem? Do the job, you know?
00:20:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And maybe that's because I've been celery for so long that I'm just like, it doesn't matter. Just do it. You know, like, it doesn't matter how much time it takes.
00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just just do it. Well, there's
00:22:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I need to stop hoping and praying that we'll get a unicorn case, get high limits, get, you know, good injuries and easy adjusters, you know, those are like you and far between.
00:22:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not home runs that wins the game to the singles.
00:22:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and so we got a hustle. got a, you know, and it means doing the boring stuff. means, you know, reviewing cases day in and day out and moving the ball, not just sending a text, just check the box, but actually moving the ball.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are people having to work hours of the night and through the weekend? are they, you know, they're hourly?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What are they working? No, even John hasn't asked for any overtime and. Well, since since he came back actually, he hasn't asked for any overtime.
00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's because they don't need to because you have been so much more efficient. Because I remember you saying. I feel. He goes around August, he wanted extra time because he couldn't handle, he couldn't get all his calls done on time, couldn't get all the work done. So you must have helped them do something to be more efficient so that he was able to accomplish the right work while also reducing the average close time by 30 days. That was a time span that that even happens. So clearly the things that you're doing are working. Are they all bored with growing and getting better? Or are they box checkers and just looking to collect a paycheck? Because if that's so, you need to tell them that is not compatible with being on this team.
00:23:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I told them. I literally told them, this is the new standard. From now on, if you want to grow and flourish. in this company, this is what needs to be done. Anything less than that, and it's going to be very hard for you to continue here.
00:24:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So two things, I think that's fantastic, by the way, I'm going to try to fly over that. My brain just goes whoop, and then my mouth follows. Point out the fact that everything that you're doing is to help them get the most out of the least amount of time and without more stress. Okay, so they're able to keep confined hours roughly, we'll say nine to five, right? Get paid well, work in a peaceful, roughly environment, right? They might have to deal with clients, but everybody there is kind and respectful to each other. I assume I've not heard any anything contrary.
00:24:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, there's no drone on all my team.
00:24:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's the things that I gotta follow with my brain, or I'll quit. I'll lose it. The things that you've been doing has proven to be effective in improving efficiency because of the Jose has decreased by 30 days over three year average within a matter of months. So that's significant But also john used to feel like he couldn't accomplish his job without doing overtime And now he's doing it.
00:25:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
He's doing good Yeah, uh, I mean He's he's a judge. He's not sleeping well at night. So he's it's Been a adjustment period with the baby.
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So i'm kind of giving him a little bit. Okay, that's even more to add to it So that's in this his first baby, right?
00:25:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Second dish first biological baby.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, so Anyway, it's a lot to deal with either way So to be able to have these improvements while and you have such a small team. So everybody on the team makes a huge difference Clearly the efforts to manage and improve the system works better So what you can't have is people who are not on board with the system You can't control the time, but you're willing to make a half hour adjustment. If that's not enough, and people still feel like they get to choose if they do it, they might want to choose if they want to keep this job or not. I don't play Lawrence.
00:26:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know, I know.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If a half hour can affect their systems and their morale that much, they are not at the maturity level that they need to be working there anyway.
00:26:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm wondering, how does that play in, if I have that kind of talk with them, how does that play in with all the work we did with the very a few months ago to get her to feel safe and secure and it doesn't negate that because very
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm here to give you everything I can, everything I possibly can, but I also need to make sure that the company and the team has everything it needs. The two have to be compatible. So I did what I could do. I'm telling you what we need to have. There's a possibility these two are not compatible. I want it to be compatible. Ultimately, I can't make that choice for you. All I can do is manage the team to my best abilities. And hopefully you know that I truly care about you and I truly wish I could just give you whatever you want and make it you happy and it's still be effective, but I can't. So the best thing I can do for you is to make sure that we all have a job and that we all have security because we're doing what we've been hired to do, which is not just the job but a great job. And you who you have thought every option you can, and that's it. So it doesn't negate everything that you've said. Both things are true. What you think and what you feel matters. I'm glad you can share with me. However, I have to tell you that this is what needs to happen. These are the results. This effort has gotten us and I can't in good faith, I guess, whatever. Go backwards in performance and take with us. That is an unacceptable thing to me. Now your theory, a mother, you have stewardship over your children. I'm a father. I have stewardship over my family, but also over this team. Ultimately, I'm accountable for how it on. So I promise you I've done everything I can to try to solve for this. This is the best that I have. I just need to know, are you willing to do this or are you not? Well, hard feelings, if this doesn't work for you, but it has to for us.
00:29:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think that's fair.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's it's truthful like we can care about everybody. We can't give everybody what they want to. can't do it for our children. We can't do it for our can't do it for us. God gives us our own stewardship and life and it's that same is true. have a calling to speak truth. Now, I have more to limitations where my perspective could be wrong. I could be wrong. But I'm called to be bold and say hard and comfortable things with love with compassion. And lots of people don't want to hear it. I'm willing to hear when I'm wrong, so I know I've done my part, right? As long as I'm, as long as people can tell me, Tim, you're wrong. You have no idea what you're talking about. And if I'm willing to hear that, then I've met my part of it. But there are people who have learned that when I say even hard things, I'm still saying it in love. Everything that I have is because I care about the greatest good for everybody. I may say it wrong. I might have been able to say it better, but they accept the flaws and weaknesses I have because of the intent of my heart. And so I'm comfortable with saying and doing those things. So, you know, when you keep showing up for your team and honoring them, you can show them like, I'm still doing that, but I can't do it while compromising my stewardship over everyone for one person. I can make all the compromises possible. bull that allow for the greatest good of the whole, but not at the sacrifice and suffering of the whole for the one. That's not what business is unfortunately. You know, in the family, maybe that's a little bit different, but we're here. Can't do it.
00:31:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I think I mean, you know, ultimately, you know, it goes back to on my first star as a lawyer, I wanted to do everything for everyone, and it's supervising attorney telling me if you can't do it for all your clients, don't do it for any of them. That's the same thing with staff members, I suppose.
00:31:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, because doing the best for people isn't doing everything for them. We can't dilute ourselves like that. You can't be the best all of the things and all the components. You can be the best at maybe one or two things, not at all of the things. And so you can either dilute your power and do okay across all the things. Or you can do really great the things that matter most, good, better best, right? President Oxtok, or you can accomplish all the things but not super well. Which one is actually the most useful?
00:32:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The first one, getting...
00:32:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's something that took me a while to learn as an attorney too. as an attorney, everyone comes to you for answers, Everyone expects you to solve their problems. so there's that temptation to feel like you should know everything. You should be an expert at everything. But...
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a lot of liberty and humility actually. Sometimes humility feels like a burden. You can't do all things for all people. So first of all, you have to pick, which is really hard. You have to prioritize. And then you have to define all things. It can't actually be all things. You have to be very specific. But with that, there's actually, you know, a finish line or a line to cross where you can say, I've accomplished this and you can have that piece that comes with it. But also, you can have a target that's out there that you're actually working for with some specificity. And it can keep you motivated because when you you're trying to do everything, it's just be motivating because it's impossible. So you're just setting yourself up for failure and stress and anxiety.
00:34:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that.
00:34:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, no, it sabotages everything.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
steals joy from everything. So you can't win anything.
00:34:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that's to start coming to work and looking at the clock the whole time.
00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that is the worst. That's the worst. So, um, you know, maybe you can help vary, try to problem solve in brainstorm, but what you can't do is make, um, it's not conce- concessions. Thank you. I had to think about it. You can't make concessions that, um, regress the whole that we've been working on.
00:35:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and in fact, instead of like it being either you come up to the standard or you, you know, you jump ship, I kind of want to make it more holistic where she sees it as like her own growth, the company's growth, her growth is invested is one and the same with the company. growth. And she, if she comes up to the standard, and that's just anyone, not just Harry, because I'm talking about a theory, but theory is actually doing fine. She's, um, you know, part of growing with a company is you grow yourself. You get a person, a better employee, a better leader, and that's what I'm trying to get to see, you know, see, try to see beyond your paycheck, try to see beyond.
00:36:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's where the questions come in handy. What are your professional goals? What do you want out of life? do you see yourself in five years? If you had a magic wand, where do you see yourself in five years? you know, if they're magic wanders, I'm in an island sipping my ties and doing absolutely nothing. There's an issue. So like, I asked Mark that question once, and he said that, he goes, okay, because needs to have purpose. And why is people have learned that not working? And I can say these things, but God cursed the word for our sake. Why? Because work is important. Because we have to have purpose. We have to have meaning. have to have value. have to have growth. If you have a person whose entire goal is to not do anything at all, they haven't learned that yet. So 2020, we had the pandemic and it just hit. was like, this is the life. have all this money and all this time. And I'm doing nothing. And I got in a depression so bad. And I kept telling myself, because for the longest time, I kept trying to get things off my plate just so I could be mom. Well, the girls kept getting older and older and needing less and less time. And so now, there's a convergence of all this free time and kids that don't want me around because they're teenagers. want to be with their friends. And so I had this programming that I put there on purpose that says don't take on too much stuff, you'll get stressed and overwhelmed. Well now I've got my clients, I'm serving a mission, I'm going to school, and then I just volunteered to start hosting a Relief Society activity once on Thursdays and organizing it, and I'm asking myself is that too I'm exhausted, but I still have hours every day where I'm just like it's too quiet. I am not doing it because I'm not trying to impress anybody or feel like I've got a statement or anything like that. I've learned that I'm actually just really happy or being busy, engaged in good things. Now I've get plenty of sleep, I still have lots of time because I'm so efficient at what I do, all of those things are done pretty quickly. So I haven't met my capacity. But what I've learned is I don't want to just sit around doing nothing. would be miserable just on the beach with nothing to do. I don't ever want to retire. So there are people like me who have learned I need to be doing something effective, right? Those aren't necessarily everybody that's on the team. So understanding where people are at is really important. And then as long as somebody has an awareness that work is an important part of feeling satisfied and happy in life, then you ask questions like, okay, how do we make this work? How do we accomplish what matters to you and still be able to be successful on the team? Because we've already determined these meetings make us better. We've already determined that these processes make us better. The evidence is there. We've been measuring the numbers. So this is isn't just a random, I think it, I want to do it, this isn't about Lorenzo's ego, and I just want your time every day and I'm demanding it. It's that this was strategically implemented and has proven to be useful and beneficial to, first of all, reducing stress, second of all, increasing efficiency, and third, everybody getting better wages and bonuses because of the outcome. So there's nothing in there, you're willing to sacrifice, right? And nobody should want that sacrificed if they're on the team.
00:40:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, if they have to sacrifice those things, then this is not the right fit for them.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And so, no bad feelings, but is there a way that we can make this work where you're still happy and you feel like you're doing these things. Now, I'm not saying where's the thing that doesn't make you stretch. Stretching is good for you. Stretching is good for us. I'm not saying you're not going to have to stretch to make this happen. What I'm saying is if there's anything I can do to help that stretching hurt a little bit less and be as productive for you as possible, I'm totally here for that. I don't see how anybody could ask any more of you than that, Lawrence.
00:41:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and I've been stressed out because last month was a little rough. I didn't settle as much. There's a lot of cases that are going to end up in litigation where I really wanted to keep them, you know, and I wanted to work them. I was expecting a much bigger end of the year. Let's put it that way. And I've been trying, racking my brain, trying to figure out how can we do better, basically. And I think that's part of it is getting getting them on board with the growth, getting them on board with the, you know, first of all, taking away those pain points where we can, but also getting them to buy into the company's growth.
00:42:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have a thought that just popped up because he said that. What if you wrote up kind of a state of the union for yourself?
00:42:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've been doing it.
00:42:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've second, so we'll see if we're aligning because what I would, I would do say, okay, this is, you know, where we were at when I started with Sweet Law. I came in Sweet Law, so let's just, and maybe you don't do it every year, but let's start that there, right? This year, you know, this is where we started and then we, I don't know if you, you bring in this work because Mark gave this to you and Patrick, and I think it's important to note that because that was his investment in you guys. not cheap. And I think that it's good to pay homage to the fact that instead of just telling you to get better, he gave you a resource to help you. And I think that that's important for the rest of the team to understand that that's who he is, while you're also showing okay, and this is you. And so when you were faced with these numbers, these are some of the things that you implemented. And these are some of results that happened, talking about you changed your team meetings. You split them up because one team didn't want to listen to something that had nothing to do with them. And so you respected their time, but it also made the meeting so much more effective. You implemented more frequent reviews, file reviews, and you implemented a kind of higher level, higher frequency file review of how we got in touch. You implemented the kind of extra expectations of, we will make sure people hear from us at least once a week, one way or another, so that people know that they're being cared for. Sweet Law implemented second voice. That was Mark's idea, but you all have helped to make it be successful. And as a result, there have been higher performance bonuses for the teams. And because you take that out of your pocket to give to your team, everybody benefited from something that wasn't even necessarily applicable to them. Like I would really highlight all of the things that have happened that have made an impact on how business works at Sweet Law. You could talk about the new additions, like who came onto the team this year, what impact they had. And then you might say, in other news, like, know, but this is where I feel like we fell short. I had into and did to do this, this, this, and this, and didn't accomplish that, but I think we can do better, and I know that I can do better. So here's what I'm personally going to do, and here's what I'm calling the team to do, and I know that if we do these things, then in 2025, we'll have shorter resolution times, higher likelihood of hitting policy limits, while at the same time, people not having to work over time, let's use John as a reference point there, I would definitely highlight that change, and people feeling heard and seen and respected if you feel like you've accomplished that on your team. I would really break down all the changes that have happened because I've seen a lot of growth, so what I also know Lorenz is, most people are oblivious to it. They're not paying attention, they're not noticing, and it's not top of mind. It's top of mind for you every week because we're analyzing it every week. But it probably not for your team. They probably haven't like when you sit there and look at all of it also, it'll be really great for Mark to see like thing a lot really has happened and he didn't really have a lot to do with it other than providing the resources and then a couple of the solutions you guys did the rest. How does that align with what you were working on?
00:46:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I mean, as you said, I was mostly focused on like where I want to go from here. think we're like kind of taking the time to talk about to discuss what we've accomplished this year is important so that they notice their growth of the growth of the team.
00:46:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they notice that you noticed that you know I mean? What I would love is if you do that, let me see the draft in case you're missing some of really celebrate all the goodness, it's important for morale but it's also important when it comes time for the next ask, I'm asking these things for a reason and the track record is when we do these things it improves and not just what's in our pocketbooks but how we feel about clients like I'm In the coming days, Mark is working on this call control training to help us all learn how to do better on our conversations and that should reduce stress and that should also improve time spent on the phones. So the future is bright. And I might point out that this is not common in any workplace. These changes, this help, the support, it's not common. It does happen in some places, but it is not common.
00:48:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think most of us on AZ team realize that we've been through enough.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We need out because you want the stack Lorenz, you want the value stacked right there. So if anybody's having a hard day, guess what you can do. Go back to that and look at everything that Sweetlaw is trying to do for you. We're not just asking of you, but we're trying to give to you like this, this is symbiotic. Never assume that people will remember the good. Always remember that the adversary will do his best to confuse and darken everything all the time. Everywhere in every relationship, anything that is good, he'll It'll feel good too, I think, when you see it all.
00:49:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think so too. It'll be good for me to draft it.
00:49:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I want you to error on the side of too many words, rather than too few. I know.
00:49:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
back.
00:49:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. And then one of the things that we can do is just kind of bullet point and give it almost like subheadings, right, of these. different things, so I can help you with that as well. We can even use AI might help us kind of, so I don't want it to write anything for us, but it can help us analyze and say, what did we maybe not notice about some of the good that we've done? In these things, is there anything that any summary that you might give that kind of highlights and makes this feel like, I don't know, encouraging or anything. Just sometimes there's just a little idea that you get about the presentation that's helpful. Definitely not to write it for you or or lead it in any way, but it's just another feedback and every time I get some thought, like, oh, that actually is something I hadn't noticed, so I do want to highlight that. So, can you have it ready for us next week? Right. If you do it before then, which would be great, send it anytime. doesn't matter. Middle of the night, everything's muted. I don't check email, except for when I want to. So whenever you've got it, shoot it over. Do send it an email because for some reason the Google like shared notifications aren't always working. yeah, I think that will be a great way to end the year and also to start the new one.
00:51:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I agree. When I hit the ground running in January, I don't want to, you know, be like, Oh, well, it was the holidays. Let's just, you know, take it easy for the first two weeks, you know.
00:51:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't need two weeks for that. Nobody needs to actually have that much time now. Yes. They need the fuel. And this will be a great gift for them, really, honestly.
00:51:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think, you know, it's like in the Old Testament, it says,
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
vision, people perish, and then there's also Lewis Carroll. I'll some wonderland. She asked the Cheshire cat, which way do I go? Which road do I take? goes, well, where are you going? So I don't know. It doesn't matter. No vision.
00:52:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It doesn't matter.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're just going to wander around. And so what you're doing is making the path very clear, not just about where you're going, but where you've been. There's the saying that those who don't know their past are doing repeated. So you're going to reintroduce them to what has happened and where we've been and really notice. if you can find something great to celebrate about each person, even better.
00:52:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tonight. Awesome. I'm excited for it. Well, I'm glad that my brain came together a little bit and that cuz I almost canceled and I was like I don't want to cancel.
00:53:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I want to have it.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I Me too, you're doing great Don't forget to just ponder pray ask Kerry if maybe a consult with with Jonah might be useful She's pretty exceptional. I just pretty much fell in love with her right away, but she's very smart and she her patients love her and she understands Medications and their side effects And the physiology of some people that might be incompatible with it and also she's just hard not to listen Maybe she can help Kerry just have a little hope Yeah, Kerry and her get along Yeah, they trap Yes Such good people I'm so blessed to have so many good people to work with and just I'm glad you're one of them
00:54:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, me too. I'm glad you're, you're a part of the team.
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna go and just rest because now I'm like all emotional and gassy. Anyway, mostly. Hey, bye.
