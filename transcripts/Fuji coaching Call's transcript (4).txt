WEBVTT

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Esther: Hello! Wait!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Tina Marie: Hi, Esther, how are you?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Esther: Good. Where's my video? There I am. Okay. Hi.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tina Marie: Hi Are we in Emmy's room, or is that Mari's room

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Esther: Mari's room. Yeah. Um, which is Yep.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Esther: It still functions more like a guest bedroom right now, or you know, when her um cousin comes over on Mondays now, and he needs a place to take his nap

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Tina Marie: Oh, nice!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Esther: But yeah, um. I realized right before this meeting that I forgot to share

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Esther: The document or put it in the folder. The document I've been working all week on, so I only shared it with you like 10Â min before this meeting

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tina Marie: I know there's a lot, and I've been trying to catch up with it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Esther: Um Oh, don't worry. I mean, it's a lot of it is really just um

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Esther: You know I kind of went down this rabbit hole of You know, trying to figure out um

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Esther: Kind of just Where I stand in terms of work and life in general.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Esther: You know. Um. Have you heard of that book? Design your life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Tina Marie: It's older, isn't it?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Esther: I don't know if it's necessarily super old, but they used to run Maybe they still do this course at Stanford

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Esther: There were 2 professors at Stanford who ran a course And it became actually one of the most

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Esther: Popular courses on campus. And eventually they took all a lot of their learnings and everything, and wrote a book on it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Esther: Um, anyway. So I Kind of been working through the 1st couple of chapters of that book

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Esther: Um, and I'm hoping it'll kind of Give me some guidance and some direction as to where I want to go right now.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Esther: Um and a lot of it, just like also kind of um sprouted off into several couple. Several digressions But um

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Esther: Anyway. Um. I was just PIN going through that in conjunction with some of um

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Esther: You know some of the things that we touched on last week Um, and thank you. By the way, for the summary last week

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Esther: Yes.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Esther: Um, and I think one of the things that really struck me From what we talked about last week is where you said greatness is messy

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Esther: And I'm like, you know what Yeah, like, my desk does not

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Esther: Need to look pristine. For me to do what I do

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Esther: So. You know, that's just how some people work, whatever it is. Yes.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Esther: So I've been thinking a lot about Perfection, and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Esther: You know, just, you know, just things like that, and also just trying to Really figure out, you know, so much of this is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Esther: So much of my day, and my time is Being a mother right, and trying to figure out for myself

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Esther: Really, what that means. Um and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Esther: You know? How do I balance that with The things I actually want in life? Or how does that play a role

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Esther: Um Anyway, I'm just rambling right now. So

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Tina Marie: They're not Not. You're. You're sharing thoughts and feelings, and they're not linear. And so we like to dismiss that as being rambling. But it's not. It's just simply nonlinear. It's coherent. But it's not linear.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Esther: Mm. Okay.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Esther: Mhm. Yes. Okay.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Esther: Um That's a great way of putting it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tina Marie: Existence is not linear.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Esther: No, it's not

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Tina Marie: Quantum physics there, there's no beginning, there is no end. So To be able to have thoughts, that

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Tina Marie: Are relative to that which is how I think right

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Tina Marie: I, Get tongue tied a lot of times, because I have 10 different thoughts at the same time, and I'm trying to choose one in a matter of order. But the problem is, they are nonlinear. So I can't choose one based off a value because you could enter at any infinite point, exit any infinite point. It's all relative

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Tina Marie: And so we call it rambling, because we don't know Or want to explain that, knowing that number one, not everybody will understand it. 2, not everybody will care 3. Most people don't want to put that much effort into it. And so we go. It's rambling

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Tina Marie: But it's really not. It's useful.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Esther: Okay, that's good to know Thank you for that perspective. I never really thought of it like that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Esther: Yeah, mhm Um

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Esther: So, anyway, I guess back to the document I shared with you. It was me just trying to go through an exercise of My feeling, you know. Um, you know. They they talked about work, view, and a life view

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Esther: And you know, writing down what your work view is writing down what your life view is, and trying to find Is there any? Where do they clash? Is there any intersection to them?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Esther: Um. And they talked about that Being kind of, you know, being kind of a guide, or like a north star, you're you know. They talk about just your path not being linear like you said

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Esther: Um, and you're not going to know exactly what you're doing all the time. But you know, creating some sort of North Star for yourself. Um that kind of You know, helps give you some direction. Um, you know you're you might not be on on the track that you want to be um all the time, but you are

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Esther: You know, still keeping to some sort of general direction, that you want to be, where your work and your values and everything like still intersect So.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Esther: Yeah, that's In a nutshell what I've been working on

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Esther: Um, the past Several days.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Esther: And I think that was Really important for me, because

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Esther: When I'm thinking about, what do I want to do Um, you know, just even questions like, Do I want to work with Ben, who hasn't gotten back to me? By the way, um! And

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Esther: You know or do I want to work with other people? I think I'm very much in need of Putting together some sort of direction for myself again

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Esther: Because I think last week we talked about You know, just I've checked off

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Esther: Kind of The boxes. I've been

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Esther: You know. I felt like I was been. You know, I was supposed to check off, you know, and I don't know what to do anymore. So I'm like, Okay, well.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Esther: I checked off all these these 4 or 5 boxes. That kind of have just been leading my life for the last 30 something odd years. Um! I like um

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Esther: I I need to. I need to figure out what like the next part of the journey is gonna be. So that's really kind of what the exercise Um is meant to be

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Esther: Um. Yes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Esther: Mm.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tina Marie: Listening to you, and also

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Tina Marie: Reading through this. There's a lot of Really useful things.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Um Let me just read a little bit more

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Esther: Yeah, no. Problem. Take your time.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Tina Marie: What we want to look for. Is the contradictions

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Tina Marie: Because the contradictions are what create unhappiness

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Esther: Hmm. Okay.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Tina Marie: So. If.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Tina Marie: Just I'm gonna preface this one time, no matter how I word things There is.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Tina Marie: All respect and judgment for the way that you view life So sometimes, whatever I can say, things that seem insensitive because I'm I'm going about this very analytically

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. So I just want to preface it with that, only because I know that you know that I'm religious and spiritual. You're not And a lot of people

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Tina Marie: Don't know how to Coexist, or respect, or feel like they've got a like

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Tina Marie: Judge others impart others, or persuade somebody that way. I'm not that person. I think you've gathered that. But

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah, I understand. Yeah.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But as I go through this as an approach like I don't know tones, whatever I have. Rbf, I get told that all the time like. Anyway, sometimes I come off wrong, and I just need to make sure, as we're digging into these things that are incredibly personal to you.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tina Marie: That I have the greatest like. I feel like crying again, respect and honor for how you feel about things, and so I need you to know that in case I say something dumb Because I'm not thinking about what I say. I need to not have to think about how I say it

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Tina Marie: Because

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Tina Marie: Then I may not say may then I may not get out the the value that I'm trying to actually get out. If that makes sense

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Esther: Thank you. And you know it's also like what I told you in bidding. I understand that you're religious. I came into this knowing it, you know, and you know we're you and I are not necessarily always

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Esther: Going to Agree where certain con. You know, we might agree, maybe on a concept or on an idea, or you know. But maybe we don't necessarily agree with where that derived from for us

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know. Maybe some, you know. Maybe you and I agree on some sort of approach And the way that you came to that conclusion was

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Esther: Based on more of a religious approach, and that worked for you, and maybe it didn't work for me. But hey, we're still arriving on generally a

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Esther: Conclusion. So I'm

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Tina Marie: And that's my experience with a whole lot of things. My sister is like you, and like yesterday I was trying to explain something I'm like. I don't know how else to explain this without bringing Jesus into it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Tina Marie: And and the thing was that I I so I believe that one of his names is the Prince of Peace, and so

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: I also believe that Peace is the only thing that Satan can't replicate. And so for me, if I feel peace, I know that

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Tina Marie: That's right. But I could Back that up by, even if I took religion out of it, and just say, every time I felt peace

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Tina Marie: That has always been the right decision, and sometimes the anxiety comes right after. And she's like, Well, you can take religion out of it. That's my experience also. And so it arrived at the same thing for different reasons, completely different

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Tina Marie: Different guiding principles or whatever. But we ended up having the same experience. And that's that has been something I've run into a lot. So

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Esther: Hmm. Yeah. And and I think that you know. And I have a similar idea, too, in the sense that I

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Tina Marie: Anyway.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Esther: You know I've come to, even though I don't Prescribe to any sort of

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Esther: Organized religion. And in fact, I you know historically, I've had very strong feelings about um. You know um Christianity

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Esther: But I can also, I can also appreciate that humans We.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Esther: We can have an experience, spirituality. As humans.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Esther: Religious or not, and that kind of spirituality can be connected You know, maybe for some people through nature, through whatever it the experiences is, and some and a lot of people, you know, and you know, and maybe

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Esther: Folks who are religious You know, find that human spirituality, through the the vehicle of religion

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Esther: And I don't. I don't have a problem with that, you know.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Esther: Um. So yeah, you and I can both be spiritual in our own ways, and

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Esther: Come to. You know, a similar conclusion about Some aspect of human spirituality. You just arrived through it through a vehicle of religion, where I do not

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Tina Marie: Right. But I just wanted to make sure, because I'm gonna just get straight into this, that um And it's not even just today or whatever. Sometimes I get to something. And I I can't. I don't want to have to think about my words.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Tina Marie: I don't think you're easily offended so. But anyway.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Esther: I am not so

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Tina Marie: These things are. I just wanted to preface that because there there are some contradictions in here, and getting through contradictions of our own thoughts are hard

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Esther: And I appreciate it. Yeah. Hmm.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Tina Marie: And they can be Painful.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Esther: Mm-hmm

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Tina Marie: Because ego does its job, which is, wants to protect itself

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Tina Marie: And I think that you do a very good job of mastering that. But Ego is also the reason. The contradictions exist. In the 1st place.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Esther: I absolutely agree with that

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Esther: Actually mhm

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Tina Marie: So if we get to the the real. And these are questions I would ask. And I so I love that. You have already done that because we can just get straight into the work because you've done it.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Tina Marie: That What matters to you most is the human experience, and what each of us makes of the time that we had

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Tina Marie: Then the experiences that you want to have are primarily centered around love, joy, and fun that means enjoying the physical world. What the physical world can offer. That's why you love traveling, music and food That you love spending time with people and connecting with them, and getting to know them, their joys and their struggles

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tina Marie: And We'll get into the parenthood thing in another in a moment. But

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Tina Marie: You also say that I'm a natural people pleaser, so I love helping someone else feel better, whether that's just giving them safe space To share or share my own experience, even if if I've gone through something similar. But

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Tina Marie: Right in between. Is the contradiction

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Tina Marie: Struggled with perfection.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Tina Marie: Perfection is about judgment. Judgment is about other people, and how they perceive you

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Tina Marie: But If there is no judge.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Tina Marie: If. The quality of your life experiences.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Tina Marie: Is what you're measuring your life on Nobody's Judgment matters

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Tina Marie: If love. And joy is what matters. Judgment is the antithesis of that

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Esther: Hmm, yes.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Tina Marie: So. Why would you want to love somebody who doesn't have love back for you? That's unhealthy. That's not

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Tina Marie: So. Then ask yourself.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Tina Marie: Is that in alignment with The experiences and the purpose of life for you

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Tina Marie: If it is to Experience, love and joy. Can you love everyone in the world? Can you experience joy with everyone in the world? You can't

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Tina Marie: If if that's true, then You're born where you're born, what

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Tina Marie: Responsibility or accountability do you have? Simply because of where you were born? If you, if you don't believe that, that's Authored or purposeful, or anything. And and these are real questions to kind of like. Ask yourself

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Tina Marie: What responsibility do you have to anyone Other than yourself to have the best experience you can

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Tina Marie: Now in terms of A morality that I do think that you have

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Tina Marie: I don't know where that comes from, right, how So for me, like it's bound to religion.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Tina Marie: But I know people have morals outside of religion.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Tina Marie: But I don't know. Like do you think of it as it just exists as it is? Are there natural laws? Where do they come from? What is nature? Natural nature, right.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Tina Marie: And What?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Tina Marie: Oh, um loyalty what um Responsibility.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Tina Marie: Do you have to those laws, or are they laws that you choose

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tina Marie: Because the answer to those questions is. The release.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Tina Marie: Of perfectionism.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Esther: Okay. I think that is a good question, and I probably should have actually left my digression in there. In cause. I rambled so much

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Tina Marie: I rambled nonlinear

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Esther: I'm sorry I uh I Nonlinearly, nonlinearly.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Tina Marie: I love that 5 times fast. Heather

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Esther: I know right um Yeah, interesting. So let me actually.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Esther: Put this digression back in in terms. Maybe that that will kind of give you an idea

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yes, yes, yes. We did that contract

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Esther: Um

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Tina Marie: Jan Hellfella

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Esther: Of where. Of where my um

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Esther: Of where I believe Like morality, and a code of ethics and stuff comes from

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Esther: Um

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Tina Marie: Do you believe in innocence?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Esther: Do I believe in innocence, define innocence.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Tina Marie: Without guile. Having

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Tina Marie: Never Done harm of, or

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Tina Marie: To another. Spiritually, physically, or

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Tina Marie: Without. Any.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Tina Marie: Willful. Intent to harm.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Tina Marie: Another.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Esther: Um, I guess, for all intents and purposes, I I do. You know, when I think of a baby or Whatever um

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Tina Marie: So there's a follow up question

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Tina Marie: If somebody harms an innocent, is that good Or bad, or irrelevant

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Esther: If someone harms an innocent um, I would say that it is

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Tina Marie: On purpose. With the intent to harm

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Esther: Huh!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Tina Marie: On purpose, with the intent to harm right, not accidental

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Esther: Yes, I would say, that is bad in definition with how our society functions For.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Esther: You know the purpose of Coexisting with another with other

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Esther: Humans

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Tina Marie: You gotta take society out of it because we're trying to define what your values are.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Esther: Okay. Alright. I think we might need to elaborate on that a little bit

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So I don't believe in good and evil.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tina Marie: But if there's innocent And a person

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Tina Marie: Intentionally harmed innocents. Then what do you call that

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Esther: I think maybe I need to clarify a little bit more of Good versus evil

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Esther: I think Maybe evil to me is

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Esther: The attempt to harm Another person or thing.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I I think if I were to say it I would say that, and then it would be to have

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Tina Marie: To to obtain dominion over another against their will. I think those are the 2 things that I think evil does

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Esther: Sure. Okay.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Tina Marie: Harm innocence, and so they they harm And they try to control. I think everything else falls within that realm

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Tina Marie: And

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Esther: Sure, hey?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Tina Marie: So it it is the violation Of another being

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Tina Marie: Measured by What?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Tina Marie: All beings would Have a right to do, we have a right to

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Tina Marie: Exist, and not be harmed

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Tina Marie: Exist. Not be controlled

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Tina Marie: And whether it's a universal law, and just simply is whether it's societal or not. Is that something that you can

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Tina Marie: Define as something that you believe in, regardless of where it might originate.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Tina Marie: So then that helps kind of Create a definition for you, and it doesn't matter who labels it and what the words are

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Tina Marie: Now have your own words And a specific categorization

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Tina Marie: Relative to your own values.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Tina Marie: And if that's true, then we have something that we can work with and run, you know, kind of filters through, and the rest

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Tina Marie: So. If.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Tina Marie: Good and bad were simplified as Only those things, right

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tina Marie: If everything could be qualified as good that does not try to harm Another or control another.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Tina Marie: Then what point is there in perfection Does it make

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Esther: I'm trying. I'm I'm trying to

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Esther: Make the connection

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Tina Marie: So judgment, it's judgment.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Esther: Between. Uh-huh.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Tina Marie: Right. So.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tina Marie: Who determines what's perfect. That is a judgment

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: That's a measurement

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Tina Marie: What? Is the source of the measurement

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Tina Marie: Who defines what is perfect, what is not.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: So. If you are chasing something that can't even be defined

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Tina Marie: And creating anxiety within yourself

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tina Marie: You are creating your own pain. And you can stop

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Esther: Ah! Okay.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Tina Marie: And we know psychologically. Worry

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tina Marie: Is creating. Pain.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Tina Marie: We can stop it now. Simple, versus, easy, right.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Tina Marie: We have. The physical ability to stop a thought

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Tina Marie: Some people struggle with it more because of chemicals, because of training, because of all kinds of environmental things. Right?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Tina Marie: But for all intents and purposes, purposes, let's say You're worrying about the future

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Tina Marie: And then you see something cute Your.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Tina Marie: Thoughts change. You are now not unhappy because of what you're thinking about.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Tina Marie: That thought just Existed, and the pain existed because of the thought

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: If the thought stops, the pain stops.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: If the worry about perfection stops. The pain.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Tina Marie: From the worry of perfection, stops.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Esther: Okay. Yes. I'm following that train of thought

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Esther: Okay. Okay.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Esther: Alright, I think Yes, that that makes sense

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Esther: You know. In other words, it's you know, it's really all

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Esther: Psychological. It's all in your head. Yeah.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Tina Marie: Almost everything.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Tina Marie: And at the very least it's all in our brain. Because pain reception, even if it's real

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Tina Marie: It's still a signal from our brain.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Tina Marie: So what are the signals that we have power over And are we taking the power that we have available to us?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Tina Marie: Those signals be what we want them to be.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Oh!

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Esther: Okay. You know, and I think I'm not sure if I wrote that

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Esther: Wrote that down, but One of the reasons

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Esther: I like Connecting with people

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Esther: Is. And oh, people opening up to each other like me, opening up to someone or someone opening up to me

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Esther: Is. A reminder that

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Esther: This person in front of me doesn't have to be perfect for me to Care about them.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Esther: You know. Um. Similarly, I don't have to be

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Esther: Perfect for this person in front of me to care about me. I think. Yes.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. One of my favorite quotes that I heard is a Dr. Seuss quote Going back to all the people in the world. Right? You can't experience all of them, anyway, and you can choose which ones you work with

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tina Marie: Or interact with. But the the quote is that Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Esther: Mm.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Tina Marie: Your observation is You don't mind if there's something wrong, because it doesn't matter, because they matter, not the thing

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Tina Marie: There are people in life who will feel the same about you And anyone who doesn't

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Tina Marie: Probably doesn't belong there. Or at least

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Tina Marie: Not within your inner circle Your inner sanctum

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tina Marie: Those are the people we can love from over there, or Let go.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Esther: Mhm. I think you know a lot of it. Really. Also.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Esther: Comes back to When you say the people who matter don't mind, and the people who mind don't matter

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Esther: Um That's very.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Esther: I think That further. You know the people who have always minded

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Esther: Yeah, where people in my life who were supposed to be closest to me, like my family, like my my parents. For example, or you know, my extended family and stuff, and those were

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Esther: Maybe that's why it hurts so much that They were the people who

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Esther: You're supposed to trust, and you know, I imagine You went through something like this, too, in your life, from based on what you told me

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Esther: And They ended up being

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Esther: The people who are supposed to matter were the ones who minded the most

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Esther: And by that definition you're just like, okay. Well. How do you reconcile that

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Esther: You know.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Tina Marie: So let's go back to the experiences that I want are primarily centered around. Love, joy, and fun

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Tina Marie: You. Cannot.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Tina Marie: Give power. To a person who would steal the things that matter to you. Most

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Tina Marie: You didn't say I want money. Power.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Tina Marie: Control, or another Things like that

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tina Marie: You want. Things that fall within the realm of good right, not harming innocent other

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: So, if anybody Robs that from you

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Tina Marie: When you gave them love. When you gave them the best part of you.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tina Marie: What? Loyalty. Do you have, then, to a person like that

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Tina Marie: I think none

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Esther: None. Yeah, that's right.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Tina Marie: Now Let's go to the parenthood for a little bit.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Tina Marie: Because a lot of these things we can Make.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: Clear. And define.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Tina Marie: And a lot of things Cannot be so easily defined

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Tina Marie: So. Parenthood was something that you felt like you had to do

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Tina Marie: And by what you said, Fuji said. It seems like maybe that's something you still feel like Is the reason you're a mother.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Tina Marie: But also you said I don't know what I would need like. You're happy, and you can't imagine life without them.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Tina Marie: But What I got from that, and tell me if I'm wrong

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Tina Marie: Is that you vacillate Sometimes between.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tina Marie: I'm here because I checked a box I love that I have them.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Tina Marie: But I'm here because I checked a box Is that true? Do you vacillate at all?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Esther: Yes, I do. Um During times, where

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Esther: I feel like they take up so much of my time and my energy. Um!

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I'm gonna pause. You there. I'm gonna pause. You there

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Esther: Yeah, yeah. Yes.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Tina Marie: Because that that Okay.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Tina Marie: So. Going back to your value and your purpose of life.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Tina Marie: Um Joy.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Tina Marie: Love and fun now. So so let me give you an example Imagine.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Tina Marie: That Every day.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tina Marie: Is the perfect temperature. Every day is the perfect weather whatever you define that as

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tina Marie: Every single day. That maybe there is no night unless you love night

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Tina Marie: Right. But no matter what the temperature.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Tina Marie: The sky, everything is perfect. Do you appreciate it? Don't answer the question yet.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Tina Marie: Because that's how it always is. It never differs Now

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: I want you to imagine A month.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Tina Marie: 2 months, 3 months. Of pure darkness.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Tina Marie: Freezing cold weather Bitter wind.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Tina Marie: And rain and storm What does that perfect weather feel like when it finally comes back

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Esther: Feels like a breath of fresh air

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Tina Marie: Or maybe even hope and life.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Tina Marie: Because I want you to try to imagine what it was like to be In pure darkness outside, and cold and freezing for months on end.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Tina Marie: It is the contrast That makes the joy

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: There is no joy.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Esther: One.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Tina Marie: If you don't know anything different It is pain and suffering that makes joy possible.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Tina Marie: Otherwise, it's just existence. There's nothing to compare it to

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Esther: Mhm. Yes. Okay. Ah.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Esther: I remember having that thought somewhere

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Tina Marie: So. Now we're going to take this to parenthood.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Esther: One time. Zone. Okay?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Tina Marie: Some of the most exquisite pain you'll ever feel physically and emotionally Will come from being a mother.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Tina Marie: What does that mean about the joy Some of the most exquisite joy.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: You will ever feel will only be possible because you're a mother If the purpose of your life

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Tina Marie: Is to be And feel love and joy.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Tina Marie: Parenthood Is the vehicle through which you can experience the most

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: Of that And that isn't a Tina opinion. That's

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Tina Marie: We have history. Of people.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Tina Marie: Who have said that

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Tina Marie: It is the rule, not the exception. There will be exceptions But in most human experience deathbed conditions and things like that

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tina Marie: That seems to be the rule for humans.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Esther: That makes A lot of sense

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Esther: Like you can't

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Tina Marie: So you didn't do it out of obligation, although you might have felt like it. It's still the thing that enables you

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Tina Marie: To do what you actually value most, which is experience, the most love and the most joy

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Esther: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's you know I don't

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Esther: I don't feel like I had them out of Obligation. I think

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Esther: For me. I told myself a long time ago that I would not feel obligated to have children

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Esther: Um. In fact, I was fine with not having any um, but You know. I you know it was one of those things where I'm just like, you know, if I don't ever have kids

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Esther: I'm not, gonna you know. I don't know if I would Ever regret it or not. But it was one of those things where I said

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Esther: I'm okay, either way, having kids or not having kids

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Esther: What matters to me is having The right partner.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Esther: Like, you know, in order to have like, at least for me. Um. So when Fuji and I decided to have kids

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Esther: It was an easy decision. I knew he was the right partner, and I said, You know what this is. My opportunity. Then All the conditions are right in my

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Esther: The conditions that I gave myself are right I found the right partner, which is the most important condition of all

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Esther: Um I am absolutely open to trying this

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Esther: Human experience. Um

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Esther: Yes.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Tina Marie: 2. Thoughts. Um

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Tina Marie: So. Work and its relationship to love, and then parenthood and its relationship to I mean work and its relationship to joy and parenthood and its relationship to work which has its relationship to joy

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Think about.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Tina Marie: Some of the most exhilarating times you've ever had in your life. What happened?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: Most likely. You overcame something hard. You did something hard

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Tina Marie: You worked. For something.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Tina Marie: And you earned it. Even if it's Fuji's love or somebody's praise.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Tina Marie: Or An accomplishment, a race.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Tina Marie: A win something you built

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Tina Marie: Our joy. Is also going to be correlated to and and contrast right

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Tina Marie: To something we labored for

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Tina Marie: So to the point of children taking up a lot of time Yeah.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, it's always relative to where we're at right now. Think about when you were waiting for Emmy to be born

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Tina Marie: How long that took And how long did it take with Mari? Was it as long did it seem as long

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Esther: They were, you know. I probably had the some of the easiest deliveries. Mar Emmy took an hour. Mari took 20Â min

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Tina Marie: I'm talking about the whole pregnancy

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Esther: Oh, the whole pregnancy! Yes, sure! 9 months

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Tina Marie: And also the milestones for mari do they seem to go faster

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Esther: You know. Mhm.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So time in perspective is relative, based off of how many experiences we've had the 1st time everything takes longer. If you go take a trip, and you've never driven that

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Esther: Yes. Mhm.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Tina Marie: Um the 1st time. It seems really long on the way home. It never seems as long

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Tina Marie: It's because You don't know how long it takes there. You don't have milestones to measure. You don't know what they are

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Tina Marie: But when you take the trip the second time around you recognize the landmarks, you recognize the milestones, and you now have a relationship to that, and the destination that didn't exist in the beginning

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Tina Marie: So. You have 2 children.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tina Marie: I can tell you. It goes even faster when you get 4 It's all relative to how much you've experienced, and also how how different they are. Some of them things will be very similar. Some of them won't be

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Tina Marie: But That feeling, of

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Tina Marie: Fear of missing out, and what else you could do A lot of that comes back to judgment

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Tina Marie: What are you supposed to accomplish? And then the other thing it comes back to is joy.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Tina Marie: Not. Everything in parenthood is joyful, but that is what you want to experience. So one of the ways that you can help yourself

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Tina Marie: Have a joy in the moment Is to understand and to borrow from the future the joy that's going to come

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Tina Marie: From having endured or worked through What you're going through right now

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. The other thing is What you're doing now is

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Tina Marie: Being more than just a mother If there is resentment.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: Um, which is natural, and many mothers have it, even if they Wanted to be nothing but mother.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Tina Marie: For the time that is taken and not appreciated.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Tina Marie: Um And or just taken, and

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Tina Marie: Your your vitality. Is being spent.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Tina Marie: And there are other things that you want to accomplish Then

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Tina Marie: Um Finding ways that you can feel fulfilled

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Tina Marie: Now while they're there, and balancing Which balance isn't even a real thing. But it's more

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Tina Marie: You know, like this? Right? It's not this right?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Esther: Fluid. Mhm.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Tina Marie: Um. It's a constant series of trade-offs Um

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Tina Marie: Moment by moment, week by week, day by day, all of those things And

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Tina Marie: Doing what you can to feel the things that matter to you most love and joy. Now, because Tomorrow's not promised.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Tina Marie: So. Everything is relative at the end of whatever moment you're in. That's where you're measuring from, not what was happening

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Tina Marie: You'll measure what stuck out in the day most Out of everything than your whole life

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Tina Marie: If you Said bad things to somebody that is special and you care about. That's what's going to be on your mind. Everything else is not

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Tina Marie: It's gonna be the bad

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tina Marie: So. It's also the same way when you just like, go to sleep at night. If you take stock of your day

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Tina Marie: If you can think about how you treated the people that you love most How you treated the things.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Tina Marie: That matter to you most If you

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Tina Marie: Honored those things. Because you value them, not because somebody told you you should

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Tina Marie: At the end of the day, if that's what you count, instead of what you didn't do or didn't do right, or didn't do well, or didn't do enough of You will be happy

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Tina Marie: And Joy.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Tina Marie: Is. One of your main 3 values really.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Tina Marie: Lovejoy and Fun

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Tina Marie: And I would say that fun really is a component of that joy. Right? It's still a

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Tina Marie: Happy it, but it um, maybe more experiential, right?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Tina Marie: Whereas Joy could just be something that you just feel

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Tina Marie: Without something happening per se So.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Tina Marie: Think about. Um

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Tina Marie: You go through these things again And where.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Tina Marie: Look for the conflicts, look for the contradictions

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Tina Marie: And then take everything back To.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Tina Marie: What do you value about life? And how do these things

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Tina Marie: Add to your value

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Tina Marie: How do they not And then

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Tina Marie: Change, how they are. So.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Tina Marie: If there's something in your life, it If it doesn't add the value, it doesn't mean you have to get rid of it in your life.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Tina Marie: It just means you may need to change the way you operate around that thing. Um. Maybe

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Tina Marie: To have joy and love You feel like

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Tina Marie: You want to have A relationship with your parents, but

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: The way that they behave. You can't. So the relationship could be. I'm going to honor you in my heart But not in my proximal, energetic space.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: If you want to come into here, you're going to have to change some things. But I'm not going to be angry

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Esther: Go ahead!

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Tina Marie: I'm not going to Have bad feelings and steal my joy anymore, or allow you to steal it

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Tina Marie: And I'm not going to have bad feelings towards you, because it will steal my joy

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Tina Marie: You know what I mean like Redefine

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Tina Marie: Things according to your values.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Tina Marie: And everything And everyone

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Tina Marie: Will be better for it.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Esther: Okay. And it's kind of interesting. I I spent

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Esther: So much time thinking about those things, and I'm still not done thinking about them either.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Tina Marie: We never are

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Esther: And yeah, um. You know, and one of the things I I struggle with so much right now is the work piece

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Esther: And how that intersects like Again. You know there are times where

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Esther: Fuji and I had the strongest connection When we were

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Esther: Like deep in the work together You know, um, and it's very interesting, because now our

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Esther: It's kind of diverged a little, you know. He you know you work with him. You know what he all day he's thinking about And

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Esther: I'm not, you know. We've kind of diverged in that now, because B. 46, for all intents and purposes like runs on its own You know, and

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Esther: To me. I feel like I'm kind of missing That

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Esther: That that really strong connection that we used to have, because He's still so focused on work

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Esther: And I am not. I'm more mostly more of my time is like, you know, just focused on the kids, or you know, whatever it is.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Esther: And I think that's part of the reason why I'm so

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Esther: I keep turning over in my head like How can I bring the work piece back into my life again?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Esther: You know.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Tina Marie: Let me ask you a question. Because

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Tina Marie: As you go through this You will find that there are things that you want

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Tina Marie: And then you will find that there are things that you want more, and sometimes It matters.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Tina Marie: And I'll give you an example You may want to be

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Tina Marie: Independent. And

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Tina Marie: Have your own purpose and value separate from anybody else in the world, including your husband. You also

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Tina Marie: Want a bond that you discovered Seem to be greatest when you are working together

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Tina Marie: There are only so many hours in the day. There's only so many things that you could do If.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Tina Marie: Everything worked out, and you had the ability to have a purposeful work relationship with Fuji again, or you could do your own thing And

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Tina Marie: Those were the only choices because of time. Right? You could only do one of them well. And this is not a question I want you to answer right now at all.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Tina Marie: Because it's not really even on the table It's an example of how things will come up

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Tina Marie: Um Would you choose

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Tina Marie: To. Prioritize the feeling of the bond that comes from having

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Tina Marie: Common work. And working together, and creating together and building together.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Tina Marie: Or Would you value the

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Tina Marie: I want to have done this thing on my own More.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Tina Marie: These are the types of choices that will happen so, and another example would be Do you um?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Tina Marie: Could you redefine the work and the goal that you're working on together is the development of your girls So that is a work to be done. Is there

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Tina Marie: Something that you want to see happen for them Experiences that you want them to have

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Tina Marie: Knowledge that you want them to have Um values

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Tina Marie: There is so much to develop. They're brilliant. Some languages, technologies. Things, jujitsu. He's doing jujitsu right. There's all kinds of different things

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Tina Marie: Is it possible? That

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Tina Marie: A way to increase your joy in motherhood And in your relationship with Fuji is to create a a goal. Tasks

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Tina Marie: That you want to accomplish with the girls that You also feel is not

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Tina Marie: Imposing upon Who they are individually and independently.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Tina Marie: But Um

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Tina Marie: Giving them something that then they could say And you, you would be okay with it.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Tina Marie: I don't want any of this anymore. This is not who I am. But

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Tina Marie: The work isn't invalidated because the work was really Being aligned with Fuji, and a purpose

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Tina Marie: And having imparted knowledge, skills, wisdom, experience. Memories, or whatever

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Tina Marie: To the girls Um, something that you could measure as in

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. Um. There are different kinds of things that people want to have So what I'm asking you to do is take that beautiful nonlinear type of thinking

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Tina Marie: Right. Remove

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Tina Marie: The judgment and the qualification of good or bad. And

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Tina Marie: Add the qualification of love and joy and fun. And now apply that

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Tina Marie: Treatment And

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Tina Marie: Value to motherhood. To work to your partnership, to the things that

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Tina Marie: Of natural consequence. Take up the majority of your waking hours in your day.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Tina Marie: How do you extract The value of your life

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Tina Marie: Every day. With the people and the things that you

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Tina Marie: Are already doing and spending time with every day. Does that make sense

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Esther: Mhm. Yes. Okay.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Esther: You're gonna have to do your AI companion thing To summarize the bold points like you did last week. But okay, that's a nugget I can work with

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Tina Marie: I also record all the calls are recorded. So they're only there in case somebody wants a recording or needs it, I automatically will delete them so you can always have the recording if you want. You could just have the audio so you could listen to it if you wanted to

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Esther: Yeah. Mhm.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Tina Marie: But the tools are are here for you if you want, but the summary often is really what we'll go to Um

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. Totally up to you. I can give you the transcript. I can give you whatever

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Tina Marie: Is most helpful to you.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Esther: I? Yeah, I liked the summary that you did last week.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Tina Marie: Cool. That's what I'll do for you.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Esther: Likewise, yeah, mhm.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Tina Marie: Just wanted to make sure you had options

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Esther: Okay. Yes, that's a nugget I can work with, I think

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Esther: You know um Yeah. And maybe it's 1 of those things where I don't have to

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Tina Marie: We have.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Esther: Overthink so much.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Tina Marie: Oh no! You definitely don't have to overthink. No.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Esther: I'm not gonna be able to solve like the question of life's purpose in like 2 weeks, you know, of sitting in front of my computer and pondering

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Tina Marie: And everything you learn. You're going to learn soon that you only knew a portion of it There is no finish line

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Tina Marie: There is no perfection.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tina Marie: It's all relative And the per

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Tina Marie: Everywhere you are at in life will change your perspective. Imagine.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Tina Marie: You're the sun watching the earth or the earth watching the sun Every rotation we see that song.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Tina Marie: Differently. You know, in the sky

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Tina Marie: The sun sees the earth. It's all relative. So

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Tina Marie: What is true to you from one angle Is not true from another.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: We want to say that there are absolute truths, and maybe there are, and maybe there aren't. Maybe there's a truth that's true from every angle But we've never been at every angle. So how do we know

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Tina Marie: So that's another way. You can release the judgment Not only do you not know all the things the people judging you don't know all the things

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Esther: Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Tina Marie: So. That judgment serves no purpose. Now there is judgment that we can qualify as serving purpose, for example, is something safe or not safe

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Tina Marie: There's quantifiable Data

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Tina Marie: That we can do right. Um Leaving an open flame in the house where you go away, not safe

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Tina Marie: Is something going to happen we don't know but but but it could, and the probability increases If you do that

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tina Marie: So there are real things that can be judged As good or bad, safe or unsafe

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Tina Marie: More likely to harm, less likely to harm. But outside of harm and damage

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Tina Marie: What's the point? It's all relative

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Esther: Alright, I think these are some good nuggets That I can chew on and

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Esther: You know, part of one of the things I was starting to come to a conclusion to Um

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Esther: You know, kind of right before our call, too, and the last couple of days, when I was also going through the notes our notes from last week. Um Is, that

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Esther: Maybe what needs to happen for me what I need to do. I just need to have bias to action. I have a tendency to like, have analysis, paralysis.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Esther: And My biggest.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Esther: Epiphanies, or the things that The ways that I've grown most isn't because I'm sitting here

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Esther: You know, I I introspect to the point where I can't introspect anymore. It starts to hurt my brain, and then You know, I realize

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Esther: I need to do something.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you one of my best tools Um

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Tina Marie: One of my Most useful perspectives for me is that I'll pay the price

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Tina Marie: For experience. So.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Tina Marie: I would think and think, and think, and think. Now I do and do, and do and do

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Tina Marie: And I learn really fast because of it. And people will be like, Yeah, but you just did this, and you did this, and you're not ever happy with this. And you wasted all this time. No, I didn't

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Tina Marie: I learned 10 times more than you know In the last week, because of all the things that I did that

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Tina Marie: Have no purpose and no end. The purpose was knowledge, the purpose was experience. I paid the price for it, and now I have it, and you can't take it from me

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Tina Marie: And it's going to have application to everything else I do in life, one way or another. Because I did it

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Tina Marie: Even if it didn't succeed Or come to some fruition, or

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Tina Marie: Whatever I gained experience which gave me wisdom

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Tina Marie: That I will apply to everything in the future

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Esther: I think that's a really. Great point that I've

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Esther: Maybe forgotten along the way somewhere. Um. It's that

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Esther: Your bias to action. The fact that you did it. You've gained something from it. Even if

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Esther: The perceived outcome Isn't what other people expect, or even if it's not what you expect

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Tina Marie: How often is it what we expect

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Esther: Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Tina Marie: Almost never If ever.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Esther: Well, I. And I think that expectation is also another form factor of perfection.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Tina Marie: And judgment.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Esther: Right in judgment. Yeah. And it's really interesting just how deeply it runs when I think about

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Tina Marie: Expectation and judgment.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Esther: Yeah, when I think about how that's so deeply wired in me. Um whether you know

00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Esther: You know, and I could say, Go back and say that you know, from the way that I was raised, you know the things were not worth doing unless they were perfect, or unless they had some sort of outcome expected outcome. Otherwise, why waste your time on it? Why do this? Why do that? And I think about, you know.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Esther: What that kind of thinking has Gotten. Let's just say my parents in particular, you know.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Esther: I don't know how much they experience joy in their lives, or how much they are just so bogged down by judgment Some sort of judgment that they think people are having on them, or they have on themselves

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Esther: Or just They just the fact that they

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Esther: Experience, so little You know I don't know, and you know I don't live in their shoes. I don't know. All I know is that

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Esther: When I see that kind of Thinking, or that kind of method mirrored in myself

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Esther: That is, when I am most unhappy, and that is when I am most like stuck You know, and that's what I am most. Um!

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Esther: Yes. Stuck in a rut

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Esther: And not being able to climb out of it. So.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Tina Marie: I just So.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Tina Marie: When we went to defining Evil.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: Or good or bad, or whatever The 2 things were

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Tina Marie: Trying. Harming.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Tina Marie: Another. Or trying to control another

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Tina Marie: What does that judgment do?

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Esther: Controls. Oh, okay.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Esther: Oh, that's a very interesting perspective. Mhm.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Tina Marie: And That control takes our freedom, and it takes our happiness. Is that not harm

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Tina Marie: So it's not good whether you call it evil or not. Is irrelevant, but we know it's not good

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Esther: It. Yes, okay, at least it doesn't serve to

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Tina Marie: Which means we need to get it out of the way.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Esther: It doesn't serve to promote joy. It doesn't serve to promote These things I supposedly want in my life.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Esther: Okay. All right.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Esther: Okay.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Tina Marie: Which means you need to protect yourself against it rather than give into it

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Okay.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Esther: Got it

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Tina Marie: And then Because I know that

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Tina Marie: Contradiction creates pain. You also want to look for where you're creating judgment

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Tina Marie: Of others. In your life.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Tina Marie: And you need to let that go too.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Okay.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Esther: Okay, this has been really, really helpful. It's It's giving me some nuggets to chew on

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Esther: Okay.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Tina Marie: Cause you did all the groundwork we just got to interact with it.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Esther: Okay, yeah, I mean, um, yes, this begets more questions. I think

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Tina Marie: Answers always do

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Esther: They always do, but um Yeah, it kind of brings me kind of to

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Esther: The next step. I you know, and I think it's really good that Um. One of the things that I'll be thinking about is

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Esther: You know. This partnership that I have with Fuji

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Esther: You know as You know, as partners um

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Esther: It's like, okay, well. Um

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Esther: Could you know? What do I want to do? Do I want to do You know, spend time building something that's just my own thing.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Esther: Or um. Is there something that he and I can do together?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Esther: Um

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Tina Marie: I would actually say To consider.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Tina Marie: That it's not an or But in end

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Esther: Okay.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Tina Marie: I think And

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Tina Marie: This is my experience, and the path that I'm on with my love with my children, with my friends. That

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Tina Marie: It creates too much of a burden on any relationship To.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Tina Marie: Have our creative powers. Be.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tina Marie: Primarily focused on other people. Or with other people.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tina Marie: Because other people will have ebbs and flows that don't match with us. And if you want to go somewhere or at a pace that he doesn't

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Tina Marie: There's conflict in a very valuable relationship In a critical relationship. Same thing with the girls

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Esther: Hmm. Hmm.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tina Marie: But To not be able to go full throttle with your creative energy is to create conflicts in yourself.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Tina Marie: So you need to be able to have a creative outlet that has A long lifespan, right? That you can keep building and building and creative

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Outside of your children and your husband And then

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Tina Marie: No matter how much energy you have, and desire and time to work on things You have always got an outlet for it that can go at the pace that you want to go

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Without creating a burden on a relationship That

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Tina Marie: That the person in that relationship may not be able to go at the pace you want to go at that time

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Esther: Hmm, okay.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Tina Marie: So. Um

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Tina Marie: It. Means that your joy in creation isn't contingent upon another person.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Tina Marie: So that you don't put the burden on that relationship To satisfy your need for creation

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Tina Marie: Which is innate

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Tina Marie: Does that make sense

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Esther: Yes, it does. Okay.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Tina Marie: The other thing is It is not

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Tina Marie: The way that he works. To come up with what that is

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Tina Marie: That is your skill. Set

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Tina Marie: You can find the compartmentalized area Where you could propose

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tina Marie: What if we worked together on this And you get all of this on your own

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Tina Marie: And you can invite me in if you want to But what if we did this thing together? And it could be in his current business, or it could be separate

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Tina Marie: You don't like the real estate stuff he does Find something that you both really enjoy, that you can work on

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Tina Marie: That will not be consuming, and take you away from the primary things That you work on

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Tina Marie: But that you get to have the joy and the bonding Over co-creating

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Tina Marie: Just something to Ponder on and think about

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Esther: Okay. Yeah, I think we just had to find some common ground

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Esther: Um You know he always dreams that we do jujitsu together as a family, and I'm just like nah dude. I

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Esther: Literally no interest in you. I did it with you for a little bit during Covid Because, you know, I just I went along with it, and you loved it. He was so happy when I was doing that with him.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Esther: But I think maybe Maybe there is something that we can work on together, because if there's something that we both like

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Esther: We both like a lot. It's money.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Tina Marie: If you can figure out the thing that you like And it makes money. I'm pretty sure he'll be happy with it, because

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Tina Marie: His main driving factor is getting to 10 million dollars in net worth To know that the family is taken care of

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Tina Marie: From what I know, that is his main driver, and everything I don't know what's gonna happen when he gets there. What's gonna you know? Okay, you tick that box. Now, what

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tina Marie: But I think your easiest way to get a yes.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Which is how we get to the happiness. Right? I'm always like, where do I move the friction out of the way? So I get what I want

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Esther: Okay. Uh-huh.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Tina Marie: But If you can find something that you love that is challenging, because joy is corollary to work and difficulty

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Tina Marie: Right overcoming. It's the contrast

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Tina Marie: Um, something that you can build that's maybe challenging, that has the potential to make a lot of money that you'll enjoy, even if it doesn't make money That's the key.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Tina Marie: Where. You can find a portion that he's interested in

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Tina Marie: I think all he needs to do to be interested is to see the money potential. I maybe Underestimating him.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Tina Marie: And I'm not trying to oversimplify him. But

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Tina Marie: That 10 million net worth is a huge thing. It's not Arbitrary number.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Tina Marie: Um for no reason. It's not for the sake of money. It's for the freedom And the protection for his family, that

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Tina Marie: It represents

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Tina Marie: So. If you find a thing that he can do well.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't trigger his Executive dysfunction.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Tina Marie: Right. He hates sales calls. There are certain types of things he hates

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Tina Marie: So it can't fall within the realm of things. He hates

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Esther: Yes.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Tina Marie: But if you can put your creativity Towards finding something that you enjoy, that can make money. That is something he has

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Tina Marie: He doesn't have to be joyful in it. He just has to not hate it.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Tina Marie: If it makes money I think that you could find something that you could both

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Tina Marie: Do. And

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Tina Marie: Have that, you know Almost like a kind of competition. Now you've got milestones. You've got things to look forward to

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Tina Marie: Things to work on those things, create joy.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah, okay.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Tina Marie: Anticipation of the future In a good thing. Milestones

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Tina Marie: Dopamine, serotonin, aka, joy. We're kind of simple chemical beings.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Esther: We are, yeah. When it comes down to it. We are

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Esther: Yeah, okay. You know um, and you know he he's

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Esther: You know him as a guy who has, and and tell me if you have to go, if you got another thing after this. But

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my daughter did just get here. So a few minutes

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Esther: Oh, okay.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Tina Marie: But go ahead.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Esther: You know he's the one with all the fun ideas, um! And I think if he if

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Esther: He or I come up with something That

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Esther: You know, and and he's been trying to do this um! Something that will get me excited And I think I have to figure out what it is that gets me excited

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Esther: Um

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Next week's homework

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Esther: You know.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Tina Marie: Brainstorm all the things that get you excited

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Esther: Huh! Yeah.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Tina Marie: Just dump it Don't overthink it. You are forbidden from overthinking or editing, or removing

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Esther: Okay.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Tina Marie: Anything that has ever excited you ever Dump it into a list.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Esther: Okay.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Tina Marie: Let's see how we can analyze that and find something

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Esther: Interesting. Okay.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Tina Marie: The very least. It'll reveal something and get us closer to it.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Esther: Okay. Alright, I'll I'll start with that

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Tina Marie: No judgment. Also, you're not allowed to judge yourself. You're not allowed to go. That's too stupid. That's too anything. It

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Esther: Okay. Uh-huh.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Tina Marie: Can't be too naughty if you get excited about something that you call naughty, or whatever I don't know

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Tina Marie: Um judge it

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Esther: Okay. Got it all right. I will make you that list. I will make that list for myself, and I will just dump dump, dump. Okay.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Tina Marie: I'll give you I'm going to give you one more reason why you can't judge it

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Tina Marie: You are not linear either. You are not

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Tina Marie: Simple. You are not

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Tina Marie: One version of you, you are multifaceted The thing that you find

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Tina Marie: Um May not.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Tina Marie: Relate to anything you're doing right now, maybe related to something Suppressed.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Tina Marie: That needs an outlet

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Tina Marie: That you have judged And deemed as not worthy of your time now, but that

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Tina Marie: Children. Are not judgmental, they are free until they're taught not to be

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Tina Marie: They believe. They love, what they love.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Tina Marie: They like what they like. They don't like what they don't like

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Tina Marie: They'll tell you truthfully until they're programmed not to. And some are programmed very, very early

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Tina Marie: But if And you were programmed probably very, very early, probably as soon as you could speak

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Tina Marie: So. This exercise may not be that great

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Tina Marie: They! If you could imagine what little girl Esther

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Tina Marie: Loved. Before she knew what judgment was.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Tina Marie: Or before she let go of it, because judgment broke it out of her

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Tina Marie: What were those things? Are there anything you've abandoned

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Tina Marie: Or devalued That

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Tina Marie: The essence of you, which is the child version of you. Loved.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Tina Marie: Could we bring some of that back for you

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Tina Marie: So that's why you can't Judge it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Tina Marie: If it pops into your head, you write it down

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Esther: Okay.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Tina Marie: Fair.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Esther: Yes. Okay.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Esther: That's fair, all right.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you, Tina.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Tina Marie: You know he's squish him You're so cute

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Tina Marie: It's cute. So beautiful, so amazing. Thank you for sharing. Ah.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Tina Marie: Talent.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Esther: I was just driving today to pick up Emmy, and I was Thinking about your story, and how you built this business for yourself, and

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Esther: You know, just like How you were taking care of your girls, and when you had no money, and I was just like

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Esther: My God. Oh, Tina's so amazing!

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Esther: I was like, how does she How did she do what she did?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Esther: Are you just Kept thinking about that

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Tina Marie: Well.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Esther: Anyway.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Tina Marie: My 2 older girls don't want anything to do with me right now, and It wasn't because of what I did for them, and how I love them. And so what it is is love and work

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Tina Marie: And those are the things that you you value. So it

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Tina Marie: Even your own children. That's what I'm trying to tell you now. It's really they're poisoned pretty much by their dad. But it can happen. I know people it comes from. There are other influences in your children's life

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Tina Marie: So you've got to be true to yourself, Esther. Because

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Tina Marie: That is all you have And when you know that you are

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Tina Marie: Being good and good as defined, is not Trying to harm or control anyone else. Right?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Tina Marie: There's nothing else There's nothing else we can do

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Tina Marie: And so it's trusting yourself And um viewing

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Tina Marie: Not. Oh, my gosh! I know you want to go see her. I will open the door in a minute. My my daughter got here, and the dogs are going nuts. Hold on one sec. I'll open the door

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Esther: Okay. Sorry. Okay.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Tina Marie: Um Ouch! Yes, I know

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Tina Marie: You know. Um

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Tina Marie: That's the only way you can be happy. But here's the thing You get to model it for them

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Tina Marie: And one day Whether they go away or not, or other people go away or not.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Tina Marie: You're going to by proxy. Give everyone around you permission to be their truest selves. And to.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Tina Marie: Do what their soul calls them to do. Because you will be doing it, modeling it.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Tina Marie: Most people aren't I,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Tina Marie: Here's how it happened. I realized I was not even living

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Tina Marie: I was afraid of dying, because my ex constantly threatened to kill me. And I just realized

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Tina Marie: Like. I'm not even living. I'm living in fear So.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Tina Marie: If you're gonna kill me, kill me. But I'm leaving And then I started to apply that same logic to everything else.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Tina Marie: The only thing I really have to be afraid of is not being true to myself. And not being happy.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Tina Marie: Work makes me happy. Purpose makes me happy. I do have a good brain, but so do you.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Tina Marie: So that was an extra gift. But really it's choice And being willing to be uncomfortable and true to myself.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Tina Marie: That's how you build the most amazing story. And that was the other thing is, I wanted an amazing story

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Tina Marie: I told Shona, be the architect of your life. She's doing amazing. Oh.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Tina Marie: I need to talk to her about tax season and stuff. Do you have a good like bookkeeper Or

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Tina Marie: Somebody who's good with books.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Esther: Yeah. We use, you know, for business

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Tina Marie: For like. Um

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Tina Marie: Uh categorizing, and then also Like expenses. What's the word

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Esther: Oh, yeah. Um.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Tina Marie: Um

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Esther: We use a service call Back office, finally

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Esther: Finally, they're they're decently priced. And they're okay. Yeah.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Esther: They're not Excellent, but they

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Esther: But they more or less get the job done. Now she's looking for a bookkeeper, not a Cpa. Right

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Tina Marie: No, I don't even know she's looking for anything. Taxes are on my mind. So I wanna make sure that she's taken care of because she's got a lot going on right now, and that's a lot to think about. So I was trying to preemptively Think about that.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Tina Marie: And just because I know that you do books of a degree like managing Billing and things like that wondered if you had a connection or

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Tina Marie: Um a good source, but we probably all need to up our game. There

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Esther: I guess it depends. Yeah, but I I guess it depends on what she needs. I know that she's working on setting up her own practice and

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know, it's essentially just um, you know, business development for her own like practice, right? Her own, her own, you know. So yeah, um, I I'm not sure like What the setup is in terms of how she is affiliated with the group, that she's affiliated with

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Tina Marie: I don't know any of it either.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Esther: At. Yeah.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I was just Uh it just entered my brain, and I didn't filter. So I'm just like

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Esther: But yes, I would imagine she, whatever she's doing, she may You know, expenses what's coming in and out

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Esther: If the group is not doing it for her, she needs She needs a she needs a way, one way or another, to know what's happening there. So

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah, maybe she's better at it than I am, cause I, my executive dysfunction goes into finances like

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Tina Marie: Whatever Make enough. I don't want to pay attention to it, but I really

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Tina Marie: Need to be better about that. So that's me. Anyway.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Tina Marie: Your list. What excites you?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Esther: Okay.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Tina Marie: No filters, no judgment.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Esther: Okay.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Tina Marie: And then just Keep contemplating this and make sure whatever you're working on is shared with me. If you create the file inside of the folder, it will automatically be shared as long as the folder is shared with me.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Esther: Yes. Yeah, usually, I just go into Google docs. And I hit new file. And then

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Esther: It just automatically actually creates in my private drive

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Tina Marie: Right.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Esther: You know, and then I have to like move it over. So I'll just have to remember to create it in the folder itself. Yeah.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. And also, you can use

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Esther: Okay.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Tina Marie: Signal. My brain is going wrong.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Esther: Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Tina Marie: And and some updates. But anyway, I am

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Esther: Thank you.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Tina Marie: This is a great week. I it's a blessing. It's a privilege for me to just to get to talk to you, and I look forward to it all the time

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Esther: Me, too. Thank you.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Tina Marie: Thank you, Esther. Have a great day. Talk to you soon
