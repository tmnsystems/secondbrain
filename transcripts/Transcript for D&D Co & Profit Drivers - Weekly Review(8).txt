Hello Hello, is this thing on?
00:00:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How is the Ryan family, this week? Big, nothing, things you'd say, things are fairly static, no freak out at home, no freak out on far. are. It's all good.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it is good.
00:00:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I just turned my heater on for the first time all year.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, all like, what do you call it here? This colder part of the year. Season, whatever it is.
00:00:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
yes.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's last winter, I should say spring because pretty much it's like winter like we have a cold season and a hot season. And yeah. Let me get into here. What's on the top of your head? What's what's the updates for the week?
00:01:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Uh, just to sort of Plugging away at everything here and there like Do something check it off. Like I did a bunch of different stuff. have to go on different things And then just to like check it off the list Uh, so it's all Oh It's best it was best you can it's uh You know, we're heading into the end of the year so like everything's about to die off So like okay, maybe I'll maybe I'll die off with it Um, wait, hold on let me go check for Stacy Stacy This is Stacy
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus my tag I'm in task. You get some sleep. Okay. I was just thinking if I owed her anything, but she just updated me that because I asked her when you get tasks like what's the point of that if you're not going to teamwork and she said that you do that she tags you and you do get the email.
00:02:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you do see when I go in like sometimes I like in a comment sometimes I go like or sometimes I just email back like yesterday I did. I did great stuff. was easier to like screenshots in teamwork, but if it's just text I'll just email back to pass whatever it is.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, let's see, load, teamwork just reset on me, that was random and weird. Like the page reloaded without me re-loading it.
00:03:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm always, like, locked out of it, locked out of it, I get this weird, like, white screens. It's like, there's the bros here.
00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You get what?
00:03:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're, like, very low, raspy down that, like, cut down. If, like, white screen, it's like, if I analogs you out and when I go back, it's always a white screen. It'll literally just hits the chrome alert if you want to wait for this and I'm like, no, I just want to want to get in like that.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm looking at the Stacey shared the Stacey Eric Dan meeting thing with me, just helpful. I'll go read where we at QA 2024, do you and have at least okay, no, you don't have Q4 rocks?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we didn't we didn't do any for Wolper was relieving, and then we didn't do any for another 71 because we're leaving things alone. And then for basis, like I'm not sure, I think I can meet with like Heather and Joe and give and just talk to them because I'm like, I got a fair word, Joe is on because my fear is that He is not going to fear. It's the truth. know I'm glad he's off building a business air quotes with Mike Kane eggs. But really what he's doing is he's making a bunch of money and building nothing. So I get it. want to go make money and you're making money. But what do you actually do when you're not building a business with this guy around AI? It almost feels like web 3.0 part two, except this time you're making money with it. But it's also a fleeting friend saying that you're probably not going to be able to make money on for years and years and years and years. Whereas this podcast that you're doing that has made your money for years and years and years that you basically turn away from again is the thing you should be building. It's the thing that you should be focusing more time. But I guess the burden of hand is like a shitload of money. The Bush is not as much money, but it's like, okay, but you have to, you have to think short term and long term. So it's like, I don't, I think he's like abandoned his whole podcast course and the whole thing. And I was like, okay, well, what is that, is that, you know, I don't want to go in and build that with him. I want to help them benefit to me is that it sells people on to basis. And if that's not what it's going to be, then I want to do it.
00:06:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm mostly got that.
00:06:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I gotta see where they're at. pretty sure that's what's happening. He's all in the bread or my cane. It's odd selling. overpriced AI training to people. Okay, great, that's good for another year or two. Like take a look at my k-nigs as businesses. They're all the same thing. Boom and bust. my God, are talking about? Hey, where are you?
00:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just got kind of like muffled when you said that. Like you said, hey, where are you? Were you? Was that referenced this or a dog or what?
00:07:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to do this.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The dog.
00:07:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. dog somehow got by me on the side of the pen. I know she's out of a porch in my face.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're slightly garbled.
00:07:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's because I walked away from my-nigs. okay. Just try to locate the barking dog.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes sense.
00:07:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I'm to do the porch or I'm going to the dark. Oh, now we're all going to do there. I don't know what's under there, but it's exciting. I'll be able to do it in a minute.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, um, Mark sent an email, actually couple of emails, you always do a walker September. Oh, you're, um, so Josh can implement that piece of reporting, we can see how that goes and looks.
00:08:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yeah. Yeah. That would really be good to have that. And then who sent that to him? Like, celebrate marketing.com. No, no, no. Go go business, new profile. do. do. do. do. do. do.
00:08:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
do. do. do.
00:08:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We do. Well, let's see.
00:09:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I lot of it with something else.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, some of the other ones. What's the case? Oh, my brain is worse than I thought it was. Okay. Um, let's see. Okay. And then Dan's old task sheet. Why? Oh. Old, but like you're still working off of it.
00:09:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's the one that we're just trying to completely get rid of everything. But there's a bunch of won't. We're crap on that. even some of that's getting done. If I, if I have my druthers, that that list will not exist by the end of the year. And it will never exist again.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Okay. All Hold on a second.
00:09:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
God, you're under there alone now.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are your parts? Yes. maybe there's a varmint vermin varmint vermin that's a lizard's part of your game why it's so weird that we have teamwork and then also this because it's just the it's an easier view work to sit on one place Stacy likes it I didn't I'm like hey if that's how you want to do it you can do whatever we feel I'm not gonna tell you how to do it but the victim is the one that you use and that works well for you period yeah so that's how she likes to do it yeah that's the thing I tell everybody which why you like trying to follow somebody else's project management system doesn't work you need to have somebody teach you the concept of managing it right which is 30,000 foot view down to the granular view, like macro micro, and following up with it on a regular basis and making sure that all things get touched. everybody's brain processes that data differently, the colors, the layout, the structure, how many clicks you have to get in between it. Oh no, let me check on this baby. Can we make it? She hasn't been to school. So last week was conferences, so there wasn't school on Thursday and Friday. And she hasn't been since Tuesday afternoon and then she went today. Yesterday, I got her up and it said, are you going to school? She goes, I need to sit. Yeah, you do. So I walked out and I closed the door. And she got dressed and she came out and we were getting ready to walk out the door. And I see tears coming down our eyes. was like, Nope. You're right. You are nice. I'm like, are you overwhelmed? Like are you sick? you 80? yeah, it was mostly sickness and exhaustion. Of course, high school is overwhelming. then she slept for about five more hours. She comes out and she goes, it's amazing what sleep can do. You're all perfect. It just changed. I'm like, yeah, then children get their like young ladies and times of month because I just, she just went to everything was wonderful and great for all the first few weeks of school.
00:12:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And then all of sudden she hated every teacher. She hated every person.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, and I should have known better than the giggle because it's very offensive when anybody else like says, well, you know, you're being hormonal because you. Excuse my mouth.
00:12:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's real.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, this is real, like real. And the perspective, it's very real. But you can't change it. And it, it's actually of, I because you tell people that f off that probably should have been told f off long time ago But anyway, so like two days later I'm I'm talking to her. I'm like, so do we need to like change the school situation? Do I need to take you somewhere else? Do we? She's like, oh no, everything's fine. I was like, oh gosh I'm like, okay I was watching uh do you know Tori emails?
00:13:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah I love her. So for some reason I was like on this Tori emails kick Two days ago, so I was like, I'm gonna listen to Tori emails And uh, the next day this do this youtuber guy that I follow our interviewer And he does like the best interviews the guy's just so into music and he's so musically knowledgeable and his interview is great Like he barely talks. He just asks great questions and they go off But at one point she launches into going through menopause. It was hilarious She's like let me tell you. And she just does this long like soliloquy on that. oh, I think she was talking about like how she wasn't writing so much because of it. She's like, it's a thing. It's, it's a lot. It's a thing. I don't, you know, it's a rite of passage. So funny.
00:14:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, funny is not the word.
00:14:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no, I know. But I'm like, I live with someone that's and doing it. It's like, it's a lot.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has she had her like lab tested and thought about hormone therapy?
00:14:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's going to said. I am, I am do, Denise does not listen to me. And like, as you know, I have been on health journey, whatever. So I do all the things like, but like Denise won't even like go to the doctor. So I'm like, you like a perfect example. She He cannot hear worth a hell out of one of the years. Like she's borderline deaf. And I go, there's no way you're hearing, like it's just weird that you're hearing just stop working. Like I guarantee you there's something blocking your ear. No, no, but I went through a doctor and he said, I go, go to the dude that I got to. My dude's great. I go to like every two years because eventually my ear get blocked with whatever. And it takes like five minutes and he does the thing. And it's like, you know, night and day will not do it. No, no, my hearing's just bad. I go, I don't believe that. I don't believe that that's the thing. Like, and shouldn't you go get that for sure? Like, known, but she won't do it. Like she went to one dude and they were like, Oh, well, I don't think it was, I don't think it was the right kind of doctor anyway. So she won't go back.
00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So then she got like, like Denise, Denise, you, I mean, like, I'm like, you're like. borderline skin cancer. I'm like, there's something you need to go get your skin like that. Like, this is not right. I've been saying it for years, literally years.
00:16:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She won't go. Who does she listen to?
00:16:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Nobody herself. So then, so anyway, I'm my new doctor. Well, I don't know if and even the last caller, the call before, I think it was the last call. She was talking about herself. He's like, Oh, No, I'm not. I'm from the program. Obviously. And he was like, yeah, like I woke up today. I like, I need to buy XYZ was off. That's how that's how tuned into it. I am. And it was off. That's like, Oh, wow. Okay. So today, it was today, or I'm going to say this. through the chair last night going to bed. You know what, if she's on the call next time, I'm going to ask her, okay, are you guys doing women now? is there, who are you using? Like, yeah, Denise would benefit from it greatly. And you might as well, you only do this thing once.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, like, what would suck worse going to a doctor or finding out that you could have felt better and you never did it. Like, I mean, it was night. The first time I took progesterone, I was slept for the first time in years. Like, just went to sleep, like a normal person. Just went to sleep. And I have not been dreaming for years. And I didn't realize that I was not having REM sleep. And it wasn't for like technology that I was like, wait a minute. And so then I started taking GABA and 5HTP. And now I'm having... the vivid dreams that I used to have. I was like, holy crap, I've been missing this for years. Anyway, bodies are crazy. But you're gonna have somebody that will that that they can listen to you. It's it's hard. It's hard to look with that.
00:18:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I have kids like that and and siblings like that and everything.
00:18:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But my sister says I'm test everything physically. Okay, so basis. I'm trying to think about because we have these disjointed conversations, but but they're it's hard to bring them back on track. But everything follows the right flow. So let me let me start with this first before I go on a basis. Any movement with another 71 in terms of your for containers and the Mercer work, the GA4, all that. I lose you. I guess I did lose you.
00:19:37 - Dan Ryan (3)
And then they got on my next step, and we should do like a moment.
00:19:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It said you were gone. I thought you were just not even on the call. I looked and it said you were not even here. So if you've been talking for the last couple of minutes, I've heard nothing. Okay.
00:19:52 - Dan Ryan (3)
Well, I was. So I'll recap now that I'm back. So over there, like the container. Peter's done over that, right? I'm not going to change it. So I am going to, the one that a tele-built is custom for that and it works well for that. What I thought was I could use that to build the one for basis, and I can't. That's why base is what I'm building. It's a standalone, and the plan is to use the first version of it on for make sure it's all working on a workflow, and then from that I should end up with like a basis container. So I'm to send you one side that's, I just keep figuring out like what events I need to find periods, and we should add that new customer event, which I don't think is working correctly. So now I just need to go in there and like match up, or mismatch up data, and see if things are tracking correctly. But my plan is, I just want to have that all done by the end of the year. So, you know, huge washing.
00:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:21:07 - Dan Ryan (3)
Oh my God. Why is your face covered with dirt?
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, I'm telling you, there's something. There's an animal that your dog is trying to get to.
00:21:18 - Dan Ryan (3)
They both came out covered with the mouths covered with dirt. Yep. Good stuff.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm asking her if she can make it through the thing. She says, I don't know. And I just told her I'll be done at noon, which is lunchtime. And so she could escape without having to get permission from the school. But they've had a whole thing. they almost shut it down because so many teachers were sick. And then I hadn't got a response because I was sending emails about her absence. And then I get an email today. She goes, yeah, I've been out sick too.
00:21:54 - Dan Ryan (3)
For the last few days. Yeah, everyone was sick right now.
00:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but. be taking my activated silver like three times a day, I feel like I'm aware that I don't have as much energy as normal, although it's just also been clouding with me, which pretty much always does that to me. But I don't feel like I got sick one day and I slept and then that was it. I'm like that silver and immunoglobulins, which is the thing that's in colostrum that's actually useful without all the dairy. So I won't begin to say that well. Anyway, okay, so once I have those containers done by the end of the year and that's just part of basis. Before I get to basis, let's talk about them a little bit and just how that's gone over the last week.
00:23:00 - Dan Ryan (3)
You're breaking up again. That's me.
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:23:08 - Dan Ryan (3)
I know. You broke up. was like, I didn't get that.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mom, what's happened since last week? Hello, Dan. Ah, what is going on here? Hello. I hear, like, What the heck?
00:23:58 - Dan’s iPhone
Hello. Hello. Oh, I think it's because I'm outside. It's Cleaners Day. So I'm using the Wi-Fi except I'm outside above the house, very far away from the indoor road or so switching my phone on a data.
00:24:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. So this mom, any movements last week, any evolution in the project, and I spoke to you?
00:24:22 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, so I got this. This we got a domain app inside a fan flowy, this new mass tagger thing inside a fan flow is also done. I, Norio's working on this other, we'll just call it an app. It's a, Norio finished this one app, which was this album track and look up app that we used in this console, API. And then he's going to automate this other. It's all that's supposed to do it like onboarding. So he's going to automate this other step that doesn't exist. So basically what's going to happen is when someone has a new release, we have them fill out a new release form. The new release doesn't actually exist in Apple or in Spotify or whatever until the actual release date comes around. So we don't have a link to the Spotify song because there is no link to Spotify. So right now when they do onboarding, they have a latest release. Well, that's a song that's already out that is their latest, right? you couldn't run a year ago. Who cares? doesn't matter. So once they do a new release, we want that to become their latest release after the song is actually on Spotify and Apple or whatever. So what Norio is going to do is like, hey, if someone submits a new release form, it's going to trigger new release forms and then it. With that, there's a date, which is the date that the distribution service, whoever it is, says, yep, your son is going to hit Spotify and Apple and BumblePaw on this date. Is things going to wait till the next day? And then say, okay, I know the name of the song, I know the name of the artist, now I'm going to go do the look up in this API that we're using for this other stuff, and it should be that it gets a result. And if it gets a result, then it will go make that the latest release in the database, all these fields, and that's that. And then I thought, I might have saw it twice, and it's just Tuesday. then I are working well. So we did this domain thing. We did this map. it's a texture thing that's part of the new release automation and then he is working on let's see Gator. Oh, we're creating a URL rewrite creator basically.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is this?
00:27:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Bob?
00:27:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's SOD?
00:27:24 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, they're they're the company that I've found that doesn't arm all and high level and they kill it. The dude's awesome. We had a meeting today and I like oh my god why didn't I think of that? Like he figured that out within minutes. I'd been effort with this for like weeks. Took two stabs at him like how are they doing this? goes maybe they're doing explicit.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The second he said I was like I'll handle that's exactly what they're doing. What company is that? What company is SOD?
00:27:58 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. They're called J.D.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
he funnels. Oh, it is them.
00:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone
I was gonna ask.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:28:04 - Dan’s iPhone
So, but it, you started telling me what he was doing, but I was like, who is that? So I can't even take my notes. Like, uh, so now he's doing a, so what we teach, again, this is part of onboarding, like, onboarding is the biggest sort of hurdle or like getting people using the software and getting my product, right? But we want them to give us all this data. we're trying to simplify the creation or the retrieval thereof, right? So, the apps that Noreo made before and what other people do is like, you have to go look up your song and look up your URL and look up your whatever. And now we're like, nope, just search for your song here. We're gonna go grab everything. So another thing that we teach them is like, um, hey, you like give us your, and this, this is trying to solve this one way. So, I'm going to go forward and then I'm going to go backwards. So, now we tell them, hey, know, go put this, put your opt-in link everywhere. So, put it on your Facebook page, put it on your Instagram, put it your TikTok, put it on your X. So, but what they're doing is they're, they, to do it correctly, they need to put this URL that's, you know, tinaband.com slash, or t-band.com slash question mark equals source equals Facebook, right? And I'm like, guys, they're never going to do that. That's never going to work. So, Saad is going to create a URL, a URL rewriter, creator. So, basically, I don't know if there's even going to be a form. Like, him and I went around or wrong with it. Usually what I do with him is like, we sit there and scope it out, and then he throws his ideas out. and then we're like, all right, go and then he'll come back with something and then I'll be like, okay, change it, tweak it. Oh, that's fine. Whatever. he's either going to come back with a form or he's going to come back with like a partial form because some of this data is already in their account. So like, we already know their URL, but we don't know the URL of their funnel, let's say, or their, their op-in. So they might have to provide us with that. And then once they do that, they could submit, it's going to go create all these short links, tineban.com slash FB, tineban.com slash IG, tineban.com slash X. But then those are actually URL rewrites inside of the level because they have a URL rewrites section. then the underlying rewrite is going to have slash FB is going to underneath and have question mark source equals Facebook. But then we'll just say, here, your, here, your URL. else, but the Facebook one on Facebook, Instagram, Instagram. And then there's no way that they can break the traffic.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:31:08 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:31:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There, that should really blow them away as long as you're highlighting the value of that.
00:31:17 - Dan’s iPhone
And, you know, yeah, we did.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then we show them this summit.
00:31:21 - Dan’s iPhone
This is how many Facebook views. So then when that comes in, we tagged on this Facebook. And then we could say that, that new fan from Facebook. And or, right, if it's a Facebook app, we know it's a Facebook app, which is just a word.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you ever like create? I mean, because it feels like this is an outreach program that you could do by going to look for all the artists on Spotify and then going from looking for people who don't have these things. And then like scrape their rumpo and reach out to them and be like, Hey, wait a minute, you're way ahead of you.
00:31:59 - Dan’s iPhone
That's of course you are. want you to go scrape all those URLs, and then I want you to data enrich these by going and getting their Spotify URL, getting their average monthly streams on Spotify, getting their latest release, getting there, whatever sort of stuff. So I think I had them do 300 of those, and getting charged manually, will be sent to record, something like that. So now we have this cold email list where mark, so now you take that list, which is in G sheet, load that up into gmass, which is this gmail mass email that you can have read, read it cheap, and then it will go use a template and say, Hey, this is Mark from Red13 Studios, I was checking out your stuff, check it out your latest crack in search track name that we have. I see that you know, you know, you're active on Instagram, right? Because I got their last Instagram post. So I can look at the sheet and say, okay, this person is active on Instagram right now. Their last song is this. This is their email address, pop up, pop up whatever. And then basically the plan would be to have Mark do some sort of cold outreach and see what happens.
00:34:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:24 - Dan’s iPhone
And then I did it and I go, okay, I, I didn't reach the records a little differently now. So maybe it'll cost me 45 cents and 50 cents. So my plan is to. So what happened is like, once they did that, I could see like, Oh, well, this one's incomplete, that one's incomplete. I saw from the errors, whatever. So now I'd go back to them and say, Hey, I will pay you 50 cents a record to get me a complete record. And this is what a complete record look like. And then just be like, just get me a hundred of those a week until
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
until you stop that would be awesome to see how that goes oh yeah so if you can I mean these are like targeted potentially targeted later so it's just matter of like how that you know you've sent them to the book clonnell send them to send giving the release like give them whatever give them something invite them to the community yeah it would be and it's endless god knows how many freaking needs that is this is crazy that this is all finally coming together and it's it came from it came from like there is no perfect origin well no you well whatever it was it was when you decided you're going to hire people to do the work and you're not going to like wait for them like you're going going to build what you build, and they can come along or not.
00:36:05 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, it was when I decided, yeah, it's when I decided, well, we're going to do my idea now.
00:36:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:36:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Funny how that happens. My big, you know, my yearly epiphany, that was this year's epiphany. it's like, true. I'm like, as I look around, I'm like, I got to get rid of these projects out in that line.
00:36:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because look, I mean, there's only so much time and energy we have, but look at the legs that are growing on this thing right now.
00:36:37 - Dan’s iPhone
But I don't.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, there's, I mean, you've done ad campaigns, but I don't think you've done cold marketing outreach. And but this is perfect for it, because those people are like, I don't know what to do. I need somebody to come like, you know, let's say nobody's coming to save you just kidding. Red 13. We're coming to save you. Like in our world, we get hammered by stupid, you know, LinkedIn scrapers and whatever, and we're just like, get freaking lost, right? But artists, they don't, they don't know. They just want to make their music. some of them might know they might have a nerdy somebody, but for the most part, they're just like, I just want to make music.
00:37:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, so that's what I went over with Mark on Monday, right? I'm actually going to work on this a bill today. So on Monday, you know, I was just sort of poking around. We got a new band that came on, right? Eric and I were sitting at the office and he got the notification, like, we got notifications, like, from a high level, it's like, oh, you're someone so phone number is approved. So he pulled up the band and we like looked at their website, like, oh my god, they're, Eric goes, is this the template? I don't know. But what do you think is the template right or what? He's like, dude, this could be the template that you had made. go, I know. There's like one thing. handsight. That's all there needs to be. So it wasn't the template. And then we're listening, know, they had the site literally, it was like they followed the template that is almost coming. And I was like, oh, okay, let me listen to whatever. And then I go, okay, watch this. Like I go to their Spotify, I'm going to guess their last song was 18 months ago. Eric's like, I got to say a year. log on two years. then put out a song in two years. And so I became one of the things I was like, I got to bring that up in the call Monday. So when I was on the call with Mark in the Monday, I go, why aren't they putting out music? Like, that is the biggest problem. Like, do we know why? And he, you know, he has like anecdotal stuff. And I go, okay, that we just need to start asking everybody that because we need to understand why they're not doing it. Is it a cost issue? Is it like, what is it? I don't know what it is. Is it just that they don't have time? But that to me is like the biggest thing and I think if you You have to just train them like this is you've got to be putting out music Period so like if you can help them if you can identify the hurt building can help them get over it. Yeah, part part like I'm do I did that scrape in in a Reddit that I'm still Recategorizing and then the number one thing in there as far as I could tell is nobody has a strategy They're all just executing tactics and it's like this thing will work. It will absolutely work And these people will be better for it becomes a bit And flowy
00:40:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's just, I'm just thinking, it's funny, you know how you can have like instantaneous thoughts, but like a span a whole long time, and I'm thinking about just starting our conversations and being a jig-in and like all these, these different evolutions, um, whoa, there's a meeting space, um, the more, this is, this is, this is universally true, but so often overlooked. The more you get off your plate, the faster things go. Usually it isn't so much that, um, we don't know what to do is that we're doing too many of the wrong things, um, that get in the way of doing the best things. But you can't know what that is immediately and it takes experience and insight and epiphanies and, you know, it's just the pace of life. It's the dawning of awareness. And I love that phrase because you think about like how the sun comes up. It doesn't just pop up boom, in the sky, you know, our awareness increases, including of the value of what we're doing, how we're doing it, who we're doing it with all of those types of things. So like this couldn't have happened any faster. But the awareness that you have has universal application. So you get to apply all of that knowledge of this is the type of thing that gets in my way. This is a type The person that gets in my way, this is the type of theme that distracts us, blah, blah, every time something comes across your plate as an idea or an opportunity, you now have this filter of experience and wisdom to instantaneously and probably somewhat subconsciously as well as consciously go, yeah, no. Or, yeah, that's perfect and here's why.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm beyond even that.
00:42:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm done.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm done. I'm like, someone hit me up yesterday and I was like, yeah, no, I don't want to do it. I think I'm now at this place where I will talk to someone about like I always have. I'll talk to you about whatever, but like I have zero interest in doing new projects. literally have zero interest in doing someone else's idea. Yeah.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because now I learn like that's just, it's never going to go great.
00:43:06 - Dan’s iPhone
It's not even that. It's that I did it. I think I did it all to get to where I am now. And it's like, okay. To your point a minute ago, right? I would have never, I would have never, ever, ever signed up for high level. If it wasn't for Francesca's business. Because I didn't need to text somebody back. I didn't, you know, I didn't lean off. I want to phone funnel. There was no version of my business that ever needed that. But because hers needed it, I found that solution. I adopted it way early, way before all these other people. And then learned it. And when I was able to take that learning and roll it into helping Mark out and then roll it into helping Red 13 out. And then it all told me rolled into this. What we've built on fan flowing now, like my ability to find sod. Oh, like, if I had to start, if we had started family in February and said, oh, here's this too high level, and we were still learning our learning high level, we'd be nowhere right. Yeah, it was the five years of me already knowing high level and building and breaking and whatever, that allowed us to move so fast. They're like now going forward, I'm like, I don't need something new. Um, or the something new has to come from something that already exists, right? Like with another 71, the something news or CPE and CMA, like both of them, we're selling CPE every week now. We're selling CMA every week now. And I was like, oh, look at that. The something news or just an extension of something that was well, if the something news or an extension of mom and family, which is, you know, something, the same thing, that's fine. Do that, right? don't go build something new.
00:44:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I was having that conversation with Maria because So, one of the things, I told her to do two things. I told her to write a pedigree post, and the- It's all that I saw post. The word pedigree just came in my head, but I guess it's an authority post, whatever. It wasn't somebody else's language and words, but what I wanted her, so the thing that she kept telling me about is all these people are trying to get her for these like dirt cheap prices and they want her time for free and they just aren't valuing her properly. I'm like, okay, so the issue is, you've been marketing low ticket, low ticket, low ticket, and guess what the association is with you? You are low ticket. I said, so you need to shift that, but she had been stuck in her head with so many different things. I'm like, I think, because she would be like, she'd tell me, sorry, she goes, I forgot I did that. She'd tell me another story. I forgot I did that. I'm like, okay, you need to remember who you are. You need to remember what you've done. You need to remember what you're capable of. And then you need to go let everybody else know because these people that you let, you know, kick your tires and waste your time, um, you need to just have something to be like, go read this and then come back, you know, because I've, I've, but as she's been doing that, she's been shifting her conversation from $1,000 offers and $2,000 offers to $15,000 all for, you know, 90 days and I'll do this and this and this for you. And, you know, with St. John reached out to her, this like, whatever, mindset kind of coach and writes books and things like that. And so higher level people are, are reaching out to her. Anyway, but the thing that I, so the, the other thing which we've talked about is that she's, well, okay, so the other assignment was, I also want you to go and make a basically like table of contents kind of like document all of the different programs that you have that you've created that you own because she's created tons of them. She had a social media certificate training before. Kate Funk or anybody else like 2010.
00:47:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, anyway, and she's like, like, she showed it to me and it was beautiful.
00:47:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, holy crap, I didn't even know that that existed. And she was like, I was a trending search term for a while. I'm like, okay, so anyway, you need to go write down all these things. Well, she did that. And then she's like, you know what I realized is like, I am always hopping around from one thing to another. And she's looking at like Amy Porterfield and other people like that. she goes, Amy came after me doing this kind of stuff. If I had just stayed in my lane, like, I could be there. Like, I get that. And there is value in that and you have that awareness. Now I said, but here's the other thing is you are a generalist. Because you've bounced around, you have an understanding and nuance of all of these different things that are actually really valuable and allow you to speak to different people. And so it's part of the thing that I have is that I did copywriting. I did development on a low level like editing PHP scripts, know, like basically figuring out how to do everything. Graphics, copy, development, marketing, splits, I was saying like I've done all the things so I have an understanding of it. But the reason it's really helpful though is because it helps me in hiring good people. It helps me in knowing how to communicate with them and helps me in managing them which is actually where my best value has been is in systems and teams and making sure that that we don't create system that, you know, pisses off talent because their brains don't work that way, that type of thing. Like I wouldn't have evolved into what I am if I didn't do all the different things that I did and I have more joy in it. So I said but now like I stay in this lane of growing businesses but it's sustainable growth and it's through systems and teams and basically, you know, the word I came in my head is in the sizing that has the wrong word on my CEOs but like you know like helping them stay focused but also remember who they are and stay mindful of them and and poke and prod a little bit because nobody else is really doing that and I said but I also have the desire for the shining and I said so and I but to not let myself play and explore would be I'm very curious so but the way that I do it is mostly with technology so I look at different technologies I look at different platforms it's still staying in my lane because it all has relevance to what I'm doing with other people so like if I want to explore in high level it's not the best use of my time at all but it's valuable knowledge and understanding and it helps me have more informed questions which is the poking and prodding part kind of thing right and also understanding potential market shifts and things like that, which is relevant to everything I do. So I don't do it, I don't spend a lot of time in it. But it lets me feel like, ooh, that was fun, you know, and have some kind of variety in the conversations. And so I said, for her, I said, like, you know, if we're doing a thing together, and at the end of the day, this is the other, like, I've known this, but I haven't really spoken it out loud to many people. Like, I told Dexter too, I'm like, I, when the girls are grown, like, I don't, I, I've never cared about building a brand or business. I've never had this big vision of this company or whatever. Like, I do know that I'll probably write a book or a few books only if anything, just to get it out of my brain, but, and tell the stories that, that people, whatever, I feel that. But, but, I'm reading this book now, and it's Clayton M. and then it's the prosperity complex and that's I think what made it really clear for me is that all of these things that I do and all of these skills that I have, my joy and my happiness and even my own prosperity has just come from imparting it to other people, right? don't, I don't, I'm very comfortable talking in front of people and I can and I know that there's value in it but I have no desire to do it like but I have been put in positions even as a teenager in like public speaking or whatever but I don't have any, I would rather just go like to Africa or some other country or even just like you know inner city stuff and teach people how to be self-provident, teach them the systems and the optimization and the thoughts and the organization and the structure and how to stay focused and do all the things right but I don't, I don't care if it's my company, don't care if it's a business, don't even care if I get paid, I'd rather have my money be making me money and go serve like for the rest of my life. I told him like I don't really want to retire. I don't want to stop but I really don't also want to do it as business like in the I have to do it to earn money. I just want to have me anyway. So I was explaining that to her and I'm like so you and I for a few years if you were to stay in your lane and but you still want to play and be excited so she gets excited about YouTube but she does YouTube like nobody else not nobody else definitely people do it but a very small majority of it right. She checks the algorithms for everything she looks at the trending data she looks at all of that and she builds something like like she basically applies SEO type strategy to it right like what is being looked for what's the competition what's being underserved and then goes and creates that stuff and she optimizes like SEO kind of video. optimizes each of the videos. But it's fun for her. So for the couple of hours or whatever week that she spends in it, it also has this compounding effect of bringing in targeted people that are reaching out to her. And they're even better than these, you know, people that have been watching her with low ticket and all that other stuff. I'm like, but if you had a variation of what you're doing to scale, like high level scale, like for mom, you know, there could be some higher level clients that are like, you know what, I hate these labels. I don't want anything to do with them. I want somebody that makes this more like boutique type label where you're we're working as personal. I'm getting to go to the venues. I want to go to the venues. I'm getting to make the kind of music that I want to make. You know what I mean? Like working at the pace that I want to buy if the artist is having kids or whatever, like all these different things. So you can serve people at at different levels based on their skill and and with their prices and anyway the happiness level but also staying in your lane but also because most entrepreneurs have this kind of ADD like I need to explore and be curious and anyway like you're I feel like you're getting into that and I think that's the sweet spot for anybody that doesn't have this desire to have this mammoth corporate type business or this massive ego go ahead and but I don't know if you caught that I do dude don't have it like people could be happy and still serve a whole variety which is diversification also in a way right because it's different levels of the market but yeah anyway yeah long thing go up
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Don't get Maria raising her Bryson's too fast. I still need to come back there.
00:55:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, it's a very specific offer, and yeah, sorry.
00:55:13 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I'm sorry.
00:55:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll be like, dance the reason we even met each other, so click slowly.
00:55:18 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, and I'm going to come with everything dumb.
00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want her to run the ads. I just don't want to run ads. Yeah. Well, I mean, she's thinking about even that because she does like doing ads and she's good at it, but the industry standard for ads is not unreasonable at all. It's just most of them suck and they waste your money because it's a flat E and a percentage to run the ads. I think that that would whatever like 1,500 a month or running the ads plus until you get a certain level of percentage of ads, then whatever, but.
00:55:55 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, the problem is they up in this, you know, Jenny Duros, I'll say they just bring. and broken funnels.
00:56:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And then you have no control over the funnel and you're like, what am I doing here?
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. Like if it's like your, your, it's like, Jenny was doing something the other day. There's this one offer that's this movie offer. It's kind of a crazy offer, but it crushes. And I think she ran like 1,000 ad spends. And then they were like, Hey, we're not getting any webinars on it, whatever. Something was right. And she goes, what are you talking about? Like how do you even rush? did someone change the funnel? Oh, well, you know, we, we added a step and it was like, oh my God. Are you like, how stupid are you?
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, they never told her. He's $20,000 bonfire right there.
00:56:53 - Dan’s iPhone
Just burn her money. Literally, just totally lit it on fire. And then they were like, and she's there, you know, of course, then it's her fault.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she's like, no.
00:57:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I didn't change the final. And also, why would you change this? What what prompt to do? Yeah, that that's sort of an issue with running out.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would also tell her too that the best part about working with you is percolating ideas and well, I mean, besides you just being awesome. But the you know, like it's a you're as sharp in your soft kind of person. Like, that's the thing about all the clients I work with and things I was trying to tell her is that like I get paid to serve, but I'm also like, I'm enriched every single time I have a conversation with one of my clients. I'm like, it's mutual and it's a good exchange. I'm like, you know, most people don't get that. So she can have that anyway. I think she's awesome. I got you. I got you. We won't have a business because yeah, she should be. I mean, that would just be cool.
00:57:59 - Dan’s iPhone
Anyway. And this should work because it's literally based Alan's like build this. I was like, all right, I'm gonna if this guy's all he says he is, then I've got the offer. So we'll see.
00:58:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, if what Alan?
00:58:14 - Dan’s iPhone
So the book funnel is based on Alan's ultimate. Like someone, yeah, she coached with him or whatever.
00:58:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, no, she's in his paid group.
00:58:26 - Dan’s iPhone
So yeah. And she recommended her. That's how I found her because he gave her props with her emotional blah, whatever it was. And then that's how that's how I got into her. And she brought a post or something. think it's interesting. But so it's like, it's, it's right off her alley and it's, and it's the funnels that she's always talking except it just won't be on click funnels. That's gonna really miss it.
00:58:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and she's getting off that too. Yeah, I feel like I have Um, I kind of been cleansing her of the bro marketing film and fills them.
00:59:06 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:59:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's definitely been up in that world for a long time, but, um, hold on, I mean, I just, I love the evolution of where this music is going, especially because it's music. Like, I can't even think, I mean, seven years ago, like, music was almost no part of the conversation. Three, four years ago. to me, this is like, I know cool things with cool people. I know you like business, I know you like tech and all that stuff, but like, those serving music is just, it's like, angels and light from heaven just like, it's, it's so cool because also, I mean, not just in the joy that I can give to you, but they're going to be.
01:00:00 - Dan’s iPhone
artist and you're just going to be and I don't mean in a sacrilegious way but like a savior like because you know what it's like it's you don't you don't know huh it's so funny like listed you I've I know I've said this to you I've definitely said in the past I would never go teach someone the basics and that's exactly what I'm planning on doing here because the someone's I wouldn't teach or the someone's everyone else teaches yes I don't want to go be a business coach but here it's like I'm marrying the business coaching inside and it's also not me right there's that part but I was like oh yeah I mean you're literally going in it we're going to be teaching them the most basic but it's like as we know from frickin the hormones these yeah the fundamentals is where it's at like people buy the fundamentals like that I don't know anything about the fundamentals from the harmosies I know what because I know I'm just saying That's all they're selling. Nothing.
01:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything they do is so basic.
01:01:05 - Dan’s iPhone
But it's because I watched a video.
01:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so annoyed that you just got the fundamentals from fricking them.
01:01:12 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I'm just saying that look at what they're they have such a huge business now and all they're really doing is teaching the fundamentals. And it's like to a starving audience. Now granted, they're doing that via a we made 40 million bucks. And that's why it's interesting to me to see people just fawn all over them. And I'm like, you're not really fawning over their knowledge though.
01:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're fawning over what they achieved.
01:01:43 - Dan’s iPhone
That doesn't mean you're going to get it. But what is interesting about that is they give that opinion more weight when it's like that fundamental was true this whole time. It's not more true because it's coming out of his mouth. but you're acting as if it's a greater truth. So I watched this dude, this dude didn't how.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
reason I was being a fundamental.
01:02:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. I watched this guy. He went and did like the 5K weekend or whatever. And then he was like, he gave the breakdown and then we went, oh, I got the one on time with Alex. And then he starts talking about the one on one time and I'm like, oh my God, like you didn't realize any of this before you spent $5,000 sitting in room and have someone tell you this. Like, okay, but I mean, dude, it was like like down on marble head. This dude was just like a changed person. I was like, you know what? If he, if his business better out because of it, he probably was five grand well spent and he probably would have never gotten there.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that is to my point of people can only hear who they can hear. And you are speaking your own unique language and other people are like, I speak that language, but I don't know what the language is called and I don't know who speaks. speaks it. just by putting content out, you put out that signal, like, here I am. And finally, somebody's like, whoa, I understood that word. What was that? know, but it's, it's, it's ingrained in us from youth, because I was having this conversation with somebody about kids. And they were talking about, and maybe, maybe it was you, maybe it was last week. But like, I would tell my kids and teach them something and then they'd come home from school, like they'd never heard it in their lives. And I've been telling it to them forever.
01:03:33 - Dan’s iPhone
And like, that wasn't me, but yes, I've learned that.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you just say to me? Like, they come home excited telling me this. And I'm like, you, you, I like you kidding me. I can't believe and they loved the knowledge and they loved the wisdom. I'm like, your mom has been telling you that your whole life. And then you come in here, you're going to give this teacher this credit. And it's just that we don't hear certain things presented certain ways at certain times is that saying you know when the student is ready the teacher appears and yes to that you're never going to teach the newbies but this is a whole different thing this is not this I mean this business but it's musicians and yeah anyway I'm just loving it so much holy crap it's so before I better check on my daughter and make sure she's not buying but I love this evolution so much and it's it's amazing to me too and and it actually is kind of a testament to the future success and the prediction of there will be success is that you've been able to get these guys to show up with some kind of consistency in working and applying and organizing and structure to towards us. And yeah, I think that you'll be able to because you're removing all the friction points to the point of like, the thing you need to do most is get the crop out of the way. All these people are spending time doing the wrong things. And so when you show them what the right things are, they won't even have any interest in the wrong things, because the right things will get them traction so fast. And anyway, I mean, this is just like the epitome of cool things with cool people, Dan.
