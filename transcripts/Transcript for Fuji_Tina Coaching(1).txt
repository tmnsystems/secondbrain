Hello. Oh, you're muted.
00:00:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hello.
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you?
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. It's been a hectic morning. up and got straight to work. Between babysitting puppy and cleaning up puppy messes and dealing with dogs fighting over each other, because my poodle has become very possessive of him. And so, having knees gets anywhere near him. She's like, I will murder you. And then tries to. It's not prepared for that one.
00:00:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Life with dogs.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Have you been, how was Christmas?
00:00:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Very good. Yeah. It's been a relaxing week. We just spent Christmas at our house, because my, usually we go to my parents, but their room was getting renovated. Everyone came here for Christmas is nice.
00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Breaking the new house with some family memories.
00:01:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yep.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Well, I did review the call. Well, actually, I had chat TPT review the calls, but now that I want to go for it. Were they all messages?
00:01:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
one of them was a message and then I got through to like one, two people. One of them was I was going to bring it up with you. They're like, oh, yeah, we're going use your stuff. It's really good. We're going to keep using you. And I was like, in my head, was like, should I? Is this where I should just shut up and be like, okay, thank you. And then hang up for. I don't know what to do with that kind of call. I've had a couple like that and it feels like either they want to just get me off the phone so they're telling me what they like, what I want to hear.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you kind of have to. each them. But one of those things could be great.
00:02:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is there anything that I could do to make the service more valuable to you? And they're like, nope, nope, you guys are great. You guys get my reports in quick and you schedule them quick.
00:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're really happy with your service. I have you like, well, thank you for your business.
00:02:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And if there, you know, if you ever need anything, hit me back up that kind of thing.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. What what I'll do is it was interesting to me because based off of the conversation we had going through, okay, um, so you would say, I would say this type of thing, and then I would be like, well, you could be more confident or more clear that type of thing. that TBT said some of the same things. So I'm going to share this with you or share my screen. And, um, you know, like, we all have things that we can improve on, but also we have to remember like, AI and not even that, but Some people will advise us to do things that aren't necessarily a good match for us and our personalities. So any feedback you get, you have to take with a grain of salt and just be like, I accept this. I'm going to filter out that. don't agree with it. So please always stay true to what you feel good about. We can always test things. So this is the wrong thing. I really need pay attention to what I'm doing. There we go. I don't normally share my screen. Am I sharing the right thing? I am. Okay. Call review feedback. Okay. So I gave it all the text, gave that and a little info breakdown about who you are and what you're doing. I do also want to run it through Claud because they both give different feedback and there's always a little something that one leaves out that the other picks up on. Okay. So this one, polite, National Express gratitude, Tom was warm, but lacked assertiveness to emphasize the value he could bring. So that was just the one thing. And then we can go back and look at the text to see if it was food. You mentioned a prior relationship with the firm. I think it would have been the other way around, right?
00:04:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Based off. Oh, yeah. No, was a different example with Lilliana.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I remember this call. Yeah. So improvements mentioned specific benefits or outcome that the firm could gain from working with you again at urgency. See, this is a, you know, that's kind of a high sales tactic that probably wouldn't want to do and then avoid the lengthy explanations about past case managers that may not be. Yeah.
00:04:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, yeah, that was the call I mentioned. Oh, I used to work with Diana at your firm, but I haven't got any referrals and she was like, oh, yeah, Diana left the year ago. I was like, oh, OK.
00:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I don't think that's irrelevant. So that's the thing, know, I'd like, is that it was at something we should have said. I don't know because now you know Diana doesn't work there.
00:05:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Now you know why you don't get anything.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that that's actually helpful. Let's see. The conversation seems slightly meandering, which might reduce impact. So with nine plus sources. Is that what it's called?
00:05:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't remember who this one was.
00:05:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So call number two. Let me go to downloads number two. We power leaned a new flex looking for different providers. Let's see. Trying to see if I can find any identifiers. Mark Montano.
00:05:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Mark, I need to look at my hub spot again. Remember that when we see Do a lot of Jana what's called a mark Jen oh Jen yeah Jen Vargas oh Mofo oh Mofo la Oh Mo Foma Oh Mo Foma Okay, so I think that that's what number two was so when it said the tone was warm, but lacked a stir. That's for Luleana.
00:06:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no Yeah, I'm I done. Um, yeah meandering Okay.
00:06:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, let's see.
00:06:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did I Then we have to let it and see if we agree with it Right not just take it You Um, let's see, actually, no, say, thank you. Do you have a face to issues with your, um, finding an initial resource, uh, consult for your clients?
00:07:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I have a problem with my .
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let's see. You just kind of busy this works. Um, It's kind of hard to understand from the transcript. Oh, let's see. Um, so, and it's A, B, A, so I don't know who's listening. How are you doing? thanks for taking my call. Okay. So you're a B. Um, because we're working with paraleons and new flex on looking for different providers.
00:07:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, that's her. Yeah, that's, that's Jen saying that.
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, also can we redirect any information about the scheduling of our client to you?
00:08:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Absolutely you can.
00:08:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, yes, that'd be perfect. We prefer working directly with you.
00:08:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's me.
00:08:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Gave your email. Email is okay.
00:08:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Info at here.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I think that the transcription missed some things.
00:08:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How do you feel that call in? I thought that was pretty good. Actually, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Sent me one after this call. Yeah, Jen sent me one. Uh, oh, sorry. What, no, she sent me an email today. But she didn't send a new client. did, um, so she sent When did I talk? is on the 23rd. okay. she hasn't sent me anyone yet, but yeah, I thought the talk went well with her. It was pretty friendly.
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so...
00:09:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that sent me a new client though.
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, it's hard to figure out with that. Okay, so do you ever face issue trouble finding initial consult? Actually, no, because yeah, I don't have any problem because I just reached out and I think last week and working with one of our clients appointment and I just can't. I feel like the transcription is just wrong enough that I can't understand what happened.
00:09:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, yeah.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which means the feedback they would get either from me or AI is not going to be really good.
00:09:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
do you have the recordings or just transcriptions? I have the recording too.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go ahead and send that over? And then what I want to do is compare your calls with what happens. It's definitely going to be a lot of work for a little while. But from here, we can probably really dial in the approach and figure out what works best. And maybe like we were talking about before, kind of profiling so that when you start talking to people, know, okay. This is how I need to handle this type of person.
00:10:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh.
00:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does that make sense?
00:10:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I don't know where this call is. Okay. I don't know which one it is. Oh, here. No, Jamie. How do I send this to you?
00:10:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Share.
00:10:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll try emailing it, I guess.
00:10:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. See if that works.
00:10:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I've tried running this through chat GPT. And I don't believe chat. APT was able to analyze this mp4a file or m4a.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know what this file format is. Let me go let's go look at this um and chat gpt listen to audio files. I don't think so let's say mp3 mp4 and peg m4a.
00:11:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And 4a that's what this is. Okay I just emailed it to you. Oh that's interesting but why I try to run it through it didn't work.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder if it depends on the model it is.
00:11:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Maybe.
00:11:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Jenna Ophoma. Okay so can I download that? Save the downloads folder. Here is the audio number for me. you can attach it up a file. Open, see if you can and extract different data than the trend script we provided. Please listen for tone and analyze that as well. Alright, this is model 4.0, I'm interested in running it through model 01 pro error analyzing. Yeah, that's what I It won't even take it there and then let me try the online version in case the desktop is different. Did you do a desktop or online?
00:13:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I didn't. Oh, I don't even, didn't even other than a desktop version.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
00:13:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What's a desktop version do?
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's where you can, well, it looks like you can do that with the online one too. You can just be there listening so you just don't have the browser going. They're not really super different before the audio version that you could talk to was only on desktop.
00:13:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But it looks like it's on. Oh, yeah. my car rides, I set it up on my iPhone app and I just like talked to it.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What audio, file types, and you know. Well, listen to it. It's going to be a while home. Open a new tab. Let me see. Pro mini audio types in the online lives. MP3, wave, AIF, WMA. So let me convert it. I think I still have audacity. Opening. And then close on me. I'm to throw this M-A.
00:15:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can we run through something that I need? I need to get addressed.
00:15:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK. So I'm trying to redo the brain MRI website. the web developer is asking for the final copy. So I wanted to go through that with you and just get your thoughts on what the website, the wording, the is going to say for the first draft. And I told Esther, we don't need to have the exact wording, but I need to have what wording I want that I'm going to have. For instance, I need to tell the web developer, I want to list here. Over here, I want to paragraph. So I wanted to go through this with you for my website, for the brain MRI's, because the developer guy needs it.
00:15:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Do you want to share screens or?
00:16:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I'm to share on the screen with you. Oops, how does that work? Does that do that? Oh, yeah. OK, so this, oh, this is perfect. You know, you haven't seen this in a while. So I'll just let you look at it, then you just let me know what your thoughts are. Oh, that's as big as it gets. Can you see?
00:16:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not seeing your screen.
00:16:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:16:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, hold on. There we go. Oh, Zoom must have changed their interface again now, because, yeah. Oh, because I was sharing. Yeah, it did change it, though, so I shouldn't. That's so weird. Yeah, that looks like someone's already sharing. And request to share this. that's one participant at a time. Well, that'll help me not make errors.
00:17:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I think I might have stopped or share though. Sorry, overall, I'll share it.
00:17:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
right, does that work?
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:17:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes. Okay. This was my badder.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's non specific. It's very ambiguous. I think that your focus is longevity, right? Even just saying brain health and longevity.
00:17:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see.
00:17:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, it's a very specific keyword for SEO. So. You keep the health because that is a part of it. Brain health and.
00:18:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see. Okay. And then, okay. We can tweak these and we have, I have in my contract that we're going to set up what's called AB split testing. So the headline is going to be one of the first things that I AB split test.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should be always. Yeah. So headline call to action and imagery.
00:18:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
the actions. Oh, I'll get to that later. But yeah. We have it done. But all right. So that's the headline and then we're going to have a subheading under it. And this is what I have for this heading currently.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we get back to the headline just for one sec? was just heading edge. It's a very specific. So edge is one thing cutting edge.
00:18:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:18:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So let's just know that we're talking about the newest type of thing, new technology, new advanced and science type of thing.
00:19:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So maybe just something simple, like you're saying like cutting edge like that? Yeah.
00:19:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
your edge. Edge.
00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Cutting edge, brain health and longevity.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In cutting edge in, I'd probably, well yeah, either way, brain health and longevity with brain ke.
00:19:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I can adjust it pretty easy once it sets up, but okay, I see what your point is to like show that we're the most sophisticated in the image.
00:19:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and as few words as possible, you want to very clearly explain to your avatar, your ideal avatar, right, which is the person who's looking for a specific type of thing. They want what they don't know, they want it to be the newest thing because they're already doing their research right. They want specific so brain health right so we know that they're interested in cognition neural function that type of thing and longevity is longer life so. Those are a very few words that said all of those things and express that very quickly but they're also keyword related. I would also go and tell chat to be tea. This is my target person. This is who they're interested in. This is my initial headline. My goal is to make sure that I'm using words that specifically attract the ideal avatar and detract right tire kickers and people who are not looking for this not spending money. Not actually interested in working for this right we don't want people who are curious. We want people who are. Like gene shorts in marketing we would say buyer aware solution.
00:21:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
aware they know that there are or at least um yeah i don't know if i don't want to say solution aware but anyway yeah that's a whole thing have line in and of itself isn't something you just like scroll past and get feedback on like when i'm doing stuff like this i work literally through all the things so i can do as much or as little as you want yeah i well i think right now i want to focus on the i need to get the the general where like i want i i need to have placeholders for words we can adjust the words later but the guy's like you need to tell me do you want a paragraph here and do you want a like a wireframe yeah like a wireframe of and he's like he's like the easiest way is just write down all the different things that you're going to want on it and i'll put it into sections and then you could change the words later but if you don't have sections then he's like you can't go back and change the words if there's no sections for the words right he's like Write down everything that you want and then we'll get it in size. Okay, so I definitely want a headline. I told him I definitely want like a subheading. So this is what I had so far.
00:22:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:22:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Something with that.
00:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, understanding and I would even say, okay, when you focus on optimization and placement is the first step towards really interesting. I actually would flip that. When you're focused on understanding your brain, that's the first step to truly optimizing your brain.
00:22:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see. Oh, that's nice.
00:22:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like that. See, I mean, though, it's like, both of those things are what you're doing, but the end result is optimization.
00:22:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Ah, yeah, like that.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Tina, you're good at this. That's why they're paying me the big bucks, sir.
00:23:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That is the first step to try to optimize it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. We have to shift the paradigm to making people be like, you need the data in order to optimize and choose the right supplements.
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's foodie. Okay. Here's how I'm going to drive this home for you so that you remember this. It is the exact same thing that we've been doing in your business. You have the data so you could understand how to fix it. You want to remember that that's true of all things, all people, all processes everywhere. Most people are not concerned with the data. They don't want to know it. They don't want to organize it. They don't want to do the work to get it, but they want the results. So whatever you're trying to get people to do, you want them to understand that the first step is understanding before you can ever get to the outcome. If you do that, then can know how to write better copy, but you'll also be able to get your kids to do the things that you want to do better. There is a certain level of understanding everybody needs to have in order to get to a particular level of results.
00:24:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So anyway, let's just make that work clear so I can remember that. I'm the first is a true optimizer in your brain. Okay. All right, I'll work on that. I wanted a section that highlighted a key problem and so I don't know, it doesn't, it doesn't just be like wide brainage, but essentially it's it's like a section of the website that has like, what is the central problem I'm trying to solve? And so this is what I came up with, like, people are wondering, how is your brain really doing? I guess it kind of goes back to what you just said, right?
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, more specifically, they want to know, is their brain going to be fully functional as long as they're breathing? Is their brain going to collapse on them? Are they going to get dementia?
00:25:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Are they going to forget things? Are they going to slow down?
00:25:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really what they want to know. Am I going to be less than I am now? I don't want to be. Anybody that is concerned with their mind does not want it to be weakened at all, right? So the pain is, I'm afraid of dementia, I'm afraid of Alzheimer's, I'm afraid of not being able to find the word I want, I'm afraid of not being as sharp as I am, and the language is different, right? So, what we want to do is try to find universal language where people who are speaking different things will still recognize that same thought when they read your copy. So that would be something that we would run through chat, TV, T and T and Claude. I really should always do the both. I'm telling you that the nuance is so, it's just profound enough that you want to look at the two. Now, but in terms of like you having a wireframe, okay, this is enough. So we can change the words later and we can go through that. Let's go ahead and continue with the outline. But what I would have done and what we can do now is literally go to either one of them, right? Chat or Claude and say, I am giving my web designer a wireframe. And this is the outline I have. However, I know that you are a marketing expert, like you have marketing expert level knowledge and you understand navigation and user preferences. things like that, as well as conversion from a website. So what I need you to do is either make suggestions to what I built or completely throw out what I built and tell me what is the optimal type of information and the layout and the structure that I should have to get cold traffic, right? People not familiar with me and my product. To engage with the website long enough to do to know me and the brand and decide if there's interest and for anybody who is the ideal market to convert them to the next step and the next step is building on a form or making a call or that type of thing.
00:27:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yep, I probably should preface all the conversations with Chad or Claude with it. Okay, this Next section, I saw a lot of websites, when I looked at 23 and me, even like the other Ezra or pre-Newvo scans or even Corbelline, they always had like sort of like a path. So I was trying, this is actually from chat TPT, but I was trying to show people, it's not really a path, it's more like the benefit section, I guess. Like what benefits do you get from using this product? This is kind of what, I guess I'll just generally call this the benefit section of the website. Yes. It was kind of like, they'd always have like a heading, sort of like scrolling sideways, or like it could have been a list, but they're like, look what you get, you get to track your progress, you get a foundation for longevity, get to see your brain like that kind of stuff.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, except foundation for cognitive longevity.
00:29:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That is ambiguous.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that you can do with chat to be TSA explain it. So you want to do that. Not everybody that's interested in longevity and brain health are academics. In fact, a lot of them aren't. A lot of them are very street smart, have gotten to a massive level of success and want to, and they have the money for it, but they're not academics, so their language is going to be different, and you want to be able to make sure you understand it. So you want to say explain us so a sixth grader can understand it with.
00:30:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
out sounding ignorant or unprofessional like the new ones to the directions that you give chat is really important okay so I listed out here the things that I believe are the benefits or I'll chat should be T-helped but I never before because we give them a 3D like rendering software so they can look at their brain we analyze every section of the brain with a volumetric okay one more thing um in your instructions tell them avoid ambiguity at all costs um clarity is the key to success okay I'm taking notes on the uh right extreme yeah I see okay um so these are the other ones I said you get a buying that analysis. This is actually the key thing that this scan does differently is that we, because of AI, we can measure each. We can, at first, we have to identify each section of the brain, and then once we've identified it, we can actually measure how big it is, and that's where the magic happens with our scan. No one else really can do this on the market right now. And that all the magic thing. It's really important, but it was hard for me to explain like, why does it matter to people?
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what you need to do is have an entire session just explaining that to chat TPT, including that this is not available anywhere else, that this is AI, and then after you've made it fully understand it, then you want to give it these instructions.
00:31:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Explain this so as sixth grader can understand and avoid ambiguity at all costs, right? Okay.
00:31:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every benefit, every fear you want to do that. then what you want to do is have say, okay, I've told you everything that I think I know about what people want to know or whatever, what I'd like you to do is analyze it and say, do you think that there's something I've missed? Is there a question that somebody I've identified might have that I didn't identify?
00:32:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:32:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, for each benefit, do this essentially explain the chat GPT, why it's for each benefit, for each fear, for each main point, period, but also look at everything as a whole, right? And then did I miss something I probably should be addressing?
00:32:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh. Yeah, because chat GPT can look at brain keys website like the main producer of the software. Yeah. So yeah, I've had it look at it and you know, it's brought up things to me like, oh, you should mention it. that they give free storage of their scans for life.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, oh, that's an interesting benefit. For sure, you definitely need to have that. The other thing is, is there something that you think BrainTree missed or BrainKey missed that they should have that I can include on my site?
00:33:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK.
00:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a software called BrainTree.
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I might do that a lot.
00:33:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brain what? BrainTree. It's a PayPal integration for a payment. So if I switch BrainKey to BrainTree, just ignore me.
00:33:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK, so these are kind of some of the high level benefits that I wanted to get on the site somewhere. Like in, I don't know if going to do like a scrolling list or like a vertical list.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you probably want to have like parallax. So parallax is, first of all, it's it's responsive, which you know, yes.
00:33:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK, so kind of like flexes or.
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, so what it means is it changes the size based on the screen size, so whether it's an iPad or big monitor or small monitor, that type of thing. But the the parallax specifically, it is responsive, but the thing that it is, it's like multi, it's colors alternating with color. So let's say white with maybe a line of blue underneath it and each section has different colors. And what that does is just help keep in the ADHD kind of attention span, right, and helps you really break apart. So if somebody's scanning the page and they want to know each new main idea or section, the section is broken up by color, so it helps, it just helps people figure out where they're at and just kind of orient according to the bag on the page. that's one thing. I just was looking at something and I changed the screen and I forgot what I was going
00:35:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I was just going to actually show you the mockups they did initially.-hmm. This is whoops, what happened?
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, they're using a pre-existing thing from Envato.
00:35:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, this is all, this is all, I don't know how you scroll this in.
00:35:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't, it's just a screenshot, so you have to zoom in and then just, yeah, like that.
00:35:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, this is one, like, so this is, like, this is going to be the headline, subheading, something like that. section here about each benefit, we built in, like, quiz later on. Intro section, how it works, kind of, three steps, or, like, oh, we're going to do this one, like, three-step process.
00:35:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do we, how do we get your scan? Chat TBT can look... that picture also and say this is the theme that I'm working with and so I want to be able to contain my words into a structure that's compatible with this theme. Okay and so it can it can give advice to that also.
00:36:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
what do you think about like I can't I don't see the difference between like these styles like colors um the formatting this is like a different one has a bigger like initial photo yeah so go to the other one real quick for me oh that's another one it's like less focused on the banner picture is what he was saying for the heading yeah it just depends on if your market is well man my
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guys hurt while you scroll. It depends on how powerful of imagery you have for whatever your product is.
00:37:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's great.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So really, it could be, yeah, it just really depends on what you have.
00:37:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So if these are what I was given for marketing.
00:37:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that does nothing for you.
00:37:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:37:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so you want to focus on the thing that's most important. So let's see, like, um, let's go look at Dave Aspray or Andrew Hugh.
00:37:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is what, if you look at the share, this is what it creates for your each person's brain.
00:37:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. So now can you compare health levels of brains? What is, you know, somebody coming in, So like how long is brain keeping around five years six years technically, okay? So ultimately what we want is we want to be able to improve or at least prevent degradation of our brain scans, right? That's right. So we had whatever we see we want to ideally see it improve and I would like brain key can't types of services or products what what let's say you get a scan and they say okay here's some of the issues we see Now we make some recommendations.
00:38:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that happen? Right now that that was kind of like my six-month plan is to add kind of ancillary services that I could either upsell or Resolve to my audience kind of no point in being told what your brain looks like if you're not going to be told how to fix it or keep it the same Yeah, that's a good point and you're going to run into that with any kind of savvy person.
00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I feel like you need to have a plan for that in the first place. So let's, let's do this.
00:39:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So let's Hey Tina, what would be better is the web developer is going to give me the first draft. I told him just do this number one. Like I couldn't tell it. I told him just make it make the wire frame like this and put it in the words. Maybe when he gives it back to me, we can go over it again.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I think you're, I think you're, I think you're trying to get somewhere faster than you should. Oh, okay. And I think you're wasting your time doing it.
00:39:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, how should I make this more efficient either?
00:39:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to share my screen. That's the wrong thing share I think. Um, but so this is Dave Asprey and I'm going to look at Andrew Huberman. See what his side is? Huberman left. I was trying to think of somebody else who's in the biohacking and longevity that would not. I would look at the websites that he promotes. Let's see, but Dave, Dave is a marketer, was a marketer first. So this is definitely something to look at. He was a marketer first and he does very well. So notice, first of all, how big the text is. Notice the breakup of colors. Notice the imagery with big headlines. how to hack your cardio workout with rehits. Very specific. want hacks. People that do cardio are specifically focused on cardio. And I don't know what re-hit is, but I know what hit is, H, I write high impact.
00:41:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I had kids to do something.
00:41:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right. So this stop lifting weights to get stronger. What to do instead. And anybody that knows Dave knows he was a fat nerd. And that's why he's doing this. Like that's how he explains himself, neurofeedback and aging, unlocking the secrets to lifelong cognitive vitality. That's very specific to what you're doing. Mendy, talks about this all the time. So again, looking at the images specific to in the correlation to the phrase, unlocking peak performance, the dynamic duo of neurofeedback and physical exercise. Okay, so here's the benefit first, unlocking peak performance. Boost your biohacking results. That is a benefit.
00:41:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like that's a result that you want, right?
00:41:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you get it? Brainwave optimization. So this is similar again to what we're talking about. Look at the, again, very simple color in the background. All of this is simple. It's logos, different colors, huge text. Doesn't matter what screen you look on, which by the way, you can change the size of everything based on the screen, even in response of the editors are different, so your web developers will have that. Very simple, Dave Asprey as a man of first, okay? So anybody that is a trailblazer is going to identify with that. People doing things nobody else does.
00:42:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They will identify with that. Does that make sense?
00:42:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So he knows his avatar. His avatar is, I want to do things nobody else is doing. want to get there first. I want to, like, buy hacking, longevity, all these things. And he's got massive testimonials from these people. Mark Hyman would be another one to look at because he does blood sugar, glucose, things like that. So the mission is simple, upgrade humanity. Again, huge headline. This is a subconsciously or fully consciously think mission impossible when you read this because of the colors. That has recognition. They automatically feel like this is familiar. And what happens psychologically is they grant authority to what is familiar, even if what's familiar is a movie.
00:43:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that make sense?
00:43:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's power in that. Very simple black and white plus a little lash of color here. We've got this DNA helix. Somebody who's interested in genetics, things like that, without actually even having an image on it, it's just overlaid here and it's still going to suggest to the mind, I can modify my DNA. Make sense? Yeah. very small psychological things happening here. Very big colorful pictures. So this background for this image, for example, these background for the images grade everything out, so it doesn't. So normally this picture, the background of these images would also be colorful, right? But he's keeping it monochromatic, monochromatic, basically, but having the color of the images pop out. It's all about grabbing attention to the thing that people are looking for. So I know this brand, I don't know these two, but this is an affiliate website. So Thinking about what you're doing with delto, it is going to be largely affiliate network kind of driven. You're going to want to know what are the things, fatty 15 is definitely something that you might look at because it does have to do with brain. It's a it's not amino acid, but it's a specific type of fat omegas, I think, I can't remember, that they discovered is more bioavailable than what we generally take, and so it improves mental cognition, you know, just smoothing out the dendrites like phospholipids, that type of thing. These types of things have affiliate networks, you can generate money, but so what you should do before you work on your website is say, okay, if you go get your brain scan. And your goal is to either make sure that there's zero degradation for the rest of your life Yeah, and really this is the thing I wouldn't even suggest that is make sure that it either stays the same or improve and This is where you use some copy and some personality and put in parentheses. Let's be honest We're only happy with improvement, right? You know that type of thing a little cheeky Then you're gonna want to have a plan of action. So if your scan shows X It means ABC the solution to ABC is to Improve it through this and prove it through that and prove it right. So let's say You are a person with ADHD and the problem is you don't make enough dopamine You've got all the receptors the receptors are functioning properly But you just don't have enough transmitters to be able to be received and I'm knocked up with So in ADHD, caffeine, well, caffeine creates dopamine for everyone. The problem is with people who are, you know, neurotypical, they already have enough dopamine, they don't need more, so it stresses them out. And so everybody is told too much caffeine is bad. But for a person who has ADHD, they lack dopamine. So caffeine actually helps balances them out as caffeine is bad for other people. So being able to create different neuro profiles, right, neurological profiles. So maybe there's a way to do it with the scan or maybe it's with the scan and a survey, which I would bet brain key doesn't actually offer. So if you could find a way to help somebody further profile themselves and then say, this would be the plan that I would give to you, right? do this. So maybe you're laying a foundation. First of all, maybe you need to remove heavy metals. So you're doing a protocol of like activated silver with immunoglobulins, activated silver because it helps kill some of the bad bacteria immunoglobulins because it removes heavy metals, but it also takes anything that the silver kills and removes it from your body. So now you've got the things that are killing your brain coming out of it, and then you start feeding it with phospholipids and anything that increases, let's say you're low on serotonin or low on So you feed it the things that your particular brain needs to have. Maybe you give them access or link them to somebody that does specific types of work out that are about strength training or normalizing hormones depending on the age that a person is. So maybe you age profile them and if they're in a particular age group like so if you're identified as perimenopausal or you know if a man has low testosterone maybe you link them to light therapy and tanning beds because vitamin D or maybe vitamin D3K2 supplement. The problem is that I don't I am not the one doing the scan right like I don't you don't need to so what you tell them is you go get the scan and then you come back and you can create and it's going to be more complicated but if you want to build a business around this you can have a membership area that says okay feed us your scan and then either you do it yourself and look at it or maybe we can build an AI program that says or maybe you get results from them either so you're going to need their scans and say if you have I'll have their scans here here's your protocol right so we're talking about a big build. But if you want to just make a few dollars trying to refer something, you could do that. But if you want to get millions of dollars out of this thing that you don't even control, create something that you do control, which is the analysis and then the protocols.
00:50:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
00:50:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and all our businesses within a year or two.
00:50:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Kind of like the scan can be the gateway. Well, the scan is the objective data, like we talked about.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Scan is the data. that you have the data, what do you do with it? That's the whole point.
00:50:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. We have only eight minutes left. What do you think I should this web developer guy was supposed to, he's supposed to get the first draft out to me by December 31. But just in talking to you for like 30 minutes about this, I'm like, okay, I need to. But this website is not going to go how I want it for the amount I'm paying for it. How much you for it? $7,500.
00:51:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, no. no. You should not save your money.
00:51:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I already paid it. So it's, but I think maybe what I should, well, you tell me, well, I was just thinking, I think I should just tell the government like pause for a little I don't know what to tell this web developer because I don't have, you've made me realize that I don't really have a plan for this site. was just going to be a very like, oh, here's some information, right? But there's no like funnel it or so what do you think we should do? I'd love to just work with you on this for the next couple of weeks. So do you think I should tell my web developer just give me three weeks and I will have a better wireframe for you and exactly what I want kind of thing? He said he's told me like, I will build whatever you want. He's like, tell me the website. I will give you, I will do the animation. straight to you. I'll give you all the pictures. I just need to know what you want. I was like, I have no idea what I want.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I can tell you, I know who knows conversions and I know who marketing. So you could give them Dave Asprey as an example. And you could tell them basically. So you're going to need for deltoes, you're going to need a specific landing page, right? But then ultimately, you're going to want to have a brand around longevity, which would be your homepage. So first of all, you really should have talked to me before hiring somebody for $75, $100 to go build you something. Oh, dude, that's a lot of money for. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, lessons are, expensive lesson is really the way that you just need to look at it. But so you need a brand that isn't delto that it is around brain health and longevity. And it could just really be about longevity period like this the science of longevity and human optimization that is it exactly but you're coming through a specific avenue which is mental it is brain health right it's not mental but it's brain health um so hold on resources blog like us about brands I'm trying to look for something for just the brain specifically don't have anything like this contact receive a free guide to start your biohacking journey you want to build a list for sure um are you living well oh yeah that's what he used to look like so before and after is good in control of the reality of biohacking exclusions longevity let's click on this Okay, so this is just a blog for Excel's book. Yeah, well, that's the thing. Everything is ultimately about selling, but you want to provide people the information so that they can kind of ascend themselves on your authority, right? So, the key features that you need is landing page that is product specific and or topic specific. So, if it's topic specific, it's going to lead to a product like an advertorial. An advertorial would be a good idea, but you're going to need copy and you're doing that, so you're not paying for that. But what you really want to have is something that is created visually. for conversion, for keeping the eyes engaged and getting people to consume the content that's on the page. And what you have does not stand out at all, so there's an issue with that. If your goal is just to sell a few referrals to Delto really doesn't matter, you're just going to work really hard for it. If you don't want to work really hard for it, and you want your website to do the work for you, which is what you should be doing, then it needs to be created more aesthetic. It's not aesthetics. It is engineered. It is more aesthetic, but that's not the point. The point is that the way it's engineered, again, pictures, contrasting colors, headlines that are all converting headlines. Start hacking your way to the stronger mental performance and physical results. One, two, four, five, six, nine, ten, words to basically tell me how I can be superhuman.
00:56:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. It's compelling.
00:56:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would click it. That's my point. That's my point.
00:56:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I think, I think, uh, maybe like you said about a couple of minutes ago that I'm doing this website, but like it's not going to work for it. You said that I'm going about this wrong essentially, but I think, I think what I'm going about this wrong is that Delta was a business. Its flaw is that I was only looking, I am only looking at this like I'm an MRI clinic. See, I, if you, if you think about that from that perspective, I'm the clinic that lets people get this brain scan. And what I'm hearing from you is like, I, I really need to shun that clinic. you know the doctor clinic mentality and and and if I wanted to do it you know differently I need to have like I really need to guide them along a product journey which could be longevity or brain health. I think fundamentally I was thinking of Delto as just the clinic that solves these brain scans.
00:57:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were for sure.
00:57:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And that's that's I think that's what this this is yeah I see because yeah you're right people if if I give people the brain scan then they're like okay cool.
00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the thing is here's the thing if you preemptively answer then now what it will be so much easier to sell than the brain scans.
00:57:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see.
00:57:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does that make sense?
00:57:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Could I do a website like Dave has sprays but it's it's just about educating people with the brain scan?
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Of course you can and that's where that's my point is that's where you need to start. So now where it's topic and product specific. So his topic specific would be longevity, right? And there are, and it's nuanced. Yours is just going to be brain longevity specifically, right? whole body. And here's a way to do that. So what you're going to do, and you need to talk to him, and you're going to have some sessions with chatTBT, and feel free to ask me questions throughout the week too. You don't have to wait until I call. But what you're going to want to do is explain, there are some gaps and placeholders that I don't have right now, because I am selling a scan that is only going to create more questions, right? It doesn't answer questions really. It answers the question of, does my brain look like? But the real question is, how do I make my brain do better? And that really is the question. No, like people are curious about what their brains look like. They're not going to pay a ton of money for that Unless they know what to do with it after the fact or how to interpret the brain results.
00:59:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So anyway, they're going to be some placeholders Tina before I Invest any more time or money When you hear about this, is this something you do you think you could sell this like is this Yeah, I guess what I'm hearing is is something that I'm worried about is like people don't have a dying need To know this data.
00:59:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean I feel no, no, no, no, no. So avoid dying need. There's a difference, right? Okay, so I heard the thing once where they said people don't actually want to be happy What they want is to not be in pain. Now. That's not true for me I am willing to pay pain for true joy. I'm an exception Your people are an exception. So it isn't a dying thing it's how do I live longer? It's really important that you understand you're talking about like top 3% of people maybe in the world and it's a very small group. But the scans that I've seen have shown me nothing. Like I don't see, I don't see, like I would be looking at my brain I would think of an fMRI. what you need to do is what does that brain scan reveal to people? You need to show them where burden is to show them what the brain scan reveals that they don't have access to otherwise. And when they know this, how certainly do they know it? And now that they know it, what do they do with it? If you can't do that, no, I would not buy from you. If you could do that, I would give you all the money.
01:00:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, because what I'm certain of is the scan it delivers. It delivers volume metric measurements, it measures each part, each of the 25 parts of your brain, it measures them and we give people the measurement.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do the measurements mean though?
01:01:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The size of your brain. So if you take someone with Parkinson's, that part of the brain shrinks and we, for the first time, can measure that section or tell them the trend kind of okay, so what measurement should be X, right, and maybe it's a parameter. That's exactly what we do.
01:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, right. So if your brain scan shows you that it's slightly below, we would suggest that there's a potential for dementia, Alzheimer's, this type of thing, Parkinson's, whatever. So what we want to do is say, from these measurements, we can predict with X amount of confidence that you might have be dealing with this. or everything looks great. Here's how you keep it looking great, like that type of thing. You need to be able to tell them what does this information mean.
01:02:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Volumetric means nothing. I don't I know, I know.
01:02:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The regions are supposed to be. And I don't know what correlation there is to the size and health. And I don't know what the variation is between a five foot two person and a seven foot two person. Like, is it the percentage of cranial space that the brain takes up or is it just volume period? Like, there's got to be some correlation to the body size. So you need to first explain to them what data they get, what the data means, how accurate that definition is, and then what do they do with it? how does it create brain, how do you get longevity out of it? How can you do anything with that data? If you can't tell me what I can do with the data to improve. my life? What the hell do I want to know for?
01:03:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, I'm going to be very honest. We don't know what to do with the data. We can't tell people that, you know, we could tell people this is how big your, you know, prefrontal cortex is. And if we see it shrinking, we could tell people, hey, know, this is smaller than average. But we really can't tell people from a medical, like from a clinical standpoint, we can't really tell them what makes it improve. We could say, hey, this might help it, this might help it, this might help it. But we really don't know what to do with the data. We're just too early in this. No one's ever got this data before.
01:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you might want to do is figure out how you can have a conversation that cannot be stolen from you, which would be very difficult to do with somebody who is massively involved in neuroscience. who's got connections so like if you go look and see just look at different neuroscientists and the creator of this is the guy that created BrainKey software he is like one of the top neuroscientist people Harvard MIT guy so then I have a question with him because here's the thing you you want to understand okay is that few people very few people understand their scientific craft and then also marketing and business and what to do with it he doesn't understand marketing so this is my point right so that's the gap that you that that you have the bridge okay so if you know how to ask the questions great if you want to have a conversation and have Ian there and just ask him a bunch of questions and say you know how do we get to this answer because what generally people like that don't know is what the average person is thinking what they need and how they act when a person is a genius and I would assume that a person is a genius. Okay, so generally they they miss a lot of the social cues they don't understand the way that other people think and they're very difficult to talk to very difficult to extract data from that is usable to other people.
01:05:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That is a hundred percent of this guy.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so there's a reason I do what I do. That's not an arrogant thing. My point is that we all need different types of people. could not, for the life of me, go create something like he did. Or there's a whole bunch of things I can't do. So I have to find other types of genius to be able to have anything to make mine useful for. So you can bridge a gap for him. The biggest thing you have to figure out is easy capable and willing to have a conversation that will get his baby. eat, you know, his creation out to the world for people to use, how motivated is he for changing the world and giving it to people.
01:06:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I would assume he would be really motivated, right?

Yes. But what you have to do is help him to understand it won't happen unless we can communicate with the average person. So we have to figure out how to translate, you know, what what you've created and what you've done to what they need to know and what they want to know. And also what is next step. So if there's something that's not created yet, and it could be a software analysis, it could be that, okay, well, we need three years worth of data. So you have to go get scan three times. Yes, that's a long term investment. Where else are you going to get it? Now the other thing is you have to do is if somebody's got, does your avatar have access to MRIs? Just go get MRIs. It's a good potential that somebody who's going to invest in Delta or bring the might have access to MRIs. Can your scan tell them something and I can't? Can it?
01:07:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bye bye.
01:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So fMRI, anything else, can anything else give us, give the data that your scan can?
01:07:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
01:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay then. So that is a very unique, very unique. So it's good, but then what? Yeah, I see it.
01:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What does it matter if I know my pre-front cortex is like borderline small, like how does that affect me?
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's what I keep thinking is, and now you would have to figure out how to get a, it's called a second tier affiliate commission, right? So basically, What I see strategically is like you doing something like introducing your guy to a guy like Dave Asprey, but saying, okay, but I get 10% of anything that you guys make together because I introduced the two of you. Your guy would not ever go talk to Dave Asprey. Dave, we would have no idea that your guy even exists. You're going to facilitate the conversation so that your guy doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to. He can answer questions through you. You basically get the bucker as much as possible for him, but you're getting paid the sales that they make. You don't even have to worry about making the sales. You're just making sure that somebody who understands how to bridge the gap between the genius of the creator and the genius of marketing that they get together and make their magic. It wouldn't exist without you and so that's why you get a commission and it's a legal contract that gets bound before you even tell them who it is or give them the idea.
01:09:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting. That's one where I could go in.
01:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it happens. And the way that you pitch it is like the only way it's getting off the ground is if we can bridge this gap, right? You have to be really specific so you don't give them the idea of go talk to these guys. The other thing is, just in case the idea comes up, you have to tell them, I know you're not going to want to deal with some schmucky, like, Instagram, like personality that is doing, you know, Facebook lives all the time and just loves to be seen because your personalities are going to conflict. You're not going to want to deal with that. Let me be the go between. Let me make sure that the message gets out in the most, you know, like engineered, psychologically engineered way possible, right? That's what marketing and psychological engineering to match up with this, this brain engineering that you have also. a basic idea. Here's what I want you to think about anytime you're doing business and you're talking to somebody for the rest of your life. Somebody's going to put something on the table and tell you what it is. They may put an apple on the table and you're like and they're like here's an apple and you could sell that apple for a dollar. But what you could do is say if I had a five star chef and a Michelin chef maybe and I gave them that apple and an hour and access to the kitchen they could sell that for a hundred dollars. So they gave you a component. Anybody that you're working with is giving you a component. Don't define it the way that they define it. I want you to look at and go if I add excellent resources to this and those excellent resources multiply and I give each person a little portion for their skill that they bring to the table. But I am the master assembler that puts all the excellent pieces together and I get the majority. already have the share, then what can it make? Your goal, you told me you went into medicine because it's got good earning potential, right? So I want you to look at everything the same way. What is the real potential, not what they told me with their narrow vision, but what do I see? Does that make sense?
01:12:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. All right. My action is I'm going to tell the web developer, I need a couple of weeks pause, please. I will come back to you and let's redo the wireframe. And maybe it would be really helpful, Tina, if you've just maybe you and I can work together over the next couple of weeks or like you said, I'll text you kind of, you know, I'm at, but yeah, would it would it be an acceptable strategy to, like you said, have a product specific website just about the scan for now, but in the back end, you and I and me.
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Over the next six months plan, the other ecosystem, like, is that an acceptable way to do this, or do you think you, sorry, yeah, but how many scans have ever been sold, period, about 5000. And how were they sold? What made it for some time?
01:13:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They were selling it through functional chiropractic clinics. So chiropractors would tell the people, hey, let's get your brain scan. And see how it is. so they're selling it like face to face. And so people were charging people like $5,000 a scan. But it was through pure face to face. There's, I think, 18 clinics in the United States that sell this. So the founder came to me or met me after I saw this was like, can you offer this online? I went off 50 states and I was like, yeah, I could do that with my clinic.
01:14:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
do you have any testimonials from people who are like, I'm so glad I got this.
01:14:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We have less than 20.
01:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why?
01:14:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like, what did they get out? Because doesn't talk to those clinics.
01:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, he's an engineer. He has no marketing team.
01:14:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
He doesn't. He's like, I don't feel comfortable asking to talk to their patients. That's what he's told me. And I see why. But.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the services that you could offer for him is say, you know, and maybe you get him to pay for it. But maybe you organize it, right? So you fund it or you get paid to do it. Yeah. It is, we need data. We need to know those, those people, like, what were the testimonials? What did they say? Um, why are they glad they got it? And how did those chiropractors specific? specifically pitches. So here's, here's my concern is that people did it just because they're at a position of authority and they're used to doing what they're told. If a doctor says you should get this, they always say, okay, there are people programs to behave that way. Crazy.
01:15:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's, it's, yeah, it's, yeah.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% there are people programs to, to behave that way. It's entirely possible that everybody that said yes, said yes out of, I have curious curiosity and I've got lots of money and I think, you know, better to do, or my doctor told me to, and I don't know any better, so I'm just going to do it.
01:15:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. The engineer thinks it's because of that curiosity and money. He's like, if you look at how much these people are paying these chiropractors, all these people are paying the chiropractors ridiculous sums of money for this functional test that the chiropractors do around the country.
01:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you might be able to make some money for a little while, but that is not a long lasting business. strategy, and I'm assuming he didn't create it for a flash in the pan.
01:16:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, he wanted all people to have this for their yearly scan, like his mother, yeah, his mother had brain trouble and only caught it from his software.
01:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so part of it should be, this is something that you do year after year to make bone density.
01:16:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Exactly, that's what it wants it to be.
01:16:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As soon as you hit 50, do this every two years. Right, so then you have to make the correlation to the types of scans that already exist and what they're doing and that it's necessary that you get multiple scans. So this is not a one and done thing that you want to keep getting it so you can get the data and measure what's happening. But here's also what you can do to make sure next to your scan is really good.
01:16:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like I'm going to tell you to take vitamin D and calcium for your bones, right?
01:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. What do you do for your brain? Omega theories, sixes, whatever, all these things, right? So that's the, you have to have a plan.
01:17:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, what does this mean?
01:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you do with it? So That's the issue building a website that can't tell you anything The website has to be able to do its job and birth you will have some random. I'm curious. It's one o'clock in the morning I'm tired. have my credit card. Let's go. You'll get some of that.
01:17:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That is not a business model Yeah So do you I mean do you think that as a first step we could make a a website that converts just the scan? Without the without having the full fleshed out ecosystem for longevity I guess is what I I'm trying to figure out like can we do this?
01:17:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You might get lucky and catch a fish That got snagged on a hook because it's But it is not a plan that I would invest any money
01:18:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
itself into you because there are way too many holes in it. I see. And the fundamental one is like you just brought up about several times you brought it up, is like, okay, great. does the data tell you? Like, how does that inform your future? Like, what do you do with the data? And I really can't answer that. The founder can't answer that. He's like, well, we give people the measurements. And I'm like, great, what is that, you know, that predictive? He's like, no, we can't say it's predictive yet.
01:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We haven't done enough research. Yeah. So it's not a sound business model.
01:18:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting. Okay. Well, I put a couple, you know, months of thought into this and $7,500, which I can get refunded. I'm wondering if I needed this.
01:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You get it refunded. You should get it refunded. If that's an option, that is the first thing you should do. That's that's how big this is. Okay. So there's a just because you can doesn't mean you should type of thing. Sure. The whole thing that we are focusing. honest, how do we get you to your $10 million net worth with the minimal like time and energy investment. Now, there's probably other factors of like, you know, things that excite you and throw you. So, but we that's not come up before in any of our conversation. So I don't know that is a major value.
01:19:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If this is a value for you, right? I'm on a call.
01:19:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Almost done.
01:19:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm on a call.
01:19:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if innovation is a it you want to scratch. Um, if, if technology, if this is something you have interest in that you're willing to pay a price of it not being the most optimized business model, then that's a conversation that we should have. But then the next step is how do we make it as optimized as it can be? Yeah. And then do you really want to pursue it for the next five?
01:20:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay Yeah, all right. Do you think we could talk about this next week or is do we have a makeup call that we could do later this week?
01:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we just gave it almost an extra half hour.
01:20:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
don't know true.
01:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true That's true, you can keep asking me questions throughout the week generally the way that I'll do it is just fill in the gaps as You know as something comes up just take extra time. Yeah Um Yeah, all right.
01:20:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm gonna cancel the website thing and then let me answer your question. You said can we We we do we can work on whatever you want to work on but what I would make sure that we also do is Spend a little bit of time even if it's just five to ten minutes keeping on top of that existing homework Don't let anything fall through the cracks while you're working on something new I see yeah Yeah Yeah, I think I think all the holes that I've seen just from just talking you it makes it problematic just to sell the brain scans I sold I've seen Well, too so far and it's just people that come from his website and he's like, oh what what city you and then they're like, oh, I mean, I'm in Seattle, Chicago, like, oh, to his click does it. So each time I do, I get like $1,000 so it's a lot of money for the amount of work that then that's why I thought. Let's keep, let's keep trying to solve this thing.
01:21:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but you have to count all the hours you put into it.
01:21:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair.
01:21:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fair.
01:21:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then that can do another thing with the time.
01:21:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% that is the way that you need to be looking at it every single time. the other thing is in terms of like getting the money, the value for any time missed or whatever you doing your homework and sending messages throughout the week. Okay, I did this. What's next? I'm gonna look at myself and go, did you do this? Did you do this? Like, like I've said before, we don't have to only talk just on our meeting times. Like if you want to keep things going, if you want to get maximum out of your investment. me, then pee me throughout the week with what you should be doing and be working on stuff a little bit more often. That being said, you also have to keep in mind, little kids, holidays, sickness, all of these things. that the pace, if you push it too hard, it breaks.
01:22:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. All right, I'm going to think about this.
01:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, ask questions, come up, just send them or put them in a dock, if you don't want to send them one off and just, you know, as you're kind of formulating things, just write it down. And but for sure, you want to be business level strategic, right? The longevity of the business. Yeah.
01:22:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
like a one off selling, like a one off scan to people, right?
01:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Right. And you don't ever want to just think about the product, you want to think about the market and you want to think about the eco.
01:23:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
system around the product. If you only have a product that you can't build an ecosystem around, then that's not a good model. Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you, Tina. You give me great stuff to think about. I think just fundamentally, I need to be like, I could probably sell this one off. But like, you know, I, to make this a business, there has to be something more, or I have to, I have to make this product itself better than it is now. The product is not, is not going to sell itself as is, you know, and yeah, I think that's the fundamental issue here. I have to be willing to put the time to make this product, the better product.
01:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and so the other thing is, you know, is it something that we can get investors or who can then fund you hiring people who can help you do these things. Like, there, there are more than one ways to go about this. But just remember that the guy that came to you is, going to be the one to do it. So there's a facilitation fee. And that can be something, but it's also exciting to you. And it's something that you have interest in. But if it was just a, I thought it was easy money. It's not really what I'm passionate about. It's not really all the work that I want to do.
01:24:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Be real about that too. Yeah. All right. All right. talk. Thank you.
01:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Perfect timing for this talk. But yeah, thank you. I know because it's the end of the year.
01:24:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
about to have a brand new year. Well, yeah. I was sitting out my goals for like 2025. And this was on it, you know, to get, you know, if I could sell 10 scans a month, I was like, oh, that's, that's an extra 10,000 a month for me, right? mean, I make $1,000 per scan. But like you said, you know, is that all the time I put in to do that to sell a product that it's doesn't sell itself. It's like, okay. Okay.
01:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does have some huge potential. I don't know how, whether the patents, I don't know, I don't know what the potential competition could be. But what I do know, like if you were going to take something like this to Shark Tank and ask, answer the questions that I asked you the way that I did, no sale. But nobody's buying it on a large scale at a customer level or investor level. If you can't answer more questions and do more with it. So really look at why you're interested in it. If the only thing you were interested in is it seemed like it was easy money and you could do it, that's not a good reason to say yes to anything, number one, and to then maybe you just need to renegotiate it. But the fastest way out of it to still get money would be to make an introduction to somebody else who could sell it and get a fee for setting that up.
01:25:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, interesting.
