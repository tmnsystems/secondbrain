00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

See? It's green on the other side. Yeah.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you have something to hook it up with or something?
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just hanging over my painting that I have back there. You know, I still remember, um, uh, I never had to make my compass. I'm going to go up and put my water on. I boil the water on. I still remember, um, Busher Azar.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? I.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Busher Azar. She's very respected. Bull persuasion.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's very bold away. She markets.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah For second anyway She used to when she first started she used to use colorful Shower curtain she bought from Amazon and have it behind her, but it worked and no one would know it was a shower curtain and you know because she's All about bold colors. It was like all like multicolored bold stuff. Anyways, it was it was funny that she just used a shower curtain I used to use My ex has been being a photographer. Well, his hobby was that he was Yeah, like those Pippers you could buy from the photography store and you just you can oh, yeah Pack it up to the top of your your wall and and it just rolls down and it's flat So that was kind of cool because you get so many colors, right?
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah Yeah I'm so sleepy. was up till like one o'clock talking to my sister and then Is she had to get up at four o'clock? So that really sucks for her. And then we got up at $5.50 to take my daughter to seminary and have been up ever since.
00:02:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how far away is the drive to the seminary?
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's three minutes. She starts at six o'clock. So we just zoomed out the door. Maybe I got up like $5.40 something, but yeah, I'm tired.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you got a lot done.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Congratulations. Yeah, but I hate all of it.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So bad. What do you mean, it all would talk to me?
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hate looking at myself. I have listening and I just cringe and I think I need to throw it all away. Oh, my God.
00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I feel every time I make something like that.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like, how can I do this without video?
00:02:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just, it's terrible, but you deliver pure gold.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but one thing that I did, I was being prayerful about it yesterday and trying to think because So everything that I do is as leveraged as it can be and price point has a lot to do with it. It's its own kind of filtration system but also a leverage in a different way. So I was thinking like, I was thinking about a lot of things. First of all, I don't like Facebook. That's where I've been for the longest time.
00:03:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have some really amazing connections and followers.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also, and I did mention this stuff to you.
00:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've asked you that.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did.
00:03:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I I answered it just now. Yeah. I think Stan's door. I've looked at it and I think it's smart. And I also think diversifying is the way to go because I posted that first YouTube video on Saturday morning. And we'll maybe about 11 by the time posted. It took a long time for the first post because I had to do all my channel optimization and keywords and new banner and all that stuff. I've been an old 15 year old account and, you know, because I've been buying, you know, some other people's YouTube courses and stuff. What is interesting about now versus even a couple years ago, YouTube is now rewarding by video, not by channel. So before, you know, you thought you have to have this perfect channel and everything's all connected, everything, but no, now it's more like by video, get one really good video that gets lot ton of views and who cares about the other videos. So that's why I want my old channel. Anyway, you wouldn't believe it. Even the guys like, I can't believe your numbers, 90% or more is all organic coming from YouTube recommended. That's how they're finding me. But the videos got over 570 views now and I got Saturday morning, wow. And the stats, I've never ever even looked at the stats. If you ever want me to share a screen and I'll show you YouTube stats, the stats are really good at showing, like it shows you the traffic. Like I thought, okay, from my warm eyes. Facebook or I send an email out about it. No, because it shows like I only got about 20 clicks from my email because I just have a small list of 750 people. And so it actually shows like direct traffic was like 29, know, people or whatever. So it shows that level, but it shows everything else is coming from YouTube suggested. And then when I look, when people join my school, new school community, I have an auto DM because school has that feature was pretty cool. Right. And I want to confuse you because you're going go high level community. So get that out of your mind. But I then asked I'm curious, just wondering how, you know, why you joined, right? And, and some of the people that started answering since I put up the YouTube video on Saturday, said, Oh, well, the YouTube suggested you on on YouTube. Yeah. So they found me through YouTube. And they became a member, you know, and I haven't launched anything yet to them. So they also became, can we come a buyer? And then they said, I just liked your style. You're just so authentic. and inspiring.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I thought that was really cool too. Yeah, that is awesome. Yeah, I that feels like the thing that I needed to hear, but also it's what I've been watching and it's what I've been doing. Like I am connecting with people that like connecting emotionally listening to the stories and going, you don't have even a quarter of the experience that I have, but what I appreciate you is you're out here talking and you have a real story and you're learning and you're learning faster because you've got way more resources than I ever had, but that makes me happy though, because I can see what's available to other people and like, you know what I mean, like there's all these different types of value people have. And yeah, and I love the diversity, not just of the platforms, but of the people. Like I like learning from lots of different people and that's an opportunity we didn't have before. So that means that we can be that another voice. We don't have to be that a voice. I think in the iron world everybody wants to be the voice and the teacher and the guru and the coach Whereas I don't need to be your everything. I can't just be a part of it And especially if I'm affordable enough for you to be able to get some of everyone That's you're making my brain guys.
00:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So in a I'm gonna stay in bed and and read a bit Because the YouTube channel I then do a lot of research right to go okay You know the statistically you look at someone that has certain subscribers that they have some certain videos that have way more Views of the subscriber count that you know That's a good video and he's got a topic that I also teach on and do so okay Let's model after some of this but using my authentic voice But so one guy that I've been following a bit is Dan Co.
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, for her to say have.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so he teaches about being a solopreneur, right? And it's kind of cool. I like his style and stuff. But what was interesting is that he's really big on one of his low ticket products. I think it's low ticket. I didn't click to see the price is two hour writing. So the concept is just, you know, if you can write for two hours a day, you can create a solopreneur digital, you know, income, you know, passive, almost passive income empire doing what you love if you like to write. But he's big on Twitter. So and I don't know if you're seeing a trend on this by any chance. But one of the guys that hired me for a consult call two months ago just shocked the heck out of me because he actually says he's making 50,000 a month selling is I think his high ticket products $5,000. So he has a book to call Donald. But all of his traffic is organic Twitter. That's it. Yes. And I'll. What? And he was referring to me because the guy that does the sales calls is bought some of my products and said, I think this guy needs to hire you to also make a low ticket funnel for Facebook ads. But either way, YouTube got to connect. He's got to hire you for a strategy call. So that's how we connected. But I was just like, wait, you're getting all of your traffic from Twitter. He goes, yeah, I started writing all the posts myself. And then now I hired a ghostwriter to do my tweets and all that stuff.
00:09:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And no video.
00:09:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's a book of call funnel. So it goes, no video can solve writing, right? But when you click the book, a call, it goes to a video sales letter of him saying, Hey, you know, I can help you. I honestly forget. Oh, he teaches people how to publish a book on Amazon. That's it. So the hey, like, I can help you publish book on Amazon and, you know, the typical 90 days or less or something. And so he goes through how much money you can make a typical video sales letter, and then book a call. And he's got that other guy doing sales calls. he's really a good example of leveraging, right? Obviously, he probably did it all himself at first, but then he leveraged. And there's other people now teaching people to become Twitter ghostwriters. it's our acts, I should say. So, there's something about that. And even I'm going to revive my Twitter account. I've revived my YouTube account, so I'm like, what's October? I always like to have each month a new money-making activity I'm going to try, like something different. So, October is going to be Twitter.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I, you know what would be great is because we have such similar and parallel paths, not necessarily, right?
00:10:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're marketing.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like I'm overall business, still, like the experience, also the level of work that we'll do in the organization and the structure, but I think it would be cool if we just kind of like dip our toe in the same things, okay? So, and make some like mini goals of what would you do like? So, maybe like a content schedule. I don't know how much you use chat GPT, but I love to use that for a lot of things, for planning, for ripping, for feedback, for research, whatever. what if, so, I'm going back a little bit because in the beginning, I feel like you were looking for your compass. How do you feel, where do you feel like you're at on that journey?
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like you've definitely been your fire stoked.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you feel like you have, how much clarity do you feel like you have in your direction, in your purpose, in, have you set any kind of specific goals yet? think, I think it starts there. I think the bigger vision is having clarity of purpose so clear that goals automatically form themselves and they're in alignment. And it isn't ever, I think when you get really clear, it's not a destination goal ever anymore. It is a progress goal. It is a this is who I am. So my goal is to continue to improve who I am and enjoy the magic on the way. Yeah, I don't I have some specific goals, but they kind of just help me formulate a path, but they aren't end goals. They are process and progress goals, right? being able to, my mom and have have a very difficult, strange relationship, but she wants to be able to travel and have a travel van as like $50,000, whatever. I want to buy that for her or have a place where she can live with one of her kids. I'm going to be traveling. So I'm not going to have a place where she can just live with me. Yeah. I want to take care of her. I want to have a couple of rental properties, know, like I want to have investments where money is working for me. I want to continue my education forever. Like I want to stay in school pretty much forever, getting different degrees and things not for any purpose other than my own learning. I want to always be serving a mission or in service work of some sorts. And in order to do all of that, I have to be able to have some income generating activities. But I also love teaching so I always to be teaching. Those aren't specific end goals. I need to be making roughly 25. My goal is $50,000 a month because of how much taxes you get in a whole new tax bracket because I pay 10% tithing and I pay my tithing off the top. I do not pay it after taxes and expenses.
00:13:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just off my gross.
00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that amount of money means I never have to think about anything and there's tons of wiggle room for. all the people I want to hire, all those things, right?
00:14:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, within that space, I want to stay within the topics of talking about God and talking about business.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I don't, there is no more specificity than that. Now, until I go, okay, well, how does that happen? And then I've got my hourly clients. I want to have hybrid coaching. I want to have a product that just is basically their for lead gen, but also kind of nurturing people up and ascending them as they learn and they grow. And that's also my teaching outlet, my creative outlet, and my service outlet. So, it serves the money goals.
00:14:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It serves the service goals.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it has the compounding effect because as my platform increases and followers increases, that means my buying market increases, my ability to generate money off of what I already have increased. And so anyway, that's, that's my thing to me, uh, if you have a version of that where all the things feed all the things with a compounding power, that's the goal, the specificity comes in the topics and the leverage. So like the offers and things like that. As we've been going, you've been dialing into different things, but you also have a goal I just learned of trying something new and marketing every month. Yes. So what kind of thoughts, how have your thoughts evolved and all of that?
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. think, um, uh, the high level answers that haven't set down all the goals yet, but the detailed answer is. I knew the process would get me there, like I needed to get the momentum. And I feel I've got that now and I, um, sometimes get pulled. back, but not nearly as much anymore about , you know, some cost fallacy about all the assets I created for Krita and systems. But I feel so free. I love your right, like I love teaching, you know, almost, you know, became a prof, you know, did my PhD way back when, because I know I love teaching. So I sort of in my element, and I also reflected on, you know, because you said, Hey, you know, think about all your past and stuff, and you know, when I'm happy. Well, it was when I was in flow. And when I'm in flow, it's when I'm creating. So like, if I look at when I was making like millions, even sometimes million per month, you know, back between, you know, the heyday was in 2005 and 2012, probably. I was publishing a lot. I wasn't really behind the scenes ever being like 50 50 partner with a Korean doing so much stuff, you know, so being like a mechanic, you know, with launching all the funnels and stuff. But I was publishing a lot and most of like 80% of the revenue came from the digital offers because I was launching one one every month, practically. So I had like 25,000 paid customers, you know, within the four year period. Yeah. So, and then I'd make lot of money, affiliate marketing, because I love Jason Bladoon. He's a good friend of mine. And so if he was promoting building something as before, he was as famous as he is now, but he always had great product. So I would always promote and he's great at selling and converting on webinars. So I would make, I was his top affiliate for the longest time, year after year, and they paid 20,000 passively from that. So at that time, also gave, when nano cast came out, do you remember nano cast? Yeah. he gave out, you know, lifetime commissions once someone became a customer. So recurring revenue.
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is that his?
00:17:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, but he used that platform.
00:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:17:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I didn't think it was that bad. No, no, we were using that platform. We switched from infusion software to there. And I was his first affiliate on nanocast and I use nanocast back in the day. So anyways, so I went, wow, that's it. Like I was in flow. And then yeah, sometimes I did coaching. Yeah, I remember having some fun weekends where people would fly up to my house and I'd teach them how to do a video Everyone still sucks at video. So I'd have like small groups for $3,000 I'd have like ten people five to ten people come out to my house and you're staying hotel, but each day we're in the house and we go for walks by the lake all the time and We're gonna do videos You're you're gonna walk away But the end of three days with some marketing videos for you your business, right? you're gonna be comfortable on video and it was fun and and so, yeah, I My best products back then was about teaching people consulting how to like the ultimate consulting challenge I saw in that domain and then I sold little $97 products So here's these consulting contracts when you get a client all this stuff. Oh, Yeah, so so I was kind of thinking hmm. I could easily relaunch that and tie that into recurring revenue go high level, right? Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. so build a community So this is step one because the digital offer community is is good And that's what I love too, but I've got Sally as my right-hand woman who could easily take that over when I then go Then to the ultimate consulting route, right? She becomes then kind of the chief operating officer if we will of that community And I'm talking a year out or something not like right now. Oh, I've got her plug in my phone. I'm my Computer hold on so or or, know, like you and I also you have that community I was just gonna talk. Yeah, me and and you know the only way to talk about that is We bring up the Google Doc and we you explain it to me and all that stuff. So that's there But yeah, so so but the other thought was the ultimate consulting challenge Did you people how to become a consultant and whether that be like a coach or whether that be like hangout and get local businesses for 500 bucks a month? And everything I teach will never be I'm even though I used to be like this. Oh I'm gonna make million dollars. I'm gonna teach you how to make, know, you know, tons of big money I want to just go here's how to make an extra $3,000 profit put a month. Here's not here's not make extra 500 month because I want to go after I'm still want to go after even though I'm not going to say just woman because 70% of my revenue come from men actually.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:20:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. But people in their 40s and 50s, right? Who I want to help.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I so what I would love to do as we're both kind of direting in and stuff and and realizing that I really I really think that I and I think it's true for both of us but I really know that it would be true for me that I will go faster spending more time talking and working with you. I think that I'll stay more focused. You are working on high-level strategy and you're working every day. Yeah. Whatever. Making traction every week. Whether it's a day thing, know, you've got mom, I've got kids.
00:20:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's there's some days that are just like and some days that are like this, right?
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but especially because we both have magnetic personalities, but the emotions and authentic desire to serve people and protect them from the predatory all marketing world. I think I know that this happens for me but I think that it probably happens for you too where you just feel sincere real love for people you don't even know you just come across and you're like I just want to see you win yeah I want you to be happy like all you have to do is see their face read their story, they say something to you and you immediately feel this, mama bear love and just like you need to win. I want you to win. Come to me, yes, I'm charging money, but I want you to win and I really care about you. That doesn't exist a lot proportionately. There are more and more of those, but proportionately it's not small. But add to it, you know, our decade of experience in the marketing world. Add to it that I imagine you've never sold yourself out for your money. I haven't. That doesn't mean that there aren't times where I feel like I have definitely been taken advantage of.
00:22:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've made people a lot of money.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, you know, as a woman, meaning using feminine assets in a way, like there's a lot that we have to offer that. and others don't who have, and it's not about judging them, it's about helping protect people against feeling they've got to do things that make them uncomfortable in order to earn money or to be successful. So I would love to, like you talked about Twitter, I would love coming up with Hey, let's just say, let's encourage each other to put out X amount of content on Twitter, can be repurposed anywhere else. Writing, but I would love to create a plan of a community that we build and we feed together. I don't care if it's just women. I want to serve women with a particular way, but I don't need to serve just women. There are plenty of men who don't fit in that alpha male, who don't want to be, and they don't want to be called feminine, so they don't want to come into women's community, but they do, because that's where they feel safest. And because it hurts my heart so much that men are like, you know, like girly men or like I was a tomboy, my sister was like a tomboy and I'm like, I hate it when somebody tells me I'm in masculine energy, I get used for you, mama bear energy is not masculine. Yeah, yeah, mama bear like my wanting to go to battle and at all costs, I said, that's them and that's a mother right there. That's feminine. Anyway, but I feel like spending strategic time on the same type of things that we can then go duplicate that process out to our other businesses. So actually starting with the stuff that we do together and they go, okay, this is working with us let's go. So Maria goes and does the same thing, a Maria world and Tina does the same thing which yours is marketing, right, mine is business together. We're marketing and business and The mamas and like I mean like that could even be them. I'm a bear marketing. Oh my gosh Mama bear marketing. like that. That would be amazing. I think I've never thought of that before but yeah Actually, like that. Well, they're marketing with Maria and Tina.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Because like right now my goal process goals are like launched to Long-form content meaning between five and twelve minute videos on YouTube a week Include two shorts a week actually just one short is fine And then now you know that the Twitter things there. I'm like hmm. I know it's worked over, but I'm willing to start earlier because Yeah, did you ever have an old Twitter account?
00:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd never did anything with Twitter. I have it And but I never God, I worry, never read about followers. My LinkedIn is huge. Well, huge for me. It's like $6,000. But I've always kept my connections minimal.
00:26:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is, and I used to teach this, and I need to make video around this too, um, publish wants or sort of create once publish everywhere, which is yeah, too, right? so like what I liked about reading Dan Coe's page, about stuff is that his, um, two hour, um, you know, whatever product system he talks about how for him, he writes, that's his skills. But then he puts on Twitter and then he does a YouTube video just saying what he wrote, right? And then apparently this works. Um, and then he, um, actually, let me just share screen and take a look at that. said apparently it works. He goes and, um, then puts the tweet on Instagram and he, He now has a huge Instagram following, right?
00:27:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's his two hour writer, right?
00:27:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's very simple. like, like, I like his, I like his vibe. Work less than one. Yeah, very nice. Join the new 1% and talks a lot about the solopreneur, right? The art of focus, one person business, talks a lot about that. Then this, the two hour writers went intrigued me.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I thought it was pretty reasonable because I think one of sounds like he has been studying my guy a lot. It's just the second brain. Like, I'd be interested if he followed Dexter at all.
00:27:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So then if you go look up and never actually look at his Instagram, but all he said is he just reposts the tweet to Instagram. And then that's really increased.
00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. Do you know who Dexter Abraham is?
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, is that your guy?
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my fiance, like 10 years, but I don't know, okay. He has my note taking nerd was an old thing.
00:27:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's pretty much abandoned that now.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, he did a lot about writing. He used to take notes at all of the major events and sold it. Like I'm talking like 15 years ago.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he started that.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like Tim Castleman doesn't now, Tim. Yes, I'm talking Tim Castleman, selling the notes to funnel hacking live or something. Yeah. Yeah, when he used to sell him from Tropic Incinversals too. But yeah, Dexter always talks about your second brain and he taught about Evernote as his second brain.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And yeah, but is he using notion?
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, or is he still use Evernote? Evernote is his second brain. he's got books and books and books stored there out of his own stuff. He's an amazing writer. Yeah. Oh, wow.
00:28:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so. I think like this, I think it's just a tweet he probably did, right? you know, so he's just doing this like like 13,000 likes. But yeah, that's all it is. It's just this. And then I've never gone to his ex account. But did you know that Google had a Google X before Twitter was an X?
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I just I'm reading a book called Alchemy. And it talked about Google X.
00:29:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, I did not know that. And you said, go ahead, go ahead. Were you reading Alchemy? No, but I do. Totally mismatch and not organized like probably Dexter does. But I use Apple Notes for lot of my notes. Well, like, I woke up this morning and I wasn't really interested to, wasn't really interested to get up.
00:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just thought, Oh, just going to. Yeah, I'm interested in getting onto this because I love it. Don't think we all know.
00:30:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So and I do like to do content stuff for an hour day easily or research, right? a lot of it's by testimonials, right? I was looking at the testimonials to our writer because this is very similar to my micro offer magic course, right? teaching me about a great small micro offer. But so I was taking screenshots of, you know, what she's saying. She's a hypnotist, mine coach to our writer, especially organized assistant art, post your content blog. But anyways, in here, oh, that's for Virginia. No, here's Dan Co. So yeah, so here's more Dan Co. So I even circled some of the stuff on his sales page. You are earning with your time instead of your mind. And I want to build a foundation to reverse that. thought, oh my God, that's so good. But the words alchemy, I did write down here somewhere that structures for social growth came, I think, from a testimonial. I wrote down to bring in, there we go, one of his clients, I went to one of his testimonial clients websites who teaches ancient alchemist principles, and I'm like, I love those words, and I just wrote it down and says that somehow I got to include that and buy stuff because I love teaching, I love, I love alchemy, like remember the, well, are you reading now, alchemy or the actually very reminiscent of a book that I read called Misbehaving by Richard Thaler, who is an economist. Yeah, I've heard of him, actually, yeah.
00:31:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, by Rory Sutherland.
00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:31:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have a call just so you know at 1230. Okay. Yeah, so I, because I offer some, I'm probably stopping or probably just a group on boarding, but I offered people free on what he called when I joined my community. So someone booked for 1230 and it's actually a client. Someone was a client of mine like eight years ago. So you know, you're going to love them.
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a pastor.
00:32:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I helped them make 30,000 a month selling angel bracelets, angel bracelets. So and and also prayers. They have an angel prayer stuff. But yeah, so I helped them. Hey, there's how you do your face. She bought my $1,000 course and she's making 30,000 was making 30,000 a month of it selling that. So they built a beautiful community. She just got sick of shipping them out because I, you know, get high quality stuff.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, hey, design this angel bracelet in China. He didn't teach her how to like hire the people and run them a little tiny business. Well, I did because of that.
00:32:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can't. Yeah. no, no, I told her to because actually I was selling yoga braces and I was using dollar for film and dot com. I said, just ship them to dollar from the film dot com and they only charge you like, whatever. I think I was like, say dollar 50, the ship and pack and you can clue it over it. But for what are reason, they just kept sending it to their house and they were shipping it out. So yeah, I don't know what ended up happening because like, yeah, she's making like 30 thou, I have all these amazing testimonies from her. But I think also they wanted to move towards building Bill's pastor spiritual business, like a little more. So that's why I think they're coming back to me because she already wrote me and said, we want to really go big on our spiritual community now and really leverage what Bill's been teaching and stuff. anyways, that's weird.
00:33:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just thought about that that I didn't even connect the dots with you. So yeah, that's awesome. Okay, I want to make sure that you have time, but also I feel so the only thing that really slows me down literally is making videos. I can write all day long. I can stay focused. But the more that I do video, I think the more I'll get comfortable with it. But but I engage better with actual people. So if I, I can read a script. That's fine. I can do that. I still will hate it. Talking to a camera just drains my soul. It's draining to me. It does not energize me. Talking to people, like if we were to have a community and have calls and report content from there, I would get so much that I could put on a YouTube channel. could do a YouTube channel together. There's so much.
00:34:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We could even do next week have you on as a guest speaker to the new school community. I've gotten talking about time and energy management.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I love serving and teaching. I've done podcasts. I love doing podcasts. I think it's also going to be something that we can serve other people by doing that say like, hey, that solopreneur thing is great until you can't do it on your own and you need to find a partner. Now we've got partner stories, right? I've got bad partner story. You've got maybe you don't want to say bad. Right. Yeah.
00:35:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just structured wrong. So I always got screwed financially, basically.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And so here's the, here's the warning things. Here's the way to go into it and then here's how to protect yourself and that type of thing. Yeah, we can teach people that and being women teaching that and we're not at newbies, you know, we're not spring chickens like some of these young girls coming out here being confident and I'm like, bro, you don't even know like you, you like talking out of the side of your neck excited that you haven't actually been through it yet. Yeah. Wait till you've been through it because experiencing it on a technical level and actually on an emotional level with a person you trusted it whole different thing.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So could you open the Google Doc and just walk me through it so we can just talk about it because we, we have about 20 minutes. that work for you or did you want to achieve anything else on this call? Uh, no.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Um, let me, I just found that. So, hold on, share and answer another question about goals.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, haven't made any big ones, but I did write down two weeks ago, I will make 100 and I have it everywhere on cards everywhere. I will make a hundred thousand dollars by October 19th.
00:36:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. Yep.
00:36:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that.
00:36:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So this doesn't have to be, I do want to have a ladies only event because of the men, like personal in, in person. And so that's where I was starting with this because I was wanting to do the in person thing and I work backwards. So how do I get ladies in person? I built this community that feeds them, but we can still do the ladies only invite and then basically we could funnel if we found male counterparts or you, or, or wanted to just do, um, so we could do ladies only and we could do co- when, right? So that we're serving both parts. Anyway, doesn't even have to be ladies only. It's just the thought. just want to serve women, but I can serve women and men at the same time. And so give that extra protection that women need, but also the men of the same variety would need the same thing. So that's that's good. Anyway, sorry, how to go through that. So primary goal is to gather people with affordable but not basement prices. I want to avoid the people that are looking for diet pills and lottery tickets. That's the language that I use for people who they'll spend a little bit of money, but they want miracles.
00:37:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know effort.
00:37:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically that. Build the list, establish a following on platform, found it on amazing female support, brilliant minds, giving heart. That's a path to upsell for coaching and offers. So when I thought about that, it was you and me creating content together and just talking about the different types of things in business offers is a big, big deal. Understanding how the market research and how to feed the market, you can do all the research you want to. Until you put an offer out, you don't know because you could duplicate somebody else's offer. You can't actually because you're the one promoting it. Your language will be different, your voice will be different, your energy will be different. So basically telling people how to minimum viability, teaching people about minimum viability, teaching them about duplication across networks, all that type of stuff. Anyway, what I would love to see us do is create content that leads people to it could be a free or very low cost community or free community that upsells to, hey, if you want to be on a call with us weekly, do this or if you want the ability to ask us questions, don't know, minimal time, maximum impact in terms of what we share. So you are a vault of knowledge, so am I. We can answer one person's question and it be useful to a thousand people. Yeah. So that's duplication.
00:39:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And now with AI and all the jazz, if we have a right, and this is where your skillset comes into, if we have a right VA in place, you can take what we produce, put it through a certain key or AI and then put it out on tweets, put it out like on Instagram. Obviously, I would probably just record video on YouTube because YouTube, taking snippets of recording doesn't really work so well. It's you know, you got to have the right hook and all that.
00:40:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyways, um, but yes is I get it You're right. We're both incredible vaults of Pure diamonds and gold and all that jazz And I think that we have slightly different take some things But also we could say the same thing and we'll express it differently Which means somebody's brain is going to receive it differently and that's great. Oh, yeah Because we get to cover more types of brains and people. Yeah, and when I want my Marketing thing that I launched about four years ago was I am possible marketing because I love Audrey Hepburn's quote You know the word impossible stands right impossible. So my podcast is called that so because I was feeling low confidence Unfortunately, I brought in you know three other partners Mia Ashley and Sally, which I shouldn't have I should have had them as I Take 80% of the revenue and hey, that's all you guys can come on as 20% because yeah They they were able to get clients from all that marketing. I was doing, and that they weren't sharing, you know, I loved how you wrote out like, hey, we figure out sharing all this stuff because then it actually goes 2500 a month. Facebook adds client, like she still has that client three years later that I hand delivered to her on civil flatter, but I would be happy if I was getting $100 a month out of it.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So being able to create a commission structure. So if anything gets sold, yeah, our products through our emails, through our group, whatever, it's done through an affiliate link, which means you get a portion of my sales, I get a portion of your sales.
00:41:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I impossible as my baby and me and Sally put in the most time and efforts in it. And yet for Ashley, me and I still love them. so good friends. They're big where their own businesses. So like they all got clients from an exposure from it because they're shy and they would never go out and do marketing on their own like I did, but they would then be invited into teaching community. the point is to respect, I respect them a lot, but they might have different answers than I would do. But we would say that, hey, you know, me and my family. our different take on it and you know and that's okay but this is how I would do it like we'd be very upfront with our community about that too.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and so part of that responsibility would be making sure that we have excellent analytics so GA4 I've got a girl who knows that Dan knows it really well and he would easily come help us and consult to make sure that we've got great tracking yeah so that is GA4 yeah so we could track like if sales came through one of your own videos that you did we have a structure that says if this tag exists maria gets this portion if this tag exists tina gets this portion like we could be really that way we have as much protection of and there could be no feelings of bitterness and it will all be protected um so that it's uh yeah and all um anyway my brain is going a million miles an hour but but we could sort the task unless and it would it would the only us would be on both of us to be honest about how we feel. Do we feel like this task assignment is equal? Do you feel like what we're creating and contributing is equal? So if you, if I say something with confidence and you're feeling like that doesn't feel fair, but you don't tell me that's on you, you have to tell me, you have to tell me and you have to know that that's safe and that you can and that'll be okay. But if I'm lying, then you'll know sooner rather than later because you'll tell me, right? You'll see my response on my face. If my face says one thing and my tone says another thing, then you know you can't trust me and you need to pay attention to that.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I like the idea of the back end being some kind of high level agency offer like or to them. So we get them on high level. So we make recurring because that's what's been missing for most of my business models. my exit when I was on fire, my exit in the past was software and it was very good. I could sell my shares in the software company that me and art created with my community. And I was happy, but right now I don't have that and I just don't, my age, I don't want to be 10 years later going, okay, I did not have launch to make money, but you know, we can also, if you're interested, no, we don't have to do this or anything.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't even know why I'm saying that honestly, I kind of do. I just always wanted to do something with Dan, but like, he's got basis. He's got all the analytics. He's got a team that is super invested in high level. He's great at marketing, but he will say things that like he just has no sugar coating and he has no filter. And sometimes it's obnoxious, but, but it's really good to have, I think the balance of masculine energy and also that no filter type of personality and like have him be like a small percentage and see if he even wants it. let us use. basis and your team, and you'll get 10% of whatever we create, but also if you want to have pick your brain, just show up to a call and not just pick your brain. So that's something I just talked to know I had to think about. But either way, I feel like we could come up with a content marketing plan, the tech plan, I have the skills to go set things up and I have a girl to hire to help out with high level and pay for it. So we would create a expense and we would have to approve any expenses. if I'm like, okay, I'm gonna give her 10 hours, she's $15 an hour. Do you agree with that?
00:45:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is what we should get out of it.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then that goes into something that before we get paid, we pay the expenses back. Basically write out all of the structure, how everything will go, who's got access to the finances, how the money comes in, how it gets tracked. all the things to protect it and make sure that you feel safe. I feel safe. I'm probably the same thing as you. Like, I just, I just feel safe. love people. I expect people to be kind to be good and not be dishonest and not disappear. But the reality is sometimes life happens and it's too much for people. And so we'll just make sure that we create a space so that if either of us somehow step out of character, because that would be out of character for us. Then the other person is protected. mean, like, God forbid, if something happened to one of my children, though, I don't know how I would be. I've never experienced anything like that. It just disappeared.
00:46:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then, yeah, yeah, And I know when my nephew and his friend started a, the tornado shakers company that I helped them launch buddy con company that got sold a year and a half later for over million. Oh, wow. I remember we made sure they worked in a like an exit clause for each person. So because also because they were like a third year college, like graduating, like who knows? One would just say, just going to take off to Thailand for two years. ya. You know? so yeah, it was good for them to have. And then also what's cool is that, you know, we could, if we do this right, we could create something that we know we could sell later. I still remember when Frank Kern's chief marketing officer, when I worked with him on a client together with the client hired each of us individually. And he's a brilliant guy, but I was like amazed that he was doing Facebook ads and funnels for 7500 a month flat fee, more for clients doing well already, really well, who already making probably 300,000 a month or more and want to get to a million. And he was really good at what he did and obviously had a bit of a team with him. But literally only two years later, he sold that marketing agency for millions. Like he's basically retired now. So he built that now he had the expertise like you and I have, but he built it all in two years and made it sellable. So I think he might have sold it to Grant Cardone to be honest, but because I was at the time when Frank Kern joined Frank Cardone for a while. Yeah.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. have you read the book built itself?
00:48:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't think so. might actually have bought it might be sitting on my Kindle, but I'm looking at my book shelf over there. No.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Built to sell and even combined. Yes. Make a really good plan, but, but built to sell is specifically about building it so that your, it's not dependent upon you. It's dependent upon your offering. So even though we're creating the content as long as the content is there. So like mama bear marketing versus Tina and Maria specifically. Right. So if it's about mama bear marketing, but then we, we use our names, the brand is still mama bear marketing and we could have like.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know like rosy rivet with the bear i made that with ai once i have to show it to you once because i that was my thing it was a mom bear but she was like rosy and she had the band and everything being do something like that so that the brand is recognizable our faces are recognizable but separately the brand has its own thing if we wanted to sell yeah i used to take my community like when i had those 25,000 paid customers like that's all meringue it out it's community right but we created the software entity called bizblis and that's what got sold out so it was always that for like i used to work in venture capital ages ago for the tennenbaum family in Toronto and a small and we take small companies merge them and then take them public so yeah definitely mom of our marketing is great i think like and we're moreable as well like yeah because you're because also we can't tie it like the community to us and stuff but is good but yeah at whatever we want to sell. So I'm just looking at my cat. She's like gonna bug me soon for feeding her. I have a cat and dogs, dogs that doggy daycare by the cats like getting antsy because I haven't fed her lunch yet. She's quite funny.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can get mad.
00:50:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She'll whack her food bowl. Like seriously. So whack the food because I kind of have a spoiler. She gets her wet food kind of in the kitchen area stuff. But her dry food. I always keep close to the bay window because you just love the bay window laying there allowing there. But she literally will look at the ball. There might be little crumbs in it and she'll just whack it off the bench. That's hilarious.
00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. My, I had a beach on she died during 2020. I see would do that. She would just smack her ball and be like, what's going on here?
00:50:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. So yeah, so so I like the concept and I think, you know, if you want to add right in there mama bear marketing as the entity that's um the only thing is you know you want to serve men too I think men would still come in I almost need the day to come in be like ooh there's women you know yeah um I gotta go to name sheep and see this there yeah and I mean we have you always come up amazing ideas too like spicy CEO marketing could be it too right like because you know like um Dan co quoted someone I don't know who it was but he said you know so so many layoffs and everything happening and everyone's here for the economy thing is there's seven billion people in the world we should have with the internet and what's available on the internet we should have seven billion solopreneurs and I thought oh that's cool concept somebody has it that does not look feminine though it does not like a woman even does it I feel like that was targeted to women powered by system maybe it is So I've got to get going because I want to grab a little snack before the call or protein shake.
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well we can just sit with this, think about it, go back and forth on Onboxer and we can start to flush out a plan, start to flush out the tactical approach for making a good contract. Dan couldn't be helpful with the contract too, he would just do it because he's helpful. And I talk to him all the time. So yeah, anyway, and then if we're meeting tomorrow, then we can just keep going on that or if there's anything else that's useful, but for me, I feel like if we just did this thing together, I automatically would have like, oh I know what I want to do on my own stuff because everything that we would be doing would be applicable, it would be about marketing, packaging, offers, service. I think that it would all be duplicatable for you and for me.
00:53:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree. I agree. And we can even leverage the free community I'm building right now, you know? So yeah, there's lots of lots of power plays here. think there's two phases here. One is you and I both getting our legs up right now. Like for me, you know, I'm getting, you know, my legs up and like, yeah, I get my voice back. And it's then, okay, now let's let's together, we'll be like the rocket that just fuels up, right?
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. creating structure takes a while anyway. So take it at your pace. I actually feel like I'd be better flipped around building the thing together and then taking the energy from that and doing it the other way. Because I would be doing everything with you. And then I automatically know, oh, I just now I've got muscle memory. I'm just going to go do this over here. So, but I'm good with either way.
00:53:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I probably can do that way too. just, it's just for me, my mind gets all frazzled thinking about this year. your skill set whereas my mind right now is on creative like I'm excited to do YouTube videos a month and are sorry a week and later like yeah but yeah so let's yeah let's continue the conversation tomorrow this is cool yeah you go go take care of your um person and I'm glad that we got some this time together this morning all right see ya bye
