00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, Lord!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Isn't he the cutest. Okay, well, kind of.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Tina Marie: Because he wasn't able to get his whole hair cut. Look at Hi.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Dan Ryan: So not the cutest.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Tina Marie: I mean no.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Dan Ryan: I didn't say it, though it sounded like you say.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tina Marie: It is cute lulu. Hi! Don't lick my face.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Tina Marie: I'm just gonna hug him. How are you?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Dan Ryan: Good! How are you?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Tina Marie: I have a puppy. I'm good. I was coding Saturday.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Tina Marie: From like noon until midnight, because. Sunday is my cutoff.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Tina Marie: And. The thing that I was trying to build and building.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Tina Marie: But stopped. Is. I'm gonna turn this off. But I'll show Mark the puppy later.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Dan Ryan: Not yet.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tina Marie: What do you. Uh-huh.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Tina Marie: Where is he? By the way.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Dan Ryan: My dogs are barking.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Tina Marie: You don't. I don't hear her.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Dan Ryan: Which blows my mind. There's 2 of them going off.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Tina Marie: That's wild.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Dan Ryan: But good good for zoom.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Tina Marie: Are you coming to our call? He's never late, and says nothing.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Dan Ryan: Is he in Spain? Is he in Spain with the power outage.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Tina Marie: Now.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. That's just Bobby.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Tina Marie: Aw.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Dan Ryan: Well, and then, like the news. Not too long ago was that they're not gonna have power for a week.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Dan Ryan: Like, what. How.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Dan Ryan: That's like end of day. Shit.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Tina Marie: In Spain.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Spain, France.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Dan Ryan: Portugal.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, there's there's this massive blackout that happened.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay, that sounds suspicious.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Dan Ryan: I don't that nobody knows. The the cause is unknown at the moment, so they're like, don't panic.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Dan Ryan: Like Bobby. I don't know when he I mean he's over there. So he texted at some odd hour like, Oh, hey! There's a power outage here. I can't do the meetings.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Dan Ryan: It's like, Oh, okay. And and it's like cell phones dying.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Dan Ryan: Cause it can't power it up. I'm like, Oh, oh. So pretty soon they'll be eating people. So.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
mark sweet: Yay!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tina Marie: That's terrible, I know. I just laughed at it, slightly morbid.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Dan Ryan: Gonna be. Great.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tina Marie: That's okay.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
mark sweet: No, it's only solution of things.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yep. It always ends that way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Tina Marie: E. Cool.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tina Marie: I would rather die than eat a person that's good.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah, maybe they're tasty. You don't know.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Dan Ryan: You don't know.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
mark sweet: Maybe you've eaten a person you don't know.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Dan Ryan: Yep.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tina Marie: Ew, I? Oh, that thought is terrible!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Dan Ryan: Tastes like chicken.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tina Marie: I was waiting for that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Dan Ryan: Mhm.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
mark sweet: I mean, you've eaten a spider in your life, and you didn't know it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Tina Marie: You know, just because that's the statistics doesn't mean it's happened for real.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
mark sweet: Doesn't mean it hasn't.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Tina Marie: Whatever. I'm going away.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Dan Ryan: Breathing people.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
mark sweet: Hmm.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Dan Ryan: Let's just face it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
mark sweet: Do you eat chocolate because there's a certain amount of bugs per pound of chocolate that's uh allowed.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Dan Ryan: Boiling green.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Tina Marie: And poop.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Tina Marie: Like less than 2% of mouse poop. But like, that's an insane amount when you think about it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
mark sweet: Little bit. Um. Okay, so sort of a hot button. Ish.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
mark sweet: Issue. The chat on our website.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Dan Ryan: Now? What.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
mark sweet: Uh. It doesn't work very well.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Dan Ryan: Is it hallucinating? Again.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
mark sweet: No, it just doesn't respond.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Tina Marie: Ooh.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
mark sweet: Says, let me get the right person for you, and then just nothing.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Tina Marie: Oh, that's even worse than not responding at all.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Dan Ryan: All right.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:29.000
mark sweet: Cause we some weird text message through law ruler, which I don't know how it got to that phone number. On a death case. And I was like, Okay, well, I'll just put it into our system that way, like we fully will do what needs to do.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
mark sweet: And we flew. Just said, Let me get to the right person and didn't ask like any, follow up anything at all. So yeah, no bueno.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Dan Ryan: Yep, we just gotta train it because it's. That was part of the issue people were asking for like Sam, and whatever so.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Dan Ryan: Well, I we said, gotta go gotta go look at what they're asking. Then give it a directive. This is why AI is not that great people.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Dan Ryan: It is, and it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Tina Marie: Bad.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
mark sweet: Do we wanna go back to the like service that I pay for? Because now I'm a little bit more concerned that we're losing out on things.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Tina Marie: It's not working.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I don't know.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Tina Marie: Mark, look at your screen.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Dan Ryan: All good.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
mark sweet: Hold on. I wanna figure out why our chats not working.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Tina Marie: There's a Hudson.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Tina Marie: So high, and then you can go away. Ah!

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Tina Marie: Anyway! Daryl.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
mark sweet: You can see it was under. Oh, this is so weird. Okay, it's even worse.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
mark sweet: Oh, this is so much worse. Um! If you look at Weston Mastro. Lead, flow, rate.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Dan Ryan: Look at what.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
mark sweet: Weston, Mastro. WEST ON, and last name Macro, MAST, RO.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Dan Ryan: Well done! Hold! Please.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Tina Marie: There you go! Is that a company.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Dan Ryan: No, it's a person.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Tina Marie: You can see the conversations.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Tina Marie: What happened? Why are you having him? Look that up, mark.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Dan Ryan: Because he's.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
mark sweet: So I had tried to.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Dan Ryan: He's talking to the bot. And.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.000
mark sweet: So.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, okay.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: What happened?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Dan Ryan: The bot doesn't know to. To.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Dan Ryan: Not schedule a call, but it would need to. This person said, Call me. Not right now, though he was like. Call me tomorrow.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
mark sweet: So what's really interesting is, when I did it on the website, I did not see any single response.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Dan Ryan: What do you mean?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
mark sweet: So. Um. Let's try it right now. See if it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Dan Ryan: When you tried to use it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah, let's see if this works. Um.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
mark sweet: Okay, you can see my screen right?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Tina Marie: Oh, even worse, cause it's your face like. Like. You're the one that said it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
mark sweet: So give me a minute.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's not gonna do it.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:18.000
mark sweet: And. So what's crazy is when I look at Lead Flowy, there's a response that says, Hey, there!

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
mark sweet: The other part is not insurance check. If you have uninsured blah blah blah, whatever. I'm not getting a response on the chat on the website at all.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Dan Ryan: Well, that's even different. Hmm.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's some. Yeah. I don't know.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
mark sweet: Oh, now, there's finally typing. But yeah, like the other night, there was no typing at all. So.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Dan Ryan: Is that what you got in the lead? Flowing.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
mark sweet: And leave Flowy a little bit. But after I wrote like anyone, there waste of time, bye after, like 2 or 3 min.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, no! Like the one that you just did. That response that we're seeing on your screen is the response you saw and leave Louie.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
mark sweet: Yes, but when I did it like that night. I wasn't getting any response at all.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Dan Ryan: Hmm.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
mark sweet: Which was. Super, weird.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Dan Ryan: Or yeah, or it's got our. It's it's following. It might be following some hours or something. I don't know.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Tina Marie: What were you using before.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Dan Ryan: Um end chat or something.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. I haven't heard that name.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
mark sweet: Like engage or something else. So now I'm just worried what we might be missing. But.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Engage?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Dan Ryan: I'm sure this is easy to fix.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
mark sweet: Thank you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Dan Ryan: Alright! I just send it to Eric.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Tina Marie: Can you make it just a weekly or. Even daily task that takes, you know, less than 2 min for.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Tina Marie: America or somebody to go check the chat and make sure it's responsive. Just because it's a key feature and or like if there's an automated way, but without a human in the loop, then.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Tina Marie: It's still relying on automation. And you know, multiple automations can break. That way, you know, something that's important is working like in an office, you can tell, did people come in? Do they do? Are they doing their jobs.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Tina Marie: But online, you know, with the chat, bot. You, you don't see that. And so out of sight, out of mind.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Tina Marie: What can you do to.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, you know we could do. We could. Probably send an internal notification to someone when.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Dan Ryan: One of these chats engages. Or, yeah.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Dan Ryan: Not that so? They know. Oh, I should go. Look at that. Because you could also just jump in.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Dan Ryan: Um. And take over from the AI. I think.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Dan Ryan: So I'll have Eric set up an internal notification, and. You just tell me who to send it to.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
mark sweet: Oh! And then, when we try to do the get your answer where it's help us here. On my phone. It wouldn't go through on desktop. It does.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Dan Ryan: Uh? Where is that?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
mark sweet: On like the bottom of web page, where you can just fill out a form.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Dan Ryan: It didn't do what. Didn't fill out. It didn't go to the form.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
mark sweet: There was no way to make the form go through.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Dan Ryan: That on Mobile. I don't even see that at all.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! One thing.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Dan Ryan: The get started button. Is that what you're talking about?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Dan Ryan: It didn't pop up the form.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
mark sweet: It popped the form, but there was no way for me to actually submit. It.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Dan Ryan: Right.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
mark sweet: Oh, and on your sorry. I'm changing way. Too many things.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Dan Ryan: Wait, so there's no button. When when your pop up comes up, there's no.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
mark sweet: On my phone. There was a button, but every time I tried to um.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Dan Ryan: Gate.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000
mark sweet: Submit. It wouldn't go through. It just kept saying, Error.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Dan Ryan: A form, error, or like a browser error.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Dan Ryan: Cause I'm getting form errors like. You didn't fill this out.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Dan Ryan: Uh. So uh, I gotta look at it on my phone. But I don't know where my phone is. It's up.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Dan Ryan: Have to go find it works on desktop, so I'll I'll look at on my phone and then.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
mark sweet: Okay, yeah, like, I'm trying on my phone. And I hit, get your answer and like, nothing happens and says.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's probably like a Javascript thing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
mark sweet: Yeah. On what you.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
mark sweet: Sent me the Spanish. There's apparently a ton of errors.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Dan Ryan: That's Chat Gpt's fault. It's the best I can do.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Dan Ryan: Tell him to send the corrections to my email.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
mark sweet: Uh.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Dan Ryan: That's shocking. That chat. Gpt! Is that bad?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So they're gonna send me the corrections. But um, not not ready for live.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Dan Ryan: No, no, no.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Dan Ryan: We gotta get that header, too. So.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Tina Marie: What? Model? Is it using.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Dan Ryan: Fuck if I now.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Tina Marie: Well, whatever you're.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Dan Ryan: Work. Whatever 4 point.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Dan Ryan: 4 point lowercase. O, whatever the hell that is.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, that should not.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I, just. Use the standard login, whatever.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Tina Marie: Hmm. So I would just say again, Is it not worth the effort for.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Tina Marie: A couple minutes a day, or at the very least a week. To check the Chatbot and make sure it's functioning. Well.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
mark sweet: I have to take a super super quick call, so I will just be myself for a second. Sorry.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Dan Ryan: Which is, do the. We should just do the internal notification to someone. I don't think the website.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Dan Ryan: It doesn't generate like a shit ton of interactions. So you could just alert someone every time a new one happens and they can hop in there.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Dan Ryan: Or alert them during work hours at least. And then they can just hop.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Dan Ryan: I mean, I think it can leak link right to the. Right to the record.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Dan Ryan: So they'd jump right into the car, and they'd see the conversation happening.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Tina Marie: Ah, yeah.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Dan Ryan: And then they then they could say, Oh, this one's effed up.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Dan Ryan: That's the problem. Nobody's. Watching it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, that that's my point. My, my concern, though, is that if it's not a habit to manually go check it. Let's say that stops working.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Tina Marie: Or the notifications or nothing's happening for a while. And the reason nothing's happening for a while is it's not working. And so no notification, no check.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Tina Marie: So. My point is that there should be a. Scheduled.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Tina Marie: Person just go check, not because an automation told them to do so.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Dan Ryan: Sure.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Tina Marie: I mean, it could just be weekly if it's not a lot.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it could be like a twofer like you're gonna get notifications. But you also should check it every Monday.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tina Marie: Um even better probably. Would be check it. Friday afternoon.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Tina Marie: Make sure. I don't know.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: Just thinking like the weekend, or maybe Thursday, so that if there's an issue there's time to work on it. I don't know. Know what I mean. Like.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Tina Marie: Cause. I would imagine that after hours it's. I don't know. I would love to know. Do we get more chat requests after hours.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Dan Ryan: This one's so new. I don't. I mean I don't. I'm not even sure how to look it up, but.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Dan Ryan: I'm not sure that this one gets very many at all. Um, but we just set it up like.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Dan Ryan: I don't know 2 weeks ago, or whatever uh, so we can find out. The.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, cause this is. Just chat before it was like tied into the the SMS. One.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Dan Ryan: And that one did. Get a bunch of stuff, but this one's totally new.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Dan Ryan: So I don't know the deeds.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Tina Marie: So. What happened to the SMS. One.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Dan Ryan: So Mark had us change this one because he didn't like. What?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Dan Ryan: The other one was doing.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Tina Marie: The SMS. One.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Dan Ryan: Huh! Yeah, it was like. Because it didn't.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Dan Ryan: That one tried to book you into a call, and then the issue. With. This was.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Dan Ryan: That it. It's not that it was SMS. It was that it was like. Book an appointment one I guess you could call it.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Dan Ryan: But they were both using the same automation. Now this is a dedicated automation. Or the idea that.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Dan Ryan: Think what he was seeing was that. Current clients were going to the site and saying, I want to talk to Samantha, or I want to talk to Patrick and the SMS. One didn't.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Dan Ryan: Doesn't do that because it was. It's only meant for leads. So this one had to be built because it it's a combo platter of like, hey? They might be.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Dan Ryan: A current client looking to get in touch with Sam, or whoever. Or.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Dan Ryan: It could be a lead. Which is so now this one. So when Eric built it and he went in, he was seeing a bunch of people that were doing that.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Dan Ryan: Now a lead. Or potential lead.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Dan Ryan: Is this example here. So it just needs the logic, for like.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Dan Ryan: So before it would have said book, a call. Now it does. It's not doing that. It's saying we'll call us.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Dan Ryan: And. The dude didn't want to call, I guess, and then the guy was like, Call me tomorrow, and then the bot.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Dan Ryan: Didn't know what to do with that. So it responded, and then the guy. It looks like the guy was upset that.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Dan Ryan: That no one was calling him. And I'm like you just said to call you tomorrow.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Dan Ryan: But of course it was a real, if it was a real person. Wouldn't have gone down like that, but.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Dan Ryan: We'll see.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Tina Marie: Does it? Does it? Does it? Um! Cause. I don't know what programming is done. But does the bot have parameters that says, you know, if somebody asks this question, basically tell them it's out of bounds. I can't answer that question.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Tina Marie: Please call or please text or or would you like us to call you back like that should be programmed into.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Dan Ryan: And. Yeah, it does. It has that. But it's just.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Tina Marie: And then. Okay.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Dan Ryan: We just gotta finesse it bait, you know, like we. It was starting from 0.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Dan Ryan: You kind of. Built it around.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Dan Ryan: What we what was happening in the. The other thing is, we couldn't parse you couldn't parse out. Oh, these are the website conversations that are happening in this.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Dan Ryan: Sort of. Single bot. Right? We have both.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Dan Ryan: All sources were going into it, but we couldn't fish through it and say. This is website. So he fished through it and was like, Okay.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Dan Ryan: And we used obviously the example that Mark gave us. So it was sort of like, hey, here's this breadcrumb. And then. When he went in. Sure enough. Yeah, there were people doing exactly what Mark said.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Dan Ryan: So it's like, Oh, we need to combine sort of the knowledge of the old bot and then start to give it this new stuff. Which we did.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Dan Ryan: But. I mean, that's the whole thing. I'm surprised it didn't send him to book a call, but he said, Call me so. I think that's where it went sideways.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Tina Marie: So. But what I'm saying is because Chatgpt has logic and ability.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Dan Ryan: It's not chat. Gpt.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Tina Marie: Is it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Dan Ryan: Unfortunate.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Hudson.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Tina Marie: Cushioning it.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Dan Ryan: It's a it's. High levels. Conversation. AI, because you can't.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Dan Ryan: You can't use chat, gpt, like this. Where you can't have it.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Dan Ryan: Continue A Conversation. Just doesn't work.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Dan Ryan: In high level. So this is like the I'm sure this is Chat gpt, but it's like their wrapper on it, or whatever.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Dan Ryan: And uh. You basically can just give it.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Dan Ryan: You can give it directives and and example questions and example answers, but. It falls apart.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Dan Ryan: Only when you see it falling apart.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That's useful.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Dan Ryan: Like. We have to see what's wrong, and then.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Tina Marie: Eh? Well.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you you can't, is there?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Tina Marie: I don't know, because I haven't seen the interface. Any kind of parameters.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, there's no interface. It's just like a single prompt. Think about it like that. So you got to try to.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Dan Ryan: Give it. Obviously it didn't know how to handle this scenario.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Dan Ryan: So we're.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Tina Marie: This is like not even vanilla. It would be like plain, just.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Dan Ryan: Right, but it's like AI. You know how it just. Gets confused sometimes, and you're like.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Dan Ryan: So you know.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Tina Marie: Either way. Then I think that it should be human, tested. Weekly.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Dan Ryan: Definitely keep an eye on it. Yeah.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tina Marie: And. What would be great.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Tina Marie: Probably. Is, if we.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Tina Marie: Use one of the smarter models and go through and say, Look, this is the situation. This is what we have. What are the best types of questions to ask as a test. Also just what are the types of questions we might expect a user to ask on this website. So that.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Tina Marie: We can see. What kind of response they would get, and just kind of run through that test really quickly. Copy and paste. Each week you could open multiple browser tabs, so that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Tina Marie: Or, I guess, incognito, browser tabs. So that you could, you know, get through the task very quickly. So the person doing it isn't taking a lot of time.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Tina Marie: But. Ensuring number one, that the system's working, and 2 that it's working across.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Tina Marie: Multiple parameters.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, and we can definitely go in. And now fish out. The actual conversations that have been happening to write a better directive.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well. But the other thing is, you know, that's reactive proactively. Could we anticipate logistically.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
mark sweet: Hey! Okay, sorry. I'm back.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Tina Marie: Might be asked. Did you catch that? Then.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Dan Ryan: No, you got you got cut off.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Tina Marie: Um look, I said, that's. Re reactively, you know, anticipating or figuring out what's been asked. But.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Tina Marie: Could we logically and probably go through and anticipate. Scenarios that might come up and just test them and see.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Tina Marie: How it responds. I realize it's not high volume. Um, but it it.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I mean, my only concern with that would be that it just. Right if we try to give it.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Dan Ryan: We try to predict what might happen. I'm like, Oh, God! Is it? Just gonna get dumber.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: Hmm, hmm.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Dan Ryan: It's like.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: No, I don't mean predict. I'm just this. Come up with a list of like 10 scenario chat.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Tina Marie: To start. Of.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: Things. People might say that logistically makes sense and see how it responds.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Dan Ryan: Um, yeah, I suppose you could do that.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Tina Marie: For example, can I talk to a specific person, for example, can you call me at a specific time? You know you know what I mean, just like, 1st of all, what's what's already been asked. But then, in the realm of adjacent possibilities.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Tina Marie: You know? What? What are 10 of those. That.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Tina Marie: Logically and with.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I get you.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Tina Marie: Relative probability will come up.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Tina Marie: And then maybe we can have.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Dan Ryan: Well, you we could probably have it. Do that right. Be like, Oh, hey.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tina Marie: Somebody on Mark's team. We.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Dan Ryan: This is what happened. No.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Dan Ryan: Think about what else could happen. And see if it can come up with something.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Tina Marie: That's what I was saying.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, no, I know I'm I'm reiterating.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Dan Ryan: I'm I'm with you.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Tina Marie: Got you. You just merely got back to me.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Dan Ryan: For the record mark. There's been a total of 4 website chats. So you're not missing out on anything.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
mark sweet: That we know of, but I couldn't submit it on my phone. So maybe there's more.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, so this fires when this chat starts.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Tina Marie: So do you have ones? Do you have evidence that Mark tried to start something.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Dan Ryan: No. Because he's not. There's no record.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
mark sweet: We'll get the April 26th one. The Western Metro was me putting the information in.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Dan Ryan: Wait! That wasn't him.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
mark sweet: I put it in with his number and everything he gave us.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Dan Ryan: Wait. So that wasn't a real chat.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
mark sweet: No, it was. But that's how I know it didn't work.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Dan Ryan: I'm I'm confused. So it was a real chat. That you found out about after the fact.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Dan Ryan: How do you know it?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
mark sweet: So I received that information via law Ruler, which I still don't know how they text it to law. Ruler.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Dan Ryan: Oh!

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:35.000
mark sweet: And so I put in the phone number. And then, obviously, guys information. So it would go into Lead Flowy. So he would get followed up with Via Lead, flowy. But then that didn't happen.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Dan Ryan: Wait. So you got that from law. Ruler.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
mark sweet: Yeah, which is where I'm even more confused of what phone number this dude texted.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. That's.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Dan Ryan: So what makes you think he had a chat.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
mark sweet: Oh, I I physically do the chat.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. So the. The chat was you.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Dan Ryan: But the lead. Okay, so this guy didn't have that experience. That was you having that experience.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
mark sweet: No, it was me having a bad experience, getting annoyed.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Dan Ryan: Got it. Okay? That was not clear at all.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
mark sweet: Got it. Okay, I just forward it to you. I'll send it, Tina, I guess. No, I don't.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Dan Ryan: Um.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
mark sweet: Tina, do you want to be on that.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Dan Ryan: Isn't your law ruler.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tina Marie: You know, always wants to be in the loop. Because when you guys have conversations I don't know part of, I'm just like, why am I here?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Dan Ryan: This is this is your law, ruler, account, right. I don't even think.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
mark sweet: Yeah, which?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Dan Ryan: I don't even think we have access.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
mark sweet: Shouldn't have anything.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Dan Ryan: We. We're gonna have to go. Look at that, because I don't.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
mark sweet: Oh, I know it's super super extra confusing!

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. But I mean I don't even think we have access to that.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Dan Ryan: So I'm not sure what would be hooked up.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
mark sweet: Uh. I'll send you the password, if you don't mind. I know it's in it before, but.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
mark sweet: I will gladly send it again.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, send it.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Tina Marie: For me, Dan. It would be super helpful when we're having these types of conversations. And you're looking into stuff. If you share screen because I like, I have so little context for this.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Dan Ryan: Ah!

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Tina Marie: Just to, you know. Request.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Dan Ryan: I wasn't. Mark was sharing his screen.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Okay.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. See anything, now.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Dan Ryan: Um. I could. I'm not looking at it, though.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Okay.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Dan Ryan: I'm gonna I'm gonna go.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Tina Marie: I thought you were.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Dan Ryan: Tried to look at it, but I don't know what I'm looking for at the moment.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah, just. Weirdness.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Dan Ryan: No, I got you.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So are you gonna remember this? Do you need a reminder to be looking at this while we move on to other things?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Dan Ryan: Who are you talking to?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Tina Marie: U.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Dan Ryan: To look at. Oh, no, I already sent it. Derek.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. It's already. It's already going.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Dan Ryan: But I told him. Something not true. But whatever he doesn't need to know.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Dan Ryan: If the. If the problem.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Dan Ryan: Whatever like, fix that cause. If that did happen, then we don't want that to happen.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And, mark you, submitted the.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Tina Marie: Trademark request for. Get paid, not played or no? Are we using.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's in its progress. Unfortunately, I might not have found some that might be a small slash, gigantic issue.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Dan Ryan: Hey!

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
mark sweet: No. There's a Pennsylvania.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
mark sweet: Law, firm. That trademarked.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
mark sweet: Like in 2018. We win.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
mark sweet: Or it's free.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Dan Ryan: Who.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
mark sweet: So that might be a small issue.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Dan Ryan: Are they using it?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
mark sweet: Well, we'll see. We're still gonna try.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Dan Ryan: Is this? Is this you telling us you didn't do a trademark search in advance.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
mark sweet: I did.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
mark sweet: I didn't find that one because I just did winner. It's free. I guess I didn't do it. Large enough.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Tina Marie: Right, yeah.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
mark sweet: Which is. Definitely.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
mark sweet: My bad.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Tina Marie: Um. Does the trademark.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Tina Marie: Have to be. State, specific.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
mark sweet: Uh no just. Just uh, country specific.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Dan Ryan: My God! Is it this traffic. Ticket, firm.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
mark sweet: Uh. How to find which one it is.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Dan Ryan: Actually, I can't even really, I mean. There's a few.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Dan Ryan: Well, this is Canada.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
mark sweet: Sorry. I guess it's been since 2011. They've had it uh.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Dan Ryan: See that I found that one. They're in Canada, though. And then we winner. It's free.com is in.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:25.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So it's Joel Kofsky. billyinjurylawyer.com.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Dan Ryan: He doesn't own the domain.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
mark sweet: He owns Phillyinjury, lawyer.com. But yes, you're right.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Dan Ryan: Well, the get around is to do. We winner. It's free.com.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Dan Ryan: Throw the.com in the into the thing, and then.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
mark sweet: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm still gonna try to push it through, because it's technically a little bit different. Um.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Dan Ryan: I'm surprised he actually got that cause when I tried to register back in the day.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
mark sweet: And we'll see.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Dan Ryan: Attorney for an attorney for you. They would not do it.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Dan Ryan: And the minute I made it an attorneyforyou.com done. But because they were like.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Dan Ryan: They're like, you can't register a sentence.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Tina Marie: How long ago was that.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Dan Ryan: 2,001.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dan Ryan: 2,002 something.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Tina Marie: We're barely in the same century.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. It was a it was a little bit ago.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Tina Marie: Little.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000
mark sweet: But Dan's right. I mean, maybe we can get it to the website itself. Then just adding that onto the. Image we created shouldn't be.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
mark sweet: Terrible.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Dan Ryan: No. Not at all.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
mark sweet: We just gotta play around with it a little bit. So that's what's up with that. So.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Tina Marie: That's also a great brainstorming exercise for chat. Gbt.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
mark sweet: Wrong.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Tina Marie: Or any of them.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
mark sweet: It's okay.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Tina Marie: I'm just.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
mark sweet: I. Still, we still probably are okay. And it's still not like a violation, their trademark, because it's just using common vernacular.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and um. Don't. Trademarks have to have specific applications. So.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: Um. Like. For example, if you were, gonna have a particular trademark like you could use it.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tina Marie: And specific application. I don't know that law is broad enough. Could it be. Um, a specific.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Tina Marie: Area of practice, of law. That you could compartmentalize right? So as long as there's no overlap.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Tina Marie: Between personal injury and. What like if they're doing personal injury? It's a moot point. But.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Tina Marie: If they're not doing.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mark sweet: They do injury, and it's for layers of accident, personal injury law. So Nope.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Tina Marie: Huh! Post.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Moot point, anyway. Sorry about that.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
mark sweet: He also has some interest. He has lost sharks with a Z.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. That's not going to help him as much as he thinks it is.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
mark sweet: Let's see.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Because unless you know that brand like and and know how it's spelled, you'll miss out on a lot of the stuff, and if somebody else has lost sharks with an S.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Tina Marie: He just sent them a bunch of traffic.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah. I got you.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Let's look at these leads.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tina Marie: I mean matters. You know what I mean.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
mark sweet: So we're in the last 3 days of this month is well, this week is always a little crazy.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, you sent this like a couple of days ago, right?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
mark sweet: This isn't like Saturday night, because, like. Kind of knew it was coming in until this morning.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Tina Marie: So? Has anything changed.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
mark sweet: Um. We're still at the same 90.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
mark sweet: But we have one. 2. We have, like 4 retainers out instead of one.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.000
mark sweet: So.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Tina Marie: What's our.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Tina Marie: What's our? What's our record number?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
mark sweet: Like a hundred and. 3 or something.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Tina Marie: Is it really.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
mark sweet: Something like that.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Tina Marie: Matters not. Cases.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Tina Marie: Incident. Right. I was thinking it was in the nineties. For some reason.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
mark sweet: No, we've definitely been over a hundred.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Wow!

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. Hold on!

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh. Where's the doctor? Referrals.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Tina Marie: Or. Return, click.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Tina Marie: Blue, steel. That's.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Tina Marie: Quantify right.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Tina Marie: Well, alright, quantify, and the walker total is. Gonna add them all up, 7, 9.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Tina Marie: 1719. 6.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Tina Marie: Walker. Okay.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Tina Marie: Um! What was the change? I wrote it down that we're doing with them? We're expecting. Okay, actually, let's do this. Where are we at with Colorado right now.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:33.000
mark sweet: Uh, we're finessing it, I guess, for lack of a better term. So I have the retainer back from.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
mark sweet: The earth, council. But it's.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.000
mark sweet: Very different than our previous. Retainers. Uh. By the way, August 2024, I think, was our highest at 110.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I thought it was August. Okay.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
mark sweet: And then November 2024 was a hundred.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Tina Marie: I did not remember the numbers, though. That's good.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so. Highest.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
mark sweet: You got a shot to beat it, but. As long as we're over a hundred. We're okay.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Tina Marie: What did you say before that.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
mark sweet: As long as we're over a hundred. We're okay. We're already.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Tina Marie: No, before that.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
mark sweet: We have a shot to beat.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Okay.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
mark sweet: Okay. I mean, a lot of things don't have to break the right way, but it's possible.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Tina Marie: So retainer back from Ethics Council looks different than every other one you've had before.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:30.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So we gotta do some teaching with it. And then we're still trying to figure out what we have to add onto it. And what I mean by that is. What do we need to get clients to sign? So we get records and bills and all that other stuff. So we have to.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
mark sweet: Ghosts. Other law. Firms like Pretend like we have a case.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
mark sweet: And this into their retainers.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Is that funnel hacking in law firms.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
mark sweet: Um. Sort of.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Tina Marie: I was kidding. Um.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
mark sweet: Annoying. I mean, it happens to us sometimes where it like sounds like a case using the retainer, and they disappear.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Tina Marie: Intake, hacking, retainer hacking whatever. Yeah.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So it'll be.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Tina Marie: Um. Any news on the Lorenz issue.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
mark sweet: Uh no. I mean, I've reached out to the.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
mark sweet: Duty sent the email. And he's like, Yeah, this is really more about the Illinois firm. And. Um.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
mark sweet: We'll get it solved. But I haven't heard anything else from the other. Firm, which.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
mark sweet: Just more pisses me off.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, cause, they.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
mark sweet: They dropped the ball, but I I. I think it'll be okay. I'm just trying not to be naive about it, because.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
mark sweet: Lawyers, light. Talk each other over, but I'm just trying to stay positive about it.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:59.000
mark sweet: None of us know enough about the case to know the value of it, but. It's sub 50 grand. So I mean, even at the end of the day, if I got to write a 50 grand check, it's not gonna be in the world, but I don't think it's worth that.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
mark sweet: So we'll see.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Tina Marie: Does and know. So he's not like, what are you guys talking about?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Dan Ryan: I do not.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
mark sweet: Uh. Lorenz, one of my attorneys, tried to do a favor for a friend.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Dan Ryan: Uh-oh.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
mark sweet: Yeah, that. That's the. Sort of it. Uh, let this other law firm file a lawsuit, using his like login stuff.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.000
mark sweet: And so they just pulled this bar information from online, which, of course, is tied to sweet law. And said, law, firm.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000
mark sweet: Just didn't do anything after filing lawsuits who got dismissed with prejudice. Because if you don't serve or go to any hearings or anything else. You have a problem.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
mark sweet: And then drop the client which. You know you screw up you uh pay the client to go away.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:48.000
mark sweet: They didn't. They just dropped the client and still texting client. How's your treatment going uh? So. Yeah, this law firm is like, this is the wife of my physical therapist, and what the F.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Dan Ryan: What?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So Lorenz, trying to do a favor for Buddy, and this is how it goes.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Dan Ryan: Good grief.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:09.000
mark sweet: So we get this harsh, harsh, harsh letter of you committed malpractice. Tell me your Malpractice insurance company is, and. Like. I can't even find this client in our system. Lawrence. What the hell.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Dan Ryan: Oh!

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
mark sweet: And. Yeah.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
mark sweet: The heart just. Suck, but.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Tina Marie: Do you know that your closing time is just getting longer and longer. Across the board.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
mark sweet: What do you mean?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Tina Marie: Days to close and days to resolution.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
mark sweet: Okay. Is the data accurate?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Tina Marie: I don't know, but I do look at this often, so I've been watching it. Um, but I I don't know if it's accurate. That's definitely something to look into.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
mark sweet: And then I wonder how many of these are litigation cases.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Tina Marie: Well. Um.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Tina Marie: That would be specified, wouldn't it? Because it'd be in.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
mark sweet: Yeah, shoot me.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Tina Marie: Not Tyler Nick's. So.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all. Cases close by team. This is.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Tina Marie: This year, and. It's refreshed.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. So all your case is closed for.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Tina Marie: Where we are. We're in. End of April.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Tina Marie: All of last year was 738 cases closed. So far this year is 250.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Tina Marie: Cheap. Guess is probably about on pace.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Tina Marie: Um. Cases closed by team for this year.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Tina Marie: 90 like like just looking at these numbers here and then cases resolved.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Tina Marie: Um. Teams. We'll go back. We're actually gonna go back to last year.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Tina Marie: Is what I want to do. So do this. Last year and go look at some other people real quick.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Tina Marie: Last year. Oh, 7, 41.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so then. Cases closed by team.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I was looking at Tyler. Tyler looked like he was standing out a little bit. Um as.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Tina Marie: Slugging in that particular area, but I don't know. I don't know. How different his cases are! Um.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: That's interesting average days to close. So I just want to look at these numbers and then compare to this year. We're only 4 months in.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Tina Marie: And. The.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: Amount of time that that takes into account. I don't. Know how much that skews the numbers.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Tina Marie: So, but looking like.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
mark sweet: A couple of cases can really really tweak it.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tina Marie: So it's good. Right, I am aware of that. So and.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Tina Marie: When they close and resolve, it changes everything pretty quickly, so. Um anyway.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Tina Marie: But let's look at that, and then the other thing is. So we're in last year.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Tina Marie: What was the. Um average fee.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Tina Marie: Last year. 1113, 14? What.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
mark sweet: Average has definitely gone up.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, we're about to go. Compare that. But I that's what I want to do. Real quick is, just look at something. So this is for all of last year, not just like last quarter. We'll do this year, you know what? Let's just do.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Tina Marie: No, we don't have in here, which I would really love to have in here is like 6 months last 6 months. To get a better date.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
mark sweet: You know you might want to do is right. Click on dashboards.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Tina Marie: You.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
mark sweet: And just open it up again, up on top.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Right click on dashboards.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
mark sweet: Uh versus dashboard self and just open a new tab that way. You can kind of put them.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:37.000
mark sweet: It's like.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Tina Marie: Um. See.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Tina Marie: This. See here!

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Tina Marie: Do you know how I could change this quickly to get it for 6 months. If I go to edit. Can I do that? Do you think.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: Last 6 months.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
mark sweet: Uh! I have no idea.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
mark sweet: Cause. I didn't know how he built this side of it.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. Um.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So we're gonna look at this. Average fee by team (111) 314-1913. This was last year.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Tina Marie: It went from 11 to 13. These don't seem like they changed much.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Tina Marie: 1314, 1913. That was 1314.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Tina Marie: That was 19. No, that was 13. So Tyler went up. Samantha went down again.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Tina Marie: This is not the same time period. That's all of last year versus the last.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Tina Marie: 4 months, basically.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Tina Marie: Team, nick. 11.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Tina Marie: Last year.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
mark sweet: Mixed up. I couldn't even look at. This is just so. Fluctuate.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Tina Marie: Um days to close is well, then, is there anything worth looking at here?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
mark sweet: Um, no, I think there are the. That fee, I think, is worth looking at.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Tina Marie: That's what I was looking at.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
mark sweet: The. Yeah, the average just to close ankle give you some idea.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
mark sweet: And if you scroll down. Um.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:33.000
mark sweet: The resolution. Speed, I think, should be okay, but the average days to close should give you a little bit more of a accurate number. That's where they were over here.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so. That's what I was saying, went up.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Tina Marie: Across the board.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, let's do this. This.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Tina Marie: Just one sec. That won't work.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Tina Marie: Never mind. It doesn't.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't. Shrink the way that I want it to.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Anyway. Well, let me.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Tina Marie: Back in here. Alright um.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Tina Marie: Dropouts and sub outs. So that's all of last year.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Tina Marie: About 1 3.rd Approaching.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Tina Marie: 2. In April.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Tina Marie: Let's do this. I don't know how to do that. I want to do like last year previous to date, new. I wonder if Chat TV can tell me how to like change these things.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Tina Marie: And maybe I could have a sandbox report that I can play with, or just a. Dashboard that I create. So it doesn't mess anybody's anything up.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Tina Marie: If that would be okay. Out!

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Tina Marie: Tell you what I learned, and you can tell me if it's okay to try it. Would that work.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Tina Marie: Cause, then if. Internally, we know how to use this better without having to go to a 3rd person. That would be a lot faster.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Tina Marie: And I'm willing to spend the time to learn it. Um.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Tina Marie: Gross attorney fee. So let's just. Do.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Tina Marie: See. What's the.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Tina Marie: Is there any way to look at this that would be comparable that would make any sense to look at gross attorney fees. In terms of like trajectory.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Tina Marie: Because.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
mark sweet: Problem.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
mark sweet: Probably not right now.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Tina Marie: All right. Mm.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Tina Marie: So, anyway, this is something to look into.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
mark sweet: Yeah, we definitely need to. Drill down on some of this. It's not good.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Tina Marie: No, that's significant. Um.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Tina Marie: And. I probably should have said something. I've seen it happening, but.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Tina Marie: I just assumed that. Part of it was.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Tina Marie: The period of time that I'm looking at, and that it's hard to tell, and everything takes a while. But.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Tina Marie: Because it just keeps getting longer every time that I look at it, either the data is wrong or something is changing, and cases are taking longer across the board, across States. Which would mean, it's.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Tina Marie: Probably internal. Unless.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tina Marie: The whole world. Just slow down. Which is possible, I guess.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Tina Marie: But this is something. That is costing you money.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
mark sweet: Well. Hmm.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
mark sweet: Yeah. I'm wondering.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:35.000
mark sweet: It's using. There may be a reason for that. Outside of all of this.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
mark sweet: And we've been doing a lot more what's called health and Trust, where we're holding some of the money. Um.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: Like pending, let's say, a health insurance lien or something else. So we get the bulk of money to the client. But the case doesn't close until it's all done done.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
mark sweet: And so I'm wondering if.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay, well, let's compare resolution speeds then, and see if they have changed, because then it shouldn't. It shouldn't affect resolution. Right? Because that's settlement.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
mark sweet: No. Uh.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
mark sweet: The Resolution date shouldn't change. The days open to close would.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Tina Marie: Right. That's what I just said.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so let let me um compare. So.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Tina Marie: 3, 25, 1, 62, 3, 0, 8, 3, 10. 3, 58, 1, 96, 3, 43, 3, 56. That definitely went up.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Tina Marie: So Samantha will use her because she's the top. Hers went up from 3 0. 2 to 3, 43.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Tina Marie: So 41 days, which is. Significant. Tyler's went up.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
mark sweet: Like, 10%. So yeah.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Tina Marie: 43 days. Yeah. Patrick is not really.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Tina Marie: And Lorenz 3, 25. He went up the least amount of days actually. He only went up 20.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Tina Marie: 3 days. Samantha went up 41.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Tina Marie: And Tyler 46. So.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Tina Marie: I think you need to do some digging into this.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tina Marie: What I would ask you is, how will you dig into it? What priority is it? Because I'm gonna tell you right that way? I mean.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Tina Marie: It's. It's easy. To understand the correlation. It may not be easy to calculate the math exactly.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Tina Marie: But you know that if it takes you. On average 30 days longer to get paid.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Tina Marie: That's costing you money. Um especially, and that gap is growing right, that that's a trajectory.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Tina Marie: It's getting longer and longer and longer. Why?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Tina Marie: Um? Is it something you can fix. How come, nobody noticed.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Tina Marie: How come no.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
mark sweet: Well, I have a pretty good idea of why.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Tina Marie: Why?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
mark sweet: We up the Caseloads for each person we lost Hank, but his Caseload into everything else, and up to everyone else.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
mark sweet: Mork says Jaron is going to slow him down.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Dan Ryan: It could be none of that. Right. It's like you. You just need to dig into it right without any assumptions, because it could.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Dan Ryan: Then the next question would be like, Are all these cases worth more.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Tina Marie: Also. It's not Hank, because it happened before Hank left. I told you it's been happening. I've been watching it.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
mark sweet: Okay, yeah. But we have been upping our kids.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Tina Marie: So. The other thing I would tell you is, somebody's not looking at this often enough.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
mark sweet: I very agree.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Tina Marie: The 1st somebody would be you.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Dan Ryan: Who.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Tina Marie: I'm. I mean.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Tina Marie: There's 1 person at the home, and that the whole issue that we keep pointing out is that you're the only one that. We'll do it internally, like I can help you with things. But I get 1 HA week with you. That's it.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Tina Marie: So I can't. Do very much in that amount of time to help you. You need somebody.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Tina Marie: Who is going to look at it? Have the time to talk to. You have the time to.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Tina Marie: Actually work on something, and not just like, bring it up, but work into it. And that doesn't exist, and it hasn't for the last 4 years that we've talked.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Tina Marie: And there's no plan in sight for that to happen anytime soon. So. It's gonna continue to be an issue.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Tina Marie: To solve that. Solving that.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Tina Marie: Makes everything else. So much easier like that is your biggest lever.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Tina Marie: Having more time on the the numbers and. What's happening internally, that has the greatest impact on money.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Tina Marie: And you not being the one to do all the things.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Tina Marie: Is there anything we can do to help you get there? Faster!

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Tina Marie: Like what needs to happen for that to happen.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
mark sweet: Meth.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Tina Marie: Did you just say meth.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Dan Ryan: He said math math.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
mark sweet: Nope, I said math.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Dan Ryan: No, it was math.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
mark sweet: No means.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Tina Marie: No, the math is the problem. He thinks math is the solution.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Dan Ryan: That was the right answer. That was the right answer. Math is not the right answer. Math is.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Dan Ryan: Sir.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
mark sweet: Not according to my clients. It's their solution for you. With it.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Dan Ryan: Hey!

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Dan Ryan: Jesse put down the pipe.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah, this is definitely some that I'm gonna bring up in our weekly meeting with the attorneys. Cause this is. Concerning.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. But again I it. I don't know that you can PIN it on them.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Dan Ryan: So it's like. It, it.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Dan Ryan: Is it even a problem? It's something that's happening. But is it a problem? Right? Because then you would.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Dan Ryan: You would say at the same over that same period of time. Did the average case value go up right?

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Dan Ryan: So it's like, what is the metric? That is a metric. But is it a metric that matters? It's a metric that we put forth. To track, because for whatever reason, right? Because the.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Dan Ryan: That was something that you were looking at, and you had pointed out. But it's like, okay, if the cases are taking 30 more days, but they're worth $10,000 more per case.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Dan Ryan: Then, is it a problem.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
mark sweet: That. Our average 14.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Tina Marie: Well, I'll point out one anomaly. One person's average fees went up.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Tina Marie: And speed to resolution went down. Guess who that was.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
mark sweet: Knows Lorenz.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Tina Marie: That was Lorenz. Guess what the common denominator is.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
mark sweet: Also. He had 2 very, very large cases.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
mark sweet: So when you have a million dollar key.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Tina Marie: That is true.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
mark sweet: A half 1 million dollar data.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Tina Marie: That is definitely true.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Tina Marie: So. But now, all of last year, though, did nobody have any very large cases all of last year.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
mark sweet: He did not. Tyler had one.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Tina Marie: Right. Okay. So Tyler, let's look at Tyler's number. Then.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:51.000
mark sweet: No, what's worrying me is I get what Dan is saying. If I look at the average fee by team. They're generally not. Uh. Sam's down from a 19 to a 14. Patrick's down from a 14 to 11.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Dan Ryan: Good.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:58.000
mark sweet: So if the average fee was up, but it was taking longer. That's a decision. Whether I'm okay with that or not. Generally, I'm surprised with yes.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
mark sweet: Here, if it's taking longer, and we're getting less. That's far worse.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Dan Ryan: Alright, that's a double. That's a double whammy. Yeah.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Tina Marie: The point that I'm trying to make is that and I could be wrong. I could have 0 impact on how profitable Lorenz is to you. But the systematic approach that we've had to him managing his stuff.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Tina Marie: Appears to be working. What would happen if you put that kind of effort into the rest of the attorneys.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000
mark sweet: Was interesting. Looking at those cases closed by team. Cause we're.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000
mark sweet: A quarter or 4 months in right. So we multiply these numbers by 3. Or no.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Tina Marie: No, that's an average.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
mark sweet: No, no! Look at cases close by. Team. Right.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Tina Marie: Oh, number of cases caused by zoom. Okay.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
mark sweet: No. Yeah. So like Lauren's at 95 for the year.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Tina Marie: Wait where? Oh, I'm I'm sorry I'm on the wrong tab.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
mark sweet: And he was like. Yeah, up on top of the 3rd one.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
mark sweet: Is this close with me? So that 95 last year he did 2 17, so I put him at close to 300 for the year.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:16.000
mark sweet: Scrape. Patrick's at 56 last year he did 1 17 that put him at 1 50 ish.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:25.000
mark sweet: Sam's at 1 0. 6, at 2, 34 last year, so that put over at 300 for the year. So they're closing more cases, which is.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
mark sweet: Good. But.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Dan Ryan: These don't. Yeah. Th, this is all warring with each other. You're like, Oh, no, that's good. But then. They're worthless.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Dan Ryan: Like you're closing more that are worth less. So then you want to go like even further downstream. Right this. Now I'm like, where's Josh? It's like.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Dan Ryan: What data needs to be looked at. What's really the problem? Because I'm like, I'm not really sure what the problem is.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Tina Marie: I will spend a couple of hours this week going through what I can with. Ah!

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Tina Marie: AI, and look at the different ways that we can look at the data. And point out what the limitations are.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Tina Marie: Um. For example, how long the cases just take to close in general.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Tina Marie: What our reporting structure ability is right. I can't look at, you know. Year to date last year year to date.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Tina Marie: Previous year. That type like apples to apples in terms of like. You know, periods of time.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Tina Marie: That are big enough to measure. In terms of.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Tina Marie: Current year. Right? So I can look at. 3 years ago, 2 years ago. I can't look at one year ago I can look at last year.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Tina Marie: Which is not the same as one year ago. So um! Looking at all of that and looking at the limitations. Um.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Tina Marie: And the fact that there are outlier cases that can happen. That change.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Tina Marie: The resolution speed significantly. If a case was just dead, for, like. Lorenz had all these old cases that were not in the beginning. They were not being handled. Well.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Tina Marie: Right. So he finally cracked the whip on everybody, and now they're getting stuff taken care of. That hadn't been taken care of. And now all these old cases closed which jacked up his resolution time significantly, like 30 days in one week. Um because it skewed his average. So I need to explain that to AI like these things can happen.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Tina Marie: What is the best way? To be able to look at this data and notice a trend that actually means something.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Tina Marie: Measurable and significant, including pointing out, are there any alarming issues. And.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Tina Marie: If they are, what are they, and to what percentage of confidence that we have, that this is an actual issue, that you know. Either way, you're still going to have to dig into it. But the 1st thing I would do is ask the attorneys like. Um, how's everybody feeling about case resolution time cases closed? Does anybody notice anything? And I would not ask it in email, I would look them all in the same face at the same time.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tina Marie: However, you can do that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
mark sweet: It's gonna be our zoom call on Wednesday.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so right off the top of your head. Eyes on me. Don't look at your screen. Don't talk to each other. What do you know? Because I bet you.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Tina Marie: Nobody knows that things are taking longer.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.000
mark sweet: No.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Dan Ryan: And they know this.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Tina Marie: Yes, this dashboard. They they have these reports. They can look at.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Dan Ryan: I don't know. I don't know.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Tina Marie: They can't look at this dashboard, but they can. They can look. At their average close time.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Dan Ryan: You can.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Tina Marie: Yes, they can.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Dan Ryan: I didn't know that.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
mark sweet: Okay. I am 3 min late for another meeting, and I'm sure Dan is too.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Dan Ryan: Uh. So I was, gonna say this, the only other thing to think of. The one thing that popped my head is what other thing changed.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Dan Ryan: That could be. Involved in this, and the only thing that came to my mind for me was Walker, has become a more significant lead source. Therefore.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Dan Ryan: Do. Walker's cases take longer to settle, which is thus.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Dan Ryan: Causing this. And is it a bad thing? I don't know.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Dan Ryan: I am.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
mark sweet: Uh, we're way upping our walker starting next month. So there's gonna be a lot more leads.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, but it could be. It's like.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Tina Marie: Right, but that only makes his point even more significant.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Knowing what Walker is, they're just regular cases. So I.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Dan Ryan: But they could have longer average resolution. Times. That affect the.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
mark sweet: Yeah. No.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Dan Ryan: The entire pool.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
mark sweet: Okay, I'm literally super late for this meeting. But yes.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Dan Ryan: All right.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Tina Marie: Bye. Bye, you've got one, too.
