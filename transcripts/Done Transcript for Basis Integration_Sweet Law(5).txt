00:00:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, can you hear me?
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? How are you doing?
00:00:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Getting a little tired of all the body blows. Gotta be honest. Been a lot of stuff for the last two or three weeks.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on?
00:00:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We have the Washington Bar Company, the New Mexico lawsuit in Bar Company. Tyler potentially missing the statue. Tyler slash Nate slash cat. Potentially missing the statue. Friday getting an earful from Sweet James because they also signed the client of ours and got mad that we were trying to write their name when that wasn't the case, so we're hearing that out at 12 today, but that's a minimum $200,000 loss for me, which sucks. It is what it is. And we kind of like... The survey cases that are relatively new, email us, tell us that they don't want to be represented in. And what about HQ intake? We're still sending our leads to HQ intake and they're going to us, so we're doing double work. So it's just getting the point where it's a lot.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, what's good?
00:01:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, great to have a big check last month. That's always good. We've signed up a good number of cases last month, despite having a lot of drops and subouts, so that's still good. We put together a new incentive plan that we rolled out to the staff, so it should be good. Obviously, it costs us money, but hopefully we'll get everyone incentivized to try to get the goals together. Oh, I took a new job with a pain doctor, so that'll be good for her. And yeah, that's what I got.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about the incentive plan, and is that going to increase payroll?
00:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. By about 15 grand a month.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A percentage is that.
00:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Payroll or.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Total so payroll was around 37% what's it now?
00:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have last month number yet. Because it's on the bed, so there's still. I know that her payroll last month was really high and give you a rough estimate of what it was.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, we also have someone trying to commit fraud against her trust account. So that's cool. Sorry, Arizona. Trying to pay their gas belt with our. Where they're trusted, yeah.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Awesome.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's. Okay. Okay.
00:04:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, we were. California was two. Seventy eight before taxes and everything else. They were buying good taxes. Oh, the employee benefits, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And You $409,113.
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was your revenue for July?
00:06:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
$1.1. $1. $1. So, I'm, is this short?
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, now we're 40 percent and when did that get rolled out?
00:07:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Thursday. So, yeah, sign in this.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, what's changed in the structure?
00:08:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They hit both money angle and settlements, it's a thousand of each person. If they want hit one of them, it's 500.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the stats on hitting those goals across the teams.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It hit it three or four months this year. It's not every time, but it's frequent enough that it's not impossible, I guess. It's definitely doable. I think done it multiple times. Thanks
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't think that that's, I think it's a good thing to me. I mean, obviously, you did too because you did it, but that makes sense to me, that I mean, I guess it just depends on how much revenue difference that makes money and goals and settlement.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the settlement goal? Three million.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The logic is not every case that settles you're going to paid out right away, just because it takes We made it clear that the goals will increase over time. Right. We're adding more people. or adding more states, writing more cases, like it's not going to stay this way.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will the payment increase or just the expectations?
00:10:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think just the expectations because quite frankly, for adding more people and more teams, it's hard to justify increasing the amount per person when we're adding more people. It doesn't make sense.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to, I assume that you would have had a conversation with your attorneys about this. So wait, let me ask this first of all, in Patrick's team probably won't even have enough to get to those goals. It's a real wide goal. And then the attorneys that are already paying out of pocket for their teams for their incentive program or are they going to Okay, this what?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
This is separate from that.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I what I was asking is, would you think that they're going to pull back what they're already doing or keep that the same?
00:11:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to them and they've all said they're going to keep the same.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so who does that besides Samantha and Marin's?
00:11:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nick doesn't because it doesn't really make sense given their volume. Patrick isn't on a percentage. So it wouldn't make sense for him to do it and Hank doesn't. Again, a percentage to noon.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. This doesn't take away from them. I wouldn't see why they would do it other than just being short-sighted and thinking that that would be How much do they pay out, do you know individually each month to their teams and internet programs?
00:12:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know exactly. Sam's a little better because she gives part of her quarterly bonus to them. She has 6,000 divided by her team and she'll pull us out like during the month. Tyler is more ad hoc. I think he's probably giving his team a round of grand that total.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the people I have on Samantha's team is Thelma, Valerie, Victoria, and Jalissa.
00:12:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that still correct? No, Jalissa never wanted, never ended moving over. She made more money doing it and take the script.
00:12:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so does she only have three people?
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's got Liz helping her a little bit. we've got Liz training with her before that is kind of cool. time would think.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And in what role? Can you send it right?
00:13:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Just helping. Yeah. I was Hank doing.
00:13:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, we've got a standing meeting every Wednesday to go through his cases and what's going on. So I talked a little bit on Wednesday last week, um, going through his cases, kind of how these are built. New cases look okay. he's just trying to scrape some of these, you know, crack their cases through. Uh, he had, not a complaint, but, you know, said it was a little tough with him in the same office, even though the office is made for four people. Um, just because sometimes they're working around. each other and we get a little loud if they're both on the phone, so we end up just getting her a separate office. They're on like a scene like what they're near each other.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that gonna cost you different?
00:14:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
600 bucks a month. It's not enough to worry about to keep two people happy. I would agree. One thing he did say, which I did find interesting and was actually kind of also anyway, he said that clients have been showing up to the office, like they want to come in more. And so I was talking to Steve, he's like, yeah, our Phoenix office, like clients love to come in. Like it's weird, no other place they do that, but in the Phoenix area they love to come in. So, I think longer term is actually a good thing having a Phoenix office, so it should help us with retention and hopefully with the hurdles.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or be more of a bottleneck because it slows things down and people get more chatty. That be interesting to see if there's less sub-out or if there's more referrals from the Phoenix office from previous customers, things like that, would be really interesting to see how, what the correlations are to anything, very interesting, so let me go look at this. Pink's not even on the team, and I look at matters by team, hold on, yeah, that's this year.
00:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we started to give them about one or two new cases a week.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first thing you said before giving one or two?
00:16:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You have some because it's getting one or two weeks, so it definitely has cases.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Screen to real quick. So this is one of the newer reports that. Did he actually say is the newest report I think. So I don't know how accurate this is or. it was made from zoom out of the way more. Okay, so these are the teams, it's finding, how would I see what criteria this report is using? If I edit, maybe.
00:17:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's probably not going to the resolution closed because he's just starting to get his own cases.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, let's see, okay, so it probably just wouldn't even be in here.
00:17:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Also, it looks like he doesn't have his own matter team as he's principal, so I'll talk about that.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh. Got that.
00:17:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, if you wanted to, like, map.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a report?
00:18:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, just letter in general.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, sorry, where do you mean?
00:18:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's home, chatter. Oh, yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then I recently viewed if you just click where it says you're telling you to left.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:18:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then just type in hang. Yep. You can see his list.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So he's got a 50. And status, no.
00:18:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, they're not using that thing. Progatory was what was supposed to be for soccer to take a look at.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just think it's funny.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the file but the offers aren't good enough to take so it's okay.
00:19:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, just making it this. I haven't like did this report like this before so that was interesting. All right, so we can probably stop screen sharing and hey, have you heard from Fuji today?
00:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Today?
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, he, oh, okay, he slept through his alarms.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He missed my call, so.
00:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you baby. Yeah, I'm not mad about it. figured I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something bad. So, you know, mean, new babies are something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We talked to him again because he got his car. He was doing drier than having fun.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, No, and I heard from him yesterday, but he he messaged that he just messaged. I just thought that he slept through his alarm. So it's okay. I'll check in with him. just want to make sure they were okay. So, um, okay, so new incentive program. That's good. You about how are I said, how are you doing? And you're like, okay, body blows, all that stuff. overall, really, how do you feel Um, trying to think of how to formulate that question right now, it just feels little demoralizing, right?
00:20:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's just like, you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and Definitely feel like you're moving backwards to some level. What's the point of doing all this stuff and having all this stress when it's just, you know, making progress? Um, it sure lives. I'll get over it. It's just All I want
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, comes in waves like that's exactly right that's exactly right. So, um, I mean, that's, that's perfect. That's just, did I tell you we had another accident? My, my daughter caught in another accident. So we have three, three and three weeks. I'm a place where you can't do any help. Anyway, point being that the craziness, that's exactly how it happens. It's just their seasons, ebbs and flows, and it's wild, but your perspective of, of that, that that that comes and goes being able to recognize that being able to put that into perspective and not let it overwhelm you. I mean, you can't not feel the things you've. can be numb, but that doesn't really serve a good function because then you can't block out specific feelings, you block everything or nothing. I mean, effectively. So just being able to put that into perspective. So last week, hold on, we started talking about that. That's not even the right note, the heck. Um, goals. Did you read Emith again? Or did I ever have you read it? I feel like you said you had read it once before.
00:22:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's two books.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emith I have. not read not So, you still have it?
00:23:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I already, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
00:23:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you can just say that for like what I'm traveling, it's just easy to, you know.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you have a target for when that can happen? Probably next week. Because I'm traveling next week. And when was the last time you read EMIS?
00:23:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's been a while. I just remember there's like an entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. And like you can be all three, but really focus on one of them. And become good at it and make sure you have the other two.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go find mine and remind myself.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
is about like the person who wants to like know more. So the person who like works on your business instead of in your business, is always big.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go to my librarian. It's been a while since I read it, too, in that way. And it's always interesting, though, too, that people pick different things out of books. Now I'm trying to remember where I'm going to find my notes, though. where we landed on just talking about the goals, although I think where you want to go with your business and that's not solidified and we talked about purpose a little bit and then I asked you some questions. let me go back to that because that was offline so I didn't put it in my notes and I need to. And you did not reply back to me. So I asked, what did you think about those two things that I mentioned?
00:25:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that was better than people. It's just a short answer.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it?
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dogs are better than people.
00:26:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't hear you disagreeing. Okay, so I mean dogs can be your purpose. That's not a judgment. I just am looking for specificity. And I would like you to work on that and generally the reasons that will resist specificity around purpose will be internal judgment or fear of external judgment.
00:26:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't want someone else to go through what I went through and if they have to to have the easier route than what I wonder. It's really what it comes down to. So these are good people generally speaking who want to make the world a better place and they have skills and talents that I don't have. And so if I can bring something to it to connect these things and to help, then it's what I want to do.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you realize what you're prioritizing there? That it's not dogs.
00:27:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is to some level because it's the overall goal. These are the people that I would need to be able to get the outcome that I'm looking for.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm missing something then. Oh, let me go like this.
00:27:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If you're trying to build a technical project, right? You'd want someone who's like a CTO. or someone who has a technical background, generally speaking, if you're trying to build some sort of new technology. In this situation, that would be the surgical vet or Sayaka for like better term.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, these are actually the two. So, of dogs, speaking of dogs. No, I missed my beach on so, oh, no, can't talk about that.
00:28:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll cry. I'm feeling. So, again, for me, if it's a way to help, and all these people come together because they have a skill that I don't have to try to get. it's the outcome that I want. Well, still, you know, there's advantages for me, right? There's tax advantages for the potential business that there's other things going on. It's not pure altruism. But, you know, the main motive here is not necessarily to make as much money as it possibly can for me.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I was just trying to sort though because there are two things that in what you were sharing with me is there having dogs that longer lives and have, you know, better quality lives, but also just because of what dogs give to people. the greater purpose to you is just, and this is not when I say just I don't mean it as a judgment at all. The primary focus would be on dogs. People take care of dogs so they don't get better quality lives unless people are taking care of them. the people are just kind of the means to an end and the end is just the best life for a dog. Yes, do I? Okay, um, yeah. So, and here's another question I haven't asked you about. What other businesses do you have the side suite? besides this, besides what you're doing with Fuji?
00:30:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's it.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is your interest in July medical?
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I work with them. like them. think he's a good person, but that's really it.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. So. There because it makes you happy to be there. Like working with them.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like them. good people.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just looking at again, this is no judgment. There's just like trying to figure out. So back to the business is ran by the person. What motivates you? does your time go? Like we haven't talked about time in a long time. We haven't really just, you know, kind of. um, broken down, like you, what you're doing specifically versus just sweet law. And if your time is going to other places, if your priority is elsewhere, or, um, one of the things that I like to look at is where can one action benefit multiple things, um, so just kind of trying to take everything to account. So how much time do you feel like you spend on July medical?
00:32:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can we separate out July medical versus who do you think?
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% and our conversations have nothing to do with those conversations.
00:32:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I understand. I'm just saying there's a large difference. July medical less than 1% of my time. Okay. Like, Hey, You know, there's the issue with the client or something else would be the only thing that comes up, but it's it's super rare. So it's not often Fuji I talked to I don't know four or five times a week Yeah, we just talk about everything I know he's had some business ideas for I stuff once my body like with record stuff Things in general. So, you know, I definitely spend A couple hours and we just talk to him, but I don't really think of that as business per se Yeah, that just sounds like friendship.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, okay Sweet lot how much time do you think you spend working on that?
00:33:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We haven't done any time tracking or So I spent a lot of time thinking about the business A lot Things are going in problems, efficiencies, in efficiencies, in efficiencies, and efficiencies, know, partnerships do we need? What are we lacking? What are we doing well? can we push? lot of time, obviously, on the financial side of what's our cost requisition, what's our end outcome, where are these numbers looking and that type of thing. But I would say it's been the vast majority of my week, you know, we're just working on one. You know, I say vastly, I would say 65 or 70 percent of my, like, weeking, getting a stinking out of it.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a scale of one to ten, you think about, because I kind of want to rank two different things. And I probably could formulate these better over time, but I'm trying to make a distinction between values. So, what I'm what I'm digging for is how much kind of joy and fulfillment and just value you feel like you get out of the business versus and separate from the level of success that you think that it has. Do you understand a little bit? It's not really and clear that I'm a little bit.
00:36:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.
00:47:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How do we just keep that going?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the other conversations have been really important. And that is, he wants to do cool things with cool people and he needs to be solving puzzles. So like, he may want to retire, but if he did, his puzzles would be music, making music. And so that would be his thing. And so everything that we do in terms of the other aspects of the business that we look like, we'll look at kind of run through that filter of what keeps him happy so that him. Because when he's happy as everything else works well and is more efficient, then he's better at leading and the cool things with cool people means that not cool people and not cool things have to get. out and there was a lot of that that had to be done. were lot of things that really didn't match his values and what he wanted. So anyway, but for you, dogs being so important, so special to you, and knowing that being human beings in life that more hard things will come up, being able to be intentional, organized, structured, strategic around that type of goal and just kind of lending some help to that if you're interested in it. I would like to do that because I feel like the natural consequence of that is sweet law is going to be better for it.
00:48:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I hear so much you're saying. You do, I'm sorry, would you say?
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. Okay, because I think it'd be happier, but the natural consequence of that is more creativity. There's scientific studies that oxytocin boosts creativity, boosts productivity, but the creativity part is really important because to me, your success in sweet life is about innovation. It's that you do things differently. You've always done it differently from the time it took over. And so if getting to spend time purposely, intentionally, consistently, weekly towards this passion project that also has the ability to be profitable, that also has the ability to potentially get you in position where you could be a venture capitalist and maybe an angel investor or maybe a startup counselor. consultant in maybe having an incubator company. I think that, I just think that creates almost kind of like a moat. Well, so we talked about the financial moat around your business. I think this is like an energy moat around the visionary, around you. Okay. So, um, and I know we're getting short on time, but this is what, okay, so let me just thinking about time. I still want to know what the heck Mary's husband is doing, because just keeps going. It's awesome.
00:50:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, you've been going and we're growing it slowly but surely, and I don't mind putting more money. into it if you keep getting the same type of results, right?
00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so also though, let me look at my calendar, because I would like to spend a little bit of time talking to you and why I say a little bit, it's probably at least 30 minutes to an hour about what I'm learning from Patrick and Lauren's. And then is that my smoke alarm? I really hope not. I've been battling those things, changed all of their batteries, reset them all. Yes. But I'm on a call. It's been oh my gosh, unplug them all. don't care. I'll call somebody. Yeah, it will not rip. But yeah. Yes please thank you. Okay so anyway that's something in my eye. So one of the things that I okay so so the unique thing about your business is that you don't have to be in the office and you're hardly around. That sounds wrong but anyway I don't know how much oversight there is and that that's unique to your business for me and I don't know how much of a limitation that is. It's okay so anyway that just means a customized approach to how you do the business because your value is that autonomy and being able to do what you want to with your time and and then creating the best business that you can within within within within those prime which then leads us back to the multiplier concept, which is create better leaders inside of Sweet Loss, so that you don't have to be, and so you don't have to be there, and they're just doing their jobs well, and you're basically just kind of the overseer and almost a consultant to these mini businesses inside of your business. That's kind of how I think matches in aligned with the things that you've told me about what you value. So then if I get to talk with these two business owners, one of them being new, almost like mini franchises inside because they have different offices, different teams, pods, things like that, just figuring out how you can do that, figuring out a system. that supports you not having to be there a lot and continual growth and improvement. So, what does that look like in terms of meetings with them or kind of training just what we're doing? Like, I feel like they're still not really walls in an outline of what that could look like, but it feels like it's coming into view a little bit. So, but our Monday calls, we do cover a lot. So, you said, I feel like you said third.
00:54:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, you can't do Thursdays, right? So, I can, yeah.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.

Okay. And next week, my Thursday is full. And then we capture that.
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Here's a, I have to suffer and go driving courses with some one between 1230 and 230.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, poor Mark, I'm so sorry.
00:55:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's very difficult.
00:55:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you, now if you, um, to take a dog with you, that would even be more terrible.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I don't think the dog wouldn't like that. So you're, you're, getting thrown around the car pretty good.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, tiny cars. Yeah. Um, okay. How is Ronan, by the way, because somebody just never sent me pictures anymore.
00:55:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So really. Yeah, no, I spent most of my Sunday with him. Uh, he's really into the Olympics. He loves to watch it.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, hilarious. That is hilarious.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But yeah, he's, he's a big boy. He's, he's a little dog though, which is really problematic.
00:55:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are your Tuesdays?
00:55:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, Tuesdays are usually fun.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how about Tuesday? at 13th. Next Tuesday.
00:56:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, should be fine.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and 10, 11.
00:56:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely pretty wide open. So what will three in?
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's make it this time. 11. I like mornings to be productive, like, use my brain, before I start talking. Speaking of using my brain, it does not want to work right now. Okay, Mark, there we go. Sweet. My. Is that for 13th? Yeah, okay. So that will work. And then, okay, so you're going to revisit Emith and rebuild the cell.
00:57:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I read both the cell first and then I'll revisit Emith.
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I will as well. And then I just have, I need to formulate just kind of a structure. Now, now that I know that we can have some other discussions kind of try to create that call format so that it's productive as it can be. yeah, the goal is just, I think, I guess what I would like is for you to kind of contemplate ponder on what it would look like to be. just if you had interest in it, maybe an investor and consultant. And what do you intuitively feel like that timeline looks like for you? And if you could create this company for, do you have a name for it or anything? You're that vision? Okay. So, just maybe putting a little bit more specificity into it. Dang it, I was what that could look like is it? I mean, because I see so many potential tangents. of creating medical programs that are training for doctors who have an interest in being specialists, trained by specialists, so that somebody doesn't have to fly to Japan to get their dog, you know, help, as well as the dog food. You know, there's so many different components to it where it could be, you're somehow involved in multiple aspects of what can affect dog health from, you know, taking care of the dog with the diet, the food, but also medical, medical care, I mean, even, I don't know, I've calmed down because then my visionary brain kicks in and thinks about all kinds of things. anyway, just ponder it a little bit more. see if you can put any more specifics on to like just let yourself dream the biggest thing and not necessarily say this is not possible this is possible or probable or likely or any of those things and just what like what would you dream about if you just let yourself dream and let's talk about that and then um so yeah there's too much of my head about this right now have to like let's end right now because i gotta make the phone call okay let's do the thing from last week so let's end out okay
