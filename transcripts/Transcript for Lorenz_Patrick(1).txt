00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there's a round. Patrick, can you talk so I can see if I can hear you? There we go. How are you guys?
00:00:25 - patrick
Good. are you?
00:00:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good. Can I get a new puppy to my row?
00:00:31 - patrick
Oh, yeah.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so excited. Yeah. Except it's gonna be a long, long day.
00:00:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Long night, too. Usually don't sleep the first night, right? Okay. are muted.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did that on accident. I don't know. Anyway, I got him this little stuffed doggy and it has a pocket for the this little thing that makes the sound of a heartbeat and it vibrates and it has another little pocket so you could put this warming thing in it. You know, have you ever had hot hands? You guys don't live in cold climates still. don't know if you know what they are. But they're these like iron pyrite or something like that. Little packets that get warm for hours and anyway, so it'll be warm with a heartbeat for him because I'm a little extra bad. Hi, how was how was the sweet lot dinner? saw a very pretty picture of a bunch of good looking lawyers that marks at me. Do you guys have fun?
00:01:44 - patrick
Yeah, it was a good time.
00:01:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was good.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't mind me, this is my protein shake lunch. All right, so Patrick, what was it like a new client call go last week during our meeting?
00:02:00 - patrick
referral from an employee. She didn't speak English so I had to help but it was always the time. She basically told us this week that she doesn't want to treat so we dropped it but.
00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you missed our call for nothing? Good, I'm saying. I'm. Elle Renz, did you send out your State of the Union?
00:02:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I did more than sending it out.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
presented it yesterday. Oh, yeah. How'd that go?
00:02:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It went well. mean, you know, with those things, only time is going to tell, right? I think the general reception was pretty positive. I think I work with, you know, people that are overall, they're eager to grow. They're not the kind of people that just want to show up for our paycheck. So that's. That's good. think that's helpful for me to be surrounded with people like that. so, helpful for all of us. Yeah, no, it was well received. I set the standards pretty clearly. I told them that these are the new standards that are going to be measured against in terms of performance and that, you know, this is basically, this is all hands-on deck and we're going to be, you know, looking at 2025 as fitting the ground running. Our targets are pretty ambitious, but they're also, you know, it's not a pipe dream either. We can get there. I summon my best inner of the ball coach.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Did you show Mark your...
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Your letter I did not I'm not sure what his you know, he's on vacation at show now. don't don't had a meeting yesterday.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he does clock his time. Yeah, he he still works.
00:04:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay You're not gonna bother him.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He does not know how to turn his brain off.
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah Even right after his dad died.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
asked him if he wanted to miss the meeting. was the next day. He's like, nope I'll be there and like okay Yeah, I don't know that that was so much a work thing because he also Like don't know if it was Dolce or his dad Disappeared for a few weeks, but I Don't know I try to help people through things. So maybe it's a little bit different when I went with our meetings But he definitely does work and I think that you should send that I would love for Patrick to see it I was wanting to talk to you about doing something like that just more kind of like a summary of How
00:05:00 - patrick
Where you started in the beginning of the year, because you weren't even on your own at the beginning of the year, where you Patrick is still from. for a little bit.
00:05:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were. Wait a minute. Did you start off on your own in January?
00:05:18 - patrick
Pretty sure some get came on like late January. Unless it came in December.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, either way it is most of it. And so just kind of recapping basically. What's happened on the team this year, how it's changed and how it's changed by design. Not just your design, but maybe what other people have done, the wins, the setbacks, if any, how you handled the setbacks. What you're on pace to be doing and. 17, Patrick to 16, okay. team morale is great Patrick that's awesome. Let's see, improving and sending you medical reports. She gets instead of having you request them for her. I love being proactive about that. And then Cynthia is about to get caught up on tasks. It's a time off. All the supplies that any outstanding offers you have on cases of the closing. Are close to being filed. And don't accept much stuff. Next week. So, are people coming into the office next week? What's the schedule look like for operations for both of you?
00:08:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my expectations are always higher than reality, so I'm trying to manage my expectations as best as I can, that I'm going to be working Christmas Eve, you know, the day after, I think Christmas is a Thursday.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Didn't know Wednesday. This Wednesday.
00:08:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so I'm going to be working on the 26th and the 27th, but yeah, I fully expect people to fall in sick or, you know, have come in late or whatever, but you know, I don't want But my problem with, I like the holidays, know, it's a good time to spend with your family take a break and all that. But it's half, if you just, you know, if you just take out, check out for two weeks, that's half of the month that you're not serving clients.
00:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't have to check out for our two weeks, but you can check out for a couple of days and have, you know, you could. Yeah.
00:09:31 - patrick
What I told my team is like, this week, you know, normal, get as much as you can get done because next week, I mean, even if they are like ready to work, like doctor's offices are closed, adjusters are not available so I mean, might as well kind of write that wave to and just. Take it, please share and then come back to the next week already know.
00:09:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. What Lawrence?
00:09:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I actually take. that week between Christmas and a new year's of take-off. That's my yearly family holiday, family vacation. I usually go send you the other stuff like that.
00:10:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last week?
00:10:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, next week or the week after Christmas.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you're working harder during the week of Christmas because the week after you're taking some more time off, is that right?
00:10:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, because it's like there's, adjusters aren't there, medical providers aren't there, everything is closed, so you know, it's counterproductive.
00:10:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, so when you say Christmas Eve, are you talking about the day of or the night of Christmas Eve, you're going to be working?
00:10:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The day of.
00:10:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So you'll take Christmas off and then, um, yeah, I mean, you might consider just taking day after also and then come in and have a solid Friday and just kind of do some planning whatever and then take the weekend off or just just feel it out.
00:11:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, my here's here's my reasoning about those days. Okay, you know, if you're going to be working, you know, I'll just come in for a paycheck like there's ways that you can be productive during those hours like, you know, you can fax requests for records, you can leave voicemails so that you're the first call that the the adjuster makes when they get back into the office. You can draft demands, you can, you know, do things like that. There's things to do, it's not.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. All I want you to do is just balance things out and remember you get one life to live. And there are certain times. That you've been talking my wife? No, but we have something in common as women, as mothers in China, just I can't. I think that nurturing perspective that nurturing element helps us to put things in the perspective and that's the reality. So I'll tell you though, as a business professional and is a type A personality who's incredibly competitive, the thing that I've noticed is that there is, I call it a divine pace. It's bigger than me. Whatever you want to name it, there are things bigger than us. Now I'm a powerhouse even though don't know if I put too nothing, but I can make things happen and what I have learned is I can use my brute force and I chill out a little bit and acknowledge that there's a lot of things. that I can't control and I don't need to control them. So when I'm being throttled, but things outside of my control, right? So there is a collective shifting of pace and energy that happens at this time of year. And that is certainly outside of my control. I can brute force and be like, I'm gonna go like take advantage of this and get something done. Or I can take that energy and let it relax me. And enjoy time with my family and trust my ability to tap into the collective frenzied and surge of energy that happens after everybody gets back work. And when I've allowed myself to do that, instead of thinking, I gotta do this, I gotta do this, I gotta do that. was like, no, what I've got to do is be present. Because this time with my kids, these holidays, how many Christmases do you get one a year? you get it however many throughout your whole lifetime. And a lot of them aren't going to be that great. Anyway, you know, all of us have different things happening. Sometimes they happen on the holidays and completely shifts the energy. We'll have lots of relatives, lots of jobs, something throughout the years. So we don't have that many of these really special moments that again have a collectively powerful energy in a community, in your states, in your country, in the world. Like, there's not a lot of that. So slow down and pay attention to that and be present during it. And don't think, first of all, that your effort during a couple of those days is going to be enough to make such a difference that that difference will be more powerful than the memories that you make with your family, who's like, wow, I was like, fun that day. And he was really present. and playful and we built like just just whatever like I'm trying to think about where you're in Arizona you're not building snowmen but um you know you guys could do something special like if you have family traditions maybe you don't maybe you go make a family tradition but I'm telling you that there's also um because I am super competitive this slingshot effect now it started for me realizing it on Sundays so it was really hard for me to take the entire Sunday off as an entrepreneur as a business owner like I'm always thinking about the things that I have to do all the time but my my covenant with God is to honor the Sabbath day and to keep it holy and to keep it for a day of worshiping him of rest of strengthening family of strengthening my faith um but my brain was like I don't know how to just stop for a day and so it doesn't stop but what I do is I do tell myself stop and And so I focus on the things that matter most to me on a spiritual level. What happened though is once I started fully doing that, there was this surging energy that was happening kind of down low. And so when everybody else is like, I hate Mondays. I'm like, let's go. I've been waiting all weekend for this. Like, I'm on fire. Come on, come on, come on. I haven't had and so nothing was lost because my Mondays were so much more effective than they ever had been because I took the time off. So what I'm saying is that that you can you can use the energy of that polarity of I've got to do things, but I can't do it right now. And then just kind of slingshot, tension, building, pulling it back, pulling it back, pulling it it back. I can't. to be here, I'm going to be here. And then you get back to work like, all right, boom, boom, boom, boom. You're rested, you're restored, but also you're excited to do the things that you haven't been able to do for a while. So why don't you take this year to test it, have a little tiny faith in me, and that experience, and also that I've counseled many, many people to try something like that. And whether it's been ending work a few hours early to go be with the family, or taking naps, or there's always some kind of thing, right, where our brains are like, I got to work, I got to work, and there's the skills and this pressure, because we're not where we want to be, or where we're supposed to be, or whatever. And every time I've managed to talk somebody into taking that little bit of extra time, they have 100% every single time built that tension that I'm talking about and actually throttled them forward, rather than holding them back. and I'm going to tell it to both of you and the reasons we do it and the times that we do it can differ. Sometimes it's because you need to rest from overdoing it at the gym and your brain is like I got to go I got to go I got to go and your body's like me chill you like it sometimes if I work out too hard I have to sleep so normally I only need to sleep like seven and a half to eight hours. If I work out super heavy I have to sleep almost 10 hours for the next couple of days. It really ticks me off but when I lift super heavy like that I build muscle and I grow strength and I don't have to work out as frequently but also that muscle has been super productive in helping me not have pain. I have more energy also when you get sick the first thing that your body burns for fuel is muscle so I've got more of that so whenever there's something down like I've got all of these protective layers there's a lot of other things that muscle does for us cognitively. Um, so that little bit of extra sleep that I have to sacrifice has a massive benefit to me, health-wise, physiologically, mentally, emotionally, and just as a protective layer health-wise. So, perspective is that there's always trade-offs. And if you prioritize managing energy, right, rather than time, your time becomes more more efficiently because I almost send more bettors like them, more efficiently and effectively because you managed your energy best. Does that make sense to you guys?
00:19:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, think about it, and also anything that you can do to maximize energy will maximize your productivity. So, in terms of like spending time with family or friends, know, patro What's your family situation? I think I've asked before, but I don't remember.
00:20:05 - patrick
Single.
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but do you have like siblings, mom, dad, yeah, family postpartum. Yeah, and they probably want some time with you.
00:20:16 - patrick
Yeah, I mean, I look at this like end of the year is kind of like a freebie. Like, it's like a free chance for us, the team, everyone to kind of unwind and because if doctors aren't available, insurance isn't available, there's only so much you can do. So I would rather than chill out now while the whole kind of industry is chilled out and then once the new year starts, they're ready to go because I know like once October hits, they're all looking forward to the end of the year to kind of chill out. So if we push them and say, hey, you're gonna have to like go hard the whole month of December, then they're kind of feel like well, we've been waiting You know to kind of unwind throughout the year.
00:21:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna bring this up because I don't want to forget that you brought up a really, really great thing which is something that we do and it's creating these mental focal points and it and it really has an impact on managing energy. So How many times have you ever told yourself? I just got to get through this.
00:21:21 - patrick
Yeah, right?
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doesn't matter what this is It could be a physical pain Like for me, like I've had a lot of illnesses in my life had been drawn a lot and I have to look at it and I just breathe through it like if it if I'm surprised about it It stresses me out and I anticipate and I flinch But if I look at it and I just breathe that I feel like I just have seconds just seconds to endure the pain And it'll be over and then I'll get what I need to know because the blood tests are always about information We do it through like I just got to get through the next few hours. just got to get through this one project I just got to get through this week, whatever, but It's being able to have like a thing, a time, a point to anchor to that helps us. Okay, so you guys know about the drowning rat experiment? It's an experiment and hope is what it is. Okay, so they scientists and it's unethical, but it was done anyway, put a rat in water. And after about 15 minutes it drone, gave up in a drone. Now another rat put in there about 15 minutes when it started to sink, he grabbed it and that rat, I don't remember how long it was like 60 hours after that. It tried to tread water, it treaded water, it didn't try, it treaded water for 60 hours, 60 hours after 15 minutes. Okay, those multiples are insane. That's the value of hope. Now burn out. Is not quite the antithesis of hope, but it almost is burnout is I've got nothing left in the tank when you are Exhausted and fatigued mentally or physically First of all if you're mentally fatigued. You are physically fatigued They just go together if you are physically fatigued You are mentally fatigued because your brain can't function when everything else is depleted and it's just trying to survive so The power of hope is this brain over body kind of thing right where Because we've got adrenaline We've got these amazing chemicals are then our body dopamine serotonin all these endorphins that can't us through things But there's a point of fatigue adrenal fatigue, right? You guys are familiar with that? Okay, so when that kicks in your physical components your chemicals Can't overcome what's happening mentally or physically anymore. That's when you hit burnout when your body and your mind cannot push you through anymore. You have to have rest periods when you're in a high performing area where everybody's competing all the time and rest periods aren't something that are frequently encouraged and it's also not the natural tendency of the type of people that enter the industry to be restful. You're going to burnout. One of the most effective mindsets and tools that I give to people is teaching to manage energy and preventing burnout. We have talked about the systems, the optimization, the way to get more out of less but the entire purpose of all of that really is to prevent burnout so the operator, the person, the human being that is working can continue to show up because once you reach burnout recovery. It takes a long time, but it isn't just your physical and emotional self. It's everybody that's tied to you. Your team is going to suffer if you burn out your children, your family, your friends, whoever, whatever your stewardship is, whatever you're managing, whatever you have enough, you know, an influence in is going to suffer if you get burnt out. And so will that happen with your team and your people? So you need to make sure that they're not burnt out. So your approach, Patrick, I wouldn't use the language of a freebie, right? Because the competitor in me goes like, boy, no, no, I'm not really, but my point is is that language, everybody responds to the language differently. But what you're saying is true is that this, it's, you're saying in a different way, the same thing I said, there is a natural thing that's happening in the community. Everybody's slowing down. Why not take advantage of that and take that rest. and restoration, this is the same thing, right? That's what rest is short for. And allow yourself to kind of reset and to build your energy backup to restore another part with the rest, right, restore. And allow your team to do the same thing without guilt. Now here's the thing, if they feel this tension from you like, yeah, guess you can take the time off. Yeah, I guess you can take two or three days off. Okay, they don't actually get to take off because in the back of their mind, your attitude and your energy is stealing their rest because now they feel this stress like, well, runs won't seem to be there. That's probably be there, I'm not going to, but then they've got this friction. Well, guess what? They're not resting. They're not working, but they're also not resting. So you get no benefit. They get no benefit. There's not work or rest happening. So guess what? You're still closer to burnout with no natural rust period coming in. You hear me Lorenz? You understand?
00:27:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're saying I was Scrooge?
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not. Not at all. I'm saying that perspective comes from experience for the most part. Some people naturally innately a certain type of perspective. That's a gift. We all get different spiritual gifts, mental gifts, things like that, right? We all don't get the same ones. I am the kind of person that has to learn for myself. So if you tell me that running into a brick wall is going to hurt me, I'm going be like, no, it'll hurt you, but I'm powerful. So let me, oh, damn, that hurt. Wait, let me try it again. That's how I learn. I've got four kids who learn the same way. So, um, my mouth is dry. Water. I'm pretty.
00:28:00 - patrick
to see a family of four in Oregon is running into a big wall or at a time.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I have four strong-willed daughters and there's no testosterone to balance it out. Even the dogs were female for the longest time. So it's a little rough. Yeah, so I know I'm not saying your screws.
00:28:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm saying I think that you could benefit from a perspective shift and I see that and I see what you're saying because to me you know when I hear like the industry is taking a break I'm like great that's my that's my end to get a hustle when they sleep. Those people get heart attacks and divorces you want to join that crew?
00:28:52 - patrick
I get them too but if I let's show up on Christmas day right and I like no phone calls are going through. I'm like
00:29:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
should have just taken it they don't yeah but like it's hard because like sometimes I'll mark work on Christmas Day I'll see him on you know green doesn't mark half four kids no but I'm like why should he have to work and not me you know he doesn't have to for a mark sometimes work is therapy you cannot compare yourself to other people yeah but like I'm like you know it's you shouldn't have to carry all that way I'm so I'm gonna jump in and help out you know no you don't help people out by being like them you help people out by being the best version of yourself yeah the best version of yourself is the rested version is the one that is the best dad he can be and the best husband he can be no and I know you're right I'm not saying like I understand what you're saying I'm right. Anyway, I know you're you are right. Uh, it's just like trying to be right.
00:30:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I because honestly, I don't care what I want is the best for you. But here's what I know. The best thing for Mark is for you to get the best thing for you. When you come back, if you are allowed to take the time off and not feel guilty about it because Lorenz told Lorenz he should be working. And then you really get to soak up some good energy because Carrie's happy and the kids are happy and it filled your cup up to overflowing and you got to bring that to work on Monday. You're going to give Mark something amazing. You just didn't do it on the day off when he was in the office. But you wouldn't have been able to give him the same quality if you showed up because you feel like you want to. Then if you did the things you ought to want to family level and then come and filled up. and thankful knowing that you did the good, better best, best thing, right, and then showed up Monday and at Monday when you're in the office, you did the best thing in the office.
00:31:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I see that and I can tell, you know, I was trying to, you know, motivate my team and talk to them about how like, you know, discipline is doing the things we don't feel like doing, and they've become, it becomes habits over time. You know, and I could tell they were like, I need a break.
00:31:41 - patrick
See, I feel like if you kind of like, take their, they're looking forward to like next week, right, like it's not a secret. Yeah. you kind of take that away from them, then they're, they literally, I literally feel like they're just going to look like this in January, February, because now they're like, , now I've got 12 months to look forward to the next one.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Productivity will suffer. Here's the other thing.
00:32:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you familiar with the book Scrum? No.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go read it. There is all kinds of studies. The energy period. But what Scrum teaches is that, and there are collegiate peer-reviewed journals that have done these studies. But basically, productivity begins to suffer after 20 hours per week. Now.
00:32:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's Sutherland.
00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sound right. Let me go look at that. Is it red?
00:32:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
think it's red. Yeah. art of doing work, of doing twice the work and half the time.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. the thing is, speaking of innate gifts, a lot of these things I learned myself and then ended up reading books that like affirmed it. And there were studies there. So, so that was one of them. But. There is something to be said for the grunt work and the labor that needs to be done. We are not going to rebuild the work week in a law office. But what we can do is take advantage of the things that already exist and not pattern off their workaholics, by the way. Okay. Mark's a workaholic.
00:34:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've terrible examples throughout my career.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do better. Get better.
00:34:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We don't bring workaholic and I'm trying to recover. Patrick has much better habits than I do.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Patrick is like a chill pill, like he's a walking chill pill, sitting chill pill, I almost think.
00:34:49 - patrick
I'll work. But when I see an opportunity to, like, I'm an energy person too, like, I know, like, if I had to go balls to the wall, I'm not going to be as productive. throughout the year, like, you just can't sustain it, so why not just chill for a little bit? Go to an attorney dinner, relax, come back the next day, work, you know?
00:35:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, Lawrence, did you, like, if you ever ran, were you more long distance or sprinter?
00:35:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, I mean, I was a soccer player, so sprinting, you know?
00:35:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, me too.
00:35:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
did cross-country, but I hated every minute of it.

But could you, could you do it?
00:35:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I was, I got, like, I was in the last three routinely all season for cross-country.
00:35:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's more than I could do, because I would just literally die. I had to run a five K once in order to be able to play soccer, because I played soccer for 11 years, I coached for five. I was a sprinter, I was a powerhouse. Like, I got to the ball faster than anybody, if somebody made the mistake of not stopping, I did neither, even with my five foot two on my feet. They were going down, not me. Didn't matter how big the girl was. But then I needed to rest. And I have learned, and actually just how to train our explainers to me this year, that I did not realize that there is a, it's so weird how we mentally process things differently when we're more fast twitch fibers versus slow twitch, OK? So people that are composed of more slow twitch fibers tend to be the runners, the marathoners. But they're also like the teachers, the doctors, the people that work slower, steady pace, right? can be high performers in terms of they get the degrees because they can stay in school and sit still. Not me. I'm like, I'm always my leg is shaking. Something is moving constantly. I am energy. And I'm explosive energy. So the weight training and the things that work better for me than just being on a treadmill forever. I'm bored to tears, first of all, second of all, I just like just that powerful search and I work the same way. So first, one understanding about that is we're all going to work differently based off of our physiology and people don't even take that into account that you're genetically predisposed to operate a specific way. You might be balanced between fast twitch and slow twitch fibers. You might be right down the middle. We are all different. We're our compositions physically are different. So it affects us operationally, but on top of that, this is the thing though, as human beings with cerebral cortex, the frontal lobe, we have higher level thinking. We can, first of all, have an awareness of our composition and we can also learn how to tap into it, but then we have to make these choices and even to understand ourselves, much less manage ourselves. And part of it is letting go of the code that should have would have, right, need to be this. And just who am I, embrace that fact, and then optimize who you are and how you operate. But guilt and shame is not any kind of optimization, one sec. Hi, my daughter. So guilt and shame serves like no purpose. Other than like a tiny awareness of I need to improve. So we all need to have kind of some being called out some admonition, right? Like you could do better and an invitation to do better. But beyond that point, beyond the helping us to do better when when it comes to. Instead, a noose around the neck, then it's not helping anything. When it's robbing you of go back to Christmas time, right, enjoying time with family and being productive at work, you just choked yourself out for no reason. You got none of the benefits. Make sense?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Time to realize I've been doing that with my adjusters too. I've been, last week on about the battery, I've been inundated with requests for extensions on the demands that basically just ignored them, just ignored their emails, not responded, and not taking their phone calls because I know that's what they're calling about, in order for them to be bound by that, by that deadline of before Christmas or before New Years. But I'm trying to realize, listening to you, that I might be shooting myself. self in the foot and getting like really crappy offers, because they're really, you know, I'm them off.
00:40:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, is this not the time of year for benevolence?
00:40:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:40:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If there's not always a time for benevolence.
00:40:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
then I also have to balance that with the fact that my clients also need.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's the thing before they do, but you can't control everything. All you can control is how you show up. But I will tell you that brute force, even in your business, is not the way to go. Tenacity, consistency, showing up, using the rules for your benefit is so strong negotiations, but and it's really hard for me to delineate at this moment a different right without specific examples. But what I will tell you is that doing it when it's you know that the biggest impetus is it's the holidays, and you're trying to push the And that, when everyone needs a rest, when everyone needs a break, when everybody's been looking forward to this, that does make you the bad guy, okay?
00:41:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I feel it's you scooty, right?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
being able to help your clients get their faster does not make you the bad guy. Because it's not your fault that everybody is collectively slowing down. You didn't get them in the wreck. You don't control what everybody else does. You did your best. And right now everybody needs a break so that they can restore and come back and do their best job. That's outside of your control and pushing everybody else in kind of a bullying way for your clients doesn't make you the good guy either.
00:41:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, just humbug them.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wouldn't advise it, but here's what I would do. When you do work, right, the one thing about the natural divine kind of throttling I was telling you about. something else is always open. Now that open might be you getting the rest you finally needed. It might be you hitting some dietary goals. Like I'm using my examples of life that things that have come on. It might be me just sitting there doing nothing, being with my children and that used to be really hard for me because they're not doing things that when they're little, it's not. I'm not having fun playing, watching Dora over and over or playing Legos like that was not but that's what brought them joy. And so there are these moments but sometimes that that opening is something that has nothing to do with work and sometimes maybe it could be a file review. Maybe it could be organization, maybe it could be automation or following up with maybe it could be structural, maybe it could be writing a really long kind of game plan for the year or one for specific individuals. there's so many different things that do open up to you, but it could just be that what's opening up to you is Lorenz, here's some time for you and your family, take it. So that's a lot of time going into it. Paths gonna feel like it's kind of there will come a time in your life where some of these things matter and maybe it's useful just for helping other people or letting them take time off when you're like this is not the thing I think you should do. I think you should show up better and do stuff like this. So just remember that it that is people that Lorenz you got, one life for children will only be young for a little while and it will be gone before you know it. And if We want them to come back to you, how you spend this time really, really matters, but your team also needs to just have permission and your blessing. There's a difference between your permission, grudgingly, right, and your blessing to enjoy time and family, but then there can be the enjoy it, get the most out of All in, and take that energy and do an amazing job when we get back and be super focused, let's not let it be a hangover kind of week, right, where you're like, okay, I'm still in party mode. I want you to take your time fully off and fully enjoy it, but when you come back, I want you laser focused, let's get to work, let's serve our clients. So, take enough time to just an enough distance to really be glad and enjoy it. think about work for a little bit, right? But when you're here, be here.
00:45:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. So let me go back and review these notes one more time. Oh, you know what I want to do is go look and let if I... And then you want to know what I'm going to do after this meeting. I'm going to go play yachty and then I'm going build gingerbread houses. My gosh. Because one of them said, let's do that. And she goes, what if I go buy ahead of time so you have no way to get out of that? like, I'm not, I'm not trying to get out of it. I'm actually not always a something, especially because there's a lot of sugar and I can't eat any of it.
00:45:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And it just makes me mad because I want to eat all of it. Yeah. I'm finally like getting back into my regimen. You look what I got back. I got back from lunch.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There are like two dozen cupcakes sitting on my counter because my daughter loves the bake and there's like this cookies and cream frosting sitting in the fridge like front and center.
00:46:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm like, you're chilling. Usually, it's not that big of a deal. usually send alcohol. So, you know, I just give it to friends of neighbors. But this year they've caught on and they're they're starting to send they know I don't get to their standing cupcakes and cookies and whatnot.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's that's rough. feel you. All right. Let's look at these numbers real quick. Am I looking at the right thing? What the heck? This looks different. What dashboard is this? Oh, it's not going to wait. Did he get on our team? That's what we want. this year. Let's look at this fast this year. Average days closed by team. We've got hangs not even like regular yet. Oh, I heard you're gonna be on TV Lorenz.
00:47:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. 30 minutes in commercial. So I better brush up on my acting skills.
00:47:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what's the word? Just persuasion skills. Yeah. want to be, I don't know.
00:47:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think you're at school different than being in court.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just kind of put on a show. All the world is staged. All right, average closed days. So let's see average resolution speed, which we actually got this corrected. Yes. Okay, so resolution speed, 326 days for you. Patrick. 157.3. I'm still interested to see like at what point like we go like these are real numbers. Sam is at 292, Tyler is at 303.
00:48:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's resolution at what stage is it considered resolved?
00:48:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that when you've gotten the settlement number and at closes we got paid. I've asked that question lots of times. I'm pretty sure that's what it is. This is what the agreement is and we know that that's final and this is what we actually get paid. think this is settled. I think this is paid. Because when you get the final yes this is what it's going to be that's what you've call settled right yeah and then when sweet law actually gets the check it's usually several months later um so this is closed like we're not thinking about it ever again because we've been paid case closed period and a story right so whatever you guys have to do in order to get paid these are things are important we're tracking this we're looking at this this matters now litigation obviously takes way longer um so let's see yeah I mean there's definitely we're still like 34 days behind on that I know you just had some old cases that came up so And that's not going to help when we look at this quarter because of it, but I still do want to go and look at it this quarter. No, it's actually better. average days to close. So, yeah, because, um, so your gap between you and Samantha is tighter. She's a 39 year at 323. So instead of it being 34 days difference, now you're 24 days difference.
00:50:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's true.
00:50:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's actually improving. And this was 376. So that's improved.
00:50:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but wasn't it 309?
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no.
00:50:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I'll go for a 319 last time we checked.
00:50:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last time I checked. I don't remember what timeframe we would have looked at. So let's do this. No, this year. We'll do this year and then we'll go look at last year. 0.1 million. Oh, were you looking at that already?
00:52:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I looked at it from last year.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, average fee last year. Um, average attorney fee of, let's see, gross. Average fee.
00:52:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
14k.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You're looking at your numbers, too, Patrick?
00:52:25 - patrick
Yeah.
00:52:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we're going to go to this year and look at those also. No, I want to go average fee by team. Patrick, so that's this year, so you went up from like 11 something. Lorenz, you went down by 3,000 per case. That's interesting, even with the second voice. Second. Yeah, second. And 2.4 million this year, last year was 2.1. And last year is Samantha, that was 3.5, and now she's 4, so she's almost doubled. but I, again, the states, the cases, like I don't know what the variables are in that. So, and this is why comparison is more about your own numbers. Also, work ethic teams, like there's a ton of variables between all of you that I really don't want to compare. everybody that works for somebody else needs to do is am I valuable? Am I worth my investment? Right? What do you bring in versus what do you get paid, you and your team? If you want to do those numbers, if you want to know, am I a profitable servant? I'm. Oh, you have to do is do some math and it can bring a lot of peace of mind. So I would advise that Lorenz for you. Because I know that you worry about that go do that. So here's also what I've done. I have had clients sometimes come to me and be like, I don't know if I think that we should still working together because they were not making the money that they wanted to. And then we went and did the math and I'm like, do you want to walk away from this? They're like, nope, I do not. Let's keep working together because I showed the value that I brought. So there's a lot of peace of mind that comes from that when you know that the math backs up, you are worth having. If the math is not as good as you want it to be, it's great incentive because now you know what you need to do and how far you have to work, how hard you have to work in order to get it to be like clearly Unprofitable, like why would you give this money up even if you're barely profitable if you're profitable and you don't take a lot of their time And you you bring in money who's going to walk away from that? Why would if somebody could pay 50 cents and get a dollar? Why would they walk away from that opportunity? Right every time they put a 50 cents they get a dollar back, okay? So I'm taking that deal all day long. So keep that in mind Because it's it's a really useful kind of mind hack to dig out. I don't have to why I wouldn't anybody walk away from Somebody who helps them make money and grows their business and expands Especially if you keep increasing your profitability. Does that make sense? Even if it's by half a percentage if you're continually improving even by only half percentage Why would anybody walk away from that so that can give you a lot of peace. And I know, Lauren, you get a lot in your head. So I really want you to start thinking about things like that. Yeah. Hi, guys. Okay, probably not for you guys because Patrick was bored out of his mind. just saying. Wait, what did you say?
00:56:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Patrick makes all the bad decisions. There's nothing to, is nothing to correct.
00:56:23 - patrick
Don't blow guys.
00:56:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there's a little golden boy. It's all right. I'm the problem child to Lauren. So I'm with you. Let's see. Okay, so we've got our stats. The goal is to improve, but there is a lot of ways to do that, right? So it's the systems. It's the leadership. It's the self management. It's the individual case by case management. It's the call control. It's the, you know, meetings. it's the fire reviews. It's the same things all the time. They are the staples, they are the foundations, and you just keep working on it and improving it, and you make sure that the person who's in charge of all of those things is the best version that he can be. So you guys get the rest that you need, you get the energy that you need. Feel your body right, feel your mind right, feel your heart right, try to do the best that you can to make sure that your people are doing the same thing, and then you get to the operational stuff. People first, and so Zig Ziglar has a quote, it's one of my favorite quotes, is you don't build a business, you build people, and people build the business. So build yourselves, build your people, and then together you guys make the best version of this, and you happen to be working for a man who believes in those same kinds of things. main goals in life have to do with taking care of people and making them happy. Like, that's not everybody, guys. That not what most people in business, when I ask them what they want and what they care about most, is not anywhere remotely near what they want.
00:58:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, I think everyone that works here realizes that. How special this place is.
00:58:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, you guys contribute to how special those are awesome. So we are not meeting next week, we're all going to take some extra time off. If you have thoughts and reports and updates, if you want to just drop a message or say hi send me a text message, happy Christmas or something like that. I love that, but what I really want you guys to do is take care of yourselves and the people that you care about and be blessed and be happy and be well. I would sneak giant hugs on the way out the door just like I used to do my little Sunday school class. I have the Sunday school class of seven little boys and they would all try to get away from me before I got them hugs but I have these two little redheaded twin boys and they would be like, Sister Springs, come here! I love them. Anyway, so you guys, you escaped the hugs but I'm sending them to energetically.
00:59:28 - patrick
That is pictures of the dog.
00:59:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will definitely, okay, very Christmas, you guys, you're wonderful.
00:59:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Merry Christmas, Tina.
00:59:37 - patrick
Thank you. Bye. Bye.
