Must be there.
00:00:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's way out for once.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. I had great sleep last night, but that's because I can found out I have diabetes now. And got some medicine and felt better. Yeah. So I've always been prone to hypoglycemia when I was a kid. And apparently that's like a sign that it could happen. And when I had each of my girls, I was, I had a stationary diabetes. None. Like I lost 20 pounds since April and my A1C went up three points. Like I'm eating so much better exercising. Doing all the things because my hormones taint and then got COVID. system was trash. Yeah, and despite that hit 6.5 A1C officially diabetic, and I'm pissed and sad and all the things, but mostly just Dude, I have to think about everything all day long in order to just live Yeah Everything my kidneys have been hurting. I'm like well that explains that I'm cussing I got the glucophage, which is metformin. Nobody knows its generic name but I do as I took that when I was pregnant and I will get the figured out and I'll probably feel much better and Lose the weight easier because now I got to pay attention to net carbs and all that stuff Yeah, I'm so tired. hadn't paid attention to everything But yeah, you can do it quit bitching.
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here you go. Here's something here's something else You
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're like, hey, you were getting into a flow.
00:02:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got to shake it up for you, baby. All right. In the body.
00:02:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm still in the piss-off mode. And also, where did you find out? Two days ago.
00:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
OK, like it seems for my reason.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But on top of that, my testosterone levels have dropped again because I've been feeling like crying every day. I'm like, I guarantee you, it's in the bottom. She's like, well, it's 25. It's still within range. I'm like, you don't understand. My normal range is probably higher than most men these days. I think I was built to fight , OK? But and then whatever the girls got sick with, like COVID went around. And I don't know. I don't know. Well, COVID went around for sure, but I don't know if that's what they had. But whatever it was, so it was respiratory for a while, but we looked at that pretty quickly. But the big thing was the just exhaustion and the body aches. And yeah, so that's it's been lots of fun around here.
00:03:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They have lots of fun problems and with the girls, you know, because, you know, when women are all miserable under one roof, how fun that is. Yeah, that's just you know all about that.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do.
00:03:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's very, very, you know, wish everyone could experience it.
00:03:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we did order, I did order a body massage chair, know, those like shiatsu chairs, like the big ones that get you top to bottom with heated.
00:03:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, station has one.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's our, that's our winter therapy. We already have like the full gym and the garage and we have a nail tech station and we have a tanning canopy because light therapy. And so now we're going to add this in there and I'll be like, there we go. there were little we played in to know now we have a salon on face.
00:03:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. with the solos chair in the living room.
00:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, great. And then the office is becoming a studio. So we've got like all the mics and the sound board and backgrounds and the different computers and the screens because the girls like to do things, the digital pianos in there. It's the systems, like it's not about the buying stuff, but it's about the tools that you can make things with. Speaking of tools, how the GA4 stuff going?
00:04:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I guess Wolfr went live last night. Eric, I just found out I was going to try to put the container on that. didn't want to get it live and then I need to update a plug in. I was going try to just get a container on there and start using a live site and then they I think that I don't know how to address or I don't think it launched with the sales page but they're building that now I think most of the plans. Will you?
00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The sales page for before?
00:05:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah the one that Maria and I did. It's never been used. It was done seven, eight months ago.
00:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have notes in there. Okay, so what's the site?
00:05:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
URL? Wolfring code.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see this basis version. If it'll I have a visceral response to her face. it's not a nice one either. It's not good but I just like it's a kind of what the shake my hand just sorry Jesus I know that's your baby. Okay so where would the sales sales page be?
00:06:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Master Plan. I have no it's right now it's whatever Master Plan the button or the link up in the mail or whatever.
00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My story services as shame me called. Oh Master Plan there it's right behind my So this is not the new sales page, right?
00:07:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Correct.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:07:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It looks nothing like that. That's like a hybrid page that was like something that they did and whatever. It's the best converting page that they've had.
00:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when do you think the sales page is going to go live?
00:07:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. Yeah. Right in the next, I mean, probably the next day or two. I think they, I mean, I think they had sort of built it, I forget. But it's all done like it's designed and all the copies in it. So it's pretty straightforward.
00:07:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should be live next week.
00:07:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, for sure.
00:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
week. You have the the GA4 containers on there.
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm going to put it on there. So I just wanted to launch the site and like not just be like, okay, we're launching. So what they did is like they launched the theme and then in the background, they're like building pages that didn't exist, right? So rather than try to launch the theme and have all the pre-existing pages, you know, with the right blocks, it was like, no, we're just going to launch the theme. And then whatever pages adopt things on their own, which are some, great. And then others, it's like, okay, we have to go tweet that page and tweak this page. So there's a bunch of landing, like, so, and then we prioritize pages, like landing pages, the most home page, most important landing page, second most important. As far as like stuff that needed, that didn't exist in the way the theme works, that, right? You can't take a custom post type from the old theme and and have it become a custom post type in the new theme You have to create because it's now in the theme and before it was in the plugin. So they're now Do it redoing like all the opt-in pages. There's like a part Eric's doing right now Like they have like a priority page list that they're just going through and saying this for that this for that this for that this for that and then Then it'll go to new stuff. There's only one new thing though, and that's the sales page and they won't replace the sales page I'm gonna split test The voice No, we do this.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go to that So, we're, I have to ask, I'm not, I don't have a perfectly formed question for this. my notes were that you're, another 71 containers finished and you're not going to change it and that you thought we'd use that for bases, but you can't, that you need to build a stand alone one and make sure it's working and the target was have it done by the end of the year. Is that something that you're going to be working on like every week?
00:10:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like what's the priority for it? Uh, I mean, it'll probably be done by the end of the month. Okay. But it might not be, right? might just be that, oh, you know what, it should do this or it should do that or we should change this or we should change that but like. 80, you know, 80 to 90%, probably 90% of it will be on Wolfert, including the new VW thing that I mentioned that Norio already did. So yeah, it's it's it all will just come down to like, Oh, you know, whether stuff is working or not working or whether it's like, Oh, we should this should be part of our container, whatever comes up, you know, but yeah, the idea would just to be have it completely. Maybe it'll never be done, but it'll be all done. Right, it's never it's probably never going to be done. But there's it's going to like a version one, let's put it that way would be done.
00:11:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's kind of a living breathing thing, but it will be live and functional, probably by the end of the month.
00:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then rolled out to all the other sites that you have on basis.
00:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:12:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a. Like, um, I kind of feel like it's, it's related to the basis rocks meeting or not rocks meeting, but the. The PM meeting, I guess that we have at one o'clock on Mondays. But a list of all the sites that have the basis theme or will have the basis name and that will have all of these. I mean, that should get all of that. Should get the Google Analytics containers and stuff on it as well.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they're all in. I mean, we don't have a list. They're all in managed WP every every site we work on this in there.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go ahead. How many sites do you have on it?
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, so there are sites in there that we don't even use, right? like an example would be trading art or work, right? It's still in there. So I don't know how many lives offhand, how many live sites there are that it would go on. But it would be like brain and dose, trying manage that a wolf or, I mean, it's not a lot.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on in a stronger town?
00:13:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I want to put it on the new theme and like give it another go when I haven't done it. I think we just got to say we get sales here and there. But I haven't been paying attention to it at all. That.
00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do they ever say anything to you?
00:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, we told they're like, oh my god, you're still thinking about doing it. I'm like, yeah, they've given up. They thought it was. All done for her. Well, you're still, but if you need any help, let us know. That was like a week ago. She ran, we randomly talked to her. She emailed us about something. Don't mean expiring or some .
00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they still randomly get cells, right?
00:14:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. I mean, I think the main problem was that it was attracting the wrong leads. But yeah.
00:14:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you is it kind of like a keep alive signal because it could be a place where you could test some things or do you have much interest in it?
00:14:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. I mean, there's a huge part of me. Okay. Well, segue into this. I'm this close. have my fingers in front of my face and they're very close together. Yeah. I'm like, I'm this close to just ditching. everything. Like, you know what? Like, Mark, all of it. Like, I don't want to do any of the anymore. I'm like, I'll just go do me like, even even the even though stupid wedding software that we just got finished, I'm like, that wasn't even my idea. And I can Heather screw that whole thing up. So I'm like, and all that money on that. I'm like, part of me is like, I'm just gonna get a scenario. Like, here you go, dude, best code you ever wrote. Take it. Have fun. Do everyone. Because I'm like, what am I gonna do with it? Like, it's so and then I'm okay. So then it's like, okay, in the new year, I'll just do fan flow and another 71 and call it a day.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you'd be way happier doing that.
00:15:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's even a matter of happiness. It's just that it's like, it's like, I should only do the things that are, I mean, the thing that I learned this year is I should only do the things that are my idea. And that's not. It wasn't my idea. My idea for them was to build the wedding planner websites. That's the thing I should have built. But then it's like, I want to work with Jamie.
00:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. That's what I'm talking about. Like I look at her and I can't.
00:16:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't. I can't. No problem. I just don't want to.
00:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. not necessarily time wise, but mental load wise to that you could be thinking and applying to another 71 and then also fan flow. Like that could be a full-time job. And when I say full-time, mean, technically it could be 40 hours if you wanted to find it that way. But full-time as in maximal capacity load and maximum effective mental capacity load, Which we know peaks around 20 hours a week actually really getting down and applying with it. But if you were going to maximize creativity in either realm, which is really where your greatest monetary value comes from 20 hours roughly. So all of these other things, like even if you're not actually actively thinking about them very much, they still take up space and they still create friction and you know cool things cool people That's all great, but like with another 71. You've got you're working with Bobby. You've got Jeff That's thing.
00:17:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's it's not even cool things cool people. It's my thing's cool people So we have a whole new phrase now, right? It's like that's what I should be Yeah, it's like I mean, I guess it is cool things cool people, I decide Specifically what's cool and it's and what I've already said what's cool is what I come up with It's not I mean, it's it's fine what other people come up with but it just doesn't work And it's, and I get why it doesn't work. It's, I mean, the reason why it doesn't work is because it wasn't my idea.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you, in my experience of you being this close to something can take like years, what would be the deciding factor for you?
00:18:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
December 31st, 2024, would be the deciding, I'm not this.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's the timeline.
00:18:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that is, that is the deciding factor. is my deciding factor always, Tina? You know it. My deciding factor is always, do not work. No, do I feel good about leaving? Yes, I do.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, well, that's not gonna go away. So I guess by December, okay.
00:18:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, I just want to be like as long as, so like Heather hit us up yesterday. She was like, I mean, I, you know, whatever, it doesn't actually bother me or anything, but she's like, can we schedule, so she still needs Bobby and I to be able to talk to, uh, Jamie. She's like, can we have a same page meeting about whatever I'm like, you're you pulled the shoot Heather.
00:19:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like, I don't know what it was impulsive. No, we love your comfort support animal.
00:19:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, her doing that was impulsive. Like it was very impulsive. You didn't really think through the number that she came up with is ridiculous. I don't know where you came over that number, but whatever, but whatever, you made this bed. She wants to have this meeting. But, you know, respect to her. One of the things was, what are we basically where's Dan going? Does she know that I want to leave? So that's, I'm like, okay, she just gave me the out. already told Jamie, anyway, was like, I'm not around. But the thing that was keeping me there was the sales page. Guess what's happening in 24 to 48 hours. My sales page is going a lot. Do I think it's going to magically start getting 20 sales a day? Nope. It'll probably get more than it's getting now. And then I. just want to be like, hey, it's 600, same things, but 600 bucks a month. The, uh, they're like Katie's contracts up. And I'm like, Katie knows they're not going to hire her. She hit me up yesterday and was like, Hey, if you ever any work, let me know. Like I don't, but I'm going to have a little, but not anything consistent. And then so I like, all right, they want to meet after they have a meeting with the generation talks who's going to do another deal with them, right? So the, whatever that is, don't care. Um, and then it'll be like, yeah, you don't do anything. Just leave it alone. I mean, the best thing about that business is it does not change. You guys know what to track. You're not even going to track it. So what's the point? And then it's like, okay, yeah, just pay 600 bucks a month. You don't pay Katie anymore. And there's like, maybe we can get AI to do some of this stuff. I'm like, maybe you could just not do anything.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right?
00:21:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
AI what? Like, yeah, you're going to have to kick Rebecca.
00:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's, it's such a, don't know.
00:21:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I really don't know. I'm like, do what? All you need is this customer service person, which neither of you are going to do.
00:21:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is just the classic, like, application.
00:21:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like I want to have my cake and eat it too. Oh, totally.
00:21:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want somebody to feed it to me. Like it's so extra in that. And it is, but application is, is a, to me, it's a classic signal of ego.
00:21:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, there's definitely some of that.
00:21:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, it's, it's that I want and think I can have and have some entitlement to all this greatness for whatever level of showing up I did before, but I don't want to show up anymore. And I'm like, that is not leadership mentality. That is, that is for sure, toxic. You know, like, whatever.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You get what you get from, but you, you get what you put in.
00:22:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, there's a correlation. Anyway, right. Interesting question is all totally, totally.
00:22:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and nobody ever puts in. So you're, you're coming through the, like, I had this epiphany a while ago, not that you haven't, but it was my litmus test for clients. Like, I didn't care how much money they wanted to throw at me, or even how much I needed it as a single mom. If I cared about their business more than they did, if I showed up more than they did, they had to go because that would just piss. That's everyone I work with. But that is exactly why I'm telling you, Dan. That's why I'm telling you very smooth with that one. Right. But like it will piss you off and create resentment.
00:22:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you're very well.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, you're going to say this.
00:23:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I knew you were going to say this, but I think things. So here's what has happened though. I, and I would invite you just before you reflexively deflected and it's not true because I think you don't take into account the fact that you have to swatted away in the first place. So like something comes out and you're like, well, I'm not going to let it bother me. I don't think you're, I think things bother you to the effect of like you have to think about it and then say, yeah, but I don't care. I think it takes more of a toll than you might acknowledge because you were like I'm not letting it take a toll.
00:23:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Believe it or not. I don't think about this stuff. really don't. When I sit around, when I sit around think about stuff, especially lately, don't sit around thinking about Wolfers business or strong marriage now like they're there. But I don't think about it like I don't think about the people ever like ever like I don't think about what Heather up to like I couldn't tell you I so why wait until the end of December instead of just be like you know what I'm done I just told you I want to get the sales page up that's all I've ever wanted since it was done since I did all that work with Maria I just want to see it through okay so it's like that was it everything else is done the actual campaign stuff is done so like all the stuff that I wanted to do that I said I was gonna do right it'll be done the new theme but it's like okay this does ready to go there's no point in sticking around right Heather pulled the shoot so I'm like I'm out the minute she said she was doing that I'm like I'm not I want to buy this I don't want to write whatever so six hundred bucks a month you guys around It's on a killer system, like just leave it alone. I mean, if you're not going to work together, just leave it alone. Do I have thoughts of where they could go in a different direction absolutely? Am I going to tell them that? way. Not interested. So there's that. And then I was like, okay, that's done. Brading the new, like, stripes shut down their account. I'm like, really? Okay. And then who incidentally, Joey emailed me, he's like, how's it going? I, it just happened. I sent them the account. I mean, I sent him screenshot of the thing they just sent me. like, dude, they literally just shut the account down. He's like, so this is pretty much the end of the line for brand new. I thought, yes, it is. If you open that door, I will walk through it. So I'm like, okay, that was, I wasn't planning on that done. Strong image has already done. That was done a while ago. So then it just kind of, and then there's like the wedding and software, which I started getting leads for it because I've got the account fixed. I could probably still do that one with those guys because of that, I'll make money. So it's like, okay, you guys get rid of timeline genius will be the provider 5050 deal. Nothing changes. It's just our software that's better. And that's it, right? And PS know you're never going to own any of this because I'm never going to make my money back on the money that was invested in it. Or it's going to take me years on years on years. And Noria wanted to like turn it into event software.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, why?
00:26:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that doesn't sound like a great idea. So I might do that. I might not. Then it would be that I'm bringing it to done, stream where it's not done, well, for done, whatever it becomes, whatever it is. I make I make money, right? So I can make like 1600 and two grand a month on it, probably. Then Mark, like, you know what? Mark's done. Like, I don't know what more. I'm never going to be able, the whole thing I went to do there, I'm never going to be able to do, right? I'm never going to get these stupid ads to work. I'm like, do I even want to, like, what to one end? Why, like, yeah, it would be like, oh, I did it. But I also think I figured out why the Google accounts didn't work. So hopefully I will actually have an account for that today. I'm like, you know what? I can figure it out in two months, whether or not it's going to work or not. have two months to figure out whether or not I can make it work or not. And we'll see. Maybe I can make it work. So there's that. And then I'm like, all right. And then with him, same thing. I'm like, all right, could these dashboards be done by the end of the year? Could this. Yes, I can all be done by the end of the year, and then I can just go off into the sunset and then roll into 2025 with just another 71 and a fan ploy. And then like, you know, I'll still talk to I still want to talk to John Heather about like doing the podcasting my version of it. Hey, let's sell this as a service to podcasters. But I think the pro I might have said that's your idea. It's my idea. It's been my idea the whole time. That just like fan flowy that I've never pursued. Right. I'm like, maybe we should pursue this. And then and I do think it would work. So his site's actually, I just got the design for his site right now. But even that could be like, hey, well, just that could be something that we're working on in 2025, like the left would be huge. But and then I got to sit down with them because like what do you like I don't want to be a dick to Joe but I'm like I hate to break it to you but like you're doing it again like you're not doing your thing you're doing someone else's thing like I get that you're making money with what's his name my cane eggs that's all well and good but guess what that guy is a new business every four or five years so what are you really what are you doing like you you've abandoned your business for the money which I get but like why don't you but maybe that's where Heather builds their business in the podcasting space and then part of that is selling these themes selling this service and then like part like maybe Heather and I work to sell his podcasting course like we build outside of the business but then and that side of the business is like is coaching core blah, blah, blah, and then selling people onto the basis. That I would be willing to do, promoting his course, whatever, now.
00:30:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, what like scale of one to 10, what is your interest in it, the basis for podcasters?
00:30:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I mean, I think that's the ultimate. I mean, I would love basis that. I mean, that's what it should be. This niche were exactly what it was always meant to be, but we could never make it that. And then that goal there would be to get that to 30 grand a month. So there's a couple of different ways to do it. One of them is to sell where we have our podcasters, or, you know, however many podcasters at 300 bucks a month or however much it is. Uh, who's here? your team.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it doesn't have extra vision.
00:31:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. sounds like shipment. Yeah. So get a hundred podcasters of 300 bucks a month. Right. Very defined. Doable. Like, I think that's doable.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, the one to 10, nine, 10.
00:31:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, scale a bunch of 10. Say it again. What is my desire and interest to pursue that? Oh, it's a tie because it's my idea.
00:31:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's me. That's been my goal is to like, okay, I need to build that business to 30 grand a month. So it's, and I'm going to use it on my stuff. going to be another 71. It's not going to be on table. It'll be on whatever.
00:31:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's, let's think about this. What would, what do you think? If you were, so no mark, no brain, so strong bears now brain and no mover really taking any time. Mark takes a tiny bit of time. But like, if you were to map out your kind of time blocks and your days 2025 without those four projects anymore, what would that look like if? And then so maybe version one is Joe just flailing around that hasn't really made a decision. You're not doing that honestly, but you could go after somebody else and do it. If there's somebody you're interested, like I think of John Lee Dumas, but so not me, but somebody else that touches podcast. Oh, like Jeremy. What's his face, Jeremy? Jeremy, Jeremy, I like him. Super tall dude. Twice.
00:32:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:32:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:32:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you don't know I'm gonna linky linky you probably just their text um so he's like in the whole you know kind of group of people and douchebag adjacent yeah like like Joe yes yes actually but really a nice family guy um really wants to make a difference in the world um very very kind anybody I know that's worked with him just had the best things to say about him best experience but very douchebag adjacent like in the mix with them anyway um but you're kind of douchebag adjacent too you're definitely not a not douchebag nothing like them but definitely adjacent so me too I mean honestly I'm probably a degree separated from most of them now, but still in the vicinity. Anyway, he does podcasting. He does podcasting services. I think he teaches podcasting. And he's definitely, his kids are older. They're not older, like they're preteens teens. they're not like baby babies. And he's only got two daughters, I think. But I think he's much more primed. And I don't think that he's been failing. He's also stayed in the vicinity of this for the longest time. He's been doing podcasts for over 10, 11 years. Joe has been all over the place. Jeremy has been more steady, which is really rare in our line of work, that could be, and I'm totally be happy to introduce you. for sure, will have tons of friends in common. But that could be something where you can do, because the thing is basis in a niche, right? It isn't basis with Joe or anything like that. And the podcasting realm is great because those are audiences with audiences.
00:35:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you could do the same thing with multiple those, right?
00:35:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this has really good legs on it because the whole thing is that there are platforms within platforms, audiences within audiences. So you could get some good growth, and so you could even within that, though, could still be like, okay, but you can only come on the platform if you check all these boxes, right? we could do negative match, right? And you don't check these boxes. That type of thing. But
00:36:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, yeah, I don't even care about that Because what about who comes on them because my plan is It's gonna have nothing to do with me, right? It's like oh, yeah I mean, maybe I'll that maybe people like oh, yeah, I built this thing whatever but ideally it has nothing to do with me because ideally I don't Necessarily want to be associated with it right like it's not right even though it's my idea Yes, it's not my thing It's meant to be sort of this thing that is or Eric and Bobby and potentially Norio and Abishik and BJ. like oh, this is you guys you guys have to figure this out Not me. I figured out what it should be you have to figure out how it works And if that and so if you figure out that you need to pre-qualify people great, how do you want to do that? I Should like that or not? It's the other bit of micro or not.
00:37:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then what, what, what does that look like? So are you back to a structure of I'll let it exist? But I don't want to really operate it. So these guys can do it, but they're, they don't get paid like, unless they're leading it.
00:37:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it, the thing would be like to get it to 30 grand a month so that I'm no longer coming out of pocket for anybody at all. That's it. And then that's like the state of gold. Okay, this is what we're doing. It's done. Now we're going to go sell it. This is how we're going to sell it.
00:37:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's a great goal for 2025. it's, it's already built. And if you can't make it, at least be on the trajectory that clearly says we're going to get there by the end of next year. then, you know, right, you got to have at least like 20 people on it by the end of the year, but like that.
00:38:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, it could go fast, it could go slow. I think the only sort of hiccup that I see is like, this should just be like a technical thing. It's like a podcast player, like, okay, what what podcast player is it going to be? then part of me thinks, I I got to talk to Joe, but like, he's with Pat Lin. I get this like, Pat Lin doesn't really pitch his podcast player anymore. I'm like, what if we can just take that over or buy this off and be like an owner finance deal and be like, all right, buy his player and then make it our own and go forward. Or do a deal with it and do some sort of licensing deal.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I do want to talk about this a little bit though, like, if you were to plan out your week thinking about another 71 and mom, and then maybe a day or whatever a week where you're working on, and I know that it won't the blocks don't work up as well. Just total days, you know, but thinking about it in terms of percentage of time devoted to specific things. So there's another 71. There's Oh, call it fan flowing on mom, because that's really, you know, what you're working on. And then just having time to make your own music. I feel like should be separate. So maybe that is mom, right? Because that's what that means. And make our music.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, so it's really long. Okay, it's right.
00:40:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm talking about Dan separately. Just make that's lot.
00:40:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Tina, that's what?
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:40:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, W. A. T.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is that like your band or something?
00:40:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Correct.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What? Okay. So anyway, thinking about time, kind of, first of all, how much time do you want to spend roughly on each of these things? Like, it's not going to be specific, right? And we don't want to build these containers where we're just like, we have to fill this up. have to spend an extra amount of time doing that. But if you were to think about, I know you have the perfect day exercise, but I like the ideal business week, meaning we're not traveling that week. It's on a holiday week, but what does the ideal work week look like? in 25 with these projects and some of the deck cleared with some of this other stuff. Could you map that out for me?
00:41:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably not at the moment.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, as far as... idea.
00:41:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'll tell you the main issue is the ninja another 71, right? I'm right. It's that 4190 or whatever the number is. Like, we're in that and we're not going to go past it. And the math tells me we can't go past it. Like, do you ever Bobby are just not picking up what I'm laying down? like, I am telling you, we have hit the ceiling. This is it. Not going to get any bigger. It is whatever it is from a CPA exam perspective, right? So, let's say that's 3.2 million or whatever the number is. Whatever it's 31 a day equals is whatever it is, which I forgot the number. So, in order to, so I need to spend zero time there, theory, right? It's like, well, I know any time there without a plan, I don't have a plan because I don't have the data to put the plan together to say, I'm going to go do this because I think I'm going to increase 31. The part of it is I could just be like, okay, let's lead it alone, right? That's what we've been doing for like six months, leave it alone. Granted, we are going to launch the new products, right? So that to me is the next test we put this on Monday, right? It's like, okay, we launch a supplement product in the full course, we have that binary choice. I believe we will get more sales just from that because a confused mind doesn't buy and my argument is that people are confused, we see it, we see them saying it on Reddit, we see it in support tickets, they're looking for the supplement. product. So when I present them with that product, didn't in theory that get me more sales, I see yes, the data will say whatever it says. So that in and of itself is a test. Like, okay, and that's supposed to go live in like, November, somewhere, I think we're close actually, but I'll say it's November, or end of November, probably after Thanksgiving, so early December, right? So it's go live when we have a huge exodus of people. Perfect. So really, you don't really know if it's working until like January, and then we have our little blip of time from January to like mid-February that we can make sales, and then we go into our natural law, and then we pop again in May. So hopefully we have enough time from when that actually launches to our natural law to say, hey, this is working, or this is not working, or everything's Right, I think worst case scenario or my worst case in areas, you're still getting 31 a day. It's just across two different products. You're going to make more money because the average sales higher. So it's like, okay, here's the here are the numbers. This is what it is. This is what's happening. What does that tell us? I don't know because I don't have that data and there's no way to get that data. They're there to do the thing. there's that part of that. And then the other part, which I just email or I'm gonna, I was drafting an email here. The bookkeeper chick was, you know, the books were all effed up and she fixed her supposed to fix them. So I know she did like one four and 23. I think she's going back to 22 and 21. I need that data so I can go back to the broker dudes and be like, okay, here are all the numbers you guys asked for six months ago. Because that those got, and then I already told them, hey, we're at place where you know we're doing what whatever it is whatever the 31 is. So if I say to them my argument or my sort of thought process with them was hey once I show you all the stuff then you tell me what I what I need to do to get the most money obviously it's gonna be like grow the business right but but why is it gonna be because hey if you're doing 400 grand a month then you can get 9x but if you're on you know I don't know what they're gonna say but I'm thinking it's gonna be something along those lines I know that I mean they don't know this but I know this but a bunch of the businesses already built around the principles that they have because I watched a video years ago that their owner put out and I made sure that all of that exists inside of another 71 including a subscription so once they get into the hood and they can look at everything they're gonna all the boxes that they like are going to be checked. You're like oh you have an imp Yeah, start. Yep. Oh, you got this. Yep. Oh, you got that? Yep. Then it will just be a matter of like, okay, from then my three-year clock starts. Okay, I want to sell this in three years. You guys tell me what I need to do. What do I, what does this need to look like in three years? And then I will figure out how to get there. But I don't, I don't, I, that is an answer that I can't come up with, which is weird, but for me. But it's like, if they, the target about, okay, then I will, I will figure out a plan to get to that target. So another 71, like nothing changed. I shouldn't do anything there until after these new products go up. And that's, that's it. Literally, I said it on Monday. like, we should not do anything. We should launch this and leave it alone, because it is the test.
00:46:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So how much time do I need to spend there? Virtually not.
00:46:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:46:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So then you, yeah. And then you go to mom fan flowy. So that's going to be a matter get the Spotify approved. I literally just sent an email about that. So hopefully that'll get the right answer there. Still think that'll be approved by the end of the year. And that can be for sale in January. So then there would be like, OK, I'm going to generate leads. Already got one way to generate leads, these cold leads. I've tested those yet. So there I'm like waiting that there's nothing I can do there until that happens proof. So it's like I got wait for that. So I'm stuck in a lot of waitings, right? And then with Joe, I'm like, I don't know what's going on with that. So I need to wait again until this whole thing, the eighth, whatever Heather have this first page, this same page meeting. I'm out. You guys can just be on basis. They're not going to say anything because I have nothing. Then it's like, and then as far as doing basis with Joe, it's like, I feel like I'm gonna have to wait. Nothing's gonna happen in November and December. I mean, we can still be working on finishing whatever we find. But maybe we don't really start exploring that until like January or something. Like, okay, great. So then no time there. That takes us to the music. Well, what a coincidence. So there, it's like my goal there is to have two songs finished. So the sort of the rotigery that Mark has come up with and that's in the book and all this stuff is this continuous release model. the continuous release model essentially says that you are releasing a song every eight to 12 weeks, but you're entering into the strategies that you already have too dumb. So you go day one of continuous release strategy, you release a song and then you immediately start making the song to replace that song. But at the end of the eight or 12 weeks, whatever your window is, you're releasing the second song that you already had done and you should have another song done so that when the 12 weeks is up, you're releasing that song. So you always have a song and you're always making a song. You're always into the game. You're following it. So I've got like multiple songs that are like multiple phases of dumbness. But on Monday with Sean, I was like, hey, I need like a production tracker thingy. So he sent me one. going to modify it and I'm going to go through the songs that I have and be like, which, which will, which one? I got to figure out which songs are the closest to being done. There's basically two or three. And then I go, okay, great. What do I need to do? have this tracker and say, okay, oh, I got to go redo the guitar on that. Oh, I got to go redo this on that. Oh, I got to do hooded. And then I think one's going to go to Sean, but one I think I'm going to send to Darryl because Sean's going on tour. So I'm like, okay, and I'm starting that today. So today I'm like, redoing guitars on some stuff. And then over the weekend, I might redo. I got to pull up this other file that I say to anybody that I haven't listened to yet. But so I'm going to finish this production tracker and then go through the songs and create a tracker for each one that's technically in production. There's like, four, one, two, three, there's like five. There's like five songs that I could probably move along pretty far. So, I mean, I could have a bunch of songs just waiting to be mixed and mastered, which, or that's waiting on Sean, but only until December. But my plan is to release a song in December and then just get it out. But then I have two more songs done after that to start the continuous release strategy in January. And then I just sent an email to Todd about the Spotify app because I was like, it dawned on me Monday or Sunday. Is there a way for me to use this app, even though it's in test mode? I have 25 test users. So, what do I need to do to use this app right now? I don't mean to be public. I just need it. It does work, but I'm like, what are the conditions I need to maintain so that I can then feed it to this page and it will work for her? I think it just means I have to have the same user in high level and in the Spotify developer area, I think. I just ran that by him, and if that's the case, then I can start promoting, us off the one song, and I was like, oh, , this actually works, and that's just me up and around. So then I go, okay, we could build the case study around what, it's a brand new band, brand new release, started from scratch, and then whatever things I figure out, just get baked into the book or into the training or whatever. So, yeah, I mean, I hopefully... In January, it could do exactly what you're talking about. Like, okay, I think this much of the time would go towards another 71, because I now know the results, or the partial results of launching two products, and I have data from the brokers. And then I think that the Spotify apps approved. We can now start working on fan flow. Like, there's no point for me to generate leads, especially through the book, with like Maria or whoever. I can't sell that software. It's the ultimate, it's not the ultimate up to all, but it's the primary. So. Okay.
00:53:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's, that's some clarity. So I think, I've been thinking about it a little. What's that?
00:53:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually, it have added a little. Just. It's a little bit of it.
00:54:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and part of what that helps you do, like, I don't know for sure where Eric fits in, but I think that there is definitely still space for him. Cause I'm always like, you know, what kind of impact does that have on the team? You definitely going to have still plenty of need for Stacy use for her, I guess. Cause she does just really good at massaging, keeping all that going. Bobby's in, um, 71 and just, I guess day to day ops. So I imagine that's not hardly anything.
00:54:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, it's a lot.
00:54:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it really?
00:54:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Cause it's like, you know, well, it's, it's coming down now. But I mean, we really, we literally just did everything over. All the software, all the content. Think it's done.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It took so, but Bobby's got security. Like that's the thing I'm thinking is like, are there?
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He definitely does.
00:54:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. And Stacy too. And there.
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then it comes back like so once I have clarity on another 71. This is the thought I had yesterday. So, I mean, I got to go look at this, but we started to get it. I started messing around with CPE and CMA, not even trying like kind of. And I think CMA is up to 50 grand a year. And CPE is a yearly product. So we have a lot, but we're getting CPE sales every week. We're getting CMA sales every week. And I'm not even trying. I'm like, okay, I'm gonna work on those. And then if I can, once this test is over, it's like, all right, either we just like, again, I think just launching the two products is going to be some, there's some degree of growth that's just gonna happen.
00:55:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just don't know. It could be huge. Could be nothing. Right.
00:55:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But then it would be, I just gave Lucy a bunch of stuff to sort of. Put the breadcrumbs in place so I can sort of like and finally figure out like all right, what leads work, right? So I am Lying all that stuff up that should all be ready by the end of the year some more thing after this but it's like, okay then it becomes the math of I need to get three more customers a day. I need to get four more customers a day and then the math of Okay, well four more customers a day is that times you know 300 bucks but it's like 1200 bucks and I'm making $600 more a day myself how much I should have put into that a lot right so it's like okay great and then it's then it's like oh all right that's where I use Eric and I go hey build this go work on this go and the same thing with Stacy like help me do this whatever because it's always has been an this will be where I make the most money. I do think that mob could be humongous, but there's nothing there's nothing there to to base on it yet.
00:57:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's like, yeah. Um, and then Mark, oh, I gotta watch the time because I gotta go to my daughter, but um, like if he, because I imagine he would still want to be able to talk to you and just like, tough , huh, tough . You're not interested.
00:57:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, no, I mean, I, I just, so it's like, I, part of me was like, ah, I just don't know, like, there's nothing for me there. I'm like, what am I getting out of this?
00:57:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, do you just do? So yeah, I mean, that's, that's really the question is, is, I mean, do you, would you, like, if he paid you a certain hour of your rate to be able to talk to you, would you like it? Is there value or would you? Be like, you know, it gets just time to not do this.
00:58:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can be on basis and So the real thing there is gonna be I'm gonna hopefully When I miss the meeting on Monday and I'm medical uber my mom. I called Google. I'm like I'm gonna call them Those in the car She's okay, but she's not but she's okay like I'm grants. thinks she's okay, but he's having issues I got on the horn with Google And it took forever and then ultimately I forget what they said something and I got oh, that's it Thanks click and I hung up on them Now like got it the basically It boiled down to this can't use your payment profile across multiple accounts anymore Like well, why didn't you just tell me that like why do you get dropped down there? Why does it why are you making it seem like that's how it works? You have to have an individual payment profile for every account. I go, OK, great. So I went back and I set up a payment profile for a wedding planner thing, and the next day the ads went live. And I was like, all right, that worked. Now I'm going to go do it. And then I did it for car accident, but it went this weird route again. OK, screw it. I'm going to open a brand new account. I'm going create a brand new payment profile with a credit card that I've never used before. Whatever I need to do, I'm going to go do it. Like, I think I to create a Gmail address for it. It's so stupid. The whole thing is dumb. I'm like, all right, I'm going to go do that. And if that account gets approved, then I can.
00:59:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it just, it feels like it lets them track more data and confirm it, because if it's through a Gmail account, like, you know what I mean?
00:59:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I don't know what they're doing. It's being stupid.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild. But, OK, back to the original question is. If Mark had interest in just being able to spend time talking to you each week, would that be something you were interested in or not?
01:00:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, that's what's happening right now.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know. I know that. But technically, that's not the arrangement.
01:00:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, right.
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just feel like he really likes talking to you.
01:00:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, well, that's what I'm trying to get at.
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I'm not in order. Like, obviously, I'm not going to say anything preemptively to Mark, because you're the top dog. You're the reason everything has happened. My curiosity is like, okay. I mean, he'll survive.

Here's where you're wrong. I work on his a lot. Like, oh, yeah. Like, was spent hours a week beyond the phone call. Like, I'll be there, like, okay. Like, right now, yesterday, I've... like, reach out to Julio to do this whole frickin back blog post category. So it's a show. But I thought about it. got I'm out of it. Or I think I'm out of it. But I can't do it. So I'm like, we're gonna hire the G sheet guys, they'll be able to do it. So I sent them the scope yesterday. But I mean, I had to sit around and think about it for hours. Yeah, gonna do this.

01:01:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then I had to talk to Gert about it, right? So there's all this communication with Gert and whatever. then I taught, you know, I email, isn't a bunch, right? So I sent you guys stuff, because like trying to figure out like Stacy sends me the stuff that you came up with. And I'm like, are you guys talked about? got she's I send this to Josh? got I got to I got to read it. So then I read that and I go, well, okay, and then I asked Mark questions and I said stuff to And then I talk to Isaac, I'm going back and forth like trying to find the pieces, and then I find them. And I go, okay, now we can maybe send some stuff to gosh, like that's the thing. like, we just like get this matters one done. Like we don't. Although the leads one is done, I sent it to you. Like it's just not done done. Like it's like the widgets are there and the stuff's right, but like the matters one is now becoming more complicated. And I was like, okay, I'm waiting for Isaac to answer something. But I ask Mark, if you were on there, go, are you doing this? He's like, no. then we can't report on it. Like, if it doesn't exist, you can't report on it. Then the question is, can it exist? I don't think answer that one. Then I go to Josh and go, okay, if we did this, can we actually load the dashboard? And then he'll load.
