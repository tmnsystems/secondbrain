Hello.
00:00:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, Tina.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. good. So it'll just be us, not Patrick today, because he's on vacation and he just messaged last night about it.
00:00:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's all you, all the focus on you today.
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nice. Sorry.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how was it gone since last week? Any thoughts and ponderings about what we talked about before we get to like the tasks and assignments?
00:00:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just kind of went ahead and did it. I met with all my team members one on one.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about that.
00:00:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it went well. Had a. Very well, you know, the whole reason I wanted to do it was to me with a very anyway, but she ended up being sick so I didn't get clearance of this morning It was good I got some good feedback the way I structured it I kind of like Asked them how they were doing and of course they gave me the generic answers, you know pretty good or you know Happy or whatever and then I got a little further asked them what their biggest stress was Right now and I got some good answers and then So usually it was like on the client side and then as I gave it we discussed that different solutions we could come up with and Then asked them, you know, what about the firm from the firm side you're experiencing stresses that I could help you relieve or any anything that we can do. so I got some good feedback on that as well. And then I set some goals with them. I wanted to have three goals for the next month for each one of them. So we set some goals. And then for coaching, I finished with coaching points. I just kind of went through a couple of things I noticed, but it kept it really positive.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would love to do, what I think would be super insightful and helpful, is just to go over those in details for you to share what it was like, what you learned, your read on them, how they felt. Because like I said in the beginning, it's really an information. gathering process. So, basically, imagine you have, have you ever played with Legos? Okay, so you're dumping out all the Legos and you're basically taking inventory, and let's say you're doing something where you're just building it from your mind, not necessarily from a plan or schematic, and so you're figuring out what you've got to work with, so you can kind of build in your mind first, knowing what pieces you're working with. So, you know, some of the pieces are the people, but inside the people, so let's say the people are colors, and one's red, but there's different shapes of red, and one's yellow, but there's different shapes of yellow, and each of the different shapes would be their different skills, talents, abilities, weaknesses, any of those things, right? So, we're really just figuring out what do we have to build with, and it will be the people and all the nuance inside of them, and then it'll also be, obviously, the combination, like, where. not just building a red thing or a yellow thing, but so if we're, you know, we could do that together so that we're leveraging, you know, both of our different skill sets and see what we can come up with. What you think about that?
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think be great. Yeah, I think initially, you know, I was a safe space. know, I wasn't like evaluating him for their next raise or anything like that.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure.
00:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But I think, yeah, that's what that's where I want to go. I want to be able to use these one ones as like, you know, a growth audience experience.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like um, very was a little bit more open this time with that intention that you set? Do you feel like she
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
end up at all more than normal. Yeah, a little bit. So, you know, what, it was a little bit different with her because I knew that that was one of the points we have touched on last last time we met. And so I made sure to emphasize the fact that, you know, this is a safe space, you know, I know that, you know, you know, I worked and passed four terms where anytime you were a little bit vulnerable, that was used as to, you know, those weaponized against you, then down the line. And I wanted to make sure I wanted to make clear that this wasn't this. This was just a way for me to, to be in touch with her and understand how I could support her, how I could help her. Set goals and how I could make sure she was happy here. And so you said that explicitly? Yeah.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did now reading both energy expression and words, how was that received?
00:06:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I could like, I could see her body language, she relaxed a lot more.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is way more like, almost like her shoulders when come up here. It's like down here is choosing. You know how big that is for that to happen. So you know what that means is that she trusts you that what you say is true. Yeah, she had an immediate response. What you said she trusted. That's, it's really important for you to understand that, that how to forgive me. Sometimes I get emotional when I think about people and our hearts and our spirits. and the things that we're going through because we are we are people and this is a big deal and our fears are a big deal our traumas are a big deal and they show up everywhere they show up in the workplace so when a person by default does not feel safe for them to come into contact with a person who can tell them they're safe and they believe it that is very powerful and I want you to remember what I told you about how you can be a different person for these people do you remember what I told you about yourself? I remember we talked about how I could be the safest person to these people because you are safe because you are kind because you do care um not Not because you just want to be that way, but I was pointing out to you that you actually are that way. And so what I want to show to you is now you've received a validation that is in Tina's just making an opinion and she doesn't know me, but she's guessing that these things. You just got validation from somebody that you've been working with, because that physical symbol of shoulders dropping and you can see that she relaxed 100% validates what I said is that you are perceived as safe. However, what I want you to also understand is that a lot of times we can do things somewhat obscurely and meaning that it's not crystal clear. Obviously, I know you know what obscure means, but I want to elaborate on my meaning. You can get a sense of something that you haven't dug into. you. So you haven't specifically identified it and brought it into crystal clear view. For example, Viri could may have sensed that you're a safe person, but you didn't give a clear enough signal to her to say, I am a safe person. I want you to feel safe. And so she felt it, but she didn't believe it per se. And generally speaking, we can feel safe around people, not know that they're safe for a very long time. And especially if you have the experience that you have trusted people in the past, and then they haven't been safe, you're going to doubt that your perception is accurate anyway. So she was able to pair her internal and intuitive perception of you being safe with your words confirming it. she believed it immediately. Hence, the physical experience and vision. visual symbol that she had relaxed and leaned into her the little bit. Does that make sense?
00:10:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want you to understand how powerful that is, because if you know that about yourself, Lorenz, then, but also if you know that there are people like Viri, and there's many, many, many, many, many of them, the majority, who don't feel like people that they are supporting that too in any kind of way are safe, who may not feel like men in the workplace are safe, or any of that, that you can give them a clear signal, I'm safe for you. I want you to feel safe. How you feel is important to me. want you to communicate what you need, what you think, It matters to me. I value your opinion. I value your presence on the team. I value, I mean, it could be your children. It could be other people in other places in your life. But you have because you are kind, because you care, but also because you're intelligent and because you have a good work ethic. That makes you rare. That's not the average person, friends. I've worked with so many people and I was just born weird watching people and intuitively recognizing them. I had grown people speaking to me as a child, forgetting that I was a child, talking to me and unburdening.
00:11:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, I'm not normal either.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I've learned to recognize people and I speak boldly because I'm open to the fact that that I could be wrong, but I haven't been yet, and I won't be surprised when I am, well, I probably will be surprised when I'm wrong, but not because of me, but because of people and because of patterns and because of consistency. People really do give a lot of signals.
00:12:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just most people aren't looking for them.
00:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm always looking for them. That's part of my bad for me, have actually become a superpower, which is actually true for a lot of people.
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So anyway, that's just all that interesting talking to you because like as an introvert, it's sometimes hard for you to express what I'm thinking, but it sounds like you're kind of like you can kind of interpret it before I can get the right words out.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it may not surprise you, but that's actually, I think it's probably one of my favorite gifts. And I get told that a lot is that there are things that people think. And they maybe have never even put it towards themselves yet. But I say it and I'm like, Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Or that's what I was feeling or like I had that awareness or whatever. So what you gave to me, even though I've already received it, it always helps me to receive that validation. So what I'd like you to keep in mind too, is that you have the ability to give validation to other people as well. And to take it when you receive it, because that is it's power. It gives people more confidence when they get a clear signal that this is true. So do you re needed that you gave a tour? And she gave you a clear signal of what I told you is that you are uniquely considered safe and trustworthy. So Oh, you told her you were safe because you were already received as trustworthy, she believed it. So those are two signals about yourself that were really important to receive. And I promise you, she's not the only one that thinks that. So that's really important and awesome and good job. Like, I didn't think that would be that fast, but that's how great you are. it does me no good to patronize or placate people. Anyway, if that would be counterproductive, I'd be out of a job very quickly because it'd be the emperor has their clothes.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know what I mean?
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So I really, I really am impressed that you were able to have one conversation and watch shoulders drop. That specific signal is really, really potent. Wow, I also couldn't even like apply on the wall and watch that happen. That'd be amazing. Okay, so go ahead.
00:15:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It was pretty, you know, a pre rewarding conversation. think she's, you know, she has so much to bring to the team and I've been frustrated with, you know, not being able to suss that out. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see how she kind of grows and is able to kind of trust me as an attorney and can bring her own input to our team.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I am so excited about that also, but I want to remind you, though, that she will need the consistency. So she'll need those signals again and again and again, because a lot of times people will declare who they are with their words, but it's when they support what they declare through their actions that we really know for sure. And I'm sure that you've already told her, like I said, she probably sensed it. This was just. the confirmation. But my point is that you'll want to reiterate that either explicitly or implicitly in the conversation that you have, even just saying things like, I'm so glad that we're opening up a little bit more and talking because I value what you say, just moving right along. not having to make a big thing about it, but a tiny little signal that I met what I said, this is on my mind, this is real, you know, let's keep going. And when she does say something, and it was, you know, more than what you would have expected before, I was just like, wow, I'm so glad that you're sharing more because I really feel like I'm, you know, from your mind and your experience. And, you know, just little signals like that, sincere, obviously, but I know that they will be. So then not only will she just continually be open but that should probably spread to other so if anybody else is needing anything and you say hey guys I need you to open up more a little bit and maybe Viri speaks up and goes yeah I did and it was awesome you know yeah super excited about this you're awesome good job good job good job and you just got right on it I love that and I love that you're all stealthy like I'm gonna talk to Viri but I don't want her to feel worried so I'm gonna talk to everybody well yeah I think you know the other interviews were good in their own rights for different reasons but Viri was the principal target yeah yeah but but you put in the effort to go through the whole thing first of all to consider and to not want to make her afraid and so to take time to talk to everybody which obviously is a benefit and wisdom anyway but that's the difference between bosses and leaders Lorenz and you just do it it because you're like, well, of course, duh, like, what else am I going to do? But, but I want you to understand that is not how most people operate. And it, it's what makes you really great and why people feel safe is because you default to that into caring and concerning about people. And they're like, what is this? That's not, that's not how people normally are. So good job.
00:18:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
job. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making me blush a little bit. Well, I am sincere.
00:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I promise you.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Okay. So did we learn anything? Did she share anything with you that that we can use?
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you have any coaching points? Let's get into the nitty-gritty of everyone. Yeah. So I guess that's where I'm very, let's talk about her. Okay. So generally, she's very happy. She's, she's, I think she was, she, she explained to me that, Initially, she was a little bit, she didn't know how to fit into the sweet lawyer's system because she came from a place where all the jobs were very segregated. so she would only do one type of task. Whereas here, it's kind of like all hands on deck. She likes that she's finding her way through that and that she's getting to a point where she's able to feel helpful, especially at the end of the mountain, things like that. And she likes that she's growing a lot faster than she expected.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's living a lot quicker than she expected. I love that.
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
One of the stress points right now is she wishes she had more time. She asked her, do you feel like you have too many cases that you're too many tasks for the cases that you and John had. And she says, not necessarily, I just wish that there is a way for me to come in earlier in the morning. So like once we get, I can get some of those tasks done before we get phone calls raining in. And she said, well, I might look into some daycare for my kids, my younger kids that don't have school so that I can come in earlier and told her, know, she needs to stay later, that's fine too, know, she doesn't have to work around her schedule within reason. And then we talked, but I do think like it's also, this might be a product of, well, she's still fairly new, she's still learning quite a few new tasks. And I think some things will get quicker as she gets more experience with them. I'm also thinking about talking to John about making sure he doesn't all flow too much to her. Then, you know, we had a conversation a little hard to hard about, you know, like this is not a place where she needs to be on guard all the time, she can make mistakes and we'll work on them to get others, this is a safe place to be, know, she doesn't need to look for perfection. And we set some goals, I told her, you know, she had a hard time setting goals, and so we kind of looked at certain things together. I looked at the cases from her and John and they have, there's too many cases in collecting meds right now, collecting med status. So I asked her what would be a good goal for, to move cases from collecting meds to ready for demand and she set a goal for it to do 20 cases by next month. I think it's a little bit ambitious, I'm honest, but I don't want to, she wants to do 20, I'm not going to like tell her it's too, too many. Right.
00:22:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So elaborate on that for a little bit, did you say collecting meds to ready for demands?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like meds being like medical like reports and doctors and medical records and billing. Medical records and billing.
00:22:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Kind of the biggest bottleneck in my case.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Now. And her goal was to do what? To get 20.
00:23:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
In what time period 30 days, so we said goals for 30 days. I think 20 I say she gets to between 10 and 15.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that would be very impressive. Where is she out right now?
00:23:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I don't have any prior data, but I know on average that's about how much people are able to get because there's so many things outside of your control zone. If the hospital says we'll get to it when we get to it, apart from following up every other day, there's not much you can do to hurry that along.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.
00:29:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need to know what's on the stick. And we need to know what it's doing every day. And we need to know, so let's say I don't know, like, what are the things that everyone's good at? is there something if we do some time tracking, and we say, this person and this person both have, you know, similar tasks to do, but this person does this type of task super fast, like we're looking at it and they spend two hours a week doing it.
00:29:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
this person spends 10 hours a week doing it. Not me. I mean, I remember last year when we discussed it, I initially was kind of on board with it, and I presented it to the team. Usually the team is like, you know, whoever Lauren says, we'll do it, know, they're pretty well liked.
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
likes this task.
00:30:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But this was like unanimously rejected, all hated it.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think it's because of fear because nobody wants the microscope on them. That is the thing that most people, when I get into teams, they're afraid of it. They're afraid of being inspected closely. But if we can help them understand, it isn't about them and it isn't about looking for flaws. It's about looking for levers, opportunities to find the sunspots and what's different.
00:30:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
it's in take.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I believe my audible, but I might have read it like a few years ago.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I would like you to read it. So there's one story where there, I don't remember where it was. I feel like it was an Asian, like an impoverished Asian population, where basically everybody was suffering from malnourishment. And but they found this one area, this one village, where the children were thriving. And they're like, and so, okay, so this, this group of people, I'm probably gonna butcher this because it has been like 10 years since I've read the book. But they were tasked with going to helping improve nutrition for an area. They had like six months and almost no money basically. They had like no way to overhaul nutrition because there was not enough money and not enough time. But when they did, down there and they dumped at the Legos basically and they looked at everything and they like what is different. So every single population they were malnourished the children were skinny they were sick they were weak except for this one village and the difference was that the mothers so they while they were working and they started adding the shrimp into the rice and that extra protein and nourishment completely changed the way that they they were they were healthy they were strong they were thriving so that was available to all of the rest of the communities they didn't have to re-educate them they didn't have to get a program going they didn't have to bring new food in they didn't have to change changed the food chain supply at all. It already existed. They just needed to change the way that they behaved, which is utilizing a resource that was already existing and adding it to their meals.
00:33:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, you know, I'm a, you know, my background, I did a psychology in college, but not like, my whole thing was numbers and statistics.
00:33:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
loved it.
00:33:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. So, I understand the value of the proposition, but I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to get the same results with that.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what I'm going to tell you. I don't. I'm not a fan of interrupting, but I'm going to because this is the leadership job. Sometimes you need to convince people that they need to do the hard thing. Your job is to motivate the troops and say, we need this data. so that you can enjoy your job better. There is something here, like go read that book, go get the study, go see if you can find a parallel study so that you have enough ammunition to explain to them. I have no interest in micromanaging you. I have no interest in picking apart how you're spending your time other than going, is there a way we can build a better mouse trap? How can I help you, like what are the things that you could, do I need to train you better? Maybe I can take something off your plate and shift it to somebody else who enjoys it more and does really well and give you more of what you like. I don't know, but until we break everything down and take inventory, we don't actually know exactly what we're working with. And I want you to care enough about your career. And I want you to have enough trust in me as a leader to say that if we gather this data together, we can look getting go huh what we're doing the best we can okay great job but I've never gone through this exercise with any company over 22 years in any industry where we didn't go whoa I didn't know that what if and then we make a slight alteration and there's improvement but what is requisite first is a willingness to get the information now either these are people who are willing to be a little bit vulnerable and invest in tracking this time or they're not but so let me give you one more motivator that you may not want to use but you can and you should you're spending extra time once a week meeting with me trying to figure out how you can be better for them you take out out of your own pocket your incentive pay to give to the team. You're investing in leadership and improvement. The least that they could do is track their time for two weeks. Because you want to know, look, are you here to collect a paycheck or are you here to be part of a team and be the best part of the team that you could be? If you're here to collect a paycheck, you're probably not going to last a long time. Because you're going to be at this for a couple more decades probably before you retire, right?
00:36:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, the fire retire.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. This world is not getting cheaper. So don't you think you have the best odds of being successful at it and being like minimizing stress and actually enjoying your life and enjoying your job if you're surrounded by people who are invested and being the best that they can be like you are?
00:36:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I feel like I am right now. I think all four of them are pretty invested in what they're doing, which is why I appreciate them so much.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks of time tracking, like what's their biggest issue?
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
know this is like, I know you're probably going to say no, but Can I just ask them, okay, you don't need to give me your exact times, but you need to give me a percentage for each task, the percentage of the total time for that day for each task.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me tell you why that doesn't work. They will guess if they're not writing down the times.
00:37:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, in other words, they would write down the time, but not having to share with me the exacts.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Okay, are they not getting paid hourly? Yeah, okay. Is there any reason why it's unreasonable to be held accountable for where your time goes when you're getting paid hourly. But the motive, that's the thing. That's your job as a leader to help them to believe and understand. you could tell them, look, I'm, if I wanted to be a jerk about it, my rights to say, look, you're paid hourly. This, this is, you know, a time report. Um, you know, I say do it, do it. But that's not why we're doing it. This is short term. This isn't going to be something that keeps coming up. It's not about micromanaging because it's not necessary. Micromanaging is counterproductive because you want autonomous people who are going to problem solves themselves. you need to tell them that also. Okay. But what this is, is a leadership effort on your part to figure out what. the pieces are and is there any kind of, okay, so for example, vieri came from a place where the tasks were segmented? Is the way that we're doing it better? How do we know? Let's take a look at what's happening and how it's going and how everybody on the team is performing and just see if we can do something like, do you guys not care enough to be willing just for two weeks, track your time? You can track your time too and you can report it and you can say, hey, I'll report to you, I don't have to, but I'm going to. Lead by example, if you want to, there's all kinds of ways to go about it, but at the end of the day, the more information that we have, the better we can lead and support and encourage and ask them to, like, are you going to be here for a year? Are you going to be here five years, 10 years, 15, 20 years? Do you want to be in an environment that is optimized for you to be able to spend your time doing the things that you enjoy the most or that you're the best at? and being surrounded by people who are being able to. I don't know, like do you wanna, how much joy do you wanna have out of it? Do you wanna come in and just drudge through it? Because what we're doing today, we don't get to keep doing. Like if you're not, we're always moving, we're either moving forward or moving backwards. There is no static, there is no being stagnant. And the market keeps changing. And there will be somebody better coming up. Like if you want to create the environment where you don't have to keep going and looking for another job and new people to work with, then we have to make the most out of what we have here. But in order to do that, we need to analyze it. And we need to not be afraid of analyzing it, which means they need to trust you that you're not there to pick things apart and break it, but you're there to look at it and go, how can we make it better? how can I support you? And either they believe you or they do. don't and either they're willing to do the extra work or they're not. They can grab about it. They don't have to love it. Nobody has to love it. And I would encourage that you don't grab about it because that doesn't support anything and that's negative and it perpetuates negative energy. You can complain once. can say, I don't like it once, once. Other than that, you become a complainer and that's an issue and the culture should be, because we talked about culture last week, we're not here to be a complainer. We're here to make the best out if we can. So that's it. It's a long conversation sometimes. It's a short conversation, but it's your job as a leader to try it now. Now, you don't believe in it, sorry my dogs are going nuts, then that's a whole other issue. So let's start there. Do you think that there's value in understanding how long it takes people to do tasks and how long they spend on it and seeing if there's any kind of patterns that evolve? okay data is my safety blanket right you like you just said like that's what you were looking at was numbers so this should make perfect sense to you so i need you to dig deep and explain to them why you love numbers and to me this is what i tell people all the time numbers tell the truth numbers don't have emotions right so if i go and i look and and very takes um 10 hours a week or 15 hours a week for for just collecting medical records and she's only getting five cases and i don't remember the other person who's equivalent on your team i have to go look at the numbers the spreadsheet hold on mike that would be mike right well they don't work out that way or maybe they did anyway it's not a perfect analog because it's a little bit differently on the other team but right so but anyway comparing what you can and going you know this takes you a lot longer but but for example it's Is there anything that Mike can do to help Viri or I don't know who else would would be doing distributions but can Mike teach anybody any that or is that just his innate qualities and it's not teachable there's probably a tactic that he could share right now and I'm all for cross training um do you have any problem with me saying telling them you know this time keep this time keeping data is just between you me and Tina not a thing not at all and you can tell them my origin how we came to work together um the impact that it had on you last year that mark has been hiring me for over three years now um that he has done this work he's done the time tracking and the time reporting so um you know uh Yeah, I think that that is helpful and to know that, you know, some of the surveys that they've seen in Sweet Law, some of the things that have your team is newer, but that we're constantly looking for supporting and making the best place for the existing people, rather than going, who can we fire? Who can we get rid of? There's never that energy here.
00:44:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can sell it better like that because it, you know, it doesn't matter how nice Mark and Mary are. There's that upper management where they feel like they have to be a little bit more guarded.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can tell them, Mark's done going to see it, Mark doesn't want to see it. He doesn't even know I'm asking before it. Like that's the autonomy that I have and the autonomy that you have, which in and of itself is part of the culture autonomy and you're not trying to undo it and you wouldn't because micromanagement is a nightmare. It is a just stress cesspool. It's not good for anybody. It feels terrible. This is just data. This is just data. It's data that scares them and you get that because it feels like a microscope. But the intent of the microscope is to go, what can we make better for you, not what's wrong with you?
00:45:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, I think I can sell that.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The framing is everything and maybe you can tie a reward into it saying like the more accurate the data is after two weeks, like this is what I'm willing to put into it. Maybe you give them, I don't know if it's a financial incentive or maybe just, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. I don't know what motivates your people. But if you could then by sending it incentivize them, or just even show thanks, you know, whatever you have to do, but I can tell you that data is super helpful. There's always an aha moment where we can go, oh, this might be how we can support them better. For example, so one of the surveys that we did was Sweet Law. Black Swan, Black Swan, you know who Black Swan is, right? Yeah. Okay. That came as a result of a survey. That came as a result of me saying, how can we help your people more? Where are they struggling? And one of the answers was converting leads to cases. So it wasn't just intake, but it was also, you know, the attorney team. And it was primarily intake being better at sales, but it also can happen from, you know, getting fired up of cases. And there's this whole persuasion tactic. So But it was a long time going through, just trying to get people to read the book from Black Swan first, and then trying to get the appointment and get the training, like you don't know how many times, every single week, I'm like, where are you at with Black Swan? Well, blah blah blah. Like it just took so long, but as a result of it, Samantha, for example, just reading the book automatically improved, she took some concept from it. She had an aha moment, and from that point forward, applied it and improved her numbers rapidly. I wish I could remember what it was, but I don't know what the tactic was because I didn't read the book anyway. But that's my point, is that we didn't know until we did the survey and asked questions, and somebody was willing to be honest and say, I could be better at sales, and so we got that. And you can share that. There was another, the intake also, at least one person, but I think that there were a couple of people that said, I don't know how to talk to people whose child died or whose spouse died in an accident. Like, this is really difficult. And so we got the grief counselor to come in and talk to them. Did you know that?
00:48:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, but I wish I would have been there because that's like one of the things that I struggle with too was when I because in Arizona, the attorney has to talk to the to the client before they sign. And usually, like, I get a little nervous every time I have to talk to a debt, wrongful death case.
00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we could, I could get Mark to bring them back in. And also, there are people who didn't get that. So because they're new since then.
00:48:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I do OK. Like, I don't like avoid it if I'm the only one available.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But do you want to do OK? do you want to get some extra skills that can help you be even better at it?
00:49:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm always for extra skills.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and that's the thing I want you to take from this is that these things are happening in Sweet Law, but it starts with asking questions, it starts with honest vulnerable answers, then it goes with taking action and trying to improve that situation, but none of it did anybody get, you know, laser pointed, hey, you're coming out of here. It has all been beneficial to the members of Sweet Law.
00:49:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with the month I'm having right now, I don't know. Oh, we're having a pretty crappy month right now, so.
00:49:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we've got a little bit more time. What is there anything that you feel like you have control over that you can improve that?
00:49:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There's sticks in the fire, and I know they're going to come, but right now, I mean, it's bad. It's like my worst month so far.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we've been digging into your team. I would like to spend some time working with you and working with your processes. I'm sure that we can do something to improve it. But you are, your team is you. Like these are your resources. So I need you to be successful at persuading them. We need this information. I need to know what your resources are and you need to know what your resources are. Because being able to lean on mic for distributions had to have been really eating to you.
00:50:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah, extremely.
00:50:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is there other relief that can come for you and for others that we don't know about because we haven't fully inspected. So here's the thing is if Lorenz's pod goes down, guess what happens Like, if you don't hit your numbers and you don't have a job, guess what happens to everybody else?
00:51:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have job.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so help me help you, right? Jerry Maguire, then. Tell me the money. Tell me the money. So, look, and we're at the beginning of this, and I need you to just take a deep breath and be like, I am on the path of growth, and I'm willing to do the work. Now, if you see that you could hustle your way to something different, if you could see where you can make some improvements, what, so other than what we've already talked about, I want you to do that. want you to get your team on board with time tracking for two weeks, incentivize them, however you can, but you can be vulnerable to and say, like, this is the worst month I've ever had since I've been here. If I'm out, you're out. And this is not your fault. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I make everybody be as great as possible. possible so that we not only just have jobs but we have jobs we'd like that we want to stay with working with people we like um that's your job that's what you need to do you need to lead them you need to make them trust you because you are trustworthy anyway and you are safe and do that and then I need you to start digging into your processes I need you to track your time Lorenz that would be very helpful to me um I may need to ask Mark about that and say hey can you help me look at this you'll be safe with him just just your time and but I'm asking you at a time if you're okay with that um if you track your time for two weeks and say hey what do you notice about this could you make it better he likes you he knows that you are reliable he you you are wanted you are wanted so he wants you to be good you want to be good the business needs to be good. You'll get paid more if you do better. I need you to trust that you're safe with him as very as with you because you are.
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's pretty inscrutable when that comes to me.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I get a different perspective and I need you to be able to trust me. I know both sides. I've seen glimpses of it and but I know the game. I know the locker room talk and I know the person and you're as safe with him as very as with you. So but I want you to buckle down. want you to roll up your sleeves. I want you to be vulnerable and I want you to get the work. So start tracking your time very closely. Let me analyze it first. If I can find an not on my own. We can just keep it between us. So that will mean that I need you to be super informative about all these things. So when you track your time, I want you to explain it to me too, because I don't know all the lingo. I don't know all the operations. I don't know a lot, I don't know all of it. So I want you to be really thorough and explain this is this, this is this, this is why this is important. This is what's hard about this. This is what this means to the value of the case. Like, I want you to analyze it as much as you can before you even give it to me.
00:54:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So you don't want just the Y as well?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Y, the how, the way you prioritize it, what logic you use to prioritize it. I want to understand everything I possibly can understand about it. Because the way my brain works, I should be able to help. And if I can't and we need to get It's what I need insight from market that we can, but the more information you give me, the less likely I'm going to ask or need to ask anything because Lorenz, this is what I do most is optimized. So that data is really important to me. So if you can do a good job of tracking it accurately, timestamps as often as possible, and then really explain it, I can just about guarantee you I can find something to improve you. But now I want to go back and just give you one more reminder that we had one conversation you thought differently about how to make leaders around you and you up to numbers immediately that very next month. So we are going through and we're looking for leverage and we're having way more than one conversation and I don't ever fail because when people will do the work and we get the data, there's always a very simple path to improvement even if it's small and then what happens is those small improvements start to compound. So there's really not anything to be afraid of because statistically I don't feel and the people I work with don't fail if they show up and they get the data and they do the work. It hasn't happened yet. Not saying it can't. I'm just saying that there's always a place to improve a little bit and that little bit of improvement having the compounding effect and now you're multiplying it times everybody else having a little bit of improvement and now your whole team is improving month after month, after year, like that's powerful. Those numbers start to become very obviously much better but what happens in addition to it and this is my favorite part is there's less stress while it's happening because now people understand the mechanics where they weren't even considering the mechanics before. They're like I still have to work and I do what I do. Instead of a stroke to work, I do what I do, but why do I do what I do and why do I do it this way and when they analyze it and then they optimize it, that's a whole new ball game. And so think about when you're driving and you're learning how to drive. There's a lot. And the first time that you get behind the wheel so imagine being a kid being like that's so easy. All you have to do is like press the gas and go room room and turn the wheel my kids every single time until they drive and then they drive it like oh my gosh it's so scary. Yeah, because you're having to make multiple calculations instantaneously on the fly they're so much going through your brain and you're having to evaluate every single thing. Is it my turn to go do I put a signal on do I break it my breaking too much. That guy's going is it my turn and like wait, wait, there's all these different things. Okay, and you're having to process them. And so in the beginning. you're having to make these calculations and they're new, so you're just asking yourself, what are the numbers that even going into the calculations? But eventually, you drive so much that they become reflexive. You automatically know, like, imagine what it was like when you were learning your times tables. At first, you have to sit there and like, it all down and figure it out and find some way to do it. And then you memorize it. And then you know, 4 times 4 is 16. 6 times 6 is 36. Like, you just know what they are. So you don't have to spend time on it, which means it's less stressful because it's reflexive now. Driving is no longer stressful because it's reflexive now. Math is not basic, right? There's a lot of things that become less stressful because they're reflexive because what you did was stop having to make the calculations. So But if you can create the system that removes the need to make the calculations and the calculations are needed because I'm stressed out and how do I figure out how to get through these things when the phone starts ringing all day? Well, I need to come in two hours early, but now I have to go take my two kids who are not even in school yet and get daycare. So I'm going to disrupt their time and it's going to be early and I'm going to spend extra money just so I can do the job that should be able to be contained in the work hours.
00:59:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's stressful. What if we could get enough information and the only thing that came out of it is Viri is meeting her goals and now she doesn't have to go disrupt the lives of her young children by getting a daycare provider and now somebody, does she trust them? Are they safe? Are they happy? Do they feel loved? Is she stressed out the rest of the time? I'm now because she's leaving her little kids and they're only going to be little for a few more years before they start school. Like, that's a big deal in a person's life. But with a little bit more information, we might be able to figure out how to optimize what we're doing so that her children aren't so that her performance is still good throughout the day because she's not depressed that she had to lead them two hours earlier just to get the job done. Because we're not segmented and segregated here like in other businesses and maybe I should just go back to another firm where at least I only have one type of task and I didn't have to leave my kids. Like, people don't think about all these things in their teammates. Sometimes the bosses aren't thinking about them, but your people are thinking about them and sometimes they just make a decision and then they up and lead. So you need to think about it all proactively. And in order to be able to think about it well, you need eat data and information. So you can use that as an example. If you talk to Viri first and say, can I use this as an example? And maybe you don't use her specifically, maybe find a way around it and draw a similar kind of story that doesn't draw too much attention to her. But at the end of the day, greatness is always hard work. Average is, it's not fun, it's stressful. The average job is people don't want to go. They go because they have to. Because they have to pay bills. That's the average workplace. Showing out to a place that you like to work, even if it's remote and existing with an organization that you like and that you feel safe with, that's not average, that's above average. That's great. But to keep, to get even better, like it takes more or effort. So you have to decide what you want and then you have to decide who you want with you and then you have to decide if you can motivate them to be great with you because it would be so much more enjoyable than just being worried about your job every day or every week or every month.
01:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I'll start trying my time tomorrow then.
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:02:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hopefully I can be, you know, can have like first-hand experience and then I'll be able to sell them all that even stronger.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that and we can wait so that you have some example and then you know if you want to wait a couple weeks before you ask them, track your time.
01:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and I could only make sense for me to jump into the frame, know, before them.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that. I love leading by example. And then if we find something, a nugget that we can work on to improve for you, you can say, look, this was my experience. I did it, and I know exactly what I can do to make some improvements, and I feel better about it. I feel more peaceful about it. I feel clearer about it. that's everything. You know, you testify yourself, I know that this is going to be good for us, and I'm only looking for the good.
01:03:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You can do this. And the goal, the goal is that it's to, it's to feel great, it's to enjoy the people that you're working with, the work that you're doing. We're not going to enjoy all of it. There's going to be stuff that sucks. That's just life. But you can create packets of just, wow, that's great. These people are great. This is awesome. And it's okay that I have to do this. for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it is.
01:04:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I want them to know what it's like to feel like you're working every day for someone else's dream. I want to feel like they're working towards their own dreams to they're invested in them.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the growth of business as much as they are on their own. Yes. And that's a good thing to also what we didn't get to what I would love for you to do is send me what everybody's goals where you said you wanted goals for each of the people about time. my job was waiting for me to take her shopping so she can get ready for girls camp. I'm fine. I'm excited about that. But please send me that just so I have it. And any other notes that you might have just clip notes on how those meetings went. And then so next week, I'm meeting just with Patrick. And then the week after that, we'll have our group meeting and then the week after that is our one on one. So we'll figure it out. out. But if you send that to me an email, then maybe we can just kind of work this in the background. But the very least, that gives you those two weeks to be tracking your time. And I want you to analyze it. want you to look at it and go, huh, maybe, you know, just see if you noticed any kind of patterns.
01:05:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sure. Yeah.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Thanks, Tina. You're awesome. Thank you for your time, Lawrence. I hope you have a great week.
