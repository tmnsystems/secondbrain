Ooh.
00:00:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Stay on.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There we go. Vuffing on.
00:00:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are we at today?
00:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Arch.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you just say church?
00:00:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Church.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? That's a purse. purse. How's the weather on the perch today?
00:00:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Very sunny. No. Not a cloud in the sky. Ocean view. It's not bad.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I woke up to slush today and the snow is coming.
00:00:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so is my routine. Slush cherry. Look on the slush. Oh, other side slush. Brown slush. Yeah.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I wouldn't call it sleet, but sort of sleetish.
00:00:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, it was. It was. was. Yeah, it was crap. I don't like it.
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I wouldn't either.
00:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot wait to leave this place. Except that means that all my babies will be grown and that will also be sad. So I think it's better, sweet. Um, let's see, let's see. I only did not save my notes last time again. I'm so glad that teamwork saves notes for me automatically. You would think all the years that I've been doing this, that I would get better at saving my thoughts because I used to have the same issue with Basecamp 11, 12, years ago, but it all saves for me also. Um, where do you put the names? I put them in teamwork, but I don't put everything there because something we talk about, no, no, I know.
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, yeah, you probably need to just use something that auto saves them locally and then you'll.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, now I'll cut and paste it in teamwork because teamwork doesn't ever save anything. It does.
00:02:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does?
00:02:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. I can't save it for weeks as long as I don't close the browser.
00:02:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
think it did that.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yep.
00:02:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And again, I don't really use teamwork, so.
00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know.
00:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm only via email.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm only via email. Okay. Hold on a second. Now I was scrolling through do do do sales page from the master plan. I'm trying to think sometimes so like I take notes, but they're not awesome now because I'm in the middle of a conversation and I'm trying to take them. But what I need to do is like sort them for what to follow up on next conversation. Then we get done and my brain is like or I usually have to go check on a child or something. Let's see. So, waiting for the bookkeeper to finish the book so you can go back to the fountain.
00:03:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got an update on that. Her sister has cancer. I'm reading the path, but as she's finished her. I think the first rounds of chemo. So now she's just, you know, at home resting or whatever. So I'm back to work full time. So she's like, I swear, they'll be done by the end of next week. I was like, I'm just for an update because those guys hit me up. And I'm trying to respond to him.
00:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that CC kilo?
00:03:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it breast cancer?
00:03:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know if she actually told me.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I sure hope it goes better for her than it is for my sister-in-law. because that's been like a three-year battle and they don't handle it very well. It depends on where you go, like, you know, everybody's different, but it is not a very tactical approach that they take with cancer. It's kind of shocking to me at this point.
00:04:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The DK, when I saw DK a few months ago, three months ago, recently, the first thing he told me is like, I got to tell you something, and I was like, okay, and then all of a sudden he starts crying, and I was like, uh-oh, he's very emotional anyway, and I was like, uh-oh, and he's like, Dan has cancer free, and I was like, when was she cancer full? I don't remember, he goes, I didn't tell you, I couldn't, I, I just, I'm not to tell you, because we just got, we just got all clear, it's free, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then he launches into this story about how she got diagnosed last November, something like that. And then he, he's such a nerd, you know, he's a chiropractor, he was going to go to med school, but he ended up being a chiropractor because a chiropractor healed him from the injury, and he's like, I want to do this for people. So, but he knows how to read medical journals and he goes deep on , like he went deep on COVID, he covered King about it. And he figured out that the bet, whatever carcinoma, whatever was the best treatment for that was the structure in Houston or something. So, for the last year, he doesn't fly, right, he's got this thing about flying, so he will not fly. For the last year, they had been driving from Sandler Obispo to Houston. and then staying at like family housing at this center so that she could get treatment from this specialist. And they've been driving back and forth and they would stay there while she got, I don't know if it just came out, don't know what it was. However, many weeks her and the baby and then they were dropped back and he never told me about it. And he did disappear, like he disappeared completely, know, So yeah, it's super interesting, like you're saying, it's like, theirs was very tactical, but I think they first went to like a regular typical path and he was instantly like, nope, it's gonna be like mega doses of IVs like vitamin D and vitamin C and like, he didn't really get into it. He's kind of, he's like, I'll tell you all about it later, but it was, it wasn't experimental, but it wasn't normal either, right? So it wasn't like she was in the test drug. But it's gone, like they're like, she's 100% cancer free. then they're like, yeah, typically, you know, it doesn't cut what will track you for a year or whatever. And then then it's every six months. But yeah, it's weird. He messaged me like a week ago about Fletcher stuff, because he had seen an old comment and was asking, he he can't decide whether not he will not launch his own product. So I think, obviously, right, it's like this also was a huge financial hit, right? So he wasn't really working. So he had to take care of the kid.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he couldn't work as much.
00:07:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he basically paused his business for a year. He's the only one that makes money. Like she works with him. But I think he's kind of not a great place financially. The only thing that's Dave Tim is Bitcoin.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:08:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, because he bought a ton of Bitcoin years ago and he was tapping into Bitcoin profits to pay for it, to pay for the treatment. mean, they have insurance, but some of this was outside of that.
00:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, it crazy. It is crazy how stuff works. So, he said he was going to launch that product, but he was shooting videos. just hit them out and be like, so how's that launch going? We'll just add a little nudges encouragement, because that's new crap to go through.
00:08:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yes. This is great.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the love, that's what I was just about to say. It's crazy how love, like purity, like loving a person. I mean love right now, last week, some people. And having a baby. you will just change your perspective. It doesn't do it for everybody, but it can profoundly help people just, you know, anyway, you know, it'll change your perspective and change your priorities and and everything else. And that's the the catalyst to like, if I see people, and I think, yeah, because a particular person and I have very different perspectives on on people and what will tolerate and some and it's interesting because he is more tolerant of some people and I'm like, why? it's the other way around same thing. And I'm like, okay, but it's what I've noticed is that if a person does not change significantly when they either go through death, divorce, or birth of a child, that person is not likely to change period. If those or severe like health to the you know fear of death or bankruptcy like the things that should that will humble any hard heart if it doesn't humble a person i'm like yeah i have zero hope for you i mean god bless you i hope for you but i don't have i don't really have any faith of that change but i do think those types of things can change almost anybody the only people i think they can't change is like really kind of wicked people and i do think there's some of them but i don't think there's very many of them i mean yeah anyway but that's that's kind of my litmus test like if you went through that on phase like and you still are all right look um okay so working on the books still working on those uh no real ETA.
00:11:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
On the books she said it'll be done by the end of next week.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, sippy. Just more. Okay. Okay. Um. run my myself because I wrote it down, but I did not make it skimmable writing. Um, in terms of just the sites. Okay. Hold on. New products for another 71 go live in November.
00:11:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, I think we're on track with that. Uh, the mushy is doing the. we had to come up with like. An upsell path in the supplements and. original idea and thinking about it and talking it really was like, yeah, that's not, we can't do that. I was like, all right, we need to come up with an alternative. Originally, we were gonna like unlock all the sections of all the sections as a supplement. I was like, well, I don't think we should do that. Instead, we should only offer an upsell to the other subscription. So it would be going from like 67 to 87, whatever, right? So unlocking the rest of the section. I'm like, really, let's not make people like more hardcore supplement users. So we decided not to offer that. We could do it later, but right now we're not. And it makes things very complicated. But in order to, we don't have like a subscription switch. It's like you need to collect a a payment if they're going to do that. So, Luci had to figure out how to. I figured out that it existed and that he's coding it so that it works. So, it'll be gap payment, upgrade to the other subscription, and we offer them to unlock all sections at that level.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see that again so I can write it out?
00:13:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, you don't have to write it. What's happening? Okay, supplement goes to subscription upgrades. So, go from supplement to full, same section, and then back out to our typical OTO which is unlock all sections at the full level, the full course level. We haven't really nailed the names.
00:13:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that was the wrong thing that was supposed to be errors. Supplement is a description upgrade which is full to what and then we offer another an unlock where we unlock all the sections as full okay like that and what are the price points for all of that right now it's 67 and 87 but i'm still gonna fight for 77 and 87 when it's done you're fighting for 87 do you get to at least it's about test for that that's now i'm just saying we do 77 and 87 call today i don't think there's a i i figure if we're going to raise our price we might as well raise our price like on both levels we haven't done it in six years and it's like do it and be like oopsie
00:15:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do what?
00:15:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change the price. Like, tell what you want it to be.
00:15:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no. Um, we'll talk about it right before we launch it. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, like Jeff always, like he's more fear based.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh.
00:15:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I'm not. Like, let's just do it. And we'll know. And it's like, what's, I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Plus, it's worth 77 bucks.
00:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're both worth it. Yeah.
00:15:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, granted, we're still going to make more money. just won't make. You, you just don't, you have to, it'll be less of a. Less of an increase, right? Because whatever percentage of people buy the new product, but you're guaranteed to make more money if they're bought.
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, based on current sales, if you were to change that price, um, and I know there's new products, so you're calculating, but what would it value be to you if conversions didn't take a hit and you increase the price?
00:16:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean that's a good factor. I'd have to know like the total number of transactions, like the average amount of transactions. We run a year, don't really know that number. I've never looked at that, but that's how you would figure it out. You'd be like, hey, you ray on X amount of $67 transactions and then you just raise that by $20. It'd be a lot.
00:16:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you should do a revenue simulator.
00:16:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I actually don't even know that exists. It's like it would be interesting, but I don't know if I can actually understand that.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't know if you could see that?
00:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like I don't, I'm racking my brain. I'm like, I don't think there's, I'm thinking about woo, and it's not something, there's no like thing in woo, where it's just like, great, how many times did you run a number 67, right? Because it's across two different things, would be a renewal and new sale, purchase, it was, many of you would all control it's borders, it's only not.
00:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're getting garbled, that happens sometimes.
00:17:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm talking, I'm also talking low.
00:17:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, obviously he does not have.
00:17:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I have to think about where that number might exist. Not in metric, and so it's done about it.
00:18:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, so there's really darting math that you could do, right?
00:18:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, I just don't I just don't know how to get it's that it's it's like total average transactions. We're just like, whatever, I'm going to call a transaction so you can know what word would be orders like that, you know what I mean, it's not it's not even orders because then you have to you'd have to take out your be total $67 total, $67 order, right? So you'd have to get rid of the upsells. You that's it, like we don't have any numbers, but you just want to take out the themselves better it's got to be uh there'll be a rhetoric speak louder gotta be a matter it's yeah i would think it's any rhetoric but maybe not can we go look at it where you are on your i'm literally looking at it i'm like i don't know what do you ever like that yeah i'm looking at it right now but i don't see it but my guess is that i could filter it or find it in here here's gotta be like how do you i mean i'm looking at some numbers right now they're definitely wrong like this is not right so i don't know what they call it but it's right you have successful orders it could be that but the number it's extremely high like ridiculously high it's definitely not a year it's well over a year's worth I don't think this was ever here before, actually. This doesn't even look familiar.
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you look at your numbers?
00:20:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like this? Never, literally never. I... Why would I have no reason to look at this? This is not, we're not gonna do anything.
00:20:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't see how that's not useful.
00:20:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, because I just use the two numbers, the new subscriptions, a total subscriptions a day, and then the new customers, like those are the two driving KPIs. And that's how I know things are on track or off track. This is, I mean, this would be useful for this one sort of projection, but then I would never use it again. Then I would go back to those two numbers.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Except you've had a... She's where things have gone wrong and you didn't notice.
00:21:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I did. Other people told me I was wrong, but I was wrong.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just feel like getting in the habit of looking at things from different angles helps you catch things faster or better.
00:21:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's how we ended up with those two numbers. That's why there, it's those two, because I was like, these are the two numbers. mean, one of these is wrong. One of these goes off. Something's off and it works like a term now. We just watch those religiously, report on them every Monday, look at them. I know Bobby, like Bobby logs in every day, like I do. Every day we log in, up to spot check and you can tell. I do it all the time when I'm on calls with people. I say, I can log in right now and tell you whether not today is good, bad or whatever or on track. I look again, I look at 9 a.m. six or eight, whatever the number is, I go wrong. It'll get there by into the blood. Now it's like, the more important thing is how do we get past that? That's what we were talking about about Monday and I, that's stuff that Lucy's working on. But your point, it's like, if I could figure out this number and then factor, okay, that whatever, what is it, what increases that even? 60, 20% increase. 30% increase? So what would a 30% increase in trans-action value be? I don't know. But that would be the way to get the actual, that number would be real. Whereas I can't use the subscription math on that because it won't work. But it will work from this straight transaction, but whatever you want to call it.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing is, so, Because the whole point of the question was how do we get Jeff to just agree and it'd be the pretty easy math I think I thought right oh no no he is not motivated He's not motivated by money. No, it's not just that so does it care hear me out? Would you hear me anyway? Sure, okay? So it's not it isn't just about money. There's there's the logistics to it, right? But it so let's say a certain whatever he he should be to the extent that You you get paid in market share and investment and and even just market share so let's say that That the dollar amount is how well you're serving the market and the resources that you have or whatever I Don't know. I guess it's not because if sales dip and sales dip and you have less of the market That means you're serving less people. So maybe he's fearful of both fronts.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like he's fearful that he has multiple fears. It won't work and then we'll lose market share. And we raise the price and then everyone already hates him. So it's like, and I can't I mean, that's him. That stuff, like it's like it wounds him. When people say on Reddit, whereas I never go on Reddit and never even think to go on Reddit and then Bobby go on Reddit, they both do it. You know, because they'll like start threads with the theory of us, like, could you see the sun, Reddit? my answer is always the same. No, I didn't. I don't do vanity searches. I don't go on Reddit. I don't even think about it. But so the way to do it would be just to say. like, we are putting, we're actually making less money, both of us. So that doesn't matter, man. But it's like, hey, you know, if we want to pay people more down the road, like we should be, we shouldn't keep having to take that from ourselves.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:25:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the value is there. This is still extremely valuable. Like, comparatively, the value is there. And we just spent a year, and then some making it even more valuable. And now we got to say, I bit that's coming out, that's going to be valuable. I'm like, we're, we're, it's not like we're charging more for less, we're charging more for more, and we're not using that much more for the more that we're providing.
00:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, there's no guarantee that this is going to just keep working.
00:25:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, .
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you should be storing up what you can, because, because it's not guaranteed. And he's got how many,
00:26:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
kids. I'm going to go to nice.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That money goes away very, very quickly when you're trying to take care of them. So like, you know, is he care more about what the market thinks and how the market is served or taking care of his family first and just being prudent because we're talking about talking, you know, $10 up a month, which is let's say two gallons of gas or something.
00:26:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What is it?
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a, it's a millet, some cheap restaurant. I can't even bring myself the same McDonald's because that's not real. But, but you know, so to, and people are going to complain no matter what you do. So whatever, and, but I know you, I'm sure, I would, I'm not really sure you have these conversations because for, for what I know about you, you're just pretty much like, whatever. That's what you think. not going to argue with you blah, blah, blah, and you just like,
00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
disconnect. No, no, no, We go up like the entire meeting. So I happened at one point. And then the longer it's taken for this to launch, he, the fear builds up. So the last time we talked about the pricing was probably a month ago. And he came back with I think it should be 67. Well, then he even wanted to lower the price. And I'm out of it. We are not doing that. I'm like, that could blow up in our face. And it just ruins all the math. Like we can't ruin the math. We spent six years establishing this math. can never go below $67. Because it's literally starting from zero. And then he did understand that. He's like, Oh, all right. Yeah, that's a good point. I go, no, it's the only point.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in this, probably won't work, but I'm just going to say it because I like looking for the way that the numbers tell the story and help with the tactics. If you were to be able to figure out some decently clean math or somewhat helpful dirty math, what you could say, know, we're talking about $200,000 at the end of the year, like, is bringing that into your family worth dealing with whatever people say on Reddit, knowing none of that has any real value anyway, because look at all your testimonials. I mean, do you care about the people that have pissed off at you, or do you care about the people that are happy with you?
00:28:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't think he's always happy with you. Yeah, and I'm not sure, like, he talked to Rhonda, and Rhonda said she couldn't work with her. So, like, I don't know what his plans are, but whatever they were, Rhonda was like, nope, I thought that was funny. Um, so, yeah, I don't know what that, I don't know what that would say. I don't know that he should be thinking in those terms. should be thinking in terms of how am I going to retire?
00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How am I going to pay for 10 kids?
00:29:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I really don't think he does. know, and part of that is he's very deez-a-see. And he's like, it's all going to be fine. He's literally more concerned with his afterlife than he is with his.
00:29:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There are so many scriptures though that talk to us about being prepared and doing good work and laboring and all kinds of other things. Like that is not like, Jesus is everything to me, but that's not how this works. To be smart and strategic and also a good steward over the things that you have. For example, the parable of the Collins. The one that Jesus was happiest with was the ones that went and multiplied what was given to them. So, you know, anyway, I could give you so many scriptures, but it would be out of context for you to do that. So, that wouldn't work.
00:30:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah. And it has no meaning for me, like, I don't have, that's not part of my thought process, right? but I hear what you're saying. don't, I mean, part of me is also like, there's no, there's no need to belabor it until it's actually going to be a thing, right? So, when it comes time, when it comes time to launch it, I'm going to go. We should make it 77. In part, part of the last time we talked about it, he was like, he said something like, I forget what it was, but again, it was like the entire meeting. And he said something about, well, know, when we launched the new product, and I don't know why he thought this, but he was basically saying something along the lines of like, we didn't know what was going to happen.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, the hell we didn't.
00:30:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. I knew exactly. Think of what was going to happen.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and how long it would take, and when it was correct, and everything.
00:31:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And whether or not we were going to whether not was even working, right? It was like, we, I knew day by day whether not where we need to be. And we can't lose that because it's been the sort of guiding thing this whole time. But also it's like, yeah, I get it, not wanting to raise the price. And it would be great if you never had to do it. But and I'm not saying, let's face facts. We have done it once in six years. think we did it once in the six years before that. We raised our prices like every six to eight years. Like no one's around.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're all gone. Right.
00:31:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it doesn't even matter. So and if we're not going to be here in another six years to raise it again, if it all goes well.
00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just, I just, you know, you're never going to see this and do anything with it in my brain. I'm just like. What are the bullets for Jeff? number one is like, there's no guarantee that this keeps on working with your exit plan. Whatever your exit plan is, you need optimal margins for it. Like if it's just you shut it down, you need optimal margins. If you think you're going to do this till you die, there is no guarantee for that. But if you're going to sell it, the better your margins are better. And like, when do you retire? What are you going to retire on? What does that look like? How do you take care of your kids? And all of these things work best if this business is run as optimally and strategically as possible. And so 67, we've been doing the first model.
00:32:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
is it?
00:32:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
865, 1,865,000. so three quarters of a million dollars.
00:32:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
More than that, yeah. Yeah, yeah, Nearly a million. Yeah. Jeff, what's more important to you?
00:33:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
million dollars, or the opinion of Jack Assalom.
00:33:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's it. That's it. Everyone bought 80.
00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So which they want. Right.
00:33:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
if you do actually, so minimum, we can get the minimum number, which would this would be out there? It would be times ten dollars. 43. I think this number is correct. No, I don't right. me type it in. around 43, two, eight, six. So it's 430 grand, 432. What that does is it completely, like your overhead is paper and then some. Right? it's like that covers Bobby. That covers the new girl's name. don't know. covers I have a check that covers. VJ that covers everyone. It's like, so it goes, it just, we cover all that and we'd make some more money.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it also, it also raises the value of the company that you're going to try and sell in three years. Yes. So, Dan, I like that.
00:34:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that argument the best.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
said it out loud. Well, that was part of when I said, what's your exit plan and everything needs optimal margins. If you sell it, which that is probably the best exit plan, right? Since we know that there's interest, you're increasing market share and Jeff is no spring chicken. Your kids are just about to be graduated. Like, how much longer are you going to want to stay in it? Probably, it's not that hard. So, not that you could do it for a long time. then again, with AI with everything else, how much is this market changed? Like, we don't, the world is changing so fast. So, to me, that this great be trained is just not going to be disrupted is really not smart. Everything is disrupted.
00:35:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Absolutely.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is part of the conversation I think that you should have. So if you go in there with here's here's the rough map of this is if we change this, everybody is paid for out of that increase, and we make extra money. And we just made this a more enticing offer to buyers. And something is going to happen and change and disrupt this, you know, at least in the next 10 years, if not sooner. What? It's a no brain to me, but whatever. But I'm not Jeff. So yeah, either way, I still feel like that was a useful time to spend talking about that. I get frustrated. Jeff not even work with them. I think he's awesome. I don't even work with them. But still, you know, anyway, It's so weird to be like so disconnected from something and still feel invested into it.
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Well, whenever you talk to them, I know. okay. You said that that conversation's not even coming until like you get ready for it. So I guess it would be when the product goes live. So it's within the month, right? I have no number.
00:36:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we're going to get done. And then I think we've already decided that we're going to. Do you like a black Friday? This is it. Like we here's the black Friday dealers. This is the last time you're going to get this price. And then we're going to raise the prices after black Friday, seven Mondays over. Like launch launch the exact that in our worst month, which is fine. But yeah. It provided the codes down on all works, which I'm pretty sure will and then I think Into the fusion toss stuff of John The infusion top part like so they need that finish use the soft part So it's all sort of engine on this last bit of code. Well, it's new code It wasn't really part of the plan. It's almost she's working on it so as soon as he releases that then the infusion top guys can Do their bit where they're adding the tags whatever everything else has been done inside the membership site? Yeah, so I think it's all sort of queued up go and then we can test it in November make sure it's all good to go and then Think we're gonna run this black Friday like this bit And then we would want to you know whenever that from around this typical run is Like seven days, eight days, I forget.
00:38:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then there's Cyber Monday?
00:38:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we usually run it through that in two or three days. And then we would look for like, I guess we'd also factor in, you know, if by chance there was a score release, we would probably try to get it done before the score release. So I don't think the next, I think score release is later into some of those.
00:38:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember when you're like, we don't do Black Friday sales?
00:38:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We don't. And this isn't one either.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing's on sale. Ivy, okay, promotion. Black Friday promotion.
00:38:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is a promotion. Promotion? Sure.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sale, Yeah. Okay. Logistics, verbiage, semantic.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
got you. President Jeff wants to do it like we should have a sale. No, no, no sales. Sales.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So let me, let's thinking about mom stuff but I'm reading my notes which just very useful last week because we were talking a lot like really into it and I was thinking oh yeah there was a lot I wanted to say and talk about and get into and now because I didn't write good enough notes I don't really remember where my brain was going um you're talking about um the goal was to finish the continuous release model um to release a song in december and then two more songs after that to follow the continuous release model and then oh you pro you started promoting what a week ago and already had 1,800 monthly listeners I want to what's the update on that okay now it's over 2,200 1,300 can you check it?
00:40:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
24. It's going up. I also submitted it to some review places. Just to get people out on those feedback. All feedback is super positive. Multiple people are like, oh yeah, the singer sounds like Jacob Dillon. Like, really? Who's Jacob Dillon and are you the singer? I am the singer. And then Jacob Dillon is Bob Dillon's son. Who's the lead singer of the world's flowers? But Mark Robear says that. He goes, dude, you sound like Jacob Dillon sometimes. I was like, what a weird reference. And then someone else made the exact same reference.
00:40:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, maybe it's not so weird.
00:40:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It just weird to me. Although I did like a couple of their songs.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would be interesting to see as you launch this what the algorithm is because I feel like it almost has it obviously there's not enough information to do this this is an intuition type of thing but if you were at 1800 after one week and it's 2438 now I wonder how much of the original like at the time of launch matters to the push like is there a okay so an Etsy and even with Facebook content it used to be like this I don't know now we have so many delayed things but but I'll use Etsy because that's current how so Etsy will promote something that goes out a new product for like the first three days and kind of see how it performs if it performs well it keeps sending traffic and if it's not doing great compared to other things that have similar interests and similar audiences, right? Then it doesn't get you keep getting promoted as much. And so I wonder if it's similar like that with the music and if that's the case, there's a bit first of all, I think that that's what helps your continuous release model. So you get this original traction of, you know, what is the time period?
00:42:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it 72 hours? Is it a week? Whatever.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like I would love to see the graph as to how those followers went on a day by day basis. That would be amazing to see. And especially if you watch it all the way. So like can you see a pattern? And then are there things that you can do it? So like what if you started for the month and you or does it do better if you release it at all these different places at the same time so that you get more traction and more awareness? And then because of that awareness, and more people liking it, it boosts the algorithm and they go, Oh, this is popular. So let's give it more traffic. You know what I mean? Just didn't.
00:43:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, so that the stuff you're talking about is applicable. I think when if you do things around when the song is literally released, I didn't start doing this until four months later. So I just started messing around with them month later. So all I'm doing right now is what's known as play listing. Went to play listing services. And I was like, Hey, you offer your song to playlist, basically, they're curators for people that run a playlist or multiple lists, and it's up to them, whether or not they want to take the song. You can't necessarily be adding to a list. You probably can, but that's not the way that I like. So you submit your For review and then it's up to that curator that list owner whether not they add the song so All i've done is prove that with play listing you can get traction but Only if they like the song right so there's i can't make someone like your song right i i can make Tell you about your songs not good, which i started doing for people i don't know if they appreciated it but i'm like you know you can do this But i've proven that playlists playlists can work And i think that i'm sort of figured out the strategically around that of like oh hey if you had everyone in mom Use the same playlist in service and then report back their experience with the specific playlist You could then have a mom Um, you're rated playlist list of playlists and say hey you go into submit hub and your rock go through the go through our curated list or air table whatever we build it in and then search for rock these are the playlists you need to submit to because this band this band this band this band this band that are in here got onto that list so I think that could be valuable and so you're basically sort of crowdsourcing submit hub by genre with other bands that are like in the community that you're in and then I went outside and used some other services so and I could say hey I submitted this service and it worked but again it only you can't you can say that it worked but if it doesn't work for them it's ultimately I believe it's going to come down to the song and you can't we can't say to them oh hey it's because of your oh they the list over the well Oh, yeah, I mean, they just tell you straight up and they're nice about it. Like, so, and so you get the feedback. So I think you, I think you could do something like that. Like all the feedback that I got, you have people cut and paste that into another place. And we're using it to refine a list and say, yeah, don't see. Cause you're just sort of throwing dark, you just something around from it. Cut and piece with, you get feet, you get feedback from these list owners. They write back, they write back and they'll be like, Oh, hey, uh, we're actually looking for songs that are sadder.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's an example.
00:46:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
even though they list their list as being an alternative rock, right? So I, the only one, I submit my song based on, Oh, it's alternative rock. And then they wrote back and said, Oh yeah, we are, you know, but we're looking at sad songs, there was no indication that they wanted sad songs.
00:46:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:46:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But now then that can be part of the the hive mind and say, well, if you have a sad song, and then if someone with a sad song submitted here and they got in, you'd be like, oh, there you go. That's what this list is good for. This is what the, so you're getting a deeper understanding of the list by getting multiple feedbacks on the list owner, and then putting that into one source.
00:47:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
sort of library, whatever. The other stuff that you're talking about, like marking those guys. So this is in the book now. There is stuff you can do when you release the song to push it into Spotify's playlist. So marking those guys released their EP, whatever, like two weeks ago, and they got picked up by one of Spotify's lists. And then that's gonna get them a ton of streams. But these streams are, well, I don't know, right? To your point, it will be interesting to see. The number just keeps going up, which I didn't think it would. Like, I don't know why it keeps going up. What is interesting is we're not getting a lot of followers from it. So you get streams, which are plays of the song, but we've only picked up like 22 followers. So it's like a .002 conversion rate of stream to follower, which is kind of crappy. You'd be better off getting followers, but I think followers will happen with our app.
00:48:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm.
00:48:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, that's what my plan is to use. Well, we have all these test bands, right? we have lands on cross until me, where we can really intimately go, well, what did you do? What did you do to get that result? Okay, great. Also try to repeat us or turn it into a framework or whatever.
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think it's something that you could do to really serve your people as if they can capture all of it that people back, and you build a database that says, you know, these providers are looking for this as of this date. And so they know, you know, and also so you can plot out look like 90% of them are looking for this type of content, or 30% of them is looking for this kind of content. And they have this size of a follower base, like, do you want to try to dominate that space, low hanging fruit, like smaller pool, bigger fish, like do be a bigger fish in a smaller pool, that kind of thing. The different strategies for different artists, like if they're a niche kind of artist, and there are niche platforms.
00:49:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, they're there are niche playlists all day long. And but the trick would be finding the ones that, right, it's their niche, but then then you get feedback from them and you go, Oh, So you're really alternative rock sad songs, right? It's like, but the only way to do that is to go through, to let you have to pay, submit up, and you pay like a credit, or you know what a credit's worth. But you're, so that would work, because the playlist thing clearly works. And I've seen people say it doesn't work. So I think part of it is because it was me, right? So I'm a marketer, so I go in and I'm reading these things. And I obviously chose fairly well, although I think I did get, I think I had a 50-50 hit rate, like 50% picked it up and 50% said no. And then of the ones that said yes, that resulted in the 2000, whatever, that's happening right now. And then one of them ended up playing it on the radio and like, Brazil or some . And you can see this stuff in Spotify. So you can see when you get added to a playlist. Then you and see the graph in relation to that. And then that could all be shared with the group. And then there's the idea of like building your own playlists, right? So you say, okay, we're going to start building our own playlists. And then you can get on our playlist, you know, that works.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm.
00:51:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then there's the thing of like adding the community, right? So remember like, Rank Hearn did the instant karma machine or whatever? It was like, it was part of list control and it was like, it was like a referral thing. Like if you referred someone, then you got points and I was like, okay. And somebody else did something, or I want to say somebody else did something like this. But I've had it in my mind for two years. I said, okay, we built a community, but we just say, hey, Lansdowne just released this. song. If you go stream it right now, we will see that you streamed it and then you'll earn credit to get your song streamed by the community next time. So they build up credits and then when their songs out, we alert the other people on the network like go stream, go stream this song and they can choose stream it or not. But if they do, then they earn a credit to get their song streamed. So then it becomes this carmic thing. So when release day comes out, boom, 500 people go stream it. That's going to signal to Spotify like, Hey, this song is popular. They won't know that they're all coming from the same, you know, network. It's not it's not it's a network of people not a network of whatever.
00:52:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. couldn't order it out for hours.
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. don't know if it would work. Right. So it'd be like something to test.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, whatever, you're what you're working on is changing and it would be cool to me. I mean, we have our hour every week. If we could spend half an hour on it and setting up maybe kind of project management, you use my time, however you want to and I'm going to poke and prod and eventually what always happens is you think of something you didn't think of and you go do something of it and that's useful but with mom getting some real bones on it, I don't know, I would like to have some more structured involvement in it but we could still do it within our existing hour if you had any interest in that but it would be helpful to me to have the data to be able to look at this. things and see what you're doing so I can formulate better questions and be more useful in that, but especially since that's going to be probably between that and another 71 majority of your focus.
00:54:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll, it will come down to just asking questions like where are you housing this, what are you doing with that? Is this something I can see and have access to to look at numbers and to kind of just create some structure and look, I don't even have any specific questions to ask at the moment. And especially because you don't really have been putting out an offer and haven't been doing promotions, but all of that is on the precipice right now and really starting with the walk promotion.
00:54:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
know, only at the Spotify, I'll get the proof.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So when is the, when do we know about that?
00:54:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
After Reese, I think I have to resubmit it, so it'll be by the end of the year. I don't, I mean, it'll probably be eight weeks from tomorrow, Saturday, like Sunday this week.
00:55:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
David doesn't get approved on what?
00:55:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's not a version of the world where that happens. We resubmit it again. It'll eventually get approved. I just don't know when, so that's okay. So do you have nothing else to offer if that doesn't get approved? No, it's just that that's part of the defined MVP.
00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you not launch this until it gets approved?
00:55:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Correct. We don't launch it as a DIY. I mean, those guys are signing up fans every week. So they're, you know, so there's part of the front end offer presently, we wanted to have this pre-sig thing as part of me.
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many bands do they have?
00:56:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'd have to go count, but it's it's over 20.
00:56:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does anybody like track them in this spreadsheet, have any data or?
00:56:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean they're all sub-accounts and family. They're all and they're coaching them, so they have like a coaching slack group, but I don't participate in that at all. Where do I want to?
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you do in fan flow, not just the coaching and slack group, right?
00:56:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so like I built an automation today because they've got a guy coming in, they found this dude that runs Facebook ads for band merch and This dude is like, no bro, I put up the ads to cold traffic, and I don't touch the ads for a year. They just run and he's saying that he spent the $1000 for this one band and made $150,000. And I was like, yeah, I'd like to see that. So we set up some conversion tracking stuff written so he can run the traffic through a high-level store. But yeah, I did that this morning. And now that guy's going to start running out for one of the bands, so we'll test him up on account. And then he's like, he wants to do as many as he can, and I think he's going to show them how he's doing it, and that kind of stuff. I just thought I don't work with, I mean, I've met with a couple of the bands, but just sort of here and there. But I don't interact with them for the most part other than just random interactions.
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so would it be possible next week that we could look at Ben for so I can just see kind of like what you the questions will come, but without anything to like visually put my eyeball on they just are kind of really ambiguous in my head, and I would love to see Just know this, I didn't build a lot of it, like I build a lot of what's in the behind the scenes, but just as an example, I don't know jack about the dashboards.
00:58:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just know they exist, I kind of know how they work, but I don't set them up, I don't set up anyone's I've never set up an account, I'm more like all the technical aspects in the apps, right like. I think we got like six different apps now. They're not all lives, but they're putting another one live right now. And Norio asked them to make other changes.
00:59:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I can't even explain what the struggle is to formulate questions without having my eyeballs on anything and just having conversation.
00:59:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that even without you having- I can add to it as a user right after this anyway. You can go poke around.
00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that would be helpful too.
00:59:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Little heart's content.
00:59:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My nerdy brain heart.
00:59:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. There's like ads of automations that need to be cleaned up. Okay. Which we talked about on Monday. need to know we got to make a more snapshot, which we talked about this morning. And he's like, all right, we're going get that. But really by the end of the year, it's like get this. If I have done and then just clean out things organized and cleaned out, I mean, they're pretty organized, but they're also not. It's like the name and conventions vary and we need to really just follow on methodology and it's never good.
01:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In other news, I got tagged in a Facebook post today, we'll let you end with us. I'm like, I look at it and I'm like, I don't know that name. And it's some Asian girl and lingerie and she's off hanging out and then she's tagged a billion people, right? And it says, more nude pictures here. I'm like, how does that get on Facebook and people get blocked or like, you know, in Facebook jail for all these other things? I'm like, that's insane. And then so I recorded it, of course, right? And they're like, yeah, we removed the comment. That was it. was like, this is just the world is in shame. So that's how we end this in shame.

I was, that was my next question. Like, is there a party?
01:01:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, what's happening? I don't know.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably a bunch of parties.
01:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

College can change things and drag people out. peer pressure, you know what I mean? Like, in a good way, friends just dragging you out and making you social because it's kind of not to.

It'd be interesting see. Well, I can't even tell she's making friends. It's like, yeah, I have. And I don't think she cares. That's what I told my mom. I was like, here's what I can tell you. She's not complaining. was like, that's how you know Ableton's not down with something. They'll complain. I haven't heard her complain once. Other than about the internet, the internet and cell service, those are the two complaints, and they're valid. So there's no cell service there, was bizarre.

That's, yeah, I think when you're super intelligent friends, like, I don't know, your interactions with people are a little bit different because you're just observing people at a whole different kind of level. I think that's why they say ignorance is bliss. It's just like, a lack of innocence is bliss. And sometimes too much is a curse. And I don't know. Anyway, well, already done. Well, I hope you guys I hope Denise has a good Halloween. I hope you have a good weekend and I will talk to you on Monday.
