Hey.
00:00:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hey.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. a little bit of running around today, this morning. Yeah, your ends up kind of stuff. But I've finished up a quiz automation in those building or updating for 10 and get that over to him to review before I publish it.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. How's that going with him?
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
mean, it's going well as far as I can. As far as I can tell, you know, we his Facebook group has like 7,800 members and it's hard to get good engagement, good response or get steady responses on the post. So the ones that do best or when it's like, hey, I've got this cool thing I use in my gym, who wants that kind of thing. And I did a post like that last week and said I need get like 50 comments to share the ads that Tim runs to bring in new leads and appointments and that's up to 77 comments now. Oh, Yeah, so that was good. So I think I'm just going to start doing more of those. And then we're. I'm just doing a Black Friday promotion. Well, it's not his Black Friday promotion. It's a webinar, where we're selling a done for you Black Friday promotion for Jim. So that's happening in the middle of October that I'm teaching that. So I've written a lot of the, most of the promo copy leading up to that and then just updating some language on the registration page.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did it take you to get 50 comments?
00:02:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We got to 50 like in three days.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. And what kind of budget did you have for that?
00:02:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's all organic. That's awesome.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's in this group. So how's the conversation going around your working arrangement? And how are you feeling about it?
00:03:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I own my follow-up back to a gross summit So sending is before gross summit. send an outline of of how how it would work with me earning a percentage and at the same time I updated my recurring charge to the three grand And So I didn't even just follow up on that email and and ask him if If he's had a chance to review it He took I guess he's got a cabin somewhere up in North, Arizona and he was there for 10 days or so Available but I've taken some time after the event, but he's back in this week.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So what are you thinking about your conversation? how would you?
00:04:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How are you framing it in your mind? Well, I later all out in the email. So it's, I want him to respond to that either via email or getting on a call and in the hammering. You know, just talking through the details, but it's like, you know, I want to be, I want to be at 5k or 5k a month for the work that I do outside of, of Titans. And the way I frame it is like, you know, I'll be incentivized because to make that, I've I've got to basically to make an extra 5k a month for, or I'm sorry, to make an extra 2k a month on top of what he's paying me. have to, for the year, I have to sell 400 grand for him. And that would, that would generate 24k for me.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That's how I talked about it in the, in the email to him.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I see that? Would you like screen share real quick?
00:05:39 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'd love to see what you put together. Yeah, let me find that. Thank you. Can you read that?
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That sounds awesome. You'd have to be just so greedy and stingy. Thank you. know that.
00:07:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a it's a good deal.
00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Heck yeah, it is. And so well, I love the way I you did such a good job, like you covered all the points. So you did the simple math, you wrote down the caveat to you wrote down, you know, what applies to what and what doesn't. You like you framed it so simple, so clear. No brainer. I know people are dumb enough to say no to stuff like this. It wouldn't make zero sense. So but then you know what you need to know. If somebody can say no to this, you know all you need to know about them. There's it's not they're not rational. They don't value you. and the work that you do, because by definition, you'd have to have earned it.
00:08:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. So, yeah, exactly. mean, I think that, you know, there's a possibility for somebody to say, another possibility someone would say, no, is that it feels like they're not confident that that we'll be able to get an accurate... No, that's not what I'm saying. Like, for example, this Black Friday promotion that's coming up, you know, Tim's created that webinar. My job is to get people to the webinar. He then sells them on the webinar. And then we've also got, you know, email follow-ups to people who attend and don't buy. And so... And as I'm talking this out and maybe this goes to your point of stinginess, maybe the nicer way I would frame it in my mind is, yeah maybe it is stinginess, it could also be like him thinking, you know, I created the webinar, I'm selling them, and he's just running the promotion. So maybe like a not not valuing, not not seeing the value and the work and effort that gets gets people onto the webinar, I'm totally making this up, this is not anything you said. I'm just trying to like, I mean, some of it comes down, could come down to just like some laziness too, like not wanting to have to think about how much percentage does Chris get, which which I mean I guess to your point would tell would be an important data point for me as well and I mean basically if he may come back and say well there are some more deals I'd want to exclude from this and I'm open to that because I don't know everything about his business I know a good bit but I'm open to the idea that you know I've got a blind spot and I'm a reasonable guy but so we have a conversation if he thinks things other than the gross summit should be excluded and at that point like if we can do a deal then I know I've got a ceiling here with him a 3k a month and and that's sort of like the clock ticking on you know But with me to get me where I want to be. But yeah, I think it's a no-brainer for him.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, so right there, highlight it. 24,000 is what you get if you generate 480,000. Yeah, he did all the work or whatever. That's Trump change really for what it is. And like I said, if you want two things or both, stingy or doesn't see how you're that valuable. But getting butts in seat and qualified butts in seats is a real value proposition. You could have the greatest product in the world. You could have the greatest pitch in the world. If there's nobody there to see it, doesn't do any good. If the right people aren't there to see it, doesn't do any good. So that's what you're doing. Yeah. know, it's it's it's brick and mortar business.
00:11:57 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's location, location, location, right?
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Offer in the world greatest pet you greatest from mama pro promotion and you're out in the boonies Nobody's ever gonna see it. Nobody's ever gonna buy it. Okay, so that's what a digital offer is until You have somebody writing the copy and doing the ads you're doing both Two things copy on its own no good without ads and people seeing it Add on its own. Oh good. It's not good copy good offer. So You know, yeah, that is all that is a it's two major services you're offering That in and of themselves That that fee Yeah, anyway, yeah, it is great So yeah, I'll just reply to this email and The just do one more thing in the example so that there's no like sticker shock So when you go 5% of 27,000 he's not doing that much like $1,300 or something like that.
00:13:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's like almost all right.
00:13:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we if you look at that and be like, okay, I'm still not even paying you $5,000 if I make $30,000.
00:13:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would put that number there because you look at it and goes, Oh, you generated $30,000 and I'm still not even paying you that $5,000.
00:13:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
was paying you before.
00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, yeah, that's a good way to put in parentheses.
00:13:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
$1,300.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would put which brings my total to $4,300. And I think it's like, it's probably probably $13.50. Let me go do this. So what the heck? $27,000 times 0.05, $13.50. So that would be $43.50. And I would put that total there in the example and go, which is still less than the five.
00:14:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
a thousand you were originally paying me monthly. Yeah.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's the framing of that. That makes it go. Okay. Like honestly, he should feel crappy because you got downgraded, but you are upgrading everything that you're giving to him.
00:14:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, he's and he's tossing like more, more, more my way.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you doing your effective hourly rate calculations when you're doing this work with him?
00:14:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I know that I want to keep it to five to six hours a week. And like today, I worked, I did two hours working on this infusion self automation and so I knew that tomorrow I won't spend as much time on his stuff. So I calculate your real time. No, I don't have a time chakra, I know, because my morning is my time that I do this kind of work. It's like, I've got my Tim and my Titans buckets. And I usually just write for an hour for Tim. But today, I don't know, because I need to actually build this automation, which I'm, and I documented it for him on a one-pager so that he could just see, because there's a lot of stuff in this automation. And he should see that and recognize what else I can do. What else I can do? Like it's a beast. Yeah, that's also an asset that he owned forever more and also that he could replicate and sell like Yeah Yeah, like this so they had done They had the bones of this built because they've got a they got a quiz they built this quiz Which which like so they they had like this This This built what I went in and did is I created a Nurture sequence to bring people into the quiz And then I'm pulling them out if they've already gone through the nurture sequence and then the big thing they want to sell is called business accelerator and Yeah, and accelerator I know I know and I'm saying be a and I'm in my character advertising, so it's like But Then these people here, if you score in one of these tags in the quiz, then they were putting them into a business accelerator. These were the emails that they had up there and they weren't really ready. I created this sequence here from the promotion that I wrote for them in June or May or June and it's pretty nice. set it up so it runs on specific days so that this promotion is always ending on Monday when people go in and then when they finish it, there is a tag that completed and then I'm giving them a soft docked out here so like not interested in getting my help to hit 30k. a click here or move from this promotion. So they can click that instead of unsubscribing. Right. Takes them to this page. And I even link to the promotion so they can look at it. And when that happens, they get tagged here, soft opt out. And then I'm looping them back into this hold. And inside of this hold, it just holds them for five months. And then kicks them out and then checks to see are they a business accelerator customer. So they go here, if they're not, then I'm going to put them back into the nurture sequence. And then anybody on the list that is not, so I created this check to see if they've been through the nurture sequence. So you can. Not anybody into that and then it'll go and see arcade have they been through the sequence before If they haven't then they're going to go straight into it if they have They're going back into this holding bin For the five months and Yeah, so though like those things are the things that i've built and And Added for him so i don't know that he's looked at the shot but Uh, his partner randy has and and really likes it And so i just put together this Wrote this up this morning so he could read it just to see the flow Like if this wasn't high level that kind of snapshot could be sold for a thousand dollars like that automation in and of itself could be thousands of dollars I get annoyed when people don't value you properly
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You already made that money drives me nuts.
00:20:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. mean, I think Tim's got a lot of money flowing out.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. But here's the thing. If you want more to come in, then you pay it to the people who bring it in. Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying and the people that help you keep it or and the people that help you keep getting more out of your existing assets. Like, that's the thing. It's there's a lot, you know, so many majority people are spinning their reel and it's feast or famine and it's their fault because it's the way they operate. It's the way they manage their business and you come in and you bring structure and leverage and consistency, which reduces stress. That stress relief is a real world value. That's a real life quality, real currency, real value, especially because reducing that allows him to operate at his higher level, which is where he is able to make the most money and not go crazy. Like, you want to get in the habit of learning how to express that that's what you bring into the table. And then one of the ways you can do is say, my goal is to block, right, to take off this load. And you can even insert things like, you know, I study psychology, I understand Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And I know that when we're stuck and we're in the vicious cycle, like, we just aren't operating at our highest level. And so when I'm coming to the table and I'm coming to the team, my job is to make sure that there is no, you know, pain and suffering. that we're all operating at the highest level that self-actualization, right? That's where we're delivering the most magic to our clients. That's where we're feeling the most magic ourselves and our teams. That's where the money flows, but not just for us, for our clients. And then they're able to deliver their best version of the product to their customers. And so I don't want you to think you're just getting a copywriter or a guy that does ads. Like, I'm, I bring all of this to the table, and hopefully you've already kind of felt some of that. Like, you want, so you might notice a little bit that it's not so dark anymore, right? But there's a whole level of degree of lightening that happens between coming over the mountain and high noon. It's so subtle that you really don't notice, but there is a distinctive difference in the level of light and warmth that happens in that process from like say 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
00:23:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At peak level. And it's so subtle, it's almost imperceptible unless somebody is really paying attention to, oh yeah, look at where the sun's at right now and think about the warmth that it's giving and think about the light it's giving. We don't, we take it for granted, but where would we be without the sun? Right. So it is human nature to just kind of be in the warmth, bask in that light and that glow that is just offered and not notice it. So you have to help people notice it.
00:23:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's a good point. I do remember when I first started, Tim was Vlad and surprise that I knew how to use a diffusion soft. Yeah. and that was just being able to send broadcast demons. Um, but he, uh, will be the first time he's seen me build something a little more advanced.
00:24:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'd be like, boy, I'm just getting started.
00:24:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
come on. Let's go. Tim is like an expert builder and infusion soft. So I know that he'll appreciate it.
00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but he didn't have to do this. Like you saved his brain power and like, like, I know you can do this, but I know you got higher level things to do and saving you super power. I like doing that for you, you know, like, maybe don't love doing it.
00:24:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it's, I do enjoy like thinking through, uh, I'm not like, a, uh, a bill. But I do, like, thinking through how to, like, how these automations flow, that is fun for me. But I don't think I'd want to be building these all the time, I'd get, my head would just be too full.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There are so many people that you can get now that are low-cost overseas that, like, like, five, ten years ago, there was hardly anybody that was good at it. They weren't great at it. They weren't engineers. There are engineer level type automation specialists for $15 an hour, you know, that you can get, who get most of this. And so if you have a few maps and say, okay, go replicate this, but insert this type of which is a lot less moving pieces. and waiting for the campaign to open and to load and to give the attributes and all of that so they can do the actual connections and logic which takes more time and you can just kind of brainstorm it and then you've got basically these different maps and templates but then you're also thinking about the nurturing sequence like it did now you're talking about the customer experience so you this is tip to tail entry to exit your this is not copy this is everything from the beginning to the end other than actually fulfilling or doing the live sales but everything else you are touching touching and nurturing and optimizing and leveraging and that is high high value you're like several people in one for $3,000 a month. Don't just, ugh, don't let me see this bull, okay? All right, all right, right, all right.
00:27:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So yeah, I got to follow up with him on this, on this email and and yeah, I feel like things were, things were going really well. With, with 10. Everyone seems to be, everyone seems to be happy.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something to be said for going through it with people though. If, if they will reward you, you know, I've done that a lot of times and you stay, it's just, it's just different. Like I do business different, like we get in and it's like we're putting an elbow grease here in the trenches with people. That is not the most. Leverage thing to do in terms of instant revenue and return, but it is extremely leveraged in loyalty and The the depth of those relationships and how long they last and how long they continue to bless you is Is is very different and for me. They're more fulfilling When you know you brought somebody through it and they know you brought somebody that you helped bring them through it it's it's a whole different kind of thing and You know, you don't you don't just get that in any type of Arrangement, so that's something to think about to you know There's there's always trade-offs in the types of deals in business that we do, but it would be really nice to see you connect with somebody who you know is doing eight figures and Okay, um would like somebody to spearhead marketing and important prove the offer creation and look at what money are they leaving on the table, you know, and just mastermind what's happening. You don't do the copy, you can approve it, right? You don't do the ads, you can approve it, you don't do the automations, but you approve it, like all the resources there, like that would be, that's ideal and you should be getting paid a good amount of money for that, $10,000 a month. They'll be happy to do it because they don't have to think about it, they don't, yes, they're paying for all the resources, but they don't have to manage it, you're managing it well, you're giving them a report of this is what it costs us, but this is what I've made us, know, all you're doing is just getting information from them and then reporting information back and they're getting paid because they built everything up to that point and now they need somebody trustworthy to manage it and that trustworthy is the operative award because there's not a lot of that.
00:30:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yep. Yeah, I point. It's interesting with Tim, know Brian too, it's so easy for me to, I know what the offer is, what they're doing, get a little bit of their personality and their voice and like, I don't run into the same kind of like mental roadblocks doing this for somebody else that I do, like if I was the face, you know, like if someone's coming from me. And I've thought about this quite a bit and there's a part of that whole world of like being, being the guy that. feels, prison is too strong of a word, but it feels to me like I would start to feel trapped of like having to the pressure of like having to be on all the being the face, but I like that because I've got these, these things that come up as like, oh, just doesn't feel fun to me, but at the same time, like when I was doing wookers. I didn't feel that because, you know, the different, a difference there was we were selling this tool and, and I had a customer support team and so if anybody had trouble using the tool, it was just like, send them off over there and I've got, I've got this idea for a software that I've been researching a little bit to see like what's out there, but I first wrote this down when I was getting started to learn a little more about email deliverability and, and I was working with Adrian Savage from email smart who I still work with him in his team was, was solution that would take leads that come in through your regular forms and automatically input them into an infusion soft form behind the scenes so that if somebody is opting in through for lead magnet or even a purchase on a non-infusion soft, and this applies to any ESP, or CRM, but that it would then take that information, put them into, you know, get the tags and everything from the Thrive themes form, put them into a infusion soft in the background as a solution to be able to mail the people who are opting back in on your third party form, and sell that as a
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a as a software solution yeah I mean I wonder I wonder what the demand is for that but I'd like you thinking about SaaS again something I've been thinking about too is is just really kind of different leverage offers so I'm the same way with you know wanting to be the face and always be on I hate it I did a video and I boosted it as an ad on YouTube and it was short and it wasn't even good it wasn't made to be an ad but I did it because I have to push myself out of my comfort zone to an extent I don't have to but there's a lot of leverage in showing up and I want to do that on TikTok but I don't like doing it myself so I found this lady she's been around like 20 years and really I Ideally, it would be somebody like me would be my ideal business partner, because personality, energy, values, language, all of these things are important to me. But being able to have somebody that's in integrity, she's like a female version of a lot of these male marketers that I'm just like, that language is not, but she's not. She was just a woman in man's world and so kind of adopted some of this stuff. But she has been making other people millions and millions she's made millions, but just and she's like mid 50s and she stays home and takes care of her mom and but so much time spending and taking care of other people. And she's but she's all over the board because she's got this hustle mentality. You know what? I can just create some structure for you so easily. And we barely talked and people are like giving her comments like, you're back. You're amazing. Your energy's amazing. You're this. You're that. And I'm like it doesn't take much. I love that. So what I get in return though is she's really great at marketing She's all over the board for herself, but for other people she's really focused Yeah, and she's able to get it done and she loves showing up on video and she has no problem with it And I'm like, you know what we could do to talk lives together And I only have to show up long enough to have a conversation with you You she loves talking about things every morning. She's writing an email every morning. She's doing a video And I'm like, that's amazing like so I'll just let you do most of it I'll do my part and I'll bring something to the table, but she's never been served the way she serves But I would do that you never been served the way you serve and I think Finding that person and they're going to be somebody like you that's just they don't act like a face. Really maybe they do sometimes But they are just consistent and the way they show up or or they're really inconsistent and they in the way that they show up as the face and then they disappear because they are all over the board and so they need a rock like you right they like you know being on video and they like talking and they like promoting but they don't know how to run things smoothly so they're always working they have made lots of money for other people right but not as much for themselves so just starting to like kind of put out your feelers and your intentions to attract somebody like that that you can align with who knows they don't want to do it by themselves but they do want to do it and they want to show up every day just not by themselves because of the riffing because of the face because even if neither one of you really wants to be the face you can do it a little they can do it little you can do it together that energy feels very different it's not like being on it's just like talking to them and kind of taking that, capturing it sending it out. So like we were talking this morning about her and I just doing conversations on live on TikTok because the audience there is so, there's so much of the untapped, Facebook attracts the people that are in the old I am crowd, The hardcore marketers. So they bring in the people that have been brainwashed and you're competing with that. TikTok is all over the board. These are people like just hearing the ideas for the first time. And so they don't have these predisposed opinions about what things should be, whatever, and they're just easier to persuade. They're not jaded like people on Facebook. And so we can go over there, have some conversations, take the, so do TikTok, TikTok likes consistency. have to show up. Tube likes quality. YouTube does not care if you're consistent. YouTube just wants you to create something that people want to consume. Stay on their platform. They will send your one-year-old video over and over and over again, as long as people are still watching it and they don't care if you've never created another video. So we can take the best of the clips from TikTok and turn that into a quality YouTube video. Put that over there. The thing about YouTube is it gives amazingly targeted low-cost leads. So without it feeling like a drain, it will just feel like I'm showing up talking to Maria but we're doing it on TikTok live and it doesn't feel like pressure because I'm just having conversation with her and people are observing and I would do that anyway. I don't have an issue with it that I wouldn't think about it so much. Whereas if I'm talking to a camera, it's exhausting to my soul. I'm looking at myself going, this is
00:41:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So douchey, I hate it.
00:41:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's it's not it's necessary, but it is not organic and not natural. And I don't like it. And I don't want to do things that don't look so I don't. Yeah. Anyway, but I know because we're always in this evolutionary evolutionary conversation about what is your offer kind of what is your thing. And I think that for most people it should be a hybrid. So I'm not going to give up my high level clients, and especially like my doctors and my attorneys, I'm having the time of my life with them. Because these are people that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, in in going to school, they're gonna be a debt for a long time. They're just used to paying for knowledge. And they're not like, I gotta make $10 million by the end of the year. And I need to make $10 million for every $5,000 I spend with you. know what I mean, debt service, he's like Tina, finally, I've been trying to tell you that you needed to like experience this. I'm like, I know, I know. But, um, but he's like, last night, he's like, I'm so glad that you're finally out of the IM world. I'm like, babe, that's never gonna happen and I'll tell you why. First of all, I wouldn't be where I'm at without having taken this path. But second of all, when moms and dads are trying to figure out how they save their family and how they get this extra income and they have no other way and they go to the internet, the first people they're gonna run into is internet marketers because internet marketers are the ones spending all the money to advertise to them. So I need to be there to show them, look, yes, there are all these opportunities, but here's what you need to do to guard yourself. Here's how you run real business practices, but you don't have to have an MBA and you don't have to be, you know what I mean? Like, very few people can simplify it like I can and talk to the average person and watch out for them. And because I have. of my other clients and my other business. I don't I don't have to charge them an arm and a leg. I'm planning on giving some of my best stuff away for free on YouTube just to be like learn it. And here's what I know because I've seen it happen with people over and over again. You give away your best stuff. Really smart people with a lot of money didn't have to pay to learn it. So they're watching you they're going, you know what? I want to hire that person and they will send you an email be like, how do I give you some money?
00:43:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How do we work together? Yep.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ten to thousands of dollars and deals happen because somebody saw you thought you were smart but you have to show that instead of showing all your schmuckery and your like 10 million upsells and downsells.
00:43:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? I mean that's how Tim came to me.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm saying.
00:43:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I threw the bootcamp.
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Saw your smartness out there. Like I got to get that guy.
00:43:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah maybe.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So put more stuff out. but it doesn't have to be your face. That's the other thing and I got to remind myself of this because yes it's a popular thing but people don't care if you're screen sharing and they can hear you and there's and there's like cap cut and script make it so easy to caption what you're saying and if the captions are right and you know how to do this because this is marketing magic and we do this right the headline the hook they need to see the right things and hear the right things they don't have to see your face so much and it could be your picture which is not the same thing it's not the same burden it's not the same energy cap cut and a script and loom now has AI editing so it's crazy you're just like oh take out this line and it automatically does it you don't have to go through that how do I like zoom into the timeline and get right to that one second and clip these words oh my gosh it is crazy easy how fast the stuff could be done. So whatever you want to teach, whatever offer you want to do, if you want to do it yourself, do it the way that you want to do it and trust that it's it's going to work because you teach simple, clear, fundamentals, you teach fundamentals too, because you've been studying the fundamentals from gene.
00:45:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.
00:52:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
A lot of that is I go through the exercises that I created for BAM on Desire and Product Performance, the channel, like channeling desire and market sophistication. Yeah, mean that that could technically be a that's interesting. That could be a series with the goal. I'm not selling a core or some selling like working with me.
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it could just be a soft like at the end. like if you, if this is something you want in your business, and you don't have somebody driving this, let me know, like I'm, I'm not the cheapest guy. I'm not the, um, the laborer. I'm the profit partner. So if you're looking for the, the guy to hire that works for you, I'm not the one. But if you're looking for the guy to be, you know, a profit sharing partner in your business, let me know. And it used to be soft. The other thing is you would drop in there. This is the exercise that I use that I created for BAM.
00:53:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
BAM, by the way, is right through advertising mastery.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it is a companion guide to Gene Schwartz is this, because I am partners with Brian Kurtz.
00:53:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so now you've just given your pedigree.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's going to be powerful too. But it up there. Right now I'm douchey way, like just like FYI, this is where this came from.
00:54:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's not a bad idea actually. If I looked at it as I'm not trying to sell a course, I'm but selling my services. Yeah, I hadn't really thought about it that way. It's funny like Brian and I, Brian just got invited to speak to this virtual. But to this group of marketers in Japan about breakthrough advertising and he looped me in. He's like, I want Chris to be on this call with me. This guy, Hyro or however you say his name, H-I-R-O. he's got a little community there in Japan studying breakthrough advertising. And. So, Brian are going to be speaking to them in December, and I mean, who knows where we'll come out of that, but it was like, I wouldn't have gotten invited into that if I hadn't done all this stuff with Break to Arotize it, so that was just reminder. I, do you know Esther Kiss?
00:55:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? Yes! She's awesome.
00:55:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, I don't know if she, I got a, is an automated email, but she reached out, she got on my list, and one of my sequences in the profit sharing thing, she replied, and asked if I was interested in any kind of PR or media work for me, and I'm not, I'm not interested in that for me, but then I was like, huh, it across my arm before, was like, uh, thinking of Break through Arotizing, like, if there was a more of a PR strategy for that book in media strategy to talk about like isn't this a cool story that here's this book that's almost 60 years old and still you know changing lives and we could talk about you know run some media about it kind of even showcasing it as a collector's item and and and and just go go out to a little bit of a broader market non people who aren't copywriters but I think that there could be a cool story of the history of the book and the story and who gene was and and just kind of build the allure around around this text and so I'm gonna I'm gonna do a call with her and the and Brian
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to see what what she thinks about that As an approach Esther is so smart and she is so Real so humble like she's just she's she's one of those people, you know, just I don't know I think she's the same no matter what yeah, and I don't think she likes playing the game. I think she loves what she does and And loves when she comes across real genuine people and knows how rare they are. She's one of those really rare people Tell her I said hi we talked to her Yeah, she just we've never done any work together, but we You know when you you've got that just kind of vibe from somebody and you interact and you like for me I have these little love affairs with these ladies on Facebook and just like just adore you. I love you You're so smart whatever I gush they gush It's it's a mutual thing and then you don't talk to people for years and then it happens And again, and it's, it's just kind of amazing. I don't know if do that, but, but we women do that. Like you just really see each other and you're like, you're awesome. I think the men do too, because I have that similar interaction with men. a little bit different because you got to be, you know, respectful. it's very, because you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. like, wait a minute, he's married.
00:58:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're married. What is happening here? like, no, no, not like that. But anyway, yeah, right, right.
00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, she is, she is, that would be really interesting to see if there's any kind of synergy there. And I wonder with Jeremy also, just because she does PR, he does podcasting, very similar kind of. It's a different path to this, to the same type of thing, which is awareness, brand awareness. Yeah, really. That's what podcasting does, right?
00:58:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Brand awareness and education, right?
00:58:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just pure, like a direct. response to marketing, which is a different type of psychology. It's it's like surgical marketing to me is what direct response is. Podcasting is like explosive marketing is like here's all the stuff. And PR is also surgical but it's like it's just it's not I mean it's it's I don't know like it's like getting stitches versus getting heart surgery. You know what I mean? Yeah it's interesting. Really keep. I say keep but because we've talked about it but I don't know that it's a big thing but that is the thing that I've been thinking about you since like 2020 2020 started talking about networking community is the people like that that are just really family or truth oriented like Esther doesn't have kids but she is a she is a mama kind of heart you know what I mean like she she she mamas her people and is loving and nurturing like just like you can tell that she loves her people yeah and making money is it's not a make money at all costs and it's they very much care about their relationships and I feel like I don't know you you also have much different values than just making money yes finding those types of people and having exploratory conversations with like what can we do together how can I help you help me but what can we create together and especially in terms of like content that maybe you can put out out on YouTube knowing that if it's quality, it can last forever and just be a beacon to the person, God will send them to you because he's amazing with that. Yeah, yes. Anyway, I'm excited about everything. I feel like I shed the last bit of the snake skin of COVID. You know, like the whole holding back, like it was happening around the beginning of this year, which is wild because that was a long time. And now I'm like, it's not like it didn't happen and there's not real things because we feel the after effects, but it is that I'm not sitting down for the next 10 years. I'm not taking it easy for the next 10 years. I'm not to burn myself out, but dude, I'm going to school. I'm on a mission. I'm doing all these like partnerships, taking care of my kids too. And I'm exhausted and I'm the happiest I've been in.
01:02:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
in a long time. That's awesome.
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Being exhausted for having labored well is good. But also I nap like two or three times a day sometimes. Yeah.
01:02:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Naps are awesome.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. I love Naps. Yeah. Okay. So let me know how Tim replies to you.
01:02:23 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't go all month. I mean, I guess if you're feeling great about things, but I'm still here. I'm here to do feedback on anything. Oh, my stuff. I don't even know. Like you can tell I'm all over the board. I don't know if there's there's stuff for us to do or not to do, but I don't want to waste your time when I get to it. And maybe I just keep helping you with yourself or whatever. And we just maybe we share the back and forth of here's what I'm working on. Here's what you could add to it. Here's what you're going take from that kind of thing. but yeah you we we got to get you to what you really deserve you've been running fast.
01:03:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah it's yeah I mean no pressure you know how to reach me if you want to kick some ideas around. I do have I did get an introduction to this young financial advisor here in town because I found somebody in TXL that works in the financial space with advisors and I've been I've been really interested in wanting to explore marketing and selling these infinite banking concepts and so I did call with him yesterday and he's not really into infinite banking but he does know the financial advisor space and so he he said there's a guy in Nashville that he does about half million a year he's like mid to late 20s and he did this great True to this guy. He's super responsive. So he and I are going to meet on October 7th. And he's got a podcast that he does. I just want to learn like what he's doing and let him know what I'm looking to do, which is I want to create the marketing. Like I don't want to write the policies at all. Like I don't want to get into that, but I want to sell them to people. And if I do this, I can get my life insurance license over weekend and then earn the commissions of the policies that I help sell.
01:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I keep forgetting about that. And you know, Business 101 is diversify. That is the best moat against poor economic times. The money is not Ever going away like ever. It's always out there and and we have so much access to it, but the average person isn't thinking about it. They're not trying to. They're just worrying about it. You If you have different areas that you can get to, but they're not consuming and they're not taking all your time and they're not taking all your energy and you're just building a machine like an engine, right? We've talked about around each of these types of things in the beginning, they're way more work and investment, but then you get in and you figure out how they work and you figure out how to leverage it. But I love that. And I love it being in, you know, the financial space where you can get money working for you plus the helping other people do the same thing. Like that really feeds the mission that you've always had, which is give back help others. And in terms of like business, but I think it, I don't think it had to be business. think business was the vehicle that you had naturally, but I think. Think that like kids you you so the proper type of stuff like huge I think you just want to see everybody be free powerful and happy and it doesn't matter how it gets there As long as it's something you're interested in you want everybody else to have it which is also about you Free powerful and happy I'm gonna write that down And those I want for people All right, I gotta get my girl. Oh go get her. Yes. All right. have a great day It's great talking to you and don't be stranger
