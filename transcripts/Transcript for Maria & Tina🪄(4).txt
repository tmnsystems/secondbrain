00:01:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I'll stay here till this call ends, and then I'll head to pick them up, and then I'll work another hour or two from home.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How's the sound? It's probably pretty echo or hollow sounding, right?
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it's little echo, but it's not distracting.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so I can put my ear pause in.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It sounds like somebody's in the bathroom. Like, you know, you get that kind of like echo sound you can tell they're in a restroom.
00:01:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me put my ear pods in. you telling me if that's any better? Yeah, I have lots of my mom's paintings.
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can put up. Oh, yeah.
00:01:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. And then now I got to switch it. Oh, I got to turn my phone off. It's actually connected to my phone.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does that happen here? Yes. All the time. Yeah.
00:02:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We may not have to spend the whole hour on the call because I'm kind of in the groove of getting this done. don't know. Would you like, unless you want to do something else, but what would you like about the idea of the loom video instead of re-recording like a whole bunch of stuff? Did you see my thing in Trello yet?
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I see that. Also, I have a meeting with Dan at 12, so this call is only scheduled till 11.45.
00:02:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need you to talk a little more before I notice.
00:02:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. No problem. No problem.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it does. Okay. What's it called? What's it called, sir? I'm looking for your mention of Trello. or Zoom, Loom.
00:03:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sorry, I could share it with if you want to and just show you. It's under the YouTube list, and it's the last card. Our second last card, I tagged you in it.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
First 10-minute videos, find your golden video, that one?
00:03:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Let's see the part I'm able to go up the golden video for an example when I report that real quick. I don't see Loom mention at all, so I feel like I'm missing something.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, OK. me, I'm sharing screen here. So, let me go to here, OK, OK, so, actually, let me just view this and let me just get. Let just talk about this here. Fit. That still doesn't look right. Usually, it stretches, yeah, that's around percent. So, basically, this section here, the Quick Start Guide for 60 minutes, you know, if we want to change the 90, let me know, but I said 60. We're talking about the clock visual. I did at least change this to 60 minutes because it was bothering me. So, here's the first question. At the point when I did the math class that I had in the last 28 days, 17,000, views, I looked into Google Analytics this morning. This is so amazing. Three, 38,870 viewers in 90 days, 2,200 watch hours, but it's really only 60 days because I really only revved the channel 60 days ago, YouTube only had, yeah, YouTube only has a choice between 28 and 99. like a 60-day stat to take a screenshot like this. So what do you think sounds better 28 days or 38,090 days?
00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the 28-day view?
00:05:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
17,700 viewers. I don't know if I can actually get a screenshot to replicate that exact number anymore.
00:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'd go with the 90 days because it's a higher number. And interestingly, if you were double that, which would make it closer to the 60 days, the number would still be about the same. So I don't know. It's fine.
00:05:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll do it, and you know what? Maybe by the time this is going to be finally like, hey, we're going to actually launch today. Maybe when I say 90 days, it's going to say like 45,000 views. 2,000 subscribers plus.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so crazy how fast it's grown.
00:05:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's awesome. It is. is. through exactly what those instructions were.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that's what I would want if I was reading the book, right?
00:07:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Yeah, like I know screenshots can be good too, but I thought, well, let's just make them do the video.
00:07:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so to me, we're creating a PDF, but the PDF was basically a house for the course, because we were talking about putting it in school. And that was to be like in high level. So to me, the PDF was just, it wasn't about creating an ebook per se, although that's great. And it can also be turned into a print book with shortened URLs, so that people can access that. Maybe they are unlisted in YouTube because it's about YouTube, right? taking Bloom out of the mix because let's say Loom goes somewhere, YouTube for sure is not going anywhere. Loom may not, but if you, but also if you're using redirects and they're URL shorteners, you can change the backend anytime you want. you. So I like.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anyway, imagine. Yeah, go through the videos that can have companion videos for sure, because to me, I think we're actually building a course. This PDF is just, you know, ebook is just the the baseline start of it.
00:08:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, like normally, like, if this PDF hadn't existed, normally what I would have done is taken the, because what I usually do in the past, taken the three hour masterclass. And I structured the slides sequentially, I would have then cut it out into, okay, here's section one, you know, 30 minute, here's section two, 60 minutes, here's section, you know, three, you know, this part, you know, or we record it because I have the Google slides, here's a video, but I wouldn't have created PDF thing because we didn't have AI, you know, back then. so yeah, but I think this is good because it really is, the PDF is like a quick start guide, and a thing is called fast start, fast tracking.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I was. Love the slides though. I would love to put the slides in here and I would be happy to do that the slides that you used What are you used for your your video training?
00:09:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah? He created that as well Yeah, yeah It is created. don't know how you would marry it up, but I guess you could but I did sort of take Like at the very beginning, you know that because I this was on the slides, right?
00:09:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, so I did take some of the stuff that was in the slides, but it wasn't like slide per slide, you know And it might not be it might just be like I cut things out of the slide or something like that, but you already done it and Got everything that's yeah.
00:09:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. so Yeah, but at this for instance, I could easily take and the snacks snap shot off. I yeah, I think I think um Yeah, so that was the main Couple of questions for you. Yeah Yeah.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay. So I'm not working really until Tuesday.
00:10:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That give you like I'm available for checking on things and reviewing things just not really like sitting down and grinding anything out. But what could I do today? Or what should we plan on when we reconvene on having and going forward with?
00:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I think, I think the biggest thing is just, you know, getting the e-book done like I should be on this tonight because see all the stuff here. Some of this is to be deleted because repetitive, right? so it's actually really I'm I'm on like, yeah. So, I think the e-book and I'm would say for Tuesday, I think we just need to start like how we're going to launch it.
00:11:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So I think like we said just talking about putting it in school and starting the simplest marketing campaign with the simplest housing, right? That's what school is. It's just simple. just put it in there. Where put it in school? I do think it should be a YouTube related one rather than so that it's searchable and we can tap into the school traffic. But that's what we were talking about in terms of like what can be a little bit And where the disconnect is so because to be clear sometimes we say, hey, I'm going to paint the wall blue.
00:11:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Royal blue or a light light yellow on the back behind me.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think? I think yellow because you wear a lot of blue and I think that will compliment it really well.
00:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, okay, cool done.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I used to have what I live in used to have one one room like it was a really nice yellow Okay, it was actually one of the things I thought about doing for Coloring cuz it pops out and not a lot of people use yellow as a background But it really makes the video stand out and catch eyes, but also yellow is calming and You use blue a lot with just trust so We're read a lot too. So read the yellow. Yeah, this is my favorite Yeah, but also I don't know if you know like yellow is the color of autism There's a lot of You know people slightly on the spectrum like me That that are entrepreneurial so That's interesting cuz yeah, like my favorite like one of my other houses I had the one room was my workroom video room and it was like I can't remember what Benjamin Moore color yellow was
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I'm not talking bright yellow, was sort of like, I don't know anyway, but actually, I might, I'll give you a screenshot of a video. I think I have a video with that yellow. It's on Facebook. I just want to be clear, multitasking. I just want to be clear on, when you say school, because there's a couple of versions of how to drive traffic to the school thing and house it in school. And that's, that's where I think my confusion is. So let me just, here we go. Here's the yellow. There.
00:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I love that.
00:13:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's the same color. You're such a cutie. It doesn't matter what your pictures are.
00:13:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're just so cute.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was like my platinum blonde and 50 pounds lighter.-COVID.
00:13:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Every version of you is so cute. So we go to school. Here's like show and tell. If we go that I remember that lady's site, we found digital growth community, so you can't buy it here, right? We've come here and then you go here. That's what I think we should do because we should have a sales page for this, right? Yeah. Okay, thank you because where I kept getting confused about was like, you mean like mine where you go about and they buy it for five bucks, right, five bucks a month and all that jazz. But the conversions will be lower doing that, you know, significantly. having an order bumpy can't have an upsell any of Right. Right. Okay. Good. Good. Now, I understand.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And because we can do anything, we could have a free YouTube group, whatever, I don't want to.
00:14:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just saying, oh, I don't want a free grow that group.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the course inside of the free group, where, but I like having the ability to sell the nurture the order bump to capture the truck. all those things too, so that works for me as well.
00:15:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool. right, so we'll do that, and then now the one thing we didn't talk about is mechanics-wise. When we take them to sales page and they buy, say the domain is what you were talking about, the YouTube fast track or YT fast track. When, when I had microfer magic, go to microfer magic, they buy stuff, but emails will come from re-ig it outs, right? So, that's why I was asking like what main domain are we going to use for email marketing, because we need to warm it up if it's going to be a new domain.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you have any thoughts on But I don't, that doesn't really portray, like, I usually have a domain based on the brand and really creating, which is the CMO, CMO thing, the accelerators. business growth, all that jazz.
00:16:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that that um I like that because then we can have a co-branded domain that we can have Tina at Accelerated Business Growth or something. I have some domains, let me go look and see if there's one that we like in nature real quick um but I do like that um and I like having a separate domain for email then from the landing page um per se just because the the you know the sender score they're both related actually so I guess it doesn't matter because sender score has evolved so much in the last few years compared to what it used to be. It used to be your sender score lasted for like a week or so. Now your sender score changes throughout the day and it's affected by who's sending to the domain not just which has always been the case so the domain the IP block, obviously, that we're on. So I think that we should have a dedicated IP block, sure, wherever we're sending from. And yeah, okay, so let me go log in and cheat.
00:17:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I have it. Every time I try to log in, I'm cheat.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, every time it tells me the password doesn't match. And I promise you, I did not forget my password and I updated LastPass and it is pretty fast. I'm gonna use my username. Guess what my username is? It is created by 18 or 19 year old Tina.
00:17:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I... rocks.
00:17:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tina took a lot of pride in being very nice and also a when needed to be.
00:17:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's nice building. Nice building.
00:17:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And somebody actually took that later because that was my show up everywhere.
00:17:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I finally, was like, that's not really how I want to be known. That's funny.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um yeah anyway account password reset let's go new password watch i'm going to copy it i'm going to paste it while you're doing that i'll take a look at what domains i own okay because one of my pastimes is like you know that looks like a cool domain on by that one how yeah i know i'm the same like i have your 2024 plan dot com of breakdowns coaching dot com you have made three consecutive failed attempts i just told you like i reset my password freaking name sheet is just me off every single time i log in i have this problem and you Change password, login, you try to tell me that's not the right password, all right. But now, last pass did not try to update it, so hold on edit item, update that, open my authenticator, all my allergies, I mean I got so much to do. Oh, right, let me show screen. I think she's kicked the last three days in a row and I am bloated in my face.
00:19:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I just got back from a new Vietnamese restaurant, had faux chicken faux fur fur. Faf, is that? It's fun. Yeah, it was so good. Because it's like the first day this year.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, this fall snow this morning. So, you had snow too, right? You're saying? Out of what?
00:20:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You have snow as well.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:20:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, like the type of day I wanted to scoop a hot soup. So, yeah, good.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Simple, savvy systems. That's long. We don't want a long one for sending the refined to CEO. don't know if we really have anything that's... So, this was my... You know how some people make up names? Yeah. I just don't know that I'd know those. One of the things I wanted to do.
00:20:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Energize profits.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my Sunday that I came from the profit energy taught whatever maximize or thing certified ops managers Focus leverage You huh? Yeah ops HQ expert ops HQ is what that is so expert operates headquarters Leveraged focus leverage systems max leverage maxed profits Yeah, don't know probably don't have anything so Some of them didn't sound bad, you know like but we could also let her our minds marinate on stuff Ha ha
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm five. I know. Make offer.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um. So many people forget to do this version.
00:22:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Come on name chief. You got one job. Registered 2015 interesting. what did you say business accelerator? moderator. And that's probably but.
00:22:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup. Um. I don't feel the rest use leandomainsearch.com, but we could give it two names, two words, and it can pump out a lot of available domains that are available. domain search. Why is it going to Shopify? think further down, there's a link.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there we go. So, you do business, systems, marketing, growth, accelerator, what words do you want to put in here?
00:23:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I know, yeah. That's going to be easy to say or read. So, marketing strategy? don't My CMO strangers, that's not bad.
00:24:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't really, I mean, name cheap and GoDaddy do the same thing, just pop on things on there.
00:24:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay.
00:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go down here, right? The pocket. Well, has, it's given on the right, right, right, right, right, right, right. Oh, generator. Enter keywords related to your start. So, I know business. Yes. right. See what we.
00:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the other alternative we could go after more like a fun brand name to say like, you know how like the product boss has the Product boss, you know, yeah, we could have something just funny like that funny, but you know what I mean like a Like you you had earlier the spicy CEO or something, you know, or spicy brain Yeah, there's something I like spicy CEO. Yeah Yeah, I have no idea what's happening I guess it looks like like logos.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Brand show results is logos.
00:25:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There we go.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why it was just because that was checked off. Oh, oh, oh And apparently now we're just not able to do anything Hand check dot P what's dot P?
00:25:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's amazing all the dot things available now a lot of people are using that AI, but it's like 80 bucks I have I used to have the business professor dot AI.
00:25:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I let it go I know I still have it.
00:26:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like business professor though. Yeah.
00:26:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if we did like business professors? I don't know because it will happen to like we've been around long time where women kind of mama bears like um but we do things differently. Business odd couple.
00:26:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's funny.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh and you know it would definitely attract it'd be interesting to see how we do attracting profits a particular aged crowd not but I wouldn't want to you know turn on the younger ones. I do think there is a lot to be said for really purposely um targeting you know the 50-60 year olds because um a lot of them are I had to learn tech now because they were employed and now they're trying to figure out how to retire differently because their retirement isn't working and so they're transferring their skills but you know there's such schmuckery out there and they might actually like people who have you know corporate backgrounds and sales backgrounds and marketing backgrounds in the real world you aren't teaching slimy doucheery stuff you know yeah yeah yeah yeah are we considering genexers so would it be like gen x marketing gen x yeah i'm gen x i'm the end of gen x i'm like the last cut off of gen x before millennials so so you're gen x two then right all right so 467 yeah yeah you should be yeah i think so yeah gen x gen x gen x marketers for gen x I like that, the Gen X CMO.
00:28:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is actually kind of cool.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Gen X CMO, aren't you? lot of people, I know this is weird, but maybe because of the people in my school community didn't know what CMO stood for.
00:28:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like it.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you know, you can educate people, and it really doesn't matter.
00:28:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The brand is what you teach people it is over time. I like how short it is.
00:28:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can't misspell the Gen X CMO or Gen X CMO, you can't misspell that, if you're on a podcast or YouTube channel. Hey, what's your YouTube channel, Gen X CMO, you know? I don't like it. You'll see if CEO's available.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy crap.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's available too.
00:29:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just thinking about small business of our business growth. I'm business experts. like GenX CEOs because it's very specific and ambiguous at the same time. We're definitely talking about meeting business, but what about it?
00:29:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
lot of Yeah, so we could do the GenX
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
X CEO, Gen X CEOs, the Gen X CEO and the Gen X, like I would get all of those at the ones. So they don't get snatched up and confused, anything. I wouldn't care about dot org or dot whatever dot name, those things. I do, go ahead.
00:30:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, sorry, interrupt you. I do getting the really close ones so that nobody else can very closely steal any traffic we might be having. I get it for less than the cost of a dot A. I don't don't mean we buy all the energy. That we could start warming it up. Yeah. And I also want to say like I like Gen X CEO or even we also buy Gen X CEO because I could see like if you're on a video, hey, just go to the Gen X CEO dot prompt.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's just so easy to say. It's too.
00:30:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I kind of like it.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I do. Any. It has X in it. It's probably hot.
00:31:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thanks to Elon. That's right. Oh god. That's right. Okay. Cool. Done. So are you gonna buy it?
00:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm gonna do this. Yeah. You do this. You can do this.
00:31:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hell yeah. Well, what do you mean? What do you do you mean? What do mean? Yeah, and you're not doing anything with it. Dumb. Dumb.
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
is this?
00:31:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When do they buy it? mean, you get in my blah, blah, blah, whatever. Okay. You're not doing anything with it. So I'll get this. And I'll get Gen X CEOs.
00:32:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's this on in case it's ever necessary check out good and won't be exciting is for the YouTube training. can show how to create a new YouTube channel gen x c o.
00:32:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes.
00:32:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so that was a good place where we can do some co branding like you're talking about how do we engage people.
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then we can just work on having a video together, talking about the stuff that we're doing, anything to get started to just go like who she would ever go references and but so after Thanksgiving week, next week, so after next week, the week after that, I would love to just so by then we should have the PDF, we should be have a a version to house everything, and then release it down and figure out, okay, what's the plan, what's the structure, and start working on branding to add to the marketing power, but I think branding comes after MVP, my own product, which you already had version one in your webinar, but what do you think about that? No, no, I like that, I like that, and then, like all that, and then, Oh, when you're done, go ahead.
00:33:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Email tech stack, there's go-high level, but I'm not crazy about go-high level email, but maybe we could pick it up, but then there's also active campaign and commercial.
00:33:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Either of those work for me, any help that we need, we could probably from Dan, if we want to. I also have very, very, very good people who are experts that go ahead level that are dear friends and past clients.
00:34:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you have access to smart brains who would sit there and walk us through stuff.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My level of deliverability is great. I think Dan like decided to go with them instead of active campaign but also I love it because it connects with the automation for texting which allows us to get I don't know just a little bit more some people respond better to emails, some people respond better to text and so wherever we can meet them where they're at.
00:34:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay so a little bit more money to do texting but yeah yeah yeah with Karina we had looked about eight hundred dollar bill two days of texting on a Black Friday but some sell I'm like oh my god that's what I wanted to talk about.
00:34:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you want since we've gotten this far and you know you have something to deliver even if it was just the replay. that could be sold for jump change, do you want to put together a small Black Friday Cyber Monday offer, knowing that at the very least you get access to the replay, but what we get is a list of buyers. So even if it's real low cost, we're building.
00:35:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So like sell what we have and kind of prototype a sales page of for the masterclass, sell that for instead of 97, sell it for like what do you mean like 27 or $19 that we're thinking or what we're thinking?
00:35:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it's only 27, I like that.
00:35:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So because you're $97 people, but you don't want to make them mad. Yeah, yeah.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But so maybe it's even 37, but here's what our people said. 47, you don't get to ask us any questions or anything. you want to, then you got to upgrade to this price and it has to be, you know, at least $10
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
working group sessions for your YouTube channel.
00:37:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, it's not scalable because it's like live with the people, but that could be an upsell or something or, or recordings of those things could be an upsell also. So let's say the first group, you don't get a, maybe a discount price, but you get this live and you get to answer the questions. And after that, it's only going to be able to be, or we do cohorts, maybe even once or twice a year or something like that, so that we keep our sauce sharp. But really what it could do is feed into upselling to pocket CMO COO group coaching or something like that. So it's just because people love things doesn't mean that we got to give it to them the way they want to. And here's the other thing is that's why to do it. Right. Sometimes people don't know how to make a simplified version of it. Right. just people ask for things that they won't show up for. You would be honest, you know, and then, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Sorry. No, I like, but I think that that should be a very high, like that's at least $1,000, if not $2,000. We'll do it. There has to be a minimum of 10 people. It's $2,000. This is the time frame. If you missed the call, you missed the call. You get the recording, but there's no make-ups or whatever. So, you know, if we're making $10,000 each to go through and sit down and we can support them together, answer the questions together, and then also capture all of that into training to improve this and make this like a super solid training that then becomes expanded that we sell for $4.97, or, you know, people were buying $14.97, for some of these courses. You already know that your three hours was better than that. So, that's something to think about. The thing I do like about the live interaction is because we don't know what we don't know. We don't know what some of the questions are. We can get better nuance to the training. But I also don't like making time commitments on the calendar that aren't in business.
00:39:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know.
00:39:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if we were going to do that, I'd probably rather do it with overall business growth and marketing, and we have like YouTube specific, you know, of housing underneath it. Because what we would tell them is, yeah, you might be focusing on building YouTube, but you also need to make sure that your whole business is leveraged, that your whole business is optimized.
00:39:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All of your marketing, you know what I mean? So like, yes, think about business or YouTube.
00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if that's all you're thinking about in a strategic way, first of all, you're definitely not capitalizing on what we have to offer you when you're already in our world. And second of all, you're probably going to build a new Surrounder Neck at some point, because most small businesses, that's why they fail. The statistics are that they fail so fast. the reason is, is because they're not taking a holistic approach to growing business. And they're not thinking about the consequences of where they're focusing, where they're not focusing.
00:40:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah, like, and having a business model at scale. So there's another like $1,000 or $500 service I thought about. But again, like, well, that's not scalable, but you probably could sell 10 of these like a quick 10k was I, if I didn't know anything about YouTube, and I really want to go to YouTube and I wasn't successful entrepreneur like this isn't for newbies, I would easily pay $1,000 for this, where you go and create a YouTube plan for the next 90 days as in like, okay, here's like, you know, how my strategies like just do a video a week. Here's the, you could just do it for one month.
00:41:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here's fourth day. AI to help us do that really well. it could be where you and I just have a day and we go through, okay, I take this group, you take that group, you run it through your AI, I'll run it through mine. Let's come back, review each other, and then it's worth it. Here's what I think that we should do. If the idea that we have can get us to $50,000 a month or more, total or each, however we want to look at it, I'm good with total. That's a good split for what we're doing depending on how we're doing. And also if the effective hourly rate is no less than $500, then we consider it. If it's not, we don't consider it. And if it is, but it gets in the way of something else that we're doing that is actually more profitable and effective hourly rate, higher average rate, then we don't do it. So that's two. with the filters that we can use to look at and go, yeah, that's a great idea, but until it can meet these criteria, we don't say yes. Now, if you keep thinking about it, then we know that we have to find a way to make it meet the criteria, that's all. So that means either changing the pricing, the offer structure, minimizing the scope of what we do, automation, AI, something like that, so that we have to say yes, because a lot of people feel like it's either a yes or no, when really, it's a yes, but, you know?
00:42:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, because I would love, like, if I were a potential client, like this business, I think it would be ideal. Yeah, I want to either revive my YouTube channel or start it. Okay, here's your first four videos need to do for this month, one a week. Here's the YouTube thumbnail you're going to use. Here's the YouTube description you're going to use. Here's the YouTube title. Here's your screen. direct or main content you're talk about because some people want to script, they can put into big view or some people actually are fine with just like, here's your title, here's the three things to talk about and then they can just riff, you know, and yeah, go ahead. So it's like a content plan done for you that's kind of almost guaranteed, but I don't like getting guarantees like that to go viral because we're using it based on the method all the As good as guaranteed but can't be guaranteed.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what we can say.
00:43:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a great politician. So think about and we can think about this and but if there's something that's like that if we're charging really good money, then what I would want to see is that we commit to doing that together, co-working, we just get our snacks and our whatever and sit down for a few hours, using your office, me here and let's just work it out together because I think that we will have the best results if we spend more time doing things together because then I'll learn your brain better you'll learn mine better I think it will I think it'll go faster I think the quality will be better and I think from there we will find our most optimized version of business much faster if we spend more time together the the downside that we don't have you know when we do remote work is that we are not spending enough time just going oh you know what because our brains do that all the time yeah we're not doing it together and then we're not having that thing that you get when you work in an office with somebody so having some more time and it's only if we're charging enough and people are aiming for it because you might think it's cool but if you don't think it's cool enough to spend your two thousand dollars I don't think it's cool enough to spend my two thousand dollar an hour brain yeah you know what I'm saying yep yeah and it's definitely worth that because like
00:45:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If you had someone do hire someone for a VSL script, like remember couple of months ago, was even charging $500 into the VSL script for a couple of people, that ends up taking a lot more longer than I thought. But at bench, so really you're getting like four scripts worth 500, right? So that's like two grand right there. Plus you're getting the thumbnail, plus you're getting the title.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just don't have to think you just hit record. Like that's pretty powerful. And that, you're getting all of the research, but you're getting decades worth of experience in the brain that filters that research, that processes and that has the historical data to go. I know this works and I know why it works. And you're paying for the distillation of all of that time and all of that experience, not just the thing that you're outputting, but the expertise behind it. And if you don't see the value in that, that's okay, but I'm not.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sell it to anybody that doesn't you know, yeah, yeah, I like that idea. Yeah, so many so I'm just thinking of that cuz Yeah, we'll follow the workflow expertise. You have to like who I'm sure we can create something pretty spicy with it And it comes out so fast like we don't have to spend a lot of time So if we find people who are like I really want this like okay I'm gonna put this offer together and you can put your money where your mouth is or yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly all right Okay, so Go hit the ground running on Tuesday We start a school group. Should we just have that as a poll start the school group on Tuesday? Well, not the school group as far as The course will be done, but how about Tuesday?
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

That's fine.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Save this event. That will probably give you an update. Why did you not save it correctly? Okay, cool. Yeah, so let's just plan on implementation and show whatever you have in the PDF. also, if you do get it finished, I would love to see it because sometimes we just get downtime. We're not doing anything or he's not like napping and so I want to get something done and might just stuff in Canva.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just repeating what I said at the beginning, but there's a lot of stuff here that was kind of repetitive, so a lot of it will be deleted.
00:50:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, I don't see why I can't. I'm going to shoot to try and get this done tonight. don't see why not. Because tomorrow afternoon I have to take my dog to the dog roomers, which is an hour away. I'm off for tomorrow afternoon.

It's annoying. I'm like.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I think that that's a good plan. so just being at our computers and ready to focus on Tuesday and looking at what we have and just dabbing it actively rather than talking. Doing it. It's the same makes it sound bad like we haven't been doing, but you know.
00:50:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, you need to go because you have a call. Right. Okay, shoot. All right. All right. Think of the girl you said that you wanted to have her do something. Maybe she's the one who would be trained on AI. So she gets the money too. So you know how I'm out in Sally, you have someone you want to help too.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yes, my brain can't even go there right now because I'm not thinking about the call. But, um, yeah, and Boxer, um, if you, if you want to elaborate on that, that would be, uh, because you said turn on AI. So that makes me have questions.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah. No, it's just the YouTube service of the titles and all that stuff.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
