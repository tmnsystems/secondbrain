00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you there? I don't know what you'll get. Can you hear me? You're muted right now.
00:00:24 - Michael
I can hear you. Hey, I am not doing video today. am jet lag.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So am I crazy?
00:00:32 - Michael
You'll feel accountable without the eyeballs staring at you. Totally fair.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing?
00:00:44 - Michael
I'm good.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. So how did you do on your homework?
00:00:50 - Michael
I didn't do any.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, sir. I sent it. So, it's number 23rd.
00:01:16 - Michael
Okay, report showing clashing patients count. Craping Craping out for expansion. Pustition recruitment streams. Put a comment after noon. Oh, we didn't talk about that. I did not do my homework.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything okay?
00:01:59 - Michael
Any good reason why I don't? I ended up I went to a 40th birthday and no good reason but now I went to a 40th birthday party from Friday to just got off the plane actually about an hour ago.
00:02:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh was that the one that marks did the chat GPT exercise with for ideas?
00:02:22 - Michael
Oh I didn't go on that one now but this is just it this is a different friends birthday I don't I don't have crazy rich friends like Mark. Okay well this is where we're at this is what we need to be working on so we can just do it on the call. Okay Okay you be invoices to my accountant.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll do that first.
00:03:05 - Michael
What is it called, itemized invoices. Should I show them an example or do they know what that means?
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Show who an example.
00:04:20 - Michael
Oh, the accountants.
00:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see my, can you see my printer?
00:04:29 - Michael
Oh, yeah, okay.
00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see.
00:04:42 - Michael
Oh, yeah. On Thursday, before I went to Vegas, I left my computer in Modesto, which is two bars from the Bay Area. When I was working there on Wednesday. Oh, no, worked in a third section. And then I came home and I took out my computer, so now I'm using my backup computer. It's weird.
00:04:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Your audio is really rough. like very I don't know it's kind of scratchy.
00:05:05 - Michael
don't know if it's just me or you I didn't have any issues with the last call but any test test test is this better? Yeah, much better.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Thank you. Okay so for emotional taxes and the close can I see an itemization of how you arrived at the total charge. Oh okay now I remember what this was about. Sorry I had to yeah um so yes let's go back and take a look at that because it was a lot. You told me you pay X a month basically and then the bill was like astronomically higher.
00:05:53 - Michael
Yeah so like this is an example here's one of my corporations and this is the amount of you. So you were asking me like well how did they arrive at this?
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, I don't know for sure that just, no, you give them, don't give them an example. So, because then you kind of, yeah, they should be able to just tell you this is what we did, rather than maybe you ask for less and they just be like, okay, give it to you.
00:06:23 - Michael
So let's see what they come up with.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's very specific language. It should be very clear, itemize me, each item is listed and quantified.
00:06:35 - Michael
Okay. Should I list that the corpse?
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
00:06:58 - Michael
I hate my lawyer for me. And he named that so stupid. OK, I think that's it.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did he do that?
00:07:14 - Michael
Because it was a new lawyer. And they read, I guess, the code, and they're like, oh, it's a good idea to name the medical corporations and the name of the doctor. So there's no confusion if another doctor has the same name. So that's what they called it. And they said, oh, it's a good thing on professional corporations to add a medical corporation to the end of the doctor's name. So that's how they arrived at this monstrosity.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can change that. I know. It's a little piece, not that big of a deal.
00:07:44 - Michael
I mean, if you really hate it. I do really hate it. Actually, I was just thinking I should change that name. OK.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I think that's Every time you see it, it causes negative energy, then you should change it.
00:07:54 - Michael
OK, going to change it. Oh, that's a good point.
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, see. So we manage energy, we manage energy big time around here.
00:08:04 - Michael
I think they did show up. did. Yep, that should be it.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, send it off. Yep. And I would personally change the language. I would not ask, can I? I would simply tell them, I would like to see it. I'm not asking permission. I pay you.
00:08:37 - Michael
have permission.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like that's their job. So I don't, I don't mean it in a disrespectful. own you. I pay you blah, blah, You know what I mean? Like, it's literally the job, though. Okay, we'll see what we get back. And that will be revealing one way or another.
00:09:33 - Michael
Oh, and then I am going to be interviewing another accountant on Wednesday here.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:42 - Michael
Just. It's been, I've been with this same accountant two years. So. We feel pretty good with them, but I always just want to make sure we. doing all we can.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it's, yeah, for sure. It's. You don't want to be complacent when it comes to financial management at all.
00:10:05 - Michael
Or I've got another one of my friend likes to say you can make a lot of money, but it doesn't matter. It's about how much you keep it.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes sense. Yep, 100%. Okay, so next task item, go into my email.
00:10:27 - Michael
Okay, let's see.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was not it. I didn't say fun.
00:10:41 - Michael
Okay.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That mean you probably didn't send it. I just laughed at it. was just thinking about Esther like moving the baby to get sleep. It's just as a mom sometimes you just like, I need to do something. I'm done. That was hilarious. It's to me of like a cat.
00:11:01 - Michael
Anyway, let me see.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I said you have to send this to you.
00:11:05 - Michael
Can you kind of look at Tina us a meme or you a meme here. I just thought I watched it and I Oh. Yes.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why I'm done. Beat yourself.
00:11:52 - Michael
Yes. Here's the cat food.
00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what you're going to be eating from the rest of life. My body is mine now.
00:11:59 - Michael
You're done. Oh my God. It's not just you Esther.
00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We all are there at one point or another.
00:12:07 - Michael
I agree. Yeah.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I saw that and I had to send it.
00:12:11 - Michael
love it. Oh, that's cat food.
00:12:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, guys. They can't run to the owner. Can you please give this to them? Because I don't want the mommy anymore. Anyway, I wanted to share.
00:12:29 - Michael
Yes, it's totally true.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is our next? Let's see. Let's see. Homework recap. Oh, I'm including one of the how many are in potential growth areas. Want to work on that? Let's see.
00:12:47 - Michael
just did.
00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, we can go through this. What? Where would you like to start? Wherever you have the most energy towards. because this is a long list, this is a lot of stuff to do.
00:13:03 - Michael
If you could Joel me to do it, I will do it but I have zero energy today from Vegas, I am working off of a team of words.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what I should do. I just do the next one, report. Yes. Hold on a second because the one thing, the high-level one, compile financial data for all the businesses. That's a big task. We're not going to do that today. That's something that I don't want to do it when you're low-energy because I need you to be focused in paying attention, but it's the one document to rule them all.
00:13:38 - Michael
That really needs to get done.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is because that's the leverage. That's where we make your 2X plan without working more. That's the thing. That's where you start getting into a whole new level of operating in business and what's going to make you feel even more successful. more confident and once you start to get that traction, but when you got that traction intentionally and without that terminal cost and extra stress and bloat and all of these things, what you believe is possible as well as your discipline. The discipline becomes easier because you're like if I just put a little effort into the right things, I get bigger terms. So that document is how we plot the path to that particular type of life. So work on that this week. Let's go ahead and get to the next thing. don't have an assignment due date for HSA payments, but any type of payment plan that you can set up for Delta, I think it increases your ability to convert, you know, patients to... Someone to buy that. So I think that that's something that you should consider and work on the initial. Okay, so this was a chat GPT note. This wasn't Tina saying, I agree with your 10k budget. Do not think you need to spend 10k at all. So I need to rework that for you. I wouldn't spend more than $5 a day. It's not about waste. It's actually that if you spend bigger budgets almost always, Google just you on purpose and they're okay with it. They don't even care. I normally would not ever use that language, but it's really like I'm trying to be graphic on purpose. The abuse in ads, if they know you don't know what you're doing, they will take a balance of you. So you need to be conservative and stay conservative. And a lot of times scaling big does not work well. you have to really know what you're doing before you start putting in money and you really have to know how to prevent Google abuse putting in big money. And that's a whole big long topic. It's not your job. It's not I'm not the expert. I work with them. I can tell you who to talk to, but the whole point of this exercise is you just being familiar with what it looks like to some extent so that when you hire somebody, you know what you're talking about and you can, you know, your BS radar will be nice and fine tuned.
00:16:33 - Michael
Okay.
00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, those two things we can set a due dates for them that you think is appropriate. They should have due dates, but I don't think that they're as urgent as other things. The one document to rule them all next Monday at cost of penalty. Okay. I agree. Okay.
00:16:57 - Michael
You're just like, I'm tired. Okay.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. All right, we'll figure out a due date for the other two next week. That will be part of our conversation so that you don't have to think about it right now.
00:17:14 - Michael
Create report showing. I'm doing the, I'm doing the HSA thing. Oh, do you see my screen?
00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, I was looking at my notes.
00:17:24 - Michael
Okay. Got you.
00:17:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, catch EBT entirely too much. I'm like, where have you my whole life?
00:18:22 - Michael
Thank you, okay, good.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:18:28 - Michael
Nice. Thank you. that's pretty detailed can you see my desktop right now or are you looking at just the window now and I can see your desktop so if you only want to share the window you have changed your sharing and go select just the window oh I should show you my website that's great I did it oh wait what is this it's actually delto not delta oh I do I thought I said delta or something I've seen that oh but I think the note taker got it wrong oh yeah this is the website yes also done with chat GPT that's it
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's that's the entire website yeah they're pre-sold somewhere else though right what do you mean oh you mean yeah well right now um the person that makes or the company that makes the AI software is like getting inbound people that want to do this and they just right now they've sent two to me um but they have I reached out to them say hey I heard you wanted a braidskin ready to go they haven't responded yeah um can you scroll the way up so that um is difficult to read there's maybe a drop shadow behind it but I doubt it but if you have texts like that you're gonna want to have some kind of like a stroke a drop shadow or a bar behind it oh okay also um if that's a brain scan image like if that's what it looks like it just does not seem that obvious in the beginning because you can barely see the outline of the brain.
00:21:04 - Michael
Oh, it's a good point.
00:21:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But what I think would be really useful what what people want to see is either some screenshots of what the scan looks like and they're clearly labeled or almost like a it's like if there's a video or kind of like a slideshow type video of different pictures of like this is what you see, this is what you learn. You can show people it's show me don't tell me kind of thing. So you want to tell them also, but people are very visual and the sooner they can wrap their head around what's happening as well as stories of what it like because it's preventative medicine, right? Sure. It's about finding something out of time. So are there any stories about what has been prevented? What was diagnosed and found in advance? like no one can know exactly. what time was saved but we can estimate you know if something has been found at this particular stage the prognosis is generally this but because we found it here it's going to be this that type of thing.
00:22:16 - Michael
Yeah I went through it and the kind of the what you were saying is I think one subset of people they're kind of worried about like what's inside and then another whole class to people seem to be people that yeah I mean obviously they want to make sure nothing's wrong but they also want to optimize their health and so that messaging was a little bit like there's two distinct subsets like the kind of overlap but so then you want to have different landing pages for different audiences yes and you there's there's two specific ways to go about it so first of all your stuff your your keyword campaigns and your marketing campaigns like
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and on specific landing pages, but let's say that they come in and they just typed in your website. so you don't know because it's a direct visit, there's no trackable source. Then you can ask them, what is your main purpose for being here? Is it preventative healthcare or health optimization, physical life optimization, and so then you can direct them to the proper, the best landing page based off of their answer.
00:23:40 - Michael
That's interesting, like even before they get into the site, just have a simple like two buttons and just be like, are you here for optimization?
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. right, and it just, are you more interested in preventative medicine and you could put in parentheses, aka a avoid diseases that you're afraid of, whatever, you want, the copywriting matters. It needs to be better than that. Or are you just interesting and optimizing your body and maximizing longevity and quality of life?
00:24:15 - Michael
No.
00:24:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I love these ideas.
00:24:22 - Michael
just don't know how to like how to get it done because you saw the website I made and it's obvious to you that the wording wasn't very clear, but it's just not obvious to me because I'm just not how I am.
00:24:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, this is why, first of all, we're doing the one document to world them all because rather than just picking something to talk about and spending five minutes on it and then going to the next thing and unstrategically spending another five minutes on it and just never getting into flow and purpose with anything, we're going to look at your numbers and figure out where. you should go through them strategically, right, in order of leverage ability in terms of meeting our goals of making more money with the least amount of investment of time, specifically, and the least amount of risk. So I don't know where Delto falls in that right now, but it's definitely not at the top of the list. When we get there, it's as simple as potentially consulting with or hiring a copywriter and then a development person who can very simply create separate landing pages. Even if you do hire somebody for SEO or keyword research, rather than a marketing campaign, which has to hire somebody to do some low-level SEO, there's iterations and there's levels of where you want to start with it. And you could go drop big dollars on a marketing agency, but you definitely don't need to and I would not recommend it. amended because, well, you've already hired me and I'm pretty good at marketing and I could beat most people in the split test. For one, do you know what split test is?
00:26:11 - Michael
A-B testing.
00:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so headlines, calls to actions, images, those are the primary things that you want to test. And then pricing and offer structure, so not necessarily the price but how you present the price. Like, have you ever been on a page where you're like, they've got three different options and there's one on the left, one on the right, and one in the middle, it almost kind of pops out. Okay, well, the left and the right are throwaway options. You don't even, the left makes no sense because the middle is obviously a better deal. That's on purpose because they don't want you to take the lower price deal anyway. The one that the tire is, well, we'll be happy if they take it, but we don't expect them to. have done our numbers and we know that this middle one is right, so it's visually created. in order to get the most people. And it's also strategically presented to get the most people. So let's say the price is, what is it, was $24.99?
00:27:12 - Michael
Yeah.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's say that's the price that you want it to be and need it to be. So you explain what they get for that price. And then you make this throwaway offer of, well, here's what you could get for this lower price. Here's what you could get for this higher price. Nobody's gonna really want that. So they're like, oh yeah, this one's perfect. Anyway, there's all kinds of psychology. There's also psychology that says the more options you give them, the less likely you will already get a conversion because you created friction in the mental process. You, by, you created a pause, because now they have to think about something other than just one thought and they have to measure this or that. So anyway, there's a lot. There's a lot. It's not just about putting up a website. and orders coming or whether it's pretty or all these different things, all of it has to be engineered psychologically for optimal effect and according to the avatars, like you said, there's two different purposes. So you need to make sure you've got a landing page for each purpose in each avatar.
00:28:20 - Michael
Got it. Yeah. All things that I know and just things I haven't executed on.
00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And that's the case with almost all of us. But most of us don't need to go study anything else or learn anything else. We just need to actually employ what we know.
00:28:36 - Michael
So one of the maybe one of the things that I could do is find it. Yeah. At first, I thought I needed a Shopify. That's why I built this site on Shopify. Yeah. I because I thought I had to have a robust payment structure, but really I'm just accepting 242999. And that's it. It's not
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I cost you.
00:29:01 - Michael
Oh, no, it's not the cost. It's like, you know, $29 a month.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's here's why it's really good, though, is because it's a well-known platform and it creates trust. And that is very important.
00:29:13 - Michael
I wasn't going to use like, I'm saying like, I could use a platform that's more known for their websites, whereas Shopify was more well-known for their ability to like, like handle, you know, all these complicated storefronts and have multiple products. Right. I don't really need that. I just need one beautiful page, or like you said, AB testing, separate pages and the ability to accept, you know, PayPal and a credit card, which everyone can do. So I'm actually thinking maybe I should just, you know, use, like Esther keeps saying, just use Squarespace, just make a beautiful website, add, and then add a payment system instead of like using a shopping-based thing to try to make a website, which isn't really their forte.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the other thing you have to think about is page speed and load time, because every millisecond it takes longer to load is the more likelihood that you're going to lose the person. People, if it doesn't load in two seconds, it's like 1.5 seconds out, used to be 20 seconds like it just gets smaller and smaller, then the bounce rate increases exponentially. So, Squarespace, generally speaking, is bloated and slow, so that's something that you need to be aware of and you need to compare and ask those questions before hiring anybody. But also know that, no matter how aesthetically pleasing it is, it doesn't have the content that the person needs to have, and Squarespace is not going to do that for As well as getting the videos and the presentations that you're probably going to get more from the creators of the product. So, going to Squarespace wouldn't solve that issue for you, and could actually create kind of like with a magic bullet to make a beautiful website, but I've asked the founders and this is like, this is their like, oh, this is our, you know, this is our backdrop that we can provide you with. So, a couple of things, the beauty is overrated, ugly often converts better than pretty, also just because they made an awesome product doesn't mean they're great at marketing, and just because they.
00:31:31 - Michael
Yes, and that's why I'm here, that's right, that's right, yes, okay, that makes sense. Alright, how do I tackle this? Because I guess I'm overwhelmed, obviously like, I wanted, I want this done, this should have been done three months ago when I was in the incubator, and I want, I want this done, but I also don't want this to take over July. I don't want this to take over my CUMI work, but I do want to get something up, because The company, the AI thing, are actually sending me hot leads.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I convert just one a month, , that's like, you know, it's a couple thousand dollars I make. OK, so do you understand the technology well enough that you could shoot a video talking about it and really inform people and put it on the website?
00:32:21 - Michael
I do. I don't I don't want to be in the video, though.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You your face doesn't have to be. It could be a voice you can even use AI to do it. But the AI voices are just a little laggy and their their animations aren't really they're not identical to what you do. But they don't have to be. They have some pretty good ones. If you go to Hey, Jen or Cynthia, I think I could do in lieu of making a video.
00:32:50 - Michael
Like I think down the road, I would absolutely do that. sounds I mean, I could use my voice video, but is anything maybe just getting your making me busy going back and forth back. That's not like you at the screen. I'm sorry.
00:33:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just gonna hide it. Um, I can't it. Okay, I'm gonna put something else in front of it. Um, yes. So first of all, better, better pictures essentially.
00:33:14 - Michael
Okay, well, purposeful pictures.
00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not about pretty.
00:33:19 - Michael
It's about function. Can I just show you what they've given me?
00:33:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Totally.
00:33:25 - Michael
Oh, God, I don't know how to use this computer. I don't have any of my stuff on this one. Uh, did I lose my mouth on the computer?
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything's okay. breath.
00:33:50 - Michael
I just like convenience and this is not convenient.
00:33:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm with you. I like it because it creates speed and I like speed a lot. I talk through things. Is it a new computer or borrowing or?
00:34:50 - Michael
This is my old computer, long ago. Well, not long ago. I was using it up to like six months ago. Let's see. I need caffeine. No, not here, okay, I can't, I don't know where it is, yeah, there it is.
00:36:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to show me their website?
00:36:28 - Michael
Yeah, that's a good place to start.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You might even be able to just search it and see what Google images is available.
00:36:43 - Michael
So this is theirs, brainkey.ai. This is outdated, they don't do this anymore.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at this. They don't do what anymore.
00:37:03 - Michael
They don't really do this genetic one.

They do just analyze your MRI scans to learn about your brain health and longevity. Okay. Thank you. Good. Yeah. This is what you should have. This is the type of stuff you should have. They're they're not using color psychology very well. But keep going. Keep going. going. I'm just going to scroll and I get actionable recommendations and then sides. Okay. That should be higher on the page. then so basically the way you do is you create an open loop. Basically, like something to the fact that we have this brain scan technology that will give you actionable items to whatever, improve your longevity, something like this, calculate your brain age. Okay. And now let us show you how you do it. You get this view, this view, this view, this view, this view, and then you bring it back to what you first told them about longevity and the score and actionable items. And then you want to learn more, here's the next step. And then it should be book a call to a sales person who gets you on there. Like if you wanted maximum conversions, this should be a sales call.
00:38:42 - Michael
That's me. absolutely want to do it. mean, yeah, I can convert one people, one person, that's more than a thousand dollars. So absolutely. Okay. That's a really good point. How do I get started to do what you just said?
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically, we just want to. a reverse engineer, and you need to ask and find out what you have permission to use.
00:39:05 - Michael
Everything. They said I could use anything I want.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we could hire somebody to basically replicate this website, but then, huh?
00:39:19 - Michael
On mine.
00:39:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and as its own landing page and landing page, so that we have it done. Oh my God.
00:39:28 - Michael
What? Mine. Mine looks so bad. Okay.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yes, let's go. Well, so what you need to understand is all about psychology, you know, and what they're doing is people, like if they're going to spend money on this, why? It's because they know something. They know that their brain health is important to quality of life and longevity. They care about it. Now, what do you automatically know about the person who's interested in this? They're not the average normal person. They're not looking for entertainment. They're not randomly scrolling the web. They need specific amount of information. It needs to be high level information because this is a high level function. It's a high level offer. And so you need to give them what they want to know. So visually, and you want to be very clear, very succinct about what is available, how it works, why it works, the fact that they can have access to it, what it's going to cost to have access to it. so what I would test also is not knowing the price, like for less than whatever. So you kind of like leave it open-ended or you do put the price in either way. You have them book a call and see if it's a fit for them and let them know that financing is available. One of the things that I would... would add color wise in here would be either orange or yellow for so so blue is blue and yellow actually both are trust but yellow is calming orange is action it's take action and so I feel like with this market and you can split test on colors too and see but it psychologically people feel energized towards action they see orange and they take action green is travel um little bit of luxury black is luxury orange and it can be luxury there's there's this whole thing color will of psychology so you will look at that but there's not a lot of color on here and that the gray and the parallax that's pretty common but because there's a lack of color splash elsewhere the energy is kind of low so you don't want a ton of it you just want it strategically placed the right types of color. Let's see. And like right there where they have you can your computed brain ages lower than your chronological age. Like I would highlight with like you know the highlighter effects. Like it looks like you actually just highlighted it. And so where's the part I think is above this where it says get actionable steps. Yeah. Can you click on review insights?
00:42:36 - Michael
No, they don't have a link to it.
00:42:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay.
00:42:41 - Michael
It just goes to their form form collection. Yeah, I see that. Just to tell you the brain key report, they don't show that because it's really the same recommendations for everyone.
00:42:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The recommendations are literally exercise, sleep, and eat well. Because that's pretty much what it is for us. But they want to get into gut health and very specific to where they'd have to test actual stuff in your brain and in your body.
00:43:08 - Michael
Well, we talked about it last time, think, that yeah, I ultimately want to sell that stuff, but that's not the first thing. I want that to be in the report so that I could sell stuff to those things, right?
00:43:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, yeah, sorry. aids and gut aids, you know, it's you do some research, I'd be interested to see because potentially there's some affiliate partnerships that you might be interested in as well, but, and I don't know, but because we don't know what we don't know, I would just love for you to go explore it because this, I can't even tell you how many thousands of dollars, tens of thousands, I've spent as a result of the test that I got from a company called Vio, V-I-O-M-E, V-Like Victor. But also literally flips my health around. COVID completely destroyed me. lost so much hair. allergies, like I can't smell anything out. I mean, it couldn't, if there was any sense in the air, like my asthma would be so triggered. was on an oxygen machine for months, all these different things. And it actually was that it destroyed my gut health. And that's actually pretty common for COVID. I didn't know that slows everything down, created massive motility issue. So biome got me a start because it breaks down everything that's inside your body. And it gives you some recommendations. So from there, I went to another one called try health smart or something like that, which did a methylation test Oh, try small. So it had, you you take, you know, 75 grams, whatever I think of glucose. It's the same thing for pregnancy, basically. Chug that, and then you breathe into these mylar bags every 15 minutes, and it measures how much, well, how much your methylating, I can't think of the word, methyl something, whatever, is in there, is in your breath, and so, and of course it can do calculations of how your body is functioning with that and then makes some recommendations, so it did that, and from there, I found a company called Silverfern Brands, and they're laypeople, they are not doctors. They do have some, medical type people on staff, but they basically just did the science and research that I've spent a lot of time doing also, and figured out if you have more of this, you have less of that, and less of this, and more of that type of And then, specific types of herbs that really just I've of how digest everything and then also learning that most people solve acid reflux by trying to reduce acid when the actual issue is motility and the only reason that the acid is bugging them is not because they have too much of it but because it's just staying there and it's coming up through the throat because nothing is moving the way that it's supposed to out of the stomach so what call so barrier so that your you could maintain the acid in the barrier so that it could break food down without like killing your lining and anyway whole lot of things all of these things go together so for anybody invested in looking at longevity they're going to go down these paths especially one of the gut brain barrier and since you've got a brain scan that i've never heard of before right you you have an answer What you know is that if somebody makes it to you and is willing to pay that, they're for sure willing to pay for all these other things. So then you get down a path of you can start with an affiliate relationship where you send people to these other companies as a partnership and you can affiliate commission. But as you start to learn more about study it, how do I, what are my first step to get my website? one sec. And the more you get interested in it, then you could potentially create your own stuff because it's actually not that difficult to go to a lab and have somebody else's stuff broke down, make a few tweaks and come up with your unique formula. then you can go sell that on Amazon, which I've been a part of a multi-million dollar company that got sold for 10 million dollars two years after it was created. So anyway, there's a lot of money in this path is what I'm saying.
00:47:53 - Michael (3)
How should I, should I get my website, how should I, so how should I do my website? I'm just like overwhelmed. How do I make my website? site look like a simple version of 23andMe, or if you think Vioum's good, I don't know, I don't yeah, websites to me, I don't, okay, anyway, go ahead.
00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me let me look at Vioum, but actually the brain key is pretty good. Because it breaks things down, so it's at least a much better start than where you're at. So if you look at Vioum, yes, notice how graphic heavy it is.
00:48:31 - Michael (3)
Yeah, lots of graphics, yes.
00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's more color, yeah, and it's not a lot, but there's more, and it helps keeps the brain engaged, and their images of the food, it's a big image of the report. Big stats right there, a whole line that says 86% find that Vioum improves at least one area of health, 70%. communicate benefits to several areas of health and 74% on improvement in health issue that led them to bio. So, like Brinke has parallax, which is you dividing the content between a row of white and a row of gray and a row of gray, right? You saw that. So this is not using parallax, but it's effectively doing it in that there are blocks for each type of text, like the full body health solutions. And then there's a mouse over effect, which means if I put my cursor over it, it goes from black to this beige color and there's movement. So it moves from the picture of the box to a picture of the pill. That movement, again, helps people stay engaged. People get bored incredibly easy. So these little things of movement and these very big, simple pictures. that communicate a lot, pictures with a thousand arms, right? The next thing says gut health solutions, again, mouse over effect changes the color, changes the image, and you see the person with the biome packet pouring it into the water. looks really simple. It's a classy looking box. It's a very simple looking effective. Like I just put it in my cup. And then the next one is oral health solutions. And we have the same thing happening, but instead of pouring a packet into a cup, now I've got this handful of pills that I take, which are giant, but anyway.
00:50:40 - Michael (3)
So how do I make it mine to be like this?
00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that simple. First of all, I mean, this website is probably 10 to thousands of dollars.
00:50:50 - Michael (3)
Oh . Yes. How do I do like just one part of it? So you should not be doing it.
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is. if you're going to invest in it, invest in it. So this, this is where you come down to minimum viable product of Fuji.
00:51:07 - Michael (3)
The first, have you sold anybody into it at all? No.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So rather than worrying about a website, the first thing you should do is say, can I have a conversation with person, a person and convince them to buy it with what I know about it?
00:51:21 - Michael (3)
If you can't do that, you shouldn't be worrying about a website. That's right. Well, I have two people that I message, but they haven't messaged me back.
00:51:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, your website is only going to sell as well as you can sell. You or your team, if you don't have the content, if you can't convince somebody to buy it from your own words, your website is never going to be able to do it.
00:51:48 - Michael (3)
So, okay, I'll really try to get these two hot leads on a call. That's what I was trying to do is, and that's just suggest that too, is like, we have to get them on the call here with their here, why they're interested, and then try to close it. So yeah, okay. I'll really focus on that.
00:52:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so then the next thing that you do is whatever money you make from it, set aside for building a marketing engine and just reinvest it. But you first have to validate the concept before you spend a lot of money on it. Just because it sounds cool doesn't mean it's going to do well.
00:52:23 - Michael (3)
Well, I do know their sales data, but they're selling it from in-person clinics right now.
00:52:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, you know, there's a place which is my point like how you sell makes a huge difference. So now if that's effective, then you have to replicate something like that online, which is where videos come in. Because when you see a video, you feel people feel like they're talking to a person. If the video is done right and the conversation is right, you basically enter the conversation that's already in the rain and you talk to them about where they're at. Like, hey, I know you're you're interested in having the best life that you possibly can have, you know, just getting by isn't your style. If you want to have maximum energy, you want to have maximum quality of life, and you know that your brain is right in the middle of all of it. And so, you know, you're looking for how do you make it work the best that you can? we've got an answer for you. These are the scan.
00:53:24 - Michael (3)
This is the data we can get. Okay, so really try to get my initial customer. Well, any hot leads I get from the founders of this company really, yeah, okay, try to get them on a call.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you can't sell 10 that way, don't bother with the website. Once you sell 10, use that money to help you with the website. And I will help you to not go do something dumb and spend too much money for nothing and also not be you because that's not your skill set and there's nothing wrong with that. None of us get all the skills and it would be foolish to spend time doing that with and you're going to make most of your money doing all these other things. Use your money then to have other people's skills on it.
00:54:08 - Michael (3)
Okay, I think that's a good plan. So I will try to make well, so I just leave this website.
00:54:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I need to collect their money somehow. So should I just leave this for now?
00:54:17 - Michael (3)
Yeah, you can even just call on a website.
00:54:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The main purpose of it is to be able to allow you to make a payment online. If you have questions, here's how you contact me. Here's my phone number, my email, my blah, blah, and you can set aside a Google voice number just for that so that you know what that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:54:38 - Michael (3)
All right, I like that.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. But again, you really should be spending your time based off of priority, which should be informed off of numbers, which hasn't been collected and organized and structured yet. And we're like three weeks into four weeks into that conversation.
00:54:57 - Michael (3)
Okay, yeah, we're going to work in the one document.
00:54:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my homework. yes it is and yeah so create a report how about you give Esther the penalty money this and go get her a massage I'm gonna do not do your homework you got it you got to suffer somehow but we can give it to Esther I don't think we agreed that this is homework do we um yes sir we did I will go back and look at the father now I said this is on the fact I'm gonna go do that and I sent you the homework assignment you didn't even read it until today so how are you trying to use a lot of this I thought you didn't I thought you didn't send it okay yeah and if you thought I didn't send it you didn't say you know I didn't get it just in case there's an error or anything like that you're not wheezing out of this no sir that's not what you hired me for to let you weasel out of things right that's true Okay, hold on. Let me go to transcript. Search the word homework. We've got to break this down. I told you, you're going to feel the eyeballs. We see you're ready to work on this day, blah, What day was that? September 19th. When did we talk? That's not the right one.
00:56:35 - Michael (3)
I said we talked on Wednesday, remember? Like, I had to be switched it.
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we did. Oh, there it is. And then we talked and spoke on the 23rd.
00:56:46 - Michael (3)
So, transcript. That was the way to go.
00:56:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. Can you send me a reminder email? Oh, about my homework. Yes, I will do that.
00:57:09 - Michael (3)
That's fair. So, how are you? What's your accountability? Oh, it's a massage for you.
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not going to be for Esther. What? I'll take it, but come on now. All right. Well, deal to deal. You got to take care of that. Get your homework done. So, the homework, one thing, I will send it to you now. But regardless, I've said it. You hear it. You committed to it. Even if I don't send an email or you don't get it, you're still committed to it. And that is the one document to rule them all needs to be by our entire time, huh? Can we have a link to that?
00:57:56 - Michael (3)
Yes. Okay, well, are you going to send a different homework?
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
game alert is just use this one you just use that one actually it's already there can you reply to it with the link to the document to fill out yes hold on let me do this don't say okay and then let me make sure next monday's clear so i don't bail on you again yeah sorry about that that is really weird why does that happen if you don't say oh that was weird i didn't know you could do that okay i'm confirming with you that next monday i'm not doing anything and let's just go ahead and check um calendar so what day of the month is your is it the 16th like middle so let's see the 14th of october oh and we're moving into our new house no um that you work so that you can't meet on monday's
00:59:00 - Michael (3)
Next next month I can meet every day.
00:59:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. I think you should actually tell me that All right, so how are we looking just for like the next couple weeks out?
00:59:12 - Michael (3)
Yeah, seventh is the next one.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe I just got your knee ball.
00:59:16 - Michael (3)
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so the seventh looks good and you want it um is 130 better?
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay, you will get the best version of me later.
00:59:27 - Michael (3)
Oh, that's right. I'm already telling me this last week. Okay, it's good. It's 130 on Mondays.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It gives me plenty of time to catch up on your homework and to really be kind of sleep in too. Which is good because I need your brain to be at optimal level when we talk.
00:59:43 - Michael (3)
You know, that maximizes your investment. So, okay, that makes sense.
00:59:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, again, energy like we are always looking to maximize energy. Okay, so you have your homework. Yeah, no excuse. No excuse. No excuse. But at the end of the day, and here's the thing about the penalty, sometimes we can make a conscious choice to pay the penalty. Sometimes you're just like, you know what? I'm not going to do it. I'll pay the penalty because I'm sleeping in or going to a party or something else is more important. And we get to make that decision. We're all ask people. You know, sometimes you just want to shift your priorities. And as long as you're accountable for it, and you're willing to pay the price and not pretend that it's something else and not blame somebody else. you're just like, yep, I'm paying the price. Here it is. Don't want to hear anything about it. I just made a choice. Then respect it and be a piece with it. And that's really empowering. Don't feel guilty. Don't feel shame. Don't be like, I should have done better. I made a conscious choice of how to use my time and I'm okay with that. That's fair. Yeah. But because when your time involves somebody else, you know, the respect of it and like, okay, well, here's what I'm going to do for you because, you know, you don't get to, like for me, I don't get to go. It either results as fast. It kind of ties my hands.
01:01:02 - Michael (3)
Like I have performance expectations. Be like on that point that we split our meetings like 30 minutes and 30 minutes. That way it will like literally force me to work twice a week on this.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because that takes up two calendar blocks from me.
01:01:23 - Michael (3)
Oh, I see, okay.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I mean? So I have to set two separate times to be committed to on my schedule in order to do that.
01:01:32 - Michael (3)
And it might as well be two different clients.
01:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I gotcha. Not the amount of times the the block on the calendar. That's fair. Yeah. But you'll get this and once I'm just going to reiterate this and then we'll go. Once you get the one document to rule them all, the way that it's supposed to be and fully populated, the plans and the clarity will start coming together. And you will see with your own data and numbers why you should be doing. One thing instead of another and not just doing it because you're like, I feel like this today, you know Okay, that's fair It's doing good. So um one question I haven't had answered yet is we had GPT help you with those Particular reports for that one attorney that kept giving you a problem How were those reports received?
01:02:25 - Michael (3)
Yeah, I messaged him last week and then he didn't respond So again, but if he had issues, would he probably have sent that to you already? He's very behind so I let me let me just ask him. That's a good thing I could work on Yeah So let's get that reported to you because I want to know if it made the difference and have you had anything else to send to him since?
01:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No Okay, all right.
01:02:54 - Michael (3)
I hope he's gonna still use me, but we'll see Yeah
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We we want to track that like how what is your relationship with your attorneys and are they using you? they using you more? Are they using you less? There's so many different ways and levers that we can be optimizing, but without tracking it and organizing that data, we're just talking about it and wasting time.
01:03:19 - Michael (3)
That's true. Okay.
01:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not here for that. I'm here for optimization. All right, Fuji. Good talk. Good work.
01:03:30 - Michael (3)
Yes. Do I have to do all this for my homework?
01:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The the one document to roll them off?
01:03:36 - Michael (3)
Or I mean, you know, there's like a bunch of stuff on September No, I will be satisfied if you actually finished the whole thing. But if you didn't finish the whole thing, then do all of the rest of the other things. I see. Oh boy. Okay. We could try this.
01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, or you could just like be a slacker, but I didn't think that's what you were here for.
01:03:58 - Michael (3)
I won't get it done.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I won't it done. I'm teasing. right. You have a great day, a great week.
01:04:04 - Michael (3)
I will talk to you Monday and say, hello to all your ladies for me. Sounds good. Thank you for rescheduling.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Appreciate that. No, I appreciate it from you.
01:04:13 - Michael (3)
I felt much better about this call showing up for you better. So thank you. Awesome.
01:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
