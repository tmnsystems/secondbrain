00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Tina Marie: Everybody spells it different.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tina Marie: Where was that email from Dan? I just had it. It was not that long ago.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Tina Marie: Because he had a bunch of things for us to go over.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
mark sweet: We try to do this later in the week. I mean. We want. It's not a big deal. Today's last day of the month. So it's kind of crazy around here, anyway.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
mark sweet: Um added more to his. Google, Sheet.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
mark sweet: So we can take a look at that if you want.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. The Doc. Injured. Okay.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah. We were trying to do like the old way versus the new way. So I tried to.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
mark sweet: Fill in a little more of it, and hopefully, that made sense.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So like um.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Tina Marie: We were. We were in Arizona, obviously, and we're talking about. I kept looking at the billboards.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
mark sweet: Do you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Tina Marie: And my guy was like this guy's everywhere. And it was this guy Rafi.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah, he is.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Tina Marie: Well, and he has an opinion about the whole pi thing, and.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
mark sweet: Very heavy. There.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Tina Marie: We were talking about the new brand. And I'm like, Whoa.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Tina Marie: We only get at Max 40% attorney fees. And he said, Well, what people will normally do is get up.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Tina Marie: Like they'll say that, and then. They'll add extra bills in. And at the end people get maybe 10% of their settlement.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Tina Marie: And the attorneys get the rest of it. And he said that that's a common practice.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Tina Marie: Is, that is that what happens.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
mark sweet: That the client only gets 10%.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Tina Marie: No, just the you know that people will say cause like up here. You said. Surprise Bills.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Tina Marie: Um. What is that? Referring to.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
mark sweet: I don't know.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you didn't say that that was Chat Gbt, right.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
mark sweet: Yeah, surprise bills. That's yeah. I.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Tina Marie: So you don't ever get more than 40% right.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
mark sweet: We can get 45 in lit. There are some firms charging 50 and 55%, just not us.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Tina Marie: Well, so. But that's just.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
mark sweet: There's also discount firms out there, too.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Tina Marie: That's the total, right? You wouldn't go like we get 40%. And then, oh, by the way, here's our bill for this time. And here's our bill for this, and here's our bill for that on top of that.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
mark sweet: Um. There's costs.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Tina Marie: How does that work out.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
mark sweet: Got it. Well for us, it's usually pretty minimal. So that's things that are like out of our pocket. So getting like a police report or.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
mark sweet: Um investigator or something else. But there's definitely firms that have very high file fees.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
mark sweet: High percentages get crappy settlements. And so yeah, the client does get like 10% in their pocket.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's what I was asking about. So is there a known reputation. Ah! About that? Is that something that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Tina Marie: People would be familiar with when they start hiring an attorney and hearing things from people.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
mark sweet: No. No, most of these people do absolutely 0.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
mark sweet: Research before anything else.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so what are they aware of in the old way versus the new way? So you know what I mean? Because if it's not relative to them. It doesn't really make any sense to go about it that way.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
mark sweet: Well, so a lot of them think of the old way of like going into a lawyer's office.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000
mark sweet: Right. You're going into an old man office. There's books. You sit there, you bring your paperwork. Everything's paper files like.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
mark sweet: We've taken over these files from some of these. We just call them Old man firms.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
mark sweet: And like there's spaghetti sauce like on the files.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Tina Marie: Ew.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
mark sweet: I know, but like, that's a lot of what we're dealing with.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
mark sweet: So that's why I kind of went into the old way. Uh where'd it go?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Tina Marie: Anywhere anytime. No need to drive across somewhere.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
mark sweet: Oh, no, we're what that's weird.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
mark sweet: No, I had it up. Oh, there it is! So I left with Dim did kind of a low away, so like.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
mark sweet: I have 10 was like they wait, wait, have to chase their own lawyer, talk to a different person every time. Feel like another case. Number. Don't get help with our car, doctor bills, lowball my insurance sign up. Forget.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
mark sweet: Promises upfront excuses later. Feel more stress, not less regret, not going with someone who actually cares.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
mark sweet: Um. Also, you drive across town just to get started. Sacks of paperwork. You don't understand stuffy office with 0 warmth.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
mark sweet: Everyone moves at a snail's pace. They talk money before they talk, help paper files and rolodexes.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Tina Marie: What is okay? Where is that? At that? You're reading from.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
mark sweet: That's what I gave. Are you on the same winner? It's free, document or no.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
mark sweet: Okay, if you scroll through it. Dan did. Yeah.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh, there it is!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
mark sweet: I have any little emojis.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay, is that, yeah. Um. Do you know what the average age of your clients are?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
mark sweet: Emojis. Uh no.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
mark sweet: We? We ran it at 1 point, but. No, I know they're generally fairly uneducated.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Tina Marie: Do you remember what it was? Okay, the age matters, though, for the language.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: And also the reference of the old way versus the new way, and also like what's valuable because. If they're a certain age.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Tina Marie: Being able to do everything electronically is not necessarily a win.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
mark sweet: I know, but the people who want to go into an office are generally not gonna be good for us, anyway, because we have so few office locations.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Tina Marie: That's true. Okay, so now we're drawing a line in the sand because we don't want the pain in the ass. People for us.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
mark sweet: Pretty much, and even those ones will like send someone out. But.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
mark sweet: It's, yeah.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Tina Marie: So this is copy to go on the website.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
mark sweet: I think so. May I want to talk about it and play with it a little bit? But you know.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
mark sweet: There's nothing here that I think is bad or wrong. We're gonna get us in any trouble.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Tina Marie: No, not worried about that. But this is too long.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
mark sweet: I am.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Tina Marie: Well, well, yes, I I met from my yes, you I know you will, but.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
mark sweet: But I I let I want to put more down than less, so we can kind of pick through it and maybe dump some things or add some things, but I want to at least get it down so we can narrow it down rather than try to add to it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Tina Marie: Agreed. We just went through an exercise with Fuji and cause he had me listen to him, make a couple of calls to attorneys offices, and I ripped that apart really quickly. He had this long list that I hadn't even seen, and we.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Tina Marie: Whittled it down to like 118 words. And it said everything that needed to be said. But way, shorter way, clearer.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Tina Marie: And way more powerfully. And that's what we want to do is make sure that.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Tina Marie: We've got the. Hook in the beginning, right?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Tina Marie: The the top pretty much. But we want to make sure the hook is really strong, really clear.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Tina Marie: And that the call to action is as well, and then everything else in the middle is just. The the bridge to transition from the hook to the call to action.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Tina Marie: And we want to make sure that every word that can be taken out is taken out. Everything that we.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Tina Marie: Require them to read. In order to make a decision.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Tina Marie: Slows down, and then well, basically creates a barrier towards being able to make the decision. Um, if it can be, say, if it can be, said Shorter, we need to say it shorter.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Tina Marie: In less words. You know what I mean.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
mark sweet: Yes, I totally get what you're saying. And again, the number one thing with this is just quick, like. How do we get them to pick up the phone as quick as possible? How do we get them to to answer something else? This is.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
mark sweet: Hey? You're about to win the lottery like. So here, hit here! Hit here! Hit here! This is not a.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
mark sweet: Think it through? Do research, play. This is a instant.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
mark sweet: Click.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Tina Marie: Right, so that could be something that we have immediately under the call to action. Um. Call us right now.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Tina Marie: To whatever right. But um. Then you have to ask yourself, do do you want to field all the calls, or do you want them to keep reading a little bit, and only call us if.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Tina Marie: This, these qualifications are met.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
mark sweet: I mean, I would rather people call in because a lot of them will say I'm not hurt, but they are actually hurt.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. So we could come up with a line that's under that. So like, let's say you've got your hero image right.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Tina Marie: And underneath that underneath that just a. Big giant button.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Tina Marie: Call, now to. Um.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. Get a free consultation regarding your case. Obviously the words have to be much better than that. Um, but.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Tina Marie: I think that that's let's see um. Let me put some notes in here.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Tina Marie: Tina's note. Oh, I don't have edit access. I'm gonna request other access.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Tina Marie: Can't requested access. I see the button, but in no clicky.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
mark sweet: Because to me it's punch in the face.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
mark sweet: Quick! Quick! Hit. And then some credibility builders with usually just look at these large numbers of cases. We've settled.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So um.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tina Marie: Um. Ooh, that's not a good color. I need something like.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Tina Marie: And then this line here. You didn't ask for this. The crash, the pain, the confusion.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Tina Marie: Um! What about the lost time working. Or the lost time, or something like that. That time's important.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Tina Marie: Last year. And uh.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Tina Marie: Add a comment. Cross, the pain, the confusion, now.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Tina Marie: Put this here. Can we say something like um?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: So the crash, the pain, the confusion, the time stolen from you, the lost wages because of someone else's mistake. Now what? Or something like that.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Tina Marie: Is that too much?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
mark sweet: No. I mean, it's okay. Um. And I think people do want to get some level of.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
mark sweet: Justice.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Tina Marie: You need help. So, anyway, my comments in here, I'll I'll screen share. That'd be better.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
mark sweet: But I super have to take this call so like 2 seconds, so sorry.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay? No. Problem.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
mark sweet: Okay. I'm back.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Tina Marie: Hey!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Second, voicing.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good job!

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
mark sweet: Not really. This one's super small. But yeah.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Tina Marie: Just let's see.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
mark sweet: Sorry. It's the last day of the month, so it's a little bit. Crazy chaotic. Here, we're trying to hit our goal, and we're a little behind.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
mark sweet: So as soon as we get off this call, like, I just need to hit phones really hard, because. While the adjusters are on east coast time.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, okay. That's a huge um.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Tina Marie: Selling factor. Was there something here? And this is just an empty bullet, or what.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
mark sweet: Um. I don't know.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. See, we talk about lost wages down here, but not at the beginning. That's a big deal. A lot of people, especially low income, like.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Tina Marie: You Miss Work, you're out of a job.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
mark sweet: Their number. One concern is their car when they're trying to contact us because they can't do anything.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
mark sweet: So that's usually number one concern. Then it's how much is it worth? How much money can I get. Because all people ever see are the big settlements.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: Just because. You don't hear. It doesn't mean people aren't worried about it.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Tina Marie: So you want to have a conversation that's going on in their heads, even if they're not able to communicate it to you.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
mark sweet: I will tell you definitively their number one concern is their vehicle.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Tina Marie: I'm not saying that that right? Okay. But what are all their concerns? So my point is is that if you and.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:24.000
mark sweet: I've got serious injuries. How much is my case worth? How long does it take? And why do I need to hire an attorney.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000
mark sweet: Those are the. Those are distilled down from all the other questions to those 3 things. I promise you. Those are the 3 main things that you can convince someone to find or not.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Tina Marie: I I believe that what I'm what I'm telling you is that to consider, just to consider. People, even the majority of them.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Tina Marie: Don't think to ask about certain types of things in a moment. And then.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Tina Marie: But it's still a selling point, right? So, addressing lost wages in the beginning, I don't know how often it comes up, but just so it's about value stacking right? And I'm talking about right here, and like the the couple of things that I added. And then also, when we get to a call to action, just a reminder. These are all the things that we can help you with. So.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Tina Marie: Um, if that's the deal, if that's if that's the thing. So one of the 1st things we want to talk about is making sure you have something to drive asap. I don't see that anywhere.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
mark sweet: Right, because we don't really wanna.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: If that's.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
mark sweet: Promise that.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: Helping you. Uh. Do you help with that like? What.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
mark sweet: Yeah, we do.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Tina Marie: You see what I'm getting at like? What can we say without. Getting ourselves in trouble.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Tina Marie: That help answer the concerns that they have most. Before they even pick up the phone.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Tina Marie: Are you thinking about it, or. You are very quiet, Mark.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
mark sweet: Because I'm trying to think.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Just checking.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Tina Marie: Let's see.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
mark sweet: Cause. My thought is this is just purely visceral.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Tina Marie: Well, what if you look at all of your assets as an opportunity to convey. Basically your elevator speech, right? Which is.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Tina Marie: Everything you need to know to call us right now. Because these are the things that are on your mind. How can I make sure that you know.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Tina Marie: Um what you need to know to pick up the phone right now. Hear what you need to hear, to pick up the phone right now.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Tina Marie: Are you thinking about the fact that. You don't know how you're gonna get to work.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Tina Marie: Um! How are you going to drive. Are you thinking about? How much money can you get out? This is even worth it.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Tina Marie: What is on your mind right now, and if you come across me in any way, shape or form, whether it's online or on a billboard, or on the radio, or whatever are you going to hear within a matter of seconds? Everything you need to know to know that if you call me. I'm going to help you. Make, sense.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Tina Marie: So you want everything.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
mark sweet: Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay! Hold on!

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
mark sweet: Cause. We know roughly how many people we've helped, like, how many clients we've had. So we can always do a trusted by.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
mark sweet: 3,000 plus. People in Xyz. State.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Tina Marie: Love, that.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
mark sweet: We obviously have the awards and stuff we can point to as well. But I think trusted by whatever number of people is strong.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Tina Marie: Um. 8.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Tina Marie: Ooh. This could be dynamic.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Tina Marie: The Vpns. Anyway. Put this in here by purple.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Tina Marie: So just like. Cause cause the browser can detect where they're at, but they could be using a VPN. That.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: Changes their location. So it's wrong. It's the wrong color. What's that.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Tina Marie: I wanted to be clear that it's a different.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
mark sweet: I don't even think I would. I take the state out, I just say trusted by number of.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
mark sweet: People.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yeah, love that especially because that makes the number bigger.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Tina Marie: Um. Alright. So you're getting into the.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: Vibe. Now, right about. What they need to hear.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
mark sweet: I'm also thinking, how do you establish credibility? Quickly.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So to the point of. Let me see if the where's the AI somewhere, though.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tina Marie: It's harder to get to when I'm sharing. Um. I do it when I'm sharing.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: I want to get to the AI companion. There it is. Doing this real, quick.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so transportation issues potential compensation and how we can help. I love that number 5. Right here our team builds a strong case, pushes back on lowball, offers.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Tina Marie: And fights to get you the big check you deserve. This that's.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: I mean, that could be a billboard. Right there.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Tina Marie: Um, you know, and we could have. So the hero image. Could be a Slider.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Tina Marie: And we. Could track.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Tina Marie: What Slider gets the most engagement. Right? So do we scroll past Slider one and 2, but Slider 3 gets a scroll back up to read what it says, or Slider 3. We click on the call button from Slider 3. Do you know what I'm talking about in a Slider.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
mark sweet: Yes, the only concern is sometimes the sliders slow things down.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
mark sweet: But that's the only issue.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
mark sweet: Slowly, like loading page time, but it's rare.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: I'll put nothing here. This line right here.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Tina Marie: Because because all of these could be in the Slider. Good change, that formatting.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Tina Marie: Paste, without formatting. Alright. The great thing is, when Dan's brain gets on this he'll be like, Oh, new version, and then.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
mark sweet: And uh.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Tina Marie: Those iterations, we go back and forth, and. Um.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Tina Marie: Collect your settlement. No win no cost like I feel like. That's it's good. I just don't feel like it's as strong as it could be, but I don't know how to make it.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
mark sweet: It's not as strong as it could be, but it's at least we're starting this alone.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Tina Marie: Right. But here's a good place to put, get paid, not played.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Tina Marie: This is, I think this is great. I think it's really strong. I'm a little confused uh.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Tina Marie: About this. How, oh, how else we help! I read that as who else we help.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Tina Marie: Ignoring my brain. See the best doctors now, like.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Tina Marie: Is this supposed to be a list? I don't know, and I don't think you wrote.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it was having like one side the old way, then the other side a new. And then how else we help, I think, was gonna be just couple spots.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay. One thing, I think that you guys might.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Tina Marie: Highlight is dealing with. Pain in the ass insurance companies. Right? That's so like.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
mark sweet: Also actual lawyers, actual results. Someone put something like that on one of their websites. And I kind of like that. A lot of these are just.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
mark sweet: Advertisement.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Tina Marie: Oh, anyway! So the whole. This one was good pushes back on lowball offers right? So that insinuates.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Tina Marie: I don't. I don't know that people even know that it's the insurance company, or if they think it's the other person or the lawyer like whatever. But this, this does a great job. But I feel like we want to be able to repeat that a few times a few different ways. Throughout the messaging. Because this really right here, mark this.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Tina Marie: This is the image of the advocate. Like we are fighting for you. But this.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
mark sweet: Alright!

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Tina Marie: Shows how we're fighting for you. And what you get out of it.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Tina Marie: So to say, I fight for you. Okay, fine. But you could be a featherweight fighting, a heavyweight. Not really interested. Know what I'm saying.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
mark sweet: Mhm. Mhm.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Tina Marie: But to say you, you're qualifying that statement. Our team builds a strong case, pushes back on lowball, offers and fights to get you the big check that you deserve, and feeding ego and entitlement a little bit there. But that's a real thing. People.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Tina Marie: Respond to that. Doesn't mean it's bad when I say Ego, ego's there to protect us. But.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. But but it's important that that's in there. So that message.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Tina Marie: It's actually almost feel like that could build that could be like a sticky. Thing with a call. Now button.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Tina Marie: That follows them on the website. Um. And maybe we've got that hero image like the hero image.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Tina Marie: I mean in a different way that avogado de justitia the, you know, superhero.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: Um. Maybe we bring that into this. Somehow.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Tina Marie: But I feel like you could build a really powerful brand. The other thing I was noticing. Um in those billboards. Is that.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Tina Marie: And my guy was. We were kind of looking at at the same time, too, like. Some people, just really, most people don't use their space. Well.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Tina Marie: Like.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
mark sweet: Very true.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Tina Marie: Rafi's brand is his face and his name, and that probably does something. But if you're not familiar with them.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Tina Marie: Big deal right now. He may have. He might be that prolific, and everybody knows. I doubt that. But then there was another one. What.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
mark sweet: He is. He is at this point. It's on TV radio. He's just.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
mark sweet: So in your face.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but let's not get derailed, because I want to tell you.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
mark sweet: That people know him so. Yes. Okay.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Tina Marie: My, my point is in the billboards, though one person that was a guy. And it looked very corporate-esque.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Tina Marie: It was navy blue. I wish I could remember what it was, but there was a lot going on, and he had um. He was in a suit with a smaller stack of money, but it was something about they offered um.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Tina Marie: 4,000. We are 40,000, and we got a million something like that. And that was.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Tina Marie: That was huge right there, right? So like you like old way, new way. Um! This is like they offered this. We got them this.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Tina Marie: That kind of thing is. Huge because they can relate to somebody, had a story where they got this lowball offer, and.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Tina Marie: That that was it. Like they knew it should have been worth more. But they didn't get more, either, because they thought they couldn't afford an attorney, so maybe they don't even know you don't pay an attorney unless it's free. So we're we're covering that. But are we covering like. What so lowball offer?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tina Marie: This is a perfect example to go. For example. Was offered. This we got. X was offered. This we got X.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Tina Marie: So and so from this place was offered this we got that right, so. We don't. You can't show names right, but client in so and so in in a city.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Tina Marie: Right. Um! This kind of accident was offered. This we got that. If you have those types of examples, we can put it there, and and.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Tina Marie: Um, they're real right. You can back them up. If if you were ever investigated as a claim. But that's huge, because a person looks at that and go holy shit like it's worth my time and effort to talk to an attorney for that amount of money. Difference.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Tina Marie: And we're not covering that anywhere here.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
mark sweet: You know that we also. I know we talked about the privacy and confidentiality thing.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
mark sweet: Because a lot of these people are very afraid of that.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. Explain how.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
mark sweet: I don't know why. Uh. People are concerned that this is not private or confidential, that someone's gonna know something.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Tina Marie: Well, can you give me more context?

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
mark sweet: It's literally stupid. I I sorry, but like I don't know another way. Say people are concerned, that the conversation is not.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
mark sweet: Confidential.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Tina Marie: I get that. But do you know why? Who are they afraid of finding out.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
mark sweet: Because they're. I don't know. These people are worried about the Government, or whatever.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
mark sweet: Or that we work through the insurance company, or I don't know cause really weird shit.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Tina Marie: So. Are they illegal?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Tina Marie: Like, okay, that would make sense to me.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
mark sweet: Sometimes. But that's usually not who.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
mark sweet: That question comes up with. I mean a lot of times if they were on drugs or something else they want people knowing about. Or you know.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
mark sweet: They're calling don't want someone else finding out. They want people know they might have money, whatever.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
mark sweet: But I cannot tell you how many times I said, Don't worry. This is this called turning client like. I cannot repeat what you say.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Tina Marie: Um. Um.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Nice.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: How is it? 1247 already. Holy crap!

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
mark sweet: Life I don't know. Today is one of those days where everything's just flying by way too fast.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Tina Marie: I'm telling you. Okay, well, I think this is great.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Tina Marie: Um all the way versus new way. It's in here. Hadn't seen it yet.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Tina Marie: 2 years.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
mark sweet: That was his old way versus in the new way.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Can I add that.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Tina Marie: Put it here, highlight it, and you can take it out. Oops! One thing up front.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Tina Marie: Right here. And I'm telling you this because.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Tina Marie: Brains, right people, sometimes those 2 extra words. Make it go. Aha! Oh, oh, you mean like.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: Before I even get started. I have to pay that money.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
mark sweet: Well, also, a lot of people have had experiences with.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
mark sweet: Immigration or divorce, where they do pay hourly.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Tina Marie: Well, so are you saying, Don't put this.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
mark sweet: No, I'm okay with it, because people have had a bad experience previously.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay. Enter long court delays.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Tina Marie: No court needed. That's. That's I mean, I just really think that.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: This also. Should be super like, literally highlighted, somehow sit through depositions.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Tina Marie: Not applicable doesn't happen. Lose, and still owe me.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
mark sweet: Excuse me.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Tina Marie: Like something um. Something to the effects.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Tina Marie: Um. Not applicable.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Tina Marie: Or big. Like, what's what do you call that sign like.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Tina Marie: I don't know the no sign. Um struggle with lying through it.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Tina Marie: Why is this so big. It's really weird.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it's so so large.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Tina Marie: I know what. Anyway, it's like.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
mark sweet: Oh, one of the things with the old way that he doesn't have on there is receive a check without knowing. What everyone got paid and basically.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Tina Marie: Can we do? Insert, row. Do that receive.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Tina Marie: Please check on what.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:24.000
mark sweet: There's a more eloquent marketing way to say this, but without knowing what everyone got paid so like clients getting, you know, 5 or 10% in their pocket.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Tina Marie: Right. Without itemized.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000
mark sweet: So basically receiving a random check in the mail without really knowing what the hell. Happened.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Tina Marie: Where the money, when it's good enough. Workshop, for better.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Tina Marie: Language. Yeah.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Okay, do you mind if we call it early today? Because I want to try to help the team hit their goals. And I'm super running out of time.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Tina Marie: Yes, um, I if you want any time later this week. Or messages, or whatever, just reach out. But go and do what you need to do.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
mark sweet: Probably cause there's a bunch of stuff, but.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:18.000
mark sweet: Her dashboard. I added some more stuff to it, added some of what we talked about in terms of procedure, so they can see what's happening with it as long as the data is in there. So that's good. And then, uh, we sort of figured out a potential payroll program for her so that could help a lot of issues and allow her to hire better talent.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tina Marie: Cool.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
mark sweet: Because she can offer things that Dr. E. Can't. So some really positive things there.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
mark sweet: Yes. Okay.
