00:00:10.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tina Marie: On the line. Whenever you guys are ready. Stop.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Stop. Stop.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tina Marie: Nope. My email is.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Tina Marie: Nothing.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Esther: Hello!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good morning! How are you?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Esther: Hmm. Good.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Esther: It's just me right now. I. Fuji's still another call. I think he forgot about this.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Esther: Because he looked at me, and he was like. Oh, I was like Tina. I was like, we have a call with Tina. He's like, Oh, I'm like.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Esther: Okay.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tina Marie: Do you want to reschedule.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Esther: Um. Yes, we could. Um.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tina Marie: Or do you want to flip and do your call now and then? Do the call with him later. In your normal time.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Esther: Yeah, we can do that. I'll just okay. That's that's actually a good idea. Let's do that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Esther: Nice. I'll I'll tell him um.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Esther: Never mind, I'll do, Michael. I know.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Esther: Ha! Ha! And do our call at 2, 30.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Esther: Okay. Okay. Yeah. You know um.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Esther: That's that's fine! Um.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Esther: It's like.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Tina Marie: Pivot, baby, pivot.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Esther: It's not. It's not unusual.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um. Let's see. Hold on a second.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Esther: Oh!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Tina Marie: I'm just seeing if he accepted it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Esther: A copy of that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Tina Marie: He did not. So.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Esther: Well, but he said this was the time that was that would work for him. Yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Tina Marie: Right, but if his system is, it goes on his calendar for him to remember. Not accepting the event means it doesn't go on his calendar. So.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Esther: Oh, okay, no. It should be there. Yeah.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Esther: For him to prep.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Tina Marie: In order for that to happen every time there's an invitation it has to be accepted. So if we're doing this together, and you want some oversight, so he's not missing it. Make sure it's on his calendar.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Esther: Okay, sure, I will do. That's fine. We can pivot um. It's not unusual that for him to forget things like this.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Esther: Um. Yeah.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Esther: Oh, okay, so. Um.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Esther: See where to start. Um, so.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Tina Marie: You wanna take a couple of minutes to review like notes and like kind of Orient yourself.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Esther: Yes, give me like 2 min like 1115, give me 2 min.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Tina Marie: Don't worry about it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Esther: Okay.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Tina Marie: Okay, I'll I'll do the same thing. Get my head there.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Esther: Okay. I remember what I wanted to talk a little bit about today.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Esther: So I did get to go to. I got a referral for Adhd, and then the.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: Cool.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Esther: Couple of places I I called um. They happened to not take my insurance. Another place I called, you know. I started the intake with them, and.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Esther: I think I realize I don't know that much about Adhd, and how it's treated. Um! They immediately offered.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Esther: To get an offered me to get an assessment with an Mp. Um, and saying that that is primarily for med manage management.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Esther: Um. And I'm I'm not the type of person who's really, ever really interested in meds.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Esther: You know, I wanted to try more like cognitive behavioral for therapy, and they didn't have something like that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Tina Marie: They don't.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Esther: So, anyway, there's just all to say that there's a lot of different little like a lot of different hurdles.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Esther: Um. And I was kind of reviewing. You know. I've been reviewing your notes.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Esther: About it, and. I don't know, like maybe I.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Esther: Don't! Have it!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Esther: Or I. I'm just like, is it worth? Is it worth going through all these hurdles to figure out whether I have it or not? And what to do about it.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Tina Marie: Well. So the only.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Tina Marie: This this is. This was part of the conversation we got to go into. Medically. The only thing that they do right that's prescribed is medicine.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Tina Marie: Or. Um, you may find somebody who's just like, let's talk about it. So cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tina Marie: Is. Generally the the um therapists that will use that like to use it for everything, because statistically.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Tina Marie: It has as good or better results as any type of therapy for anything, including exceeding medicines.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Tina Marie: So. Once once you know that.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Tina Marie: All you need is um. Basically a licensed therapist who knows what they're doing and can talk. However.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Tina Marie: That match, like, you know, probably through experience, that you don't just go find somebody that matches you well, that you can relate to. Well, that can address all the things that you're thinking about, but also. Honestly, Esther.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Tina Marie: As introspective as you are. Um.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tina Marie: So. To me a therapist.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Tina Marie: Facilitates a conversation. With yourself.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Tina Marie: That. Um.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Tina Marie: You. May not give yourself permission to do a loan.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Tina Marie: Basically, it's a support person who understands the way that the brain and the mind work. Right? So I say them separately, because one.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Tina Marie: Is difficult to describe. One is kind of chemical, and you know it's the way that we're wired, and then there's something else ethereal, and whether you. Call it spirit or not, it's still difficult to define.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Tina Marie: Because. You can line up all the the chemistry you want to. There's still going to be variants. That's not explainable scientifically.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Tina Marie: So. And then talking to somebody who understands those concepts.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Tina Marie: Right, and then can. So all cognitive behavioral therapy really is is self-observance. It's introspection.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Tina Marie: And noticing how we behave in certain situations. So um. Right cognitive, noticing our brain behavioral and therapy is just going.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Tina Marie: How could I behave differently in this situation? Right? What do I control.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Tina Marie: How am I showing up. And what could I change in order to change the outcome of these types of situations? If I don't like how they're happening? Or if I just want to improve how they're happening. That is the gist of cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Tina Marie: So. Number one. You already do that.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Tina Marie: You you do it. Having a facilitator like to me, I would say, this conversation is still facilitating that because it is what happens during our conversations.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Tina Marie: You notice something about what you do? I noticed something about it. We say, what if you tried something else? That's all it is.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Tina Marie: So. It doesn't necessarily have to be somebody licensed. It could be somebody who's just a deep thinker. That's a friend, you know that you have.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Tina Marie: Deep conversations with, and you're you. You feel safe enough to say this is how I show up. You know, and I've been wondering why and wondering. You know, what could I do about it? And you might have somebody insightful. That just goes. What if.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Tina Marie: So the solution is. Kind of whatever you want it to be. But.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: For Adhd clinically. It's adderall. That stuff is terrible.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Tina Marie: Um. I did take it once. Um! And it was amazing, because my mind had never been so quiet. I was so.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Tina Marie: Peaceful. I get emotional, just thinking about it. But all the research I did because my fiance was like, please please don't do that. I've watched people be destroyed.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Tina Marie: And so I did some research on it, and the probability that number one, it won't last very long. 2 that I'll have to keep taking more. 3. That it'd be addictive. That would be destructive. That would do all these things.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Tina Marie: Was just too high, so. That that calm was amazing and wonderful.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Tina Marie: But the cost. 1st of all it was temporary.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Tina Marie: Very temporary from everything that I read. Incredibly temporary.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Tina Marie: And the the cost was unacceptable. We talk about trade-offs right. So. The thing that I've learned in life is there is no escape from the things that are hard.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Tina Marie: What there is is management of the things that are hard, but also. The world labels.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: Adhd. As a disorder. It was created because.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tina Marie: The people with it are difficult to control. And that doesn't work well in classrooms.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't work well in companies. The world is run on classrooms, training people to work in companies.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Esther: Mhm. I.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Esther: I agree with that.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Tina Marie: So there's nothing wrong with you. It annoys the crap out of people to be called out on their crap. Esther.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Esther: Huh! Mhm.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Tina Marie: It annoys the crap out of people to see somebody ordered and structured, and requiring them to have some order and structure too. So there is nothing wrong with you.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Tina Marie: You don't fit in the rest of the world, because you're not average. And it annoys people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Tina Marie: But. It's your strength.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Tina Marie: And you don't feel like you belong. The way that you want to feel like you belong. But.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Tina Marie: Would you really condescend. To feel like you belong, would you.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Tina Marie: Shrink yourself. Like you have. I'm positive.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Esther: No.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Tina Marie: To feel like you belong. Is that really the trade off that you want. So.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Tina Marie: That's the conversation we had about masking right.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Esther: Okay. Mhm.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Tina Marie: We do it? So, just.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Tina Marie: Learn about it. Just study about it. Start there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Tina Marie: To be informed. You're going to find lots of people with lots of strong opinions. And their personal experiences.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Tina Marie: Find what feels true and good to you and useful to you. Discard the rest.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Tina Marie: And allow yourself to define who you are. What you are, what is good, what is not good.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Tina Marie: What is just. It is, and it's neither good nor bad depending on how you use it.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Tina Marie: Which is true of almost every quality that we have.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Esther: Wow! That's really insightful. Because. I was honestly coming to a bit of an impasse.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Esther: Thinking. You know how much is. This is gonna cost me if I have to.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Esther: Pay out of pocket, and it's not like we don't have money right, but at the same time, like, Oh, my shit, I have to go on. You know, if I need to do more therapy, or whatever it is, you know it. It adds up over time.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Esther: You know, and.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Tina Marie: There are better things you not necessarily better, but you know other things. You don't make your money just to burn it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Esther: No, that's that's right. Yeah. Um. You know so.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Esther: I think. One of the most.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Esther: Profound things you've said to me. Is.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Esther: Your thoughts, around. Chaos a little bit, or messiness, and.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Esther: You know, like my house isn't perfect, and like no one's house is perfect. My workspace is far from perfect. I just have things everywhere. Because that's how I remind myself. That things need doing. Yes, I have to do lists, but.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Esther: Um. I need it. I'm the kind of person that needs to have post it notes like everywhere and on things. So I don't forget, you know my forget Mari's formula when we go out, or I don't forget her diaper bag, or whatever things like that.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Esther: And I think just kind of. Being, accepting.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Esther: Of that, and accepting that. These unconventional ways of operating are okay, that I'm oh, it's okay for me to.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Esther: Think and act on these unconventional ways of operating.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Tina Marie: They're not as unconventional as you think. It's just that everybody hides them.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Esther: Okay. Okay.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Esther: I see. Okay.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Tina Marie: Because you're conditioned from school to behave a certain way. So that you can go to work and behave a certain way.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Tina Marie: That is our approval process. That is how we define ourselves. That is how we've been measured. Our entire lives. To feed the system.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Tina Marie: Entrepreneurial type, strong. Types, powerful types that get things done who can find order in chaos.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Tina Marie: Um. I like to call it my, you know, disaster like organizes. I don't like dirt and. And clutter.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Tina Marie: But there are parts where it exists a lot, and those are the parts where I do a lot of things because. Productivity outweighs.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Tina Marie: Order. To me.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Tina Marie: Because my productiveness is order. It is the order of my growth and evolution. So most everything is pretty clean most of the time.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Tina Marie: But the areas that are highly used are they look chaotic. I know exactly what's there, though. And for me out of sight, out of mind. So I needed to be in my sight. I needed to be in my mind.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Esther: Same here.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Tina Marie: So that I'm applying my mind to it. But I will tell you what. Almost every entrepreneur creator, artist, all the people that make this world beautiful and amazing.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Tina Marie: Are chaotic. And messy.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Tina Marie: Not filthy, not dirty. There's a big difference.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Tina Marie: There's a big difference between even dust on the floor and. And food spots that you might get, and things like that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Esther: Oh, I I agree.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Tina Marie: Between filth. So I'll give you an example every time somebody had to come into my house and do some kind of work. I felt so embarrassed like my house is so dirty I feel whatever they're like. Lady, this is one of the cleanest house we've ever we've ever been in. You should see.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Tina Marie: Feces on the wall, and, like you don't understand the level of filth that many people live in. Esther, many. My girls that they've had friends, and they've gone out, and they've told me about these things. I'm like, you're kidding me like I cannot believe what people live in.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: Everybody's hiding. Not true. Not everybody, but the majority of people.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Tina Marie: Are hiding. The majority of people don't feel free telling the ugly, dirty, uncomfortable truth.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Tina Marie: I do, and it really drives people bonkers. There's only a little bit of people that actually like me. And people either love me or hate me. There is no in between.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Esther: In between.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Tina Marie: There's none. I am very polarizing, and I don't. Want to be, but then I think about it. I'm like, you know what.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Tina Marie: I I would like it. I wanna I want people to. I want to know where I stand with people. But the thing that I've learned is, people know where they stand with me, and they love that.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Tina Marie: And it has brought them comfort. Um. I, when I worked in the corporate world.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tina Marie: Uh! People were scared all the time of losing their jobs. But it came on my team, you know. The slackers were scared, but nobody else was. They're like, I know where I stand, because I would tell people this is how you're performing. And unless you fall behind below this threshold you'll never have anything to worry about. I may come. Talk to you. I may come, coach, you.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Tina Marie: But. You should expect that, anyway, because even if you're my best person, I'm going to coach you and raise you up. And the company attrition rate was roughly 70%.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Tina Marie: Mine was 30. And I lost my people too.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Tina Marie: Promotions. So.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Tina Marie: And also just define working right what works. So one of my favorite memes is when you've got like a chicken, a rabbit, a fish. And like an elephant, and the test is, climb the tree.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Tina Marie: The fish can't climb that tree. The elephant can't climb that tree. Right. So they're set to fail. But if the measure of intelligence, or goodness, or ability or amazingness is, can you climb the tree.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Tina Marie: The ones designed to live in the water. Or be bigger than 3.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Tina Marie: You know, you know what I mean like, it's it's the application. So because you don't do certain things like certain people doesn't make you less than. Doesn't make you disordered doesn't make you wrong. It makes you. Esther. Esther was designed for.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Tina Marie: Specific things. And.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Tina Marie: To operate in a certain way, so. Let's ask yourself, are you functional?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Tina Marie: Do you take care of yourself? Do you get up in the morning. Can you have conversations and.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Tina Marie: Do you have the emotional intelligence, ability to. Have a conflict and not murder somebody.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Tina Marie: Not go slash their tires, you know, like. Um.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Tina Marie: Instead of asking yourself what's wrong with Esther? Look at. Can do you? What do you contribute to the world, to your.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Tina Marie: Family? Is it more good than bad? Um.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Tina Marie: Do you grow. Do? Do your children grow and evolve? Does your marriage grow and evolve.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: Um. Do do things grow and evolve? Or do they constantly.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Tina Marie: Are they constantly at threat of being destroyed. So, if everything is not under constant threat of being destroyed.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Tina Marie: And there's evidence that there's either maintenance or growth. Where's the failure?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Tina Marie: What's wrong.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Esther: Okay.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Tina Marie: How can you say it's wrong?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Tina Marie: Based on what. Compared to what? Because everybody is the same.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Tina Marie: So we can compare.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Esther: Okay. Oh, my! Gosh!

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Tina Marie: Can't.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Esther: I think you saying that somehow. It's kind of turning some things in my mind on its head a little bit in the sense that.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Esther: Yes, I do keep looking at. Things around me as to what is the next thing I can.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Esther: Improve. What's the next thing I can fix. What's the next thing that can be better.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Esther: Um. Yeah, I keep looking for what's wrong.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Esther: And um. Yeah, that's just kind of.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Esther: The way my mind has been.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Tina Marie: So. Do you remember that I told you that our strengths and our weaknesses are the same coin just opposite sides.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Esther: Sort of.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay, well, they are. Just applied differently.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: So you just gave a perfect example. The same quality that goes. What can I make better? That's good growth and evolution. If you're a gardener, you want to do that. If you're a parent, you want to do that. If you work any place you want to do that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Esther: Okay.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Tina Marie: But then you said something that is not the same. And that is what is wrong.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Tina Marie: So something doesn't need to be made better, because it's wrong. It can be made better simply to evolve it and improve it.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't make it wrong.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Esther: Okay.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: So. You can stop asking yourself what's wrong, because I'll tell you what what's wrong shows itself.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Esther: I think the other adjacent question to that that is in my mind is. Um.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Esther: It's not good enough.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Tina Marie: Based off? Of what standard. What measurement.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Tina Marie: And who created the measurement, who created the standard. Every book that we have.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Esther: You think that's the I think I think that's the insidious thing right?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Tina Marie: But let's go with that for a minute.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Esther: Like. Mhm.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: Where did all the standards come from? If you trace it all the way back from the Origin. Where did the standards come from?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Tina Marie: A person. What qualified that person to make the standard.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Esther: No.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: The loudest voice.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Esther: Yeah, we'd like.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Tina Marie: The one that had power over other people, because they took it by force, like.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Tina Marie: What gave them the power to make that standard.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Esther: Yeah. It's.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Esther: No, I I think. Well, I think that's a very simple answer is, my parents. Actually, yeah, um.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Esther: I never. It was almost as if.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Esther: To to me. You know, things just things were never good enough.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Esther: It's like just this bar. This is completely unreachable bar that just keeps going higher and higher and higher. Like, and there's just no way to reach it. There's no.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Esther: There's nothing that says, Okay, you know, I have a goal. If I reach this goal or something, then oh, it's good enough, or whatever it is. But.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Esther: The way that they've. You know that they kind of.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Esther: Impressed on me was. Whatever I was doing, which is never, never, never good enough.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Tina Marie: Try hard.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Esther: And.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Tina Marie: Try harder, try harder.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Esther: Harder, you know, like. And it was a lot of comparisons.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Esther: I don't. Do you know, I've luckily more or less. Grown out of the habit of.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Esther: Comparing myself with other people, I mean, that was. For a very long time. That was something I really struggled with.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Esther: Um i. You know.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Esther: I was taught to compare. I was compared to other people. Constantly.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Esther: And it was like, Oh, why would you compare yourself to someone who's like worse than you at something? But as a kid I was just kind of like. Oh!

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Esther: I don't. I never remembered comparing myself to people that it was just something that they drilled into me like it never existed in me, and I don't think comparisons. Existed in, exist in my true self.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Esther: It was. Forced on me.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Esther: And then once I, after you know, 1015 years of removing myself. From their presence, and allowing myself to kind of.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Esther: Flourish the way that I am the way I want to be. I realized that. Comparison and competition.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Esther: It's just not me. Like Fuji, is naturally competitive and.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Esther: That he loves it. That's just, you know. Some people are always like that. I literally don't give a fuck.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Esther: I really don't. I'm just like I don't. Hair.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Esther: Someone makes more money than me. I don't care if. Someone I really don't care. There's just so many things I don't care about. I don't.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Esther: Care if this team wins or that team wins, or I don't know. I just don't care.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Esther: Um. But and then so I find it hard to relate to people or coworkers, or colleagues who are really competitive, because I'm just like. I, you know, as soon as you know I I spent.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Esther: Some time away from that sentiment, and that thing that was just forced on me. The comparison, the competition. I just feel so much more like myself.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Esther: Um, but. It still hasn't um.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Esther: It still hasn't gotten rid of, so I'm not comparing myself to other people, but I still have the tendency to be like, oh. Whatever I'm working towards is not good enough. It's not good enough.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Esther: Maybe I'm you know, comparing with myself, or just some sort of like nebulous. Ideal.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Esther: Um. You know, if it's not a person or some sort of actual.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Esther: Thing, but like a certain goal. But it's just a nebulous, like nebulous, unreasonable, unreachable perfection or ideal. Yeah.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Esther: So.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: Or or just. You've internalized that you're not good enough, no matter what you do. So it there isn't an actual goal, and that's why you can never reach it.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Esther: Yes.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Tina Marie: So. It's just continuing to be aware of that. And and so.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Tina Marie: The other type of therapy that is incredibly, powerfully successful is exposure, therapy. And.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tina Marie: It's. It aligns with cognitive behavioral therapy because.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Tina Marie: When you expose yourself to the words, I am enough.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Tina Marie: Constantly. You begin to believe it. So like Emdr. Is.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Tina Marie: Sort of exposure therapy in the way that. Um. You're told to go through the scene again just over and over again, because all trauma is.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Tina Marie: Is. Harm.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tina Marie: Right. But but that um traumatic Pstd, Ptsd. Is that we replay that harm over and over again, and when we remember it.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. We feel the same things as though it's happening again, like they've wired the brain.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Tina Marie: And the body ekgs everywhere, and it's as though the trauma is happening again. When that person remembers it. And so the therapy is having people remember it, and then walking them through, and just be like, you're fine. You're safe.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Tina Marie: Nothing's happening. And so the more often they do that the less that stress response happens for the memory.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Tina Marie: Right. It's all happening in the brain now. The trauma was real. It really happened. But the damage continues to repeat inside of our minds.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Tina Marie: There's also a book. I didn't read it. Um! Other people. I didn't feel like I needed it, but other people have felt really helpful, and it's called the body keeps score. I don't know if you've ever read that.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Esther: Oh, I've never heard of that book.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Tina Marie: But. It is that we hold stress in different parts of our bodies. There are women.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Tina Marie: Who cannot. Do any kind of yoga pose that requires their hips to be open.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Tina Marie: The trauma is trapped in their hips, so they. Clench up.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Tina Marie: They cannot open up. Well, because they cannot open up even just for exercise. Right? Much less. Let's talk about intimacy and what that keeps them from.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tina Marie: Because their their fear just locks them up right there. Well, if your muscles are that tight. Your tissues are suffering.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Tina Marie: And your hips are connected to everything. Imagine the quality of life and all that pain like you're you're breathing shallow right now. I don't know if you know that your shoulders are going up and down. You're stressed out right now.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Tina Marie: I don't know that you know that, but I can see it in.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Esther: Huh! Okay.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Tina Marie: Do you? Do you feel anything in yourself like? Do you feel tense because. Do you notice it?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Tina Marie: Because it's visible in you right now.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Esther: Oh, I don't notice it. I think I just. I'm just thinking.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Tina Marie: You're thinking about stressful things.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Tina Marie: And it's visible in you.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Esther: Okay. Oh, Fuji always said I was very expressive, so I didn't know that it shows on my face.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh, it's not just your face, it's your whole body. I can see your respiratory rate increasing, and I can see your shoulders going up and down.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Esther: Oh, okay.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Tina Marie: You're leaning in like, but you're going through something.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Esther: Okay.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Tina Marie: Thinking about what I'm talking about, but also other things at the same time.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Esther: Okay. Wow, that's really perceptive. Okay.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Esther: I am thinking about other things at the same time. And like kind of.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Esther: Using your words to kind of see if I could pinpoint. Um.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Esther: Where.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Esther: Yeah, okay.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. No, I know what you're doing. You're taking a new lens.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Tina Marie: And running it through those scenes. Right now.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Esther: Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tina Marie: So there's nothing but that's cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Esther: Oh! Okay.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Tina Marie: So what happens then is, let's say you go through another situation. That.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Tina Marie: Is stressful to you, but something we've talked about, and so. One of the things that makes me laugh.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Tina Marie: Is that people will be like Tina. I heard you in my head. And then.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay. They'll go through something, and they'll hear that thought, that voice, that conversation, and replay it in the same way. The stress was just doing that to you.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Tina Marie: The calm of the conversation that we had did that to them in that moment.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Esther: No.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Tina Marie: And. So we flipped it.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Tina Marie: The memories. Of the good things that they intentionally put in your brain. You're intentionally putting these conversations in your brain.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Tina Marie: You'll get to use them as tools in your tool belt. When the next types of things happen.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tina Marie: Ah, so it's just.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Esther: No wonder I feel so good every time I read through our notes again.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Tina Marie: And that's part of what they're there for, because you're not just remembering my words. You're remembering your feelings and your words, your thoughts, your epiphanies, your releases, because I can't tell you, probably at least once a call. You do this. Okay, you just yawn. Do you know what that is?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Tina Marie: So you're just releasing. So the yawning is a stress. So that's the secondary effect. When we're stressed out.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Esther: Okay.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Tina Marie: Our adrenal system, our. Parasympathetic system.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Tina Marie: Um. One of the things is like cottonmouth. And.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Tina Marie: Restrictive airways. So you're getting less oxygen.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Tina Marie: What do we do when we get less oxygen?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Esther: We we tense up. The.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But we also yawn.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Esther: Okay.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Tina Marie: And so you're you're starting to try to recover from that tense.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Tina Marie: Feeling that you were feeling.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Esther: Okay.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Tina Marie: So. The things that are happening in your brain that you're feeling bad for because you give it power to it is a full physical response that you're feeling every single time that you have to battle every single time, as though the threat were real and present. Still, like you keep saying it's been 15 years like.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Tina Marie: When is it gonna you have to train your body. And your mind.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Tina Marie: To. Have a different script in your head.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Tina Marie: When you replay those scenes. So notice that it's stressful and say.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Tina Marie: I'm safe.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Tina Marie: I'm happy. I am in control.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Tina Marie: I can be calm. Breathe.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Tina Marie: And just. Breathe. And just think about being calm.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Tina Marie: And just think. I'm okay.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Esther: Okay. Oh, I think this is.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Esther: Okay. This is, oh, a lot of good stuff to chew on.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Esther: Because even the things. That I.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Esther: You know. Sort of decided for myself that I want, or I want to do.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Esther: Um. Sometimes end up becoming stressful for me.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Esther: And. I. And I think that's instead of.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Esther: Starting to connect the dots like instead of it, me pursuing them because. Their joys.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Esther: They warp into obligations.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Esther: Or warp into. You know. Um, I'm not doing anymore because I enjoy them.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Esther: Um. Like, I've set some sort of okay. For example, like.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Esther: You know I was. I love learning, languages.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Esther: Um. And then there was a stint a couple of months ago where I was dedicating a lot of time. To um.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Esther: Keeping up Emmy's mandarin. I was also dedicating a lot of time for me to learn Japanese, because I've always wanted to learn. But somewhere along the line, instead of it becoming enjoyment.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Esther: It like warped into. An obligation.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Esther: It warped into. Okay, like. I have to keep reaching.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Esther: I'm not getting good at this quickly enough. And it just.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Tina Marie: I was gonna tell you that, but you found it.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Esther: Yes, and and now and then, now I've. Put it down, because.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Esther: It warped. It doesn't bring me much joy.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Esther: And. Yeah.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Tina Marie: So what if one of the things. I'm sorry my lips feel really dry right now. I need some water.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Tina Marie: Part of my whole morning routine just got messed up. My daughter came in. She broke down, and I'm like, Okay.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Esther: You wanna go get some water, just go get some water.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Esther: Yep.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Tina Marie: I'm good. I'm good, but thank you. Um. And I used to get really stressed out about that, because I'd be like.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Esther: Sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna migrate upstairs because baby is.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Esther: Got it.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tina Marie: Um. I would just watch the clock and go okay. And and I did that. I still do it. But then I'm like, you know what.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tina Marie: It's okay, because no matter what happens, like worst case scenario, I have to tell you guys, hey, I'm going to be late. Um. But what I'm not gonna do is neglect my child when she's stressed out.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Esther: Yes, absolutely.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Tina Marie: So. One, and and I pick people in my life, Esther, that I know I'm safe to be able to say that to. It's not what I want to do. I want to be on time all the time.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Tina Marie: But. What I want most.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Tina Marie: Good, better best. The best thing I want is to be the best version of myself for the people that I care about when I'm there.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Tina Marie: So if I'm late I'm late, but when I'm there I am there. And I am present, and I'm giving the best version of myself.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Tina Marie: And um. So one of the the best words that you can learn is encroaching.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Esther: Encroaching.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Tina Marie: Right. What is encroaching.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Esther: Okay. Encroaching means.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Esther: To me it means something that is overstepping. My boundaries something that's creeping.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Esther: Yeah, creeping past the boundaries of what's. Acceptable.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Tina Marie: Right. So who gets to decide what the boundaries are for the things that you choose to do in your life?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Esther: Me!

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so. If you decide to adjust those boundaries and say.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Tina Marie: Mandarin. Language is encroaching upon things that matter more.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Tina Marie: But it is still important to me. But it belongs here, whereas my time.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Tina Marie: And my energy and my mood within my experience with my family belongs here. So.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Tina Marie: Having Emi learn mandarin, is part of enriching our conversation together and connecting her to history and culture and her people right.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Tina Marie: But these people in this house right now. Her feeling, her mood, my feeling, my mood. This is the present, and this is what matters most at this time.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Esther: Oh!

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Tina Marie: If. Making the most of this time together.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Tina Marie: Requires that we have less time with mandarin. Or maybe.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Tina Marie: It's less consistent, but it stays a love in our heart. Is that not better than having it, and then allowing it to say, but.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Tina Marie: You owe me 20 min today. Because.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Tina Marie: That's the rule we set. You get to adjust the rules.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Tina Marie: But more importantly. The boundaries and the scope, and so imagine that they're fluid, because, like willpower.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Tina Marie: Time and energy is finite. You can't make more of it.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Esther: Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Tina Marie: But other things come in that you can't plan and anticipate for. You get to adjust priorities on the fly. Nothing says that mandarin has to stay this level or Japanese, this level, or or anything dishes being done at night.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Tina Marie: Whatever thing feels like, it rules you. You get to say your rule exists to serve my best self.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Tina Marie: And when I'm my best self I serve the people and the things that I love. And serve and care for.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Tina Marie: Best. So.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Tina Marie: You decide the boundaries you get to change them. Day to day, even moment to moment, as you change.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Tina Marie: Ebb and flow.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: And if they're encroaching, you don't feel bad because they encroached into your space. You tell them.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Tina Marie: You go smaller. I won't.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Esther: Oh, okay, that's a very interesting. Concept because.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Esther: I felt like. Okay. So I think you know, let's just take mandarin, for example. Again.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Esther: Um. I felt, and I think you know, and mostly the reason.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Esther: I dropped it, or I didn't I. Stop being consistent with her about it, even though she was still kind of talking to me in Mandarin. Sometimes she would ask me to count.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Esther: You know, do things with her in Mandarin, but I didn't. Well, she still asked me to read books to her in Mandarin, which is fine. But our day to day, conversation.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Esther: I just found, and I know the reason that I. Kind of let it go, or I dropped. It is because.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Esther: I felt that. I wanted to prioritize.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Esther: The parenting. Um.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Esther: So it's very difficult to parent in a different language. When that language does not, the way that I learned it, and the way that I grew up with it.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Esther: Does not support. And I don't have the words, for I don't have the vocabulary, the words, or the expressions.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Esther: For the type of healthy parenting. That I want to.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Tina Marie: That makes sense.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Esther: Instill in her.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Tina Marie: Right cause. You never heard them.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Esther: Yeah, and even just things like, um.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Tina Marie: And the literal translations don't exist.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Esther: The literal translations don't right.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Esther: Um, and there are um. There are resources out there where there's a lot of um. Bicultural.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Esther: People. My age like. You know other Asian Americans who.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Esther: You know. Try to bridge that gap, and I've. Looked at those resources, but.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Tina Marie: Have you tried? AI?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Esther: At the end. Huh!

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Tina Marie: Have you tried? AI?

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Esther: I have. That's what I I use. I created a Gpt. That allow me to translate things appropriate for kids on the fly.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Tina Marie: That's so cool.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Esther: Yeah, so, and you know, but that also forced me a lot of the times. To stop what I'm doing with her because she's asking me, mommy, how do you say this? And.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Esther: How do you say this in Chinese. And I have to stop what I'm doing. Pull up my phone and look it up.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Esther: And I've tried so many different things from like shortcuts to things. And I just found that while yes, it added to the vocabulary. But.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Esther: You know it was disruptive to like the time that I spent with her. It was disruptive to just, you know, some of the ways that I wanted to parent. I mean.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Esther: Yeah. So that's why I kind of. I only have so much energy. And that's where I wanted to focus that energy is like, you know what.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Tina Marie: That's working.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Esther: I'm so. Figuring out this whole like.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Esther: Parenting. Thing, and.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Esther: English is still the language that I. Parent better, and and that also then allows me to be.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Esther: More in sync with my husband. You know. Like, if we're using the same language, if we're using.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Esther: Um. Yeah, that same vernacular. So it's consistent for her.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Esther: Um. Anyway. So that's 1 of the reasons.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Esther: Kind of like. Let it fall to the wayside. There are moments where I feel a little bit.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Esther: Guilty about it, because now, when I try to speak to her again, she like answers me in English, and I'm like, Oh, she's already doing what most people say they like started doing when they're teenagers. They don't answer their parents in mandarin anymore, but I've always had to kind of weigh in my head, you know.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Esther: What's more important, you know. Is it really the language.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Esther: Or is it really um? Kind of.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Esther: Raising her in a healthy way, like what we're really focusing on right now is boundaries. Boundaries, and.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Esther: Learning how to share. Those are our 2 main focuses right now. Um. So, yeah.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Esther: Anyway. Um, that's all to say that that's kind of example of what I I think I'm sort of. Trying to do what you're saying, that if something isn't.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Esther: You know, if it's encroaching. On a value, or if it's crouching on something, then it's okay to make it smaller or let it go.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Esther: For the for the time being. Yeah.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Esther: Mhm I think what I'm afraid of Tina is. Um.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Esther: Something that I had a lot of excitement for. Um.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Esther: You know something I had a lot of excitement for, and I was like doing. And then suddenly, like. 2 or 3 weeks later.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Esther: Um! It's become a chore. Like.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Esther: Why does that happen? How do I stop that. Um? Because how can I?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Esther: Really get anything done. If I.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Tina Marie: Well. Actually, let's put this in perspective for a minute, because it's not necessarily something bad happening. And I'll tell you why.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Esther: Okay. Okay.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Tina Marie: It's the same attribute that makes you think, hey? I might have Adhd. And this is a bad thing. So.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Tina Marie: We can be easily excited about certain things and want to dive into it. But then diving into it.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Tina Marie: Realize. All kinds of different things. It may be that you're making it a chore and giving it too much power, and that's all that it is, and it belongs in your life. It may be that.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Tina Marie: You explored it sufficiently for your brain, so. We talk about generalists and specialist.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Tina Marie: I'm a generalist and a reason why I can solve a lots of people's problems. I'm not an expert in tons of things. I actually think I do qualify as expert in some things, because I just go so deep into that. And most people don't. But that's the only reason that would make it expert, not because I know all the things I just know more than average, and that's all it takes to really be considered an expert right. If I know more than the average person, they can come to me, I can give them help.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Tina Marie: But really I don't go. I don't specialize in anything other than. Learning lots of things. So I picked them up.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Tina Marie: And in order for me to pick them up, I have to be passionate about them. Where they're not going to get my attention, because I've got too many things. I'm excited about.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Tina Marie: So everything has to excite me for it to even get on my radar. And if I'm excited about it I'm going whole hog. I will buy all the things and then find out. You know what I bought all those supplies, and I spent a lot of money and a lot of time, and I don't want anything to do with it.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Tina Marie: But guess what I know now. It's exciting. It's not for me. I only know it's not for me.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Tina Marie: Because I brought it in to try it out and try it on. So now I'm learning. I don't actually have to dive into everything to go. You know what? That's not for me. And here's how I know it's not for me, because I'm looking at the math.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Tina Marie: I do. My time blocks mentally. I've done them physically.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Tina Marie: And I know how much time things take, and I go. There's actually no room for you. If I bring you into my life, something has to go, because my day is full. If you bring something new in, I imagine your day's full. Something's going to have to go. That's just basic math.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Tina Marie: It was designed. That there was going to be conflict over your time from the beginning.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tina Marie: And it may be that something is comes in, and it's better than all the other things, but it may be you brought it in and go. You know what. I had the experience with you. Thank you for that. You enriched my life.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Tina Marie: But. I guess I don't really have time for you. If I'm going to keep all of these other things.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Tina Marie: And and it can be that. And so it could be a matter like I say, the good, better. Best thing it's not whether.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Tina Marie: Um. Things are good or bad for you, or right or wrong. Or you're too much or too little.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Tina Marie: It's just this spectrum of. What is the most.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Tina Marie: Good. What am I most happy with? And the fact that. Every. Yes, that you give. So if you fill up your day with 80% yeses to the good things.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Tina Marie: You have 20% yeses to give to the best things.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Tina Marie: But when we say yes to something we usually don't. Just be like, I'm just kidding. Never mind, because we feel too responsible and too guilty.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Tina Marie: So you have to be really cautious what you say yes to, because otherwise you bring the eventual guilt that's going to come in because you brought something in. When your day's already full.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Esther: Okay.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Tina Marie: What you can give yourself is permission to try new things and be passionate about, and go. You know what that is wonderful, but it's not for this season.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Tina Marie: I'm going to set you aside for the next season or. I have to finish a season with this thing that I'm doing first.st

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: And it could be a particular growth in raising the girls. It could be your own growth. It could be like for me. I've got school. I've got my mission. I've got. Raising teenagers. I've got client work like.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Tina Marie: Some things stay consistent, and some things have seasons, and the seasons change. So.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Tina Marie: Um. When something comes into my sphere, it may not be the time when I get to.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Tina Marie: Really fully engage and interact with it.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Tina Marie: But it may be when the love starts to develop and starts to grow, and I keep thinking about it and keep thinking about it, and I have to tell it. Not yet, not yet, not yet. But I didn't forget to. So if I could learn all the things I want to, I would have a Phd in psychology, in neuroscience and in quantum physics. I would know inside out Hebrew.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: Um, I would know mandarin. And I would know Asl and I would know Spanish those things. I want to know all of them. I cannot learn them all now. So mandarin is probably going to be the dominant language spoken in the world at some point. That's the trajectory we're on because of how many people speak mandarin, and the Chinese population.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if you know that, but it's been known for decades.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Esther: You.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Tina Marie: That that's the trajectory we're on. So.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Tina Marie: And that is not adjustment that you should go spend more time doing mandarin or anything like that. I'm just saying. That there is.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Tina Marie: Nuance to the the reasons we choose, what we choose. And I think you have a tendency to want to be very linear and very black and white, even when you know that that doesn't work because you were trained to do so.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: Good enough, not good enough, and everything was not good enough. And so it it encroaches right that old.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Tina Marie: Teaching. Encroaches, because.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Tina Marie: Maybe you didn't recognize how prolific it was. And.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Tina Marie: Now. You can start to identify.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Tina Marie: Cbt, right.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Tina Marie: What is this thought? And where is it coming from? And ultimately does it? Does it get back to? There's no logic for it, because again I'll go back to the standards who decides the standards. And by what metric? And where did that metric come from? It's.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Tina Marie: Arbitrary.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Tina Marie: They just chose it. And said, It is so.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Tina Marie: And you know that internally you know it. There is no basis for it. It's arbitrary. So if you start to go through and look at that and go.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Tina Marie: What is the metric I'm measuring against. And where did it come from?

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Tina Marie: What proves that is true.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Tina Marie: Nothing. Therefore it's arbitrary. I'm going to determine a new metric. And I'm going to start applying my metric as of today.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Esther: Okay. All right.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Esther: I think that makes sense. And there's a couple of things you said. That kind of stand out to me. One. You're right.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Esther: I'm very linear. I can be. I don't. I never like to. I never like to think of myself. As.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Esther: Black and white, but. Because I like to think of myself as someone who understands nuance. But.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Esther: You're right. I'm very linear to me. There's an. There's always like an order.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Esther: Or a way to do things like in my mind.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Tina Marie: A right or wrong.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Esther: A right or wrong, an order, a way to do things. Um. You know, setting the foundation for something first, st you know, and a great example would be the way that each of us learns like Fuji and his dad when they, a couple years ago, they were taking a few years ago they were taking flying lessons. Fuji just wanted to hop into the plane with a pilot.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Esther: And like, learn. His dad was like no.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Esther: I. That's not how I do it. I want to take a class to learn all the controls first.st I'm going to study the guidebook, you know. I want a foundation to know what I'm doing. I am very much more like his dad.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Esther: You know. And so for me, you're right there. In my mind there's a real linear way of doing things. Um, sometimes that.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Esther: Gets in the way of me moving quickly. Um, you know, versus getting to. Oh, okay, this has. These Xyz things have to be prepared.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Esther: Um before we can move forward, whereas. Fuji. He just goes, and he executes, and he will make his mistakes sometimes, and make them fast.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Esther: That's why the whole thing with the brain, MRI, really. You know, was the 1st time I ever saw him hesitate.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Esther: So much I'm like. I told him. This is very interesting, like I've.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Esther: Hardly ever see you hesitate like this. I've hardly ever seen you just like.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Esther: Be paralyzed and not sure what to do, or just. Hesitant and afraid.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Esther: Anyway.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Tina Marie: Can I tell you what? Why that was, though.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Esther: Why?

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Tina Marie: Because he didn't have power. It wasn't his.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Tina Marie: That was the problem.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Esther: It was someone else's. Product.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Esther: Right.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Tina Marie: Yep, that that was the only thing.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Esther: That makes sense.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Tina Marie: Because if he had owned it he would have done things differently. But he had to go through somebody else, and it tied his hands, and he didn't anticipate that, or take that into account.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Tina Marie: When he decided to do it. And and that was the issue that held him back constantly. He was not free.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Tina Marie: He was not autonomous.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Tina Marie: And. That's why it slowed him down.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Esther: Okay, that's good to know. Um. The other thing, too, is like what you mentioned. If you had your way you would have a Phd. In 4 different things, and know, like.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Esther: 3 more languages, and. That's how I am, too. I want to be an expert.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Esther: At everything I'm interested in. Um. But I think the truth is, I'm more like you. I'm a generalist. I'm not.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Esther: Maybe maybe that's true. I'm. I'm not suited for super deep, deep diving work.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Esther: I don't know. Well, I don't also don't want to say that, because I don't want to pigeonhole myself. But maybe that's also I don't know.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Tina Marie: Seasons, though, Esther, you're in a season that doesn't. Is not conducive to deep diving on anything other than being a mom. It's a very consuming season of life.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Tina Marie: That you chose. But it it's short. Emmy's interest in anything, and wanting you to teach her everything that is going to be gone before you know it.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Tina Marie: And not because you do anything wrong, and not that it's wrong. It's just. They tend to lean towards. And this is statistic, whether families are good or not.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Tina Marie: That they. Will lean more on their social network, and want to learn from their friends and their peers more than their parents. This is a very small window. It will be gone soon.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Tina Marie: So that's something to take into account, as you're going through things of the things that you want to teach her. But what does she want you to teach her. Because.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Tina Marie: Her wanting to teach you things, teach her things. That's a small window.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Tina Marie: And her being listening to you, teach the things that you want to. So. Kind of balance all of that out, but as young as she is, she will remember.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Tina Marie: What you gave to her, of what she wanted. If she wants mandarin.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Tina Marie: She may go back when she's an adult and go. I wanted my mom to teach me mandarin, but she wouldn't do it.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Tina Marie: That could be her interpretation of it.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Tina Marie: Now there's no knowing. So like I said, don't drive yourself crazy trying to. Figure out what everything's gonna be like in the future. Just know that.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Tina Marie: What she wants now, even at a 3 year old, will matter to her as a 30, 40, 50, 60 year old. The Emmy as an adult.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Tina Marie: She exists now. That.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Tina Marie: Part of her. Is still.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Tina Marie: It's the here now.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Tina Marie: And all of those memories are going to be formed around this nucleus that she is now. So.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't think you dismiss her.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Tina Marie: But be careful that they don't feel dismissed. Kids aren't really passionate about all of the things consistently so. If there is something that they are passionate about consistently. That's probably important to their beings.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Tina Marie: So you know something to think about.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Esther: Yeah, well, you know. And kids are constantly changing interest, too. Right? You know, we.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Tina Marie: Or adults. But yeah.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Esther: We're adults, you know. So. I think for me, I'm not gonna force it. If she wants me to read her book in Mandarin, of course I'll read her.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Esther: A book in Mandarin. I'm I'm not going to not read it to her, but. Again I feel that the more.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Esther: The effort that I'm putting into the most right now is. Breaking the generational traumas.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Esther: You know, showing her that. You know, mommy is gonna go for a massage and take care of myself.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Esther: You know um. And just like these things that I feel that are fundamentally.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Esther: So important to her being as a person.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Esther: More than. Her knowing how to speak a language that's great, like, you know.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Tina Marie: That's very complex. Also.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Esther: It's really, you know, and I know that there's a lot of people who um, and that's 1 of the reasons why we pulled her out of her. Her old school is because. We just felt that.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Esther: Um. The school wasn't enriching her.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Esther: In the ways that we wanted her to be enriched as a person. You know. Um kind of the values. That's why we put her in a Montessori school instead.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, that's so great.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Esther: And I was just like you know what um. You know. Yes, maybe some. Some people value the language and everything. But no, I.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Esther: It's very. It's, you know, it's important to me. But ultimately I need to accept that. Why is it important to me.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Esther: I have to think about. Why is it important to me. And that doesn't mean it doesn't have to be stopped being important. But I have to recognize, where does it truly fall? My list of priorities.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Esther: And my list of priorities is truly for my girls to.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Esther: Grow up emotionally healthy, well-rounded. Confident.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Esther: And. Those things are so much more important to me than them. Knowing the language.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so I want to be clear that I wasn't being like Esther. You should really teach her mandarin. That's not where I was going with that.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Esther: Yeah. No. No, I mean I know where, you know, and I've been told this my whole life right. That's why mandarin was so pushed on me.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Esther: Was because, like China is going to be a world leader. One day.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Tina Marie: No, no, no, no, that's I'm I'm trying to tell you. That's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying you should teach her.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Esther: Oh, no! No!

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Tina Marie: This is completely separate. That just happened to be. The topic it was around is that.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Esther: Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Kids kids. Their their level of interest and the the things that they want from us. And you're right, they change. But but so do adults. So um, just thinking like.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Tina Marie: They remember. What they're interested in. If they're passionate about something, you can still put it in a small container and go. Yes, I'll read this to you. 5 min, just 5 min, right.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Tina Marie: Or you know what I mean like so. You could still make it so much smaller, or just be like, I'll read it to you. How about this weekend? We do it so it's not no.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Tina Marie: You still really get to control the frame of it. But just considering that as she's growing like some of that interest.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Tina Marie: And it's a it's a consider us, or this is not a judgment. This is not. You should do something else. You you have. You're the only one that knows where all your time goes, where your energies, where where your priorities are, and you're going to be the best one to make those decisions.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Tina Marie: The only thing that I was offering, and it happened to be around that topic. But it isn't about you should do that.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Esther: Oh, sorry I'm not focused on that particular linchpin either, or any of.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Just wanted to make sure, because I'm like, the last thing I want to do is make add more judgment about not doing mandarin. I am not trying to do that.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Esther: Thank you.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Tina Marie: Just saying that even at 3 years old their personalities are beginning to come out very strongly, and they're. Their desires and their interests, and it may be something that she connects with you. It may be, mommy, this is the only thing that you and I do. That's different. That doesn't happen anywhere else in the world, and I love it because it's you and me.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Tina Marie: You know, I was just offering a little tiny. Child perspective, but I feel like I.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Tina Marie: I encroach, and I don't want to do that because you're working so hard.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Esther: Oh, no, that no, that's okay. I don't feel like you encroached.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Good.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Esther: I'm open. I'm open to all like thinkings and ideas and stuff, and. You know, I think it's very interesting, because.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Esther: When I. When I approached you for coaching.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Esther: One of the things you know, and the thing that I'm always trying to quote unquote, solve in myself. Is.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Esther: You know my feeling that I I just don't have the ability. To sit still and.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Esther: Commit to something. Um unless I give it a hundred percent of my time.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Esther: I can't. Let's be real like I. It's taking me a long time to come to the term. Come to terms with the fact that I cannot multitask. In my life like I cannot have.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Esther: 4 different things going on. That I'm dedicating my 4 or 5 different things. I'm dedicating myself to day to day. I cannot sit there and say I'm going to do an hour of this today, and then I'm going to do an hour of that an hour of that. There are some people who operate so well like that.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Esther: And they are able to use that to reach their goals, and it always frustrated me that I wasn't 1 of those that I don't seem to be like one of those people. I don't know what it is. Um!

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Esther: You know, but rather for me. If I'm interested in something, I'll go into it for several hours in a day rather than. You know I'm splitting my time.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Tina Marie: It's called a flow state. That's called a flow state, and that's a superpower.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Tina Marie: And a lot of people don't. Most people don't have it. They don't have the ability to sit in the flow. And what happens is this cumulative effect.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Esther: Okay. Mhm.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Tina Marie: And the depth that you're able to go. That's unique. So that's a superpower.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Esther: I think the I think my question is, I don't know how to. Like.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Esther: Harness it in a way. Where I can.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Esther: Achieve. I can reach my goals and achieve things.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Esther: That. Require consistent practice.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Esther: Right things like language learning, which I'm really interested in. But it's 1 of those things where.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Esther: Um. Like you get more like you improve.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Esther: Better or more, by. Daily consistent practice. But that's just not how my brain is wired. So yeah.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Sorry I've got a call coming up. Um! We're over, but.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Esther: Great. Yes.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Tina Marie: So um that we did the exercise of the things that sparked joy. But we didn't really spend time talking about it. So let's get into that.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Esther: Okay.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Tina Marie: And then also next week. What I would like you to do is write down the things that are goals and interests, and the things.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Tina Marie: And how you feel about them? Are they like. This would be fun. This would be cool if.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Tina Marie: Or I feel like I really need to do this thing. And make time for it. But I struggle with this like what are all of the things that you are.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Tina Marie: That that run through your head on the average week, week after week, after week after week. What are all of those things? Where does Esther get into judgment and.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Tina Marie: And friction and frustration over the same topics, week after week.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Esther: Hmm.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Tina Marie: Brain dump all of that. Don't!

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Esther: Okay.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Tina Marie: Judge, just. Vomit words.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Esther: Okay.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Tina Marie: And then let's come through and structure them, because. 1st of all, that is not going to be a 1 time conversation, that is an iterative conversation.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Tina Marie: This thing. Is your evolution. It's going to be lifelong.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Esther: Okay.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tina Marie: Um! There is no end zone. There is no target, there is no goal. There is just you creating the most enrichment for yourself.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Tina Marie: And being free to be yourself.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Tina Marie: And accomplishing the things that matter most to you.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Esther: Okay.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Tina Marie: You can't do other things. So start with that list. I'm going to go get this transcript and put it in the notes for you right away.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Tina Marie: Please do let me know if Fuji is going to be able to be there and be on time for the call later today. If not, we need to reschedule.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Esther: Okay? Bye.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Tina Marie: So I do also have a lot of things going on.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Esther: Okay.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Tina Marie: And um, we can reschedule if if we need to. And at the very least, though the things that you put together.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Tina Marie: Is a good starting point, and and jumping off point uh, either for your conversations together, or when we get started. So.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Esther: Okay.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Tina Marie: There's that. Um, and then, of course, you can use uh.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Tina Marie: Signal. If you have questions, comments, or you just wanna just kind of process things verbally.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Tina Marie: Um, and just kind of dump it there because it gives us a transcript. So you're welcome to do that also.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Esther: Okay. Yes.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Esther: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate it. Okay.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Tina Marie: I like talking to you. I hate that. I have to cut it off, but I got it.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Esther: Oh, no, that's okay.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Tina Marie: Manage that time, you know.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Esther: Um, but you always give me a lot to chew on. So yeah.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Tina Marie: You are great to talk to Esther. You're amazing, and I love getting to like.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Esther: Okay.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Tina Marie: Have these conversations with you, and. Anyway, it's a privilege.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Esther: Thank you, I cherish you.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Tina Marie: And I want to hug you. Okay.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Esther: Okay. See? You.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
