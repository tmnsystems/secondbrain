Any time I'm traveling, I'm like, Oh, I, I overbooked things, but also now with my school, her school, like college, my mission, all this stuff, I've got tons going on. And it's good, but there's just always a little margin of error. Yeah.

Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. get it. I get it. Good.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:01:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So, well, I, um, I sent an email out as a teaser and just the PS, and I'm just trying to pull up that email. there's already a couple of people that best say, Oh, excited to see what you have coming up. And it was like, like, very much a teaser. Hold on. trying to get to my darn Gmail account.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have one nail done. I was trying to figure out if I like this color. I like this one better. I know. Oh, that's so pretty. You have such pretty hands too.

It's a cat eye. Can you kind of see the stripes?
00:01:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can't, but if there's a way to make you.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just like a wavy stripe.
00:02:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. I like that.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's got metallic in it and like you put a magnet over it and it pulls it to the shape of the magnet and it changes.
00:02:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me now because I just put into top. Let's see. Like a wave?
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a little bit like across the, actually.
00:02:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Kind of, I'm gonna send you a picture.
00:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I took one and I was like and then I forgot to send it. Because I do not do a great job at nails, so the details are not.
00:02:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's my little bit of therapy and my creative outlet while I do it too.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus I can do whatever colors I want to. have bottles and bottles and bottles. have two nails drills. have two lights.
00:02:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like we have a whole nail station because my girls do their nails too.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And my 17-year-old, Emma, she's almost 18. We just got her signed up for beauty school and she starts on Monday. Oh nice. She's gonna be a tattoo artist.
00:03:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's incredibly artistic. So that's nice.
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got these girls. Alright, so people are excited what I didn't see your email today. I saw that you emailed that I didn't see what it was.
00:03:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, it was this uh, seen this year at 10 months, 1.2 million. Um, and there was another email yesterday subject line, same thing. Um, so look at that. So did you do six ingredients? Yeah, but it was just in the p.s. Someone deeply invested in helping on careers like he thrived, I understand important staying ahead of the digital landscape and building something that gives you time and money and freedom. Next week on Tuesday, I can't wait to reveal the opportunity involving done for you and with you to build and scale your online business that you feel called to serve that has a component benefit to you and your clients. It'll give you emotional support, social support, office support, system support, clarity and comments on your offer. What to do today?
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We come up. Yeah, I love it. Yeah. So I.
00:04:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I was just pulling stuff from our stuff in our conversation. So, so I think I'm going down a wrong path, so I'm glad we're having a call. So, there's this dude that has, yeah, there's this dude that has like this offer template that he used to close high ticket stuff and he just kind of sent them a dock like this on sort of a sales call. And so, I started to try and fill it out, but I was just like, I think being in his box, I'm not sure is working, but because his thing when he presents, some of the just clients is the promise, the problem, the path. So, he starts with what the promise is, right? And so, I like, you'll get everything you need to, and then you insert the benefits. So, here, you need to, you know, blank to outcome alcohol without the pain. So, I was having a hard time filling But a lie, because at first, was like, you get everything you need to have 100% clarity on your offer. I'm is that really like, we're doing so much more.
00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, sorry, maybe, maybe we just start from scratch with, yes, since, yeah, I got into anybody's boxes and templates.
00:05:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And yeah, maybe it just starts like this, right?
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the thing is, I just don't buy people's stuff and I don't follow their patterns because I know people really well, and I trust it. And I think that you will start leaning into it. I think like it surprises me how we'll see this carefully because we say things and it comes out wrong. I don't think you have an appropriate. level of confidence in yourself for your skill and ability. But I think that you also love learning and studying. And I think that that's a wonderful quality. But through this, you know a lot. And well, yeah, you have an appeal to people, you attract a certain amount of people that you you could just literally just have a conversation. And all you have to do is think about what is the conversation happening in their head and enter that conversation with them. So the ideal person who's ready to say yes right now, and this is going to be important because I got to quit looking at the screen because all the moving around is distracting me. But the important thing with the ideal person right now has several products or has been offered bring a particular service and getting a particular result for years. They have been helping others succeed, not necessarily like us making them millions, but have helped others succeed for years. They know that they can deliver a result. They know that they can make money. They know that offer. They might be in the launch habit. They might have launched different products, sold different products, or just sold their services and their time, little time trading time for money, because they either are not great at marketing, or they're not great at business and systems, or they're not great at either, which is the majority of people. They lack structure, they lack support. Biggest thing. is they can do for everybody else but not for themselves which is me too and you too. I'm amazing and I still can only do certain things for myself and certain things I can't. So if I don't get somebody to help then I'm going to struggle. So knowing that that's the case what we're going to do is build a support structure around them and there's two versions of it so the one is the original package and we're going to say you already know most of what you need to do. You just have a lack of clarity and confidence in what the offer should be and the fastest and simplest way to execute it. You may lack some of the market research you may not be clear on the offer or the offer structure. You may not be good at crunching the numbers in order to be able to calculate the best way. to go out building a sustainable evergreen offer. So it should be an evergreen offer. So let's definitely put some focus on to that. Let's escape the launch cycle and escape the madness.
00:09:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Stop the insanity!
00:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also we're building in 90 days of support. So veteran experts in the trenches with you support on boxer. You can access us. You know, I don't know how many days a week you're available.
00:09:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can promise five days week. I'm not available on Sundays.
00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I may respond on Saturdays, but I'm not obligated to.
00:09:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I would say that.
00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you know, response within probably eight, let's say eight business hours. So that excludes the weekends. I'm happy to respond within eight business hours because if we're talking about five o'clock at night, you're going to hear from me by, you know, 12 the next day.
00:09:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's eight business hours technically.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and in it so but but what you're going to get is we're going to do um and we can do a screenshot of a um a calculator one of your calculators are so much pretty oh my gosh I was jealous yesterday not really jealous but I was like I was impressed I was like yeah and it's not even envy because I'm it's not a negative emotion but I'm like I need that I want that because mine every time I show mine people like wow because it gets the job done but yours gets the job done beautifully oh my gosh beauty and maria like all that art that pictures that like anyway beautiful your beautiful because like it's cool because I think you're like your very auditory math and and I'm very visual actual oh okay and no no I'm actually more visual than anything got okay um When it's tactical, I need to see it.
00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to see it. So, but I am fast. And so if I can say it, I'll say it first, and if people can hear it, you know, I'll do that. So being able to say something gets it done faster versus creating and struggling. So pairing up with you is like, Every day is a new reason why I'm so glad I found Maria because it's going to be. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I'm hoping to bring the same to you. So, so we're going to. So let's send them a screenshot of like, we've got this calculator. It doesn't matter because the ideal person for us is not going to go try to do it by themselves. And again, we only need a couple of people to say yes. So if they get inspired by what we share and give away, and they go from self. Great. They'll remember that we talked. that matter, you taught them that. So we'll show them that we're going, that we have like an offer calculator that is like, we'll plug in real numbers and we can calculate in average cost per leads, target cost per leads. And we can say, we'll say caveat, we can't guarantee that this is what it is, but these are some average basic numbers that we've tested over and over again. And so as long as you've already been making sales, then we know that what you're offering has some validation. It may not be that you marketed, maybe it's been 100% word of mouth, 22 years, 100% word of mouth, and made a million dollars across five and a half years in coaching, working 10, 15 hours a week. So, you know, like, but isn't the type of thing that I could have gone and marketed mass level very well that I know of, probably. because I've ever had a gone through a lot of sales calls and a whole long funnel, because it's very difficult. It's been difficult for me to describe what I do for people because I'm a therapist. Like I'm so many people that you don't want to go make those claims anyway.
00:13:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Something is in my eye and it's driving me nuts.
00:13:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so yeah, so if you know that you can fulfill a service or a product for people and you have charged money for it and you have happy clients, but what you lack is an offer, an evergreen offer that maximizes and leverages your, each customer completely. Meaning you have complimentary and supplementary upsells so that you're increasing your average order value as well as your average lifetime value. If you've never built the marketing for yourself, if you've never had access. If you don't know how to write copy, if you haven't had a hook, if you haven't built up an email follow up sequence, so that when leads do come, you're giving yourself the best chance at converting them into a customer, knowing that back in the day it took five to 12 touches, these days it could take three years before somebody converts to a customer. So you want to build that system. We will architect that system and process for you with the numbers and help you figure out how to execute it, who you need to hire, give you access to our road exit people that you need to hire, but we will simplify it. So if you're prone to say, but I got to go get a new YouTube channel, and I got to go create a new brand, and I got to go get a new domain, we're going to tell you stop the insanity. Let's not use that phrase. Let's come up with that version of that, which will be great for us. and then tell them that we're going to help you focus on the minimum Bible product and why would you do that? First of all, because we don't know what we don't know and every offer that has worked has its own kind of magic. You almost always stumble onto it. But there is a pattern for increasing the likelihood of stumbling onto that. Now, that might sound a little scary because there's no guarantee. But you don't need to have a knock it out of the park $15 million a month product. You just need to get to maybe it's $10,000 a month, maybe it's $15,000, maybe it's $20,000. the likelihood that you can get to that given the size of the audience, giving the quality of the market, giving, given all that we know and the fact that all of the ad platforms want you to keep putting their money. money and then they want to give you some of your customers. And knowing that you've already told us that you have the ability to deliver a successful result to people, we're pretty confident that if you meet these these parameters, we can build something for you that like top to bottom and plan out and not out. So additionally, we'll give you 90 days of support. So if you run into issues and you have a question, you get both of our brains resolving it as quickly as possible. This is what we do all day long. This is what has generated tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions between the two of us and our clients. And if you want us to do it for you, $4,000 extra, we will take care of it. That's how confident we are that that this can be built and that this is simple. And then you will have it again. can't guarantee how much money it's going to make. We can guarantee you'll be much closer to success and having the thing that will make you money on a regular basis once you've gone through this. There is no shortcut to success. The work is that you have to build it, you have to test it, you have to refine it until it works. So no amount of thinking and planning and studying all of the gurus is going to get you any closer until you do it. If you're not doing it by yourself, why don't you do it with us? So you're going to invest time and money into success. You can't get more time, there's 24 hours in the day. How much have you accomplished during your 24 hours over the last six months year? How long have you been thinking about this planning this? What are the odds that if you've been thinking about this for years that you're suddenly going to have something in the next 90 days on your own? So, you can't collapse that time and turn that into three years from now in 90 days, but what you can do is leverage money to use our time, our brain, our resources to essentially collapse that time, think about a tesseract and a wrinkle of time, right, to leapfrog ahead and now, and I got goosebumps, 90 days in, you've got something more than you've ever had before. Yeah. That's what your money is going towards. Your money is not going to guarantee success because it doesn't exist. If you do it or redo it, there's no guarantee. Now, do you want to risk that money? Don't do it if you don't want to do it. We don't want your money. But if you know that you have better odds with expert success and support, expert support and planning and structure, if your heart is telling you, this is the thing I've been waiting for. you're If Yeah. Then you're for us. If that's that doesn't happen and you want to get on a call with us and have us convince you it please don't bother me please don't fill up my form I don't want to talk to you that this isn't for you like yeah we are called to serve this is inspired we know it we feel it and whoever it's for is going to feel it too yeah so if you can't stop thinking about this offer at night and when you wake up in the morning then you should be filling up the form of talking to us because this was for you I like it yep that makes sense cool okay so why don't when we hang up I get the record of that and then I'll put it in just a fresh doc like because yeah I already I just started a fresh google doc and I just kind of as you can see the screen here I just copied what I had from the PS and the email that I wrote yesterday so yeah you know You could do too. Do you have testimonial videos of things that you've done for people with your different like micro offers or anything else?
00:20:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, like you mean like of like different people saying how much money they made or what they got tons of them.
00:20:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what if we ran our testimonial videos through like opus and it can get the script with the of the script the script. You know how it pulls out these little pieces like these little clips in highlight reel and it puts in the captions. Captions? Yes. Yes. it could go through and the highlight for us really easily those particularly like really good clips and we could put together a little bit of a montage of testimonials of people that highlight different things that we've done for them because when you stack Maria did this this this and this for me and there are very specific types of issues and that solved and then Tina did this this this and you look at that whole package compared to the claims that we're making they'll be like all those different people validating all these claims that they just made so but either and this is the beauty of the Holy Ghost it's what it is the job of the Holy Ghost is to be a witness of the truth of all things period so a person doesn't have to know that the Holy Ghost exists for him to do his job it is the blessing of being a child of God that Heavenly Father has given that to us he wants his children to be successful he wants them to be provident and independent he doesn't want them to be poor he doesn't want them to be enslaved financially by by any of those things and so If we're speaking the truth, a person who needs to hear the truth and is worthy to receive it, which the level of worthiness is not Christian so many times and so many people will be like, you got to be this, like sin free, none of us are that, none of us are that. Anyway, the level of worthiness is basically have a good heart and not be trying to do bad things to bad people, just try to be a good person, that's really it. And so I trust that that witness will be out there and that a person is going to feel it. So all we have to do is speak to them be like, if you're feeling that, you got that like little flutter in your chest and that excitement and then it keeps going with you and you're not going to put yourself in detrimental risk by making the investment. If you can't afford this, you know, you're to put yourself at risk, please, please wait, we'll come up with an, you can reach out to us, we'll come. come up with an offer that works that might be slower, but a little bit more secure financially for you. And let's come up with that. we can basically give them the template, but that done for you. You know, yeah, anyway, that's what I'm thinking. What do you think?
00:23:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, yeah.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did work. I just know how many followers going to give us like, we're going to have fun together. We're going to make some magic for somebody who deserves it. And you're going to get the money that you need. I'll get money will like, and that's just resources for us to give more blessings to other people.
00:23:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, no, I love it. I love it. I was like, you know, it funny. I was even looking at like way back machine, some old, old stuff, like, like, I used to have this ultimate consulting challenges, literally from 2000 with that 2009, right? this is very old school stuff. But sometimes when I write this, I'm like, damn, I helped this guy make $66,000 for his first client.
00:24:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was almost a confidence boost for myself again, right?
00:24:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is really good stuff, know? had all these things here, right? And I didn't buy any of other people's products. just wrote, you know? I mean, very non-Facebook compliance.
00:24:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is all about money but at the same time, that's how a lot of sales letters back then were written, right?
00:24:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But still, I was kind of looking at actually I was looking back on to the quick start guide, all the stuff. So yeah, anyways, was reviewing a lot of this.
00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Facebook compliance and as well as Google compliance gives us a gift of a little bit of protection because any of those claims, the FTC can come breathing back and just destroy your life.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:24:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So I'm going to, I think we're done, unless you want anything else to talk to, because once I get the recording of this, I'll just kind of put it all into a dock. like that. And so are you thinking that we should do like maybe then a... Zoom call with with people next week, just invite whoever wants to jump on to talk about who you got this exciting offer.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I think that would be great. Um, let look at my calendar.
00:25:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think they they've never been my people. don't know who you are and vice versa. So I think seeing the two of us together will be pretty powerful as well.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. Um, next week. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, I always keep Friday's open. My Friday is wide open and the next Friday? Yeah.

00:25:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay. So we can do that. Are you, um, Yeah, let's just take to the fourth because that way we can just like, you know, we start setting people to sign up for it and stuff. the meantime, obviously still have a Google Doc ready to send people. As well, but what time on the fourth works for you.
00:26:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

How many are East Eastern Time Zone?
00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

I don't know, just, but also I have lots of space in my day, lots of quiet time, like I never, as much as there's a lot going on, there are pockets of peace throughout the day, every day, always. I never do anything busy all day long, it's just not really good for myself. I went to the gym last night, I'm going to send you this picture of my cute little 14-year-old man. She doesn't know what he took the picture, I stole it. She leg pressed 415 pounds last night.
00:28:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.
00:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did it too, by the way. Yay! I've been going to gym for a year. Ooh, study. And she doesn't know what it is. And she's so cute. And she was just, she's feeling good today, I thought she's going to be sore, because she was really sore, she's like, I'm so cute. proud of myself. I think I don't like she did. Did amazing. So that was joyful.
00:29:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then my friend Stephanie was going to come over and work. So what I'm working on is so I built my own GPT and gave it some instructions for cleaning transcripts of my bottom calls. So it's able to quickly recognize speakers. So it removes everybody but me. And then it removes anything that's personal and only keeps any business up in there. And so we're going to copy and paste that out of each of the calls and then put it into a Google Doc because the custom GPTs, you can only feed it 10 files and I don't know how big they are. But anyway, it's going to be a Tina bot. So I'll be able to ask questions like, what are some of the processes that Tina has described and outlined? And because I don't even remember all the things I tell people sometimes. And I could say, what does she say about that's what you say about that and it will go write an article like let me share my screen hold on second there they go this that's actually cool gpt and i got i gotta sign into the right account first hold on oh that oh yeah log out um yeah i want to see that we can have two chat gpt accounts so that i can have a team working in one and i work with the other and i get it you get my authenticator authenticates oh there you are think this is it oh oh oh Okay, do you see my screen?

Okay. So I. All right. What the thing I told it to do first? Oh, so we're coming up with a content plan. Let's just start with this. So, um, what's the next? Okay. Right. Right. That's peace. So we came up with a content plan. Or 100 days of content. The sound from my ear. Um, but breaking it up into basically three repetitive sections. Cause I don't want to take a hundred days to go through everything. want to get through all of my main topics. I teach people what I do over the course of 30 days, so it's fresh, and then I want to do an iteration of that same content, again, the next 30 days, and then the next 30 days. So, did I? No, I'm in the wrong GPT, I think. Maybe. All right, well, it hasn't been fully tried, but let's ask it a question. What can we ask if we could just ask a question, or a piece of content? It's going to be so much better, so I'm excited to see the difference too. Let me think of something Oh, let's let's do let's do an extraction. Oh, wait, it doesn't have everything. It has a few things. Um, let's know about what you can describe for a particular. gosh, I hate when it does off.

I like this. So I believe that efficiency isn't about getting more done. It's about getting the right things done. The things that move you closer to your version of an extraordinary life. That's why the system works. It doesn't just optimize your business. It optimizes you, your time, your energy, your passion are too valuable to waste. Try it and tell me I'm wrong. I dare you.

So like if you are, if you have a bunch of recordings, we could run it through some transcripts, a service and then build a Maria GPT. Yeah, which, because then it can help you just write some pieces. Like you could give it a specific thing. Like, so I don't think it's got enough of the data now, but I have described, I've described, let's see. I don't think it, I don't think it has it, but, um, simple funnels, you know, like, how you would attract a new customer, um, they're looking for, some like marketing principles.
