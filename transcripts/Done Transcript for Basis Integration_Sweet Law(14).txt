00:00:02 - mark sweet
Okay, Tina, can you hear us? No, Tina's unmuted.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:00:10 - mark sweet
I'll see your videos on.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's okay.
00:00:13 - Dan Ryan
I'm just doing that more now. Same thing.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, everybody's here. Oh, go away. All right, sorry about that. But you did separate the meetings. Are you hearing?
00:00:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
You've freed this out of Lauren. Oh, we sold Dan so he can laugh.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's funny. Yeah.
00:00:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Makes you feel better.
00:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
bunch of Sure.
00:01:01 - Dan Ryan
I should send you the AIS summaries of some of our meetings because the summaries are ludicrous.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, that is not what we said.
00:01:09 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. Yeah. And it like in one of, um, Stacy's husband's name is Warren. But his nickname is Renault. So like I always call him Renault. I've always known as Renault and it translated that to Ronald and we started talking about Ronald. So we just call him Ronald now. We're like, how's Ronald?
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. I was so stressed out. was physically ill. Oh my gosh. Anyway. Okay. So, um, this is why we separated the calls in case I ever make a setting that I haven't considered what will happen. And if I do that, 63 and so that's what it is.
00:02:04 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So two things I really want to make sure that we talk about. I'm just saying on the upfront, so we can come back to if we need to. PPC on our own name, because it's an issue with Sweet James. I know, but we're losing clients because of it and it's frustrating. It's also way that we could potentially pick up clients relatively cheaply, but I need to make sure that we do it perfectly because we know that Steve is relatively so happy.
00:02:33 - Dan Ryan
Right, so they're not doing it perfectly. They're doing it in a way to not do it perfectly.
00:02:42 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right, and it's going to be somewhere on the radar, so I don't know if want to start it right now or, you know, start putting things together and do it in a month, but it's frustrating when I Google our name and their number one. In PPC, obviously, you know, organic's organic.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, but it just takes me off. All right, well, I have to switch the strategically. Thanks. So I'll, I'll switch.
00:03:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I just Google sweet lot. Yeah. Yeah. There's one sponsor. And I understand sweet laws on sweet lawyers. Fine. That's okay. Our thing on Google pops up to the side of us. Showing up the local.
00:03:32 - Dan Ryan
What can't you show up for him, I guess?
00:03:34 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
we know? Or we don't know until we.
00:03:38 - Dan Ryan
That's it.
00:03:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Sweet lawyer, sweet attorney. Just sweet and James put together.
00:03:45 - Dan Ryan
No. Got it.
00:03:48 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Everything else is pretty much on the table. Because we do go by suite of lawyers, sweet libraries, attorneys.
00:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about sweet justice, wasn't that. right. like trademarked or something.
00:04:01 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, don't do sweet justice.
00:04:03 - Dan Ryan
Oh my god, who or who was that?
00:04:06 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
We tried to do it at one point, because everyone tried do this version of like, get sweet justice. Steve is suing Rafael Sweet over it now. I don't know if that ever ended or not. Rafael didn't have last name sweet, but like stepdad might have had that last name at some point, and he changed his last name to be sweet to try to pick up the cases. Yeah, so they're in some weird fight. So, you know, Sam Sweet, Samantha Sweet, Tyler, Tyler Sweet, know, all the other trainings, all the case manager names. We don't have anyone named James, so I think we're fine with that.
00:04:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um. Who does those campaigns, Dan?
00:05:03 - Dan Ryan
Me, I'm doing it right now. Like, just tell me what we can't do and I'll go. So I'm going to try out bidding first. See how that goes.
00:05:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I imagine they're very expensive.
00:05:18 - Dan Ryan
You wouldn't know. But that's typical. Well, I mean, they say it's not an auction, but it is an auction.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we'll see. Yeah, if there's nobody there right now, there's more than one sponsored spot. So would that not suggest that we're not getting one at all?
00:05:38 - Dan Ryan
Correct. Now we're there. We're just not number one.
00:05:42 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
He's number one. I don't see us at all, of course, we love.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're kidding.
00:05:47 - Dan Ryan
Really?
00:05:48 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely there. incognito, and I just typed in sweet love. And sponsor just for James, then organic is all us.
00:05:59 - Dan Ryan
OK.
00:06:00 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And then the lower sponsor on the bottom of the page is Charvidean Law Firm and Addison Menon Dew. Page two is Sweet James again, then Drake Law Firm, then California Injury Law Firm. And then it's bottom of the second page, GKB Lawyers, Help J&Y Law, and Brown Day, whatever, I don't know.
00:06:25 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, so there's two. So I'll, right now, like just, I'm just gonna increase the bid and see what that does. So there's two metrics that we wanna look at. There's, the metrics would be search impression share, which means every time, and I'll go like specific, right? I'm gonna go after sweet law, sweet lawyers, whatever. So I'm gonna try to, I'm gonna try to separate them. Yeah, So, yeah, right, but so there's two metrics. The Search Impression Chair, which means, hey, granted, this isn't totally accurate, but this isn't what it's supposed to mean, every time. So if I go more targeted, so I can say, hey, I'm going after sweet law. It will say, hey, your Search Impression Chair is 80%, which means however many times it was typed in, it had only showed 80% of the time. So that's metric one. So you can never get that to 100. mean, you can, but you really can. But you can get it at 98, right, because that's what I do for myself. Then the other metric is absolute top. So it will tell you, hey, showed up 98% of the time for this term, and your absolute top was 70, or your absolute top was 80. what you want from here in this correctly is you want 100, 100. You want to be number one every time for.
00:08:00 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
for these keywords.
00:08:04 - Dan Ryan
Okay, so it's just going to be a matter of like, how to get there, right? There's two ways to get there. Potentially one is just straight out bidding, but it is an auction. So you can't always win on that. And the other is to change the ad type, which is, I forget what it's called, but it's basically the absolute you're saying, I want to show up number one all the time. So right now, all the things are built around the, the traditional keyword thing and you can get there that way. But if that doesn't work, then you switch odds, or he's not running the second one. So if we can't win by out bidding, then we'll try to win by, by, by absolute top. So I just adjusted the bids and what is the matter?
00:08:52 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like you can step against last battle and incognito, JP dash law.net. And then again, sweet James, then we're not.
00:09:03 - Dan Ryan
So then you've got to break it up by states, right, which they are actually, because I want to see we just Seattle, Washington, right, I just typed in Seattle, just because I want to show up. Oh, no, that won't. Yeah, no, you have to. You have to change your IP. There's a way to do it through. I don't know if there's an R. It might be. There might be. No, there is. You literally have to go in through the code and you're like, you get an IP address that you know is Seattle, and then you punch it in through like the code inspector or there might be an ad on for it, but I don't think there is because that's a little too. You agree. I got it. Hackery. Redo. Let's see, it'll allow you to switch your IP with a plug and with an extension. don't think they would cry, people We can enable the VPN. Exactly. There's also the thing where you get an IP and you stick it in through the code of the browser somewhere. forget how to do it, but I used to do it. Yeah, so we can do what we'll see. I'll just raise the bid. That's the first line of attack, and we'll see if works.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. More than incognito, you might try it with VPN from different locations, because like, this is my search, and I just put in TweetLab. Is this sponsored right here? Damn. That's Google in my business, right?
00:10:52 - Dan Ryan
No, that's sponsored.
00:10:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. sponsors for whatever reason?
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what this probably actually might. No, you know, I see sponsors stuff. then I did Sweet Law, Seattle.
00:11:10 - Dan Ryan
Right, so your GMB won't show up because it knows you're not in Seattle.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but I mean, that's how you would know your in that it sees you as Washington is the GMB would show up.
00:11:25 - Dan Ryan
So that's one way to confirm that you're viewing Washington. Right now, you're viewing a search for Seattle.
00:11:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, these aren't sponsored, but you show up on top for me here.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I mean, it's never going to be the same. when I'll do is like the branded campaigns.
00:11:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just, you know, you're in Oregon.
00:12:00 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
have it.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm pretty sure.
00:12:01 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What wouldn't? Yeah, since I forget your location, we obviously aren't doing much of anything for organ.
00:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:11 - Dan Ryan
No, right. So you'll show you're gonna only show up as like a result as a SERP, not as an ad. You shouldn't see any ads.
00:12:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. I don't. And I guess that's why then, huh, that none of these would be because they're not do. Well, does sweet James not do organ?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan
No.
00:12:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what's okay? You said you wanted to talk about two things.
00:12:46 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That was one. So prior to that medical office.
00:13:00 - Dan Ryan
So not sweet love.
00:13:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She starts in like, uh, if we have some time, but just trying to keep that ball rolling.
00:13:13 - Dan Ryan
Well, what would, like, what would you want to see? I guess it's like, so usually you got what's the MVP, you know, like what's the MVP that we're targeting? Like, I don't really know. Uh, so we'd have to like define the MVP and then, you know, really don't understand like what the pipeline is, right? So they have a pipeline. don't know what the pipeline, I'll give you example, right? So I just built this out for a paintless dent repair company in Texas. So the dude, I would do it on the inside. And then I just talk to that guy and I talk to him on the phone, but mostly email. And I go, send me the paperwork, send me stuff. stuff that people fill out that are like that's lead oriented right not mess well it's both it's like internal stuffs of stuff they have when someone comes in and then stuff they use when they're in and then I go okay explain the process to me explain the process of closing a lead and from that he tells me oh we got a lead and then we get in contact with the lead then they book an appointment they show up for the appointment we send the info to the insurance company if the insurance company approves it then we schedule them to drop off the car when the car is dropped off we order parts and then when the parts are in the thing starts the repair starts and then he's like then then the first part of the repair is they take out the headline or a ba-ba-ba so I listen to the right so he's got like 30 steps and I go okay so insurance company says yes drop off car, that's the end of the first pipeline. And he's like, yes, I don't get great. So then the insurance company approves, drop off cars that start with the next pipeline, the quote unquote repair pipeline. And then repair is drop off car, order parts, parts are in that moves them to to tell the dude to rip out the headliner, wherever the hell that step is. Headliner's done, then they give it to the tech, the tech does the dense, and then they wait for the insurance company to send a check, and then they then they contact the person to schedule the pickup. Yeah, okay, great. And then that's the next pipeline, the pickup is the last pipeline. So they ended up having five pipelines, lead, repair, pickup, review, right, then they try to get a review, and then referral, there's this referral pipeline. I got all that from like three emails and two documents that he sent over. And then the documents that he sent over showed me, oh, you get the make model and year of the car. You get the insurance company name, you get up, up, up, whatever. Then I use that to go in and create all the custom fields. So like I was saying last week, it's like, you have the toolkits there. Some of the 's already built, you're going in and then adding the stuff that's unique. You don't have to go in and build. Hey, let's build texting people.
00:16:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That's built.
00:16:32 - Dan Ryan
You have to build in when you're going to text them, what you're going to text them, what that flow is. And you build these pipelines. So we need to understand that I need, we need that information from like inside the office now, but that's going to come from Chona. Great. If we can get some of that stuff in advance so that we can look at it and go, all right, here, the most important thing is like this, the pipeline. in the communication. And then understanding where they're sort of falling down right now. So with these dudes, as an example, nobody answers the phone. So it's like, you guys have 500 in phone calls that nobody answered. Like, why does nobody answer the phone? Oh, we can't. It's too loud. Whatever. I'm like, for real. So why do you even have an F and phone number? Like, really? But I saw that and I go, okay, great. I built an automation that tells them, hey, we can't come to the phone right now. We're going to text you. And then it texts them one of four things they could be calling about or other. And it says respond with the thing that you have. And they'll respond or leave a voicemail. And if they leave a voicemail, I know it left a voicemail. And then it triggers a notification to someone on the team and says, hey, someone just left a voicemail because, and then we look get listen to the voicemounts and be like, what are they doing? Are they all doing the same thing? OK, we can modify this. The other people will be like, I need a quote. If they say, quote, then that goes to the sales guy. And the sale actually goes to a sales automation. And it goes, hey, I see you need a quote. What year card do you have? And it starts this whole thing. So it's like you need someone on the inside to answer questions, right? And we're coming in saying, I don't know how this works. I know that you need a system. I just need to understand what the system is for. So how do we get all that info? Because the software is sitting there, right? It's just like, we don't know what to turn it into.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So with the first step, then not be you creating a list of questions and maybe kind of templatize it based off of your automation.
00:18:54 - Dan Ryan
I mean, I know there are no automations. Right? Everything. Some stuff's reusable. Like you can do like a text back automation. Yeah, that's totally reusable. They're not going to, they don't even do that right now. It's really like, tell me, tell me how a lead works. Like do they even get leads, right? I don't even understand that aspect. Is it a lead or is it already closed?
00:19:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
These are like closed people. So where it's coming from, patients aren't finding them really on their own. It's generally speaking, a lawyer or another doctor sending them over.
00:19:32 - Dan Ryan
OK. then they're like a hundred percent. They don't drop off or it's like it's a done deal.
00:19:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Not they're just going through the step.
00:19:40 - Dan Ryan
Well, there's no lead step. There's no leader conversion thing.
00:19:43 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's just service or whatever. So the person sends over John Doe. Then office calls John Doe. Sets up a time for the consultation while that's happening. law office or sorry doctor's office sends out lean paperwork or John Doe to sign law from the sign that's how doctor's office gets paid. Doctors office then reach out to if there was a first doctor first doctor for whatever medical records they may have there is no first doctor fine.
00:20:26 - Dan Ryan
How do they know how do they know if there's a first doctor?
00:20:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
When you're talking to the patient or if it's coming as a referral from a doctor Okay. Yeah doctors office sending it over you it probably already has.
00:20:44 - Dan Ryan
Right so like the first question is how do you get these right so if marks if mark sweet sends one over how does that come if a doctor sends it over how does it come if I guess that's really the only two right here. So then it's like How does that happen? And then this is how I would, this is how I would want it to happen. I would want Mark to fill out a form and say, Hey, here's, the referral. Want the doctor to fill out the form, like to be a doctor form, there'd be a lawyer form. Ideally. Then the question is, how plausible is that?
00:21:24 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, it's plausible to build it. client website, right? That like, they just, if you'll have access to you, they just fill it out quickly and can upload the records that for some of them, they might do it. mean, some people still won't, but if we can cut down on, you know, 50%, that's great.
00:21:42 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, so it's apparently it's all HIPAA compliant. But I mean, doesn't even need to be HIPAA when all they're entering is their name, email and phone number.
00:21:52 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, because we asked them to upload any records they may have.
00:21:56 - Dan Ryan
No, no, no, but they wouldn't do that until later, right? It's a lead that.
00:22:01 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, because that's the relationship that's being created or whatever.
00:22:08 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, that's fine.
00:22:12 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
But for the first meeting, usually a virtual assistant reaches out to gather basic information about the patient.
00:22:21 - Dan Ryan
Right. So you're saying, so it's like, we'll just call that a lead or it's a new, new patient, right? New, we'll say new, new patient comes in. Yeah, new patient comes in and then the first thing you want is then to book an appointment for the next step. So you're going to try to do that automatically. You're going to try to send them a text, ideally send them a text, going to try to be a text, AI probably. So you'd have this AI bot go out trying book an appointment and then that's going to try for whatever period of time. I don't know how we determine that. I mean, you're going to only contact them during office hours, right? So someone said, sort of at seven o'clock at night, it's not going to try, oh, maybe it would, maybe it would go to like eight o'clock at night, wherever. then it's going to start up in the morning and it's going to try to book them or like yours does. And then it's like, hey, if this thing doesn't happen, then you're going to tell Tracy, hey, this lead needs to be thought up with manually, or you're going to build something that lets sort of like what I was talking about building for you, which is they try manually and then they trigger another automation. And then they know that it's in that automation, but so whatever. So there's something that is sort of worked out by doing it and you go, hey, this work, this didn't work. So let's say, all right, appointment's booked. And then it's like, okay, appointment's booked.
00:23:50 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Do they show up?
00:23:52 - Dan Ryan
Right. if they show up and they do the thing, then they go to the next step. If they don't show up, then they go backwards to need to be re-booked. That's an automation and automation takes over and says, hey, sorry, you missed your appointment. But let's get you rescheduled to whatever.
00:24:09 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Before this, we're to the reminders of your appointment day before hour of a week.
00:24:14 - Dan Ryan
Oh, yeah, yep, totally. Right, so the tiniest point, that's like a pre-built thing. That you just reuse because it's an appointment reminder thing, tech specs pre-built, but the other ones, the more specific ones are not pre-built. I mean, they're not cut and paste.
00:24:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Let's put it that way.
00:24:33 - Dan Ryan
From stuff we can cut and paste and tweak, but they're not pre-built. There's some pre-built recipes, if you will, the other ones that are not. All right, so then it's like, they do the thing and then it's upload your docs or something like that.
00:24:50 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Wait, no, no, the records have to be created. So the doctor has to actually write the records how that may be. Yeah, firmly templates that we can use into that or obviously is going to take more time. That's not something you or I can do.
00:25:19 - Dan Ryan
It depends. Like if it's like a one sheet read to the the PDR guys, it turned out the bulk of their was on one piece of paper. It was kind of pluji, but I was like, oh yeah, that could be a form or that could be fields that the admin uses and check check check.
00:25:37 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, no, yes, no.
00:25:38 - Dan Ryan
So it depends what that looks like.
00:25:41 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So it's going to import over obviously the name, date of birth, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, the initial notes, the VA is taking meaning the complaints by weight, stuff. Then we've got the notes from the doctor who's doing the actual appointment. which probably falls into four or five different things, and then pulling in from the records if they had that before. So what I mean is, let's say they sort of saw a chiropractor and had an MRI system. Those MRI results we get pulled over into the template.
00:26:18 - Dan Ryan
What's the result? that like the imaging or the imaging report?
00:26:25 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
The report.
00:26:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The interpretation of what the doctor saw like there.
00:26:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Between the L2 to L3, there's a three millimeter display between L4 and L5, there's one of them.
00:26:38 - Dan Ryan
Right, but that wouldn't need to exist as like menus within the contact record. You just attach the report to the contact record.
00:26:48 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That part would need to go into the report that all right. That part mean as an example. I'll do these records because I think he does it pretty much basically like out names and any type of identifying your information, just so you get an idea what I'm talking about.
00:27:10 - Dan Ryan
Yes.
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. I was thinking about when you were doing this. This is what we were talking about using a I for. And it was this exact process also because he asked the right reports differently for different people, different attorneys want different. Like, anyway, a little bit like he's got this one that's a real pain. He said, because he's always complaining about this, that or the other thing. And so does your, would your office have to? I mean, I would imagine that there's going to be new ones to the way that the report has to look.
00:27:51 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Correct. But if you have to use the template part where they can go and tweak it from there, right at the starting point where they can tweak and be more efficient.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I mean, and I don't know what the scope of that conversation that you would want to have here is, but what I was suggesting to Fuji is we can use chat GBT4O basically to feed some of the conversations and it could be redacted if needed to be for feeding it, because I don't know if using chat GBT with this information would be considered a violation because your paid account should be private, shouldn't be sharing anything. But either way, even if you have to redact my personal information basically, feed the conversations back from different attorneys who have said, okay, I need this, I need that, I need this, and here's why that type of thing. So that it basically profiles and trains for like you can pick up at their specific patterns that they keep asking. or so that we can kind of template according to their preferences, and there still has to be human factor involved in this every time. But if the system can reduce how much that has to happen and templatize as much of it as it can, including prompting the human to say, make sure you check for this, this, this, and this for this particular person, then you kind of have streamlined that process. So there's, it's a little less time, but the other thing is less mental fatigue because so much of it is guided, templated, assisted, which means that their likelihood of error would be reduced, not just because of the system, but I mean, the secondary impact of the system is because they're not so fatigued. They can they can just have less error because they're just not as tired if that makes sense. don't think I'm being very clear, but.
00:30:08 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, look, the more things that we can automate and more than we can take brain power off to someone better. Exactly. The copy also is interested in trying to figure out how to have a better scheduling service because they are really, really busy in terms of amount of PT volume they do, there's a good therapy on telemed.
00:30:30 - Dan Ryan
And so they had ways to.
00:30:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Really getting back and forth, especially with the lawyers, they're interested in seeing what else they can do and they'd want to be part of it. So may I already have a first point?
00:30:43 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, it's all a matter. mean, so we're doing it right now. It's like, oh, yeah, let me see that doc. And then, like I said, some stuff, some stuff you might have to build on your own, right? But it's like an. Integrative app. It's like this. You're you're building your own dedicated app. So like The a reporter builder as an example would probably be An app that you build and you're saying oh, hey, I want to take data from the contact record that we've collected and I want to merge it with The chiropractor report or I want to merge it with the chiropractor report and the MRI And like this and then I want to slap the law firms logo on it or I want to whatever whatever the hell it is Totally possible, right? It's There's very little that's not possible and you're you're going to end up building the things that like high level doesn't do Which is fine because then that's where you know the proverbial value is right, so the The white label that I'm doing Right now for the independent musicians, right? Like we built this spotify up that they're never going to build that Right and we're building this other one that does something else that they're never going to do that. We just need to figure out what that is.
00:32:11 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, then I'll talk with Zach over at the copy and see what they're doing, what their pinpoint started, probably figure out.
00:32:18 - Dan Ryan
Who's that? Is that a different place? Is that the similar flow or maybe, right? Or it's going to be, hey, here's the pain doctor version, here's the PT version. Exactly. Granted, they're addressing the same, right, they're addressing this same lawyer relationship, right? That part's the same, but it's right. The idea that I mentioned last week is like, you have this idea of a snapshot, so you build the PT snapshot, you build the payment, snapshot, and you go, hey, we have a new payment office. Great. Lost the... payment snapshot. Hey, we have new PT. Okay, great. They're going to use the PT snapshot. And then there's stuff like the report builder probably is, you know, it's probably the same app, but it knows on building the PT report, assuming they're different on building the payment report.
00:33:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. But usually they do interact with each other and go back and forth. So it makes sense. And especially given how much tell them that they do, they're going to have some of those issues.
00:33:33 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, yeah, totally. And they're going to collect a lot of the same info and they both need to be HIPAA totally. Yep. And then the HIPAA thing is for sure real, by the way, I just confirmed it.
00:33:45 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:33:46 - Dan Ryan
No, it's real. No, I mean high level. There's a HIPAA. It's a different version, but for sure exists by a different version, but it's an add-on.
00:33:56 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
You're activated. Okay. Okay, cool. Then I Work on that side of it and part of it. I'm sure it's just her doing everything manually at the beginning to learn how stuff works.
00:34:05 - Dan Ryan
then Yeah, and then we'll build it like inside of lead flow basically and so it's like they'll get a lead flowy account and we'll build it in there And then go, okay, actually, maybe not. Maybe we won't do that. And we could just build it We'd have to build it outside. Never mind that. I Grabbed that we can't do that because lead flow is not HIPAA. Although I could make it HIPAA. I'll have to think about that What is the priority level of this for you Mark and for you Dan to make sure that we're It says zero priority for me Because I don't know what we're doing I'm still I'm still feeling my way around Uh Uh, yeah, I mean, I don't know right like where what is the don't use the P word potential. I don't want to hear about that the potential of this because as I like to say I have the potential to be a bodybuilder and yet I'm not.
00:35:09 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She starts this job on September like second. So like this is happening in terms of her job. Yeah I mean it's probably worth it to the whole business isn't everything else that will come with time. It just makes sense as just a natural extension. If we have a good case study of not just pain doc but here's a T place it's a natural extension of these are other things we can do and especially like California I mean of all the doctors know why I am know that I'm savvy especially compared to most places out there and if I tell them hey this thing may be better than what you currently have they would be interested.
00:35:57 - Dan Ryan
It will be I mean I can tell you it'll be better. So just for like context, we started building the, I'm going to say, oh, I can actually look this up specifically, but I'm going to guess right now, we started building the independent musician thing in March, maybe February, I think it's March. And as of right now, like 20 minutes to go, we're now going, we're at the MVP, we need to go in and like do some cleanup, basically, for our own internal sanity. But it's like, okay, none of this stuff's not changing, we need to go organize the names or just so that we're so that we can add, add, add, add. And right now, like they're texting me literally right now, we're coming up with the three pricing tiers. So it took us roughly six months to get to the MVP. This version would probably go faster because not done this twice, right? So it's like, oh, we're going to do it like this. Oh, we can go look at this one. Hey, it's like what we did over here. The question mark here would be the app component because I don't think we really know what that needs to be yet. But Norio, our lead dev is building his first app right now and it's going pretty well. He's only like two weeks in. He's probably going to be done this week with his first one. I've got some dudes that can build apps. He hates their code, but they work. So there's a way to do it there. Ultimately, Norio is like the best. So if you look at it, like, hey, might take six months to get to an MVP. That's certainly reasonable. And maybe little longer because we're going to hit that hole. Hey, it's Thanksgiving, Christmas. No one does anything. So that's going to go slower down. I'm cool with that.
00:38:02 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, no, it makes sense. And again, I just being on the other side of this, right, dealing with the doctors who have these things is a major pain point for a lot of these doctors.
00:38:17 - Dan Ryan
I'm sure. Yeah.
00:38:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And they make enough money where they're not looking for like a $99 in $9 a month solution.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan
Are they looking to, are they interested or looking to go, Oh, well, now I can add 10 patients a month because I'm not adding. It's not adding, it's edible, right? Is it, is it that they get to this point? Okay. Yeah.
00:38:44 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So if you create system of processes, getting rid of people and then being able to actually track on the back end, what they're getting paid. So which law firms are actually good for them or bad?
00:38:56 - Dan Ryan
Yes.
00:38:57 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. And that value alone. It's got to be significant.
00:39:02 - Dan Ryan
Well, that's a good point.
00:39:05 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Because we know doctors and lawyers are terrible at tracking things.
00:39:10 - Dan Ryan
Yep. And we know it's like trying on vendors, right? They can try on firms, but they can't right now because they don't know.
00:39:19 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just had a meeting with the fine law before this, because they were trying to see our PPC and it's like, yeah, it doesn't really exist, but going to blow up that door for right now. And, you know, they've got a lot of legacy directories that I'm sure do work pretty well. And they just got with their CPC. And I'm like, guys, I don't care what your CPC is. It's irrelevant. Like, I understand it's part of the overall components, but your CPL sort of helps, but it just comes down to my acquisition costs. I will share whatever race you need, but this is what I'm looking at. These are generally, we have, you know, five to seven percent. If it's outbound. 20%. and plus if it's inbound, cost needs be between 1,800 to 2,600 for a chain or however we get there, get there. like, most lawyers have no clue on any of this stuff.
00:40:11 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. Like, I know, like, I didn't know you spoke a foreign language.
00:40:17 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
You're like, yes, I do.
00:40:18 - Dan Ryan
So like, they're data, data is the foreign language? Exactly. We don't have any people not knowing that stuff. No.
00:40:28 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And their specialists did not have much to say. They're like, yeah, my vision is how much else to say.
00:40:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me ask a question then. When you're talking about building this and building that for the doctor's office, this is kind of like a joint venture creation between the two of you.
00:40:51 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I am technically not a part of any of it. Like, I can't own it or anything else, because I think there'd be a conflict.
00:40:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, soon. I want to understand this from kind of like, it's pretty easy.
00:41:06 - Dan Ryan
I own it. All right, moving on.
00:41:08 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you and John.
00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:41:12 - Dan Ryan
Wait a minute. You can't just throw a part around me.
00:41:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That's getting a Filipino.
00:41:17 - Dan Ryan
No, no, I do not want a Filipino.
00:41:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I have the same reaction in here.
00:41:24 - Dan Ryan
am. So, is Tona Filipino? Yes.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I did not know that. I thought she was like, or something like Oh, okay. Well, I left it. I'm 6% Filipino. Anyway, I'm also 2% African. So, I'm a mutt. I'm a mutt. I got Chinese. I got a pint of ice. Anyway, So, but the reason I'm asking is because like I asked Dan about priority mark. There was the first thing that you started with the calls. So, to me, this is something that's. your mind and I know your energy and excitement around marketing and building this as a potential. So it doesn't feel like the level of priority and importance is aligned and I want to know if there's can we be more clear in the conversation like Dan you love puzzles but you're anyway I just want to know is there is something that we can do to create some more kind of same page level energy focus priority make any kind of go towards us what is your interest level in it near Dan because he's the guy he would be the bottleneck for the opener yeah I mean I'm definitely interested in the idea of building
00:43:00 - Dan Ryan
these niche services on top of high level, because to me, it makes a ton of sense. I don't think that it's really funny because in building out the music one, I've gone around and like bought other people's stuff thinking, oh, this is by it and it will work. And then Eric and I look at what we bought and we're like, Jesus, this is horrible. Like, these are nowhere near as good as the that we're building. So I'm like, all right, well, we're definitely building some cool . I mean, just like, it's just like what, I mean, here's the elephant in the room. What we built for the sweet lot and leave flow is really good. like, shouldn't we be turning that into a product as legal flowy or whatever? so I'm interested in it, but the part where I lose interest we're like, actually, shouldn't say lose interest. The part that I'm not. ever going to do. And I'm fully happy to admit this is I'm never going to sell it. Right. So like I partnered with the dudes in Boston, they're selling it. We're already talking about selling so that I'm just saying that's that's the part that I will not do. It's not that I can't that it's I don't want to do it. I like to build the software and make it work. And yeah, I'll run ads that do the marketing. But I don't want to sit there and pitch it to anyone like I'm never going to you're never going to see me trying to sell a band onto this software. It's just not going to happen. But you will see me go. Hey, I think we can make these ads better. Hey, I think this should be the headline. Hey, I won't. Hey, here's it was my whole idea. Right. So a fan player is my whole idea. Granted, this isn't my idea, but it's pretty damn close. It's like, Oh, yeah. Okay, sure. Yeah, you you can bring this niche to turn this white label into a service. Yeah, in a way, it's like, all right, yeah, that's kind of like my idea, although not exactly. So, I'm into it in that regard. Like, yeah, I like to build this stuff and I can, and I know it could be built well, but I'm never going to sell it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, you would love doing that part of that, right?
00:45:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, and the reasons are, one, I mean, it personally helps me, right? If I've got doctors who are way more on top of this, I don't have to chase them for things or spend a lot of time in headache, like, it personally helps me. Two, I need to start bringing up other alternate streams of income and SaaS is definitely a great alternate income source, right? So, in a way, it can build out more, makes sense. It's easily duplicatable. Adding on additional people doesn't really increase the complexity or anything else. It's very, very simple to roll out, fairly easy to explain, and there isn't something exactly like this already out there. I mean, you're working with Fuji on Salesforce, I mean, showed me the back end of it, it's like, you're trying to cram Salesforce to make them do what they need to do. It works, but there's better ways to do this. And if you've got a really simple all-in-one product, it makes sense. Beyond that, I mean, you could add in for people who do traditional medicine and what I mean by traditional, like, insurance, of just how to have everything put together and submitted and bill in summaries in a way that would just completely open up the fish tank, if you will. Right, because there's tons of doctors offices out there.
00:46:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think it's a perfect match because for all All the things that you said, um, in addition to that, you love being a person who helps other people, giving them a solution that they can't find anywhere else is helping them. You're constantly going to places where you're meeting different attorneys, different doctors, um, having this conversation. So, you know, to, for it to get some legs with some, some people to try it out before creating any kind, and it could, it could be one of those things. The it just lives as a word of mouth and, and do a wealth and still be a good, um, source of income, depending on the pricing. So, with that said, Dan, if there's marketing built into it and revenue that could come from it, unlike, you know, basis that has taken all this time and investment and you haven't really got much back out of it. Does that excite you? with the puzzles, it's in the veins of this the stuff that you're already doing. We know that whatever you learn from that is going to be because I know that your pattern is where you learn something and you can go duplicate that somewhere else or learn to solve specific types of problems and then you think new thoughts and and your thought process changes and then it applies to different types of projects. So could it be a priority and something you'd be excited to work on kind of consistently for whatever it takes to make you want to do that, what would it take for it to be important to you and exciting to you so that you would want to work on it steadily?
00:48:47 - Dan Ryan
Oh it's there. I mean it's I literally do this every day so it's like oh you just it's just been different. I wouldn't do it if I didn't. Think okay. I know this doesn't fit right like a good purge example It never fit it was never gonna fit for like singing teachers, right? It wasn't scalable It's like that's not skill you and and there was no one to sell it there, but in doing it there I learned like oh this okay. I know what this I mean this operates good for managing leads Done like you can do all this stuff But what I've done in the last six months with the music thing is like it's a whole nother level of using high level And I was like oh Okay, I get it right so I want to do it for wedding planners, but I'm not right now because I Don't see the path to sales there. I need someone to sell it there and And that person is not necessarily present at the moment. So I'm not working on it. I could build it Sure. No problem. But I'm like, what's the point? you're like, if you build it, they will come?
00:50:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, they won't. That was a movie.
00:50:07 - Dan Ryan
So like, I don't, I don't have a wedding planner to bounce a few things off clothes. So I'd be doing it all myself. And I'm like, that doesn't, that's too much. I can't tap into, I can't, I can't get someone. Here's the, this is the role that I play in this. we're doing it right now. Is it, for whatever reason, it's me going, how does this work? What are you doing? Da-da-da. And then I can take all that and go, oh, this is what we need to build. I don't need to go build it though. I just go, this is what we need to build. And then I tell someone, I tell Eric or tell Johnny, like Johnny's dude. So like, I don't build a lot of the automations and the music thing. I, I look at what we're doing and go, this is what it needs to be. And sometimes I build them because I can't explain that to someone else. But now I have things I can point at. Go, no, go make it like that. Go look at that one.
00:51:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We need a given example.
00:51:05 - Dan Ryan
Like I built this thing called a retry. It's like, we need to use the retry. Go look at the retry in this and we need a retry in that. And then sometimes I build stuff and you watch it and you go, okay, great. But there's so much complicated good stuff in the music thing that is like a lot of it's there. And then here, I think the big question mark is the app, right? But the app is just a matter of having the feedback loop. Like if it's Chona, it's this doctor, that doctor, that office, as long as that feedback loop exists, then you can solve it. As long as they can tell us, you know, to use Mark's terms, as long as they can tell us the pain that we can come up with the solution. If there's no one there to tell me the pain or tell us the pain, then we're just guessing what the pain is. And then yeah, we're solving this assumed pain. And maybe you're not solving anything at all. That's the wedding planners. I'd be like, oh, you have this problem, but I don't know that they do.
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you used key room for something. Didn't you, when you were first starting the maps and stuff out?
00:52:16 - Dan Ryan
No.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, regardless, I think like a simple mind map would help be able to get people on the same page in terms of figuring out this process. But if you guys can both see my screen, I wrote down basically what you're saying, because I know I can't get AI to capture all of this unless it's in the transcript. But thinking about where to start, because I know where you get friction and you just stated it, which is the basically starting it kind of thing. Thank you. work better from okay. I'll call it copy chiffing versus copy writing. when you, it's that blank page start, right? That's where the biggest friction point is. But if we eliminate that by what we've got here, so Mark, if you were to take a look at this and say, okay, here's what I know and fill in these blanks, then we could maybe consider that a jumping off point down where, so Mark's given some information per these questions that you asked. And then you could look at it and go, okay, here's what I still need to know. I still need to know this. I still need to know that. And then do a little bit of a back and forth in terms of write that conversation. And then you could potentially send it to Eric knowing that it's going to be nowhere near usable and say, okay, put some bones on this. And then that iteration process is really how everything goes, right? It's, no, definitely not this fix that. Definitely not this. We need this, that type of thing. But in order to get to track in a momentum, I think that this is where we start.
00:54:06 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, and like just the stuff that like, this is exactly what I did with the paint company, right? And it was like, I talked to him like a, Mark and I just talked and then I was like, okay, write me an email with the steps that you explained. And then, then I got the steps. So like Mark, like we said, we were a new patient and then it's new patient, book an appointment, but whatever it is. And then I looked at that and said, oh, but really that let's say, this is what I'm hearing, right? You do this whole new patient thing and then after you write a report, okay? So it's like, is that a separate pipeline? Okay, great. what are the steps in that, right? And then at some point, this is getting back to the lawyer. Is that like another thing? Is the report something that happens internally? And then it gets looked at and they go, okay, yeah, check. Okay, checked out, report done. And then that triggers then to attorney. and do we need to hear back from the attorney? I imagine, I think there is, right? So, okay, it goes to the attorney, then it's in this attorney pipeline, and you're waiting for the check from the attorney, or you, I don't know what it is, right? You're waiting for something, but then that thing happens, and then boom, that's the end all over. I've gone through three pipelines, and that's it. That's soup to nuts, but it's not all one pipeline. And then you figure out, oh, I'll give you the car example, right? Parts ordered. They order the parts. They cannot start the project until the parts come in. So it's like, oh, so then the parts come in, and somebody knows that? Yeah, okay, great. I made that a checkbox. When that box gets checked, it automatically starts the next pipeline. They don't need to do anything. And they're like, you can do that? I'm like, yeah, if we know, if we know that that would be the thing that it's tied to, and no one's going to check that by accident. You're going to accidentally start like no, no, the one person I got great about one person checks that box. You're good to go. It'll, it'll do the thing.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Mark, do you feel like you have enough information? So like if I sent you this email right here, says write down an email with the what the process is right at different scenarios that you can think of beginning to end literally just a bullet list.
00:56:28 - Dan Ryan
No, actually, yeah, in stages.
00:56:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what are the things that have to happen in order to trigger the next step bullet list? Do you feel like you could put something into that?
00:56:43 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Some meat?
00:56:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think it's the only way for Dan to be able to do it and use it, you know, know that that is because that's what he just said. What I'm asking is, do you can you do that?
00:56:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:56 - Dan Ryan
And then any of that paperwork, right?
00:56:59 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So it's like, yeah, I mean, we
00:57:00 - Dan Ryan
It blows my mind. Every time I go to a doctor's office and have to fill out piece of paper, like, I know you have all this info. I know why am I doing this?
00:57:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is insane.
00:57:13 - Dan Ryan
Or they hand you an iPad. I'm like, this doesn't make it better. You have this. Why is this not populated?
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand. When you say, and any of that paperwork, Mark said, yep, so he clearly understood it, but I didn't. What do you mean in terms of, do you mean that being able for them to attach paperwork to the scenario?
00:57:35 - Dan Ryan
No, no, Like anything that they, like, oh, there's a this, and we, this is what the report looks like that goes to the lawyer, right? So he mentioned that. But then there's also probably, like, is there, is there a form or like, I don't know what they're doing in this, this first telemedicine thing? Are they sending over an email? Do they send them over a form? Like, what information are they getting? gathering. So I guess it's kind of two layers like what information do you gather and at what at what stage is this happening? And then what information are you gathering from the patient? What information are you gathering from other doctors? What information you getting from the lawyers? And then what information are you pushing out, right? It seems like all they push out at the end is a report, but maybe there's other stuff I don't know. And then like the other bit is like we touched on this at the beginning. where are the patients coming from? Law firms, other doctors, something else. Like I don't we don't care what it is. We just want to know what it is.
00:58:42 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm really not like ads, right?
00:58:49 - Dan Ryan
Google ads. Yeah, it's great.
00:58:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Not yet.
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan
Anyway, eventually who knows? No, not yet.
00:58:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can see how time I get. I don't know if you have other meetings. I don't know if anybody's aware of what time it is.
00:59:03 - Dan Ryan
I'm not aware of what time it is to have a word that I'm great.

That's about it. Because this took up the whole call, which is awesome and great. So I think that it's needed. I think that there's good business benefit for both of you. I think that there's good learning that the more that we master the automation than the tools, the more leverage we have in the business, which means that we have more likelihood of profitability, increased profitability with less effort or at least maintaining effort. But looking at the time, I don't know if there's anything else you guys want to discuss now or table it for next week.
00:59:47 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think that's interesting to me is how much California we have this month and how little Arizona. In person, I mean, it's not bad like we're doing well. So I'm happy with what we're at. I'm just interested in the Arizona, and I took a couple of steps back.
01:00:06 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. Well, at Sergley's asking that question too, because they had, they're like, dude, where are the retainers? like, I don't know, they're updating me. I gotta look at what they sent me. But they had three retainers out. And then one subsequently looks like it's gonna become a referred out. And then the other two aren't back in yet. And they're like, they're what? Yeah. they're like, what the F? Yes. And they're like, what the F do? And I gotta, you gotta send me the names. Like I got, I'll dig into it.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I only see one, that's the retainer out right now for them.
01:00:47 - Dan Ryan
There were definitely three, because I looked at them on Friday. But well, yeah, there were three, sorry, there were three on like Wednesday, one subsequently became referred out, but not referred out. It's actually attempting to. were far out. Because what's what is PC? I don't even know what PC stands for. so potential client was that fault. I was like, yeah, that one's not going to convert. That was a done deal.
01:01:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but look, I'm going to keep trying to put it somewhere just because someone might see some different, right? Like, and that's cool. I'm seeing the one that was a word for now. There's two that are working. Let's see if I've referred out one more. Yeah, I was pretty sure that they're at fault, but I just want someone else to maybe take a look at it, but it didn't make sense. So don't think this is a different way, but I don't think that one's never going get signed up, but frankly, Seth is one that's more working. They're currently represented by law firm, want to salvage. It's fine, but I think the issue was they were told that policy elements might have already been extended. Yeah, this one, they didn't know what it happens. They were in a car, we would have gotten to a seizure and we're like, you need to get the police report because it's been at least a year and a half. So, yeah.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just one thing I wanted to point out real quick, because last week we were talking about how leveraging multiple resources. So we were talking about how if you had lost a particular lead source at one point same thing with states because Arizona dipped and in the beginning you were California and California, Arizona, Washington, when we started it, Washington, all almost nothing. got 21 in Washington this month and eight in New York.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so most of the Washington is Walker, Valiant, I'll say Walker and Valiant and Felipe. Felipe had a little bit though because you've got 21 and you've only got. Yeah, we've been jumping on Felipe a lot because they want money and you were like your results don't go with the money that you want. So we cut them back a little bit because of that and they're now more in line with what I expect.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, because you're on track, if this pace were to keep up to potentially still have your best month ever, don't know, so that's just, yeah, it's, it's good staying on top of where's that AdWords ID.
