Hello.
00:00:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We are.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan Ryan sir. Are you.
00:00:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So quiet. Be there.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan.
00:00:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Now I hear you. It's your computer again. Not because the other one is going to say that all the time. Now we, we proved it as far as I'm concerned.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but then I had issues on the other computer.
00:00:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So we did not. I think it's proven and it's your fault.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you now. So there. Was up was up.
00:00:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, not a whole lot. Trucking alone.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Trucking alone. T-R-U-C-K. the truck all the way. Oh, sorry. It's the cheerleader in me. It never goes away.
00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. you finally review Mercer's analytics stuff?
00:01:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm deep into it. Oh, wait. There's no reviewing.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Let tell you that.
00:01:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm going through the course.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ryan. Thanks for that, Chef.
00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
don't even bother. Hold on up on that. Because I'm going through Mercer's stuff, and he's saying a lot of . I'm like, oh, that's a really good point. Oh, that's a really good point. granted, some of it doesn't apply to me, but some of it does. So I'm just taking, like, copious notes. I'm going to go through his whole preliminary. force, and then gauge where I'm at. But one thing he said, he's like, you know, I see a lot of people goes, I can't believe he said this. And I'm like, Oh my God, other people do this. He's like, they set up all these systems to collect the data. And then they never really look at it. like, who does that? What are you talking about? That doesn't sound like me. I do that. So it's like, as I'm going through it, like, I actually listened to my podcast too. And he said some stuff on a podcast. I was like, Oh, that's I could do this. I could do that. Dude, he's next level. This guy's just next level. It's crazy. But I want to talk to him at the end, because I know him. But because I do stuff that other like, it was funny, I listened to another podcast and they were talking about him, which I thought was funny. And they were it's this podcast where it was with Ralph, the perpetual traffic podcast, which you might want to watch this one, but I can give you the synopsis. there's this dude, John Moran. So John used to work for this PPC management company. I think you might have been a part of Omar, all Solutions 8. And Solutions 8, he was like one of the faces of it, but the real face was, or is, oh, what's his name? Oh, god, I can see his face. This Indian dude, don't think he's Indian, whatever, he's like, is was the co-host of perpetual traffic until like two months ago. So I didn't know what was going on. John, all of sudden, is working at tier 11 with Ralph. I'm like, that's weird. And then what's his name is no longer on the podcast? Like, that's even weirder. But then I found out that he got acquired. So he sold his agency to some of the other...
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not acquired?
00:04:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, the other dude, solution's eight. Okay. So I think that's why the guy's not on the podcast and that's why John left. He switched to tier 11 because they acquired it. They kept what's his name on as like an advisor. But I guess they're doing, they manage like a hundred million from PVC, the company that bought him. But anyway, John goes to tier 11. Now John's smart dude. But for the longest time, like the better part of two years, he was like just hot and bothered by P.E. Max and whatever. And I tried that and it just doesn't work. I mean, yeah. It looks like it works, but I'm like, these numbers don't make sense, right? maybe a month ago, two months ago, Ralph and John have this podcast or they put out a video, I forget what it was, and John starts talking about forget roas, right? Everyone's hot on roas, he's like, forget roas, you have to look at the internal numbers of the business. like, is this a joke? Of course you look at those. What the hell are you talking about? And then they start telling these stories of how they were just relying, they've been relying on the dashboard analytics of Google or whatever. And then the business owner would come in and be like, I'm losing my . Like, this isn't working. And they'd be like, no, are you talking about? Look at the roas, it's Gen X. So then they, John has a business, started looking inside his own business and started piecing it together like, wait a minute. These numbers don't actually line up. Like what I'm seeing over here, what I'm seeing. inside. So he's like, the real metric is the business, the business revenue metrics. I'm like, is this a joke? Are you really just coming around to this idea? The answer is yes. So they're acting like it's this big epiphany, like ground shifting, f-row ads, whatever. So now, then he puts out this video like 11 days ago. And dude, I watched this video and I called Salko. I was like, you got to find someone to get this lawsuit going. So John figured out that Google is basically, I'll call it algorithmic price fixing. If you use any of those methods, the p-max, row as whatever, he proved across 10 accounts that when he raised the budget, his costs went up every time. It's like you're being penalized for, if you offer the more money, they'll spend it. And by reporting back your results, the conversions, the offline revenue, all that , they're using it against you. So he went in and he went in and turned everything off and he went back to manual PPC, which is what I always run. And he started getting more, more exposure, cheaper lead cost, more conversions, everything went in the other direction. And he's like, dude, we have to try harder to get your business or something, no, no, because the pixels screwed them. So the way for them to close their revenue gap is to just basically rob you more. But under the guise of we're helping you and the metrics that you're looking at in the dashboard make it seem like it's better, but it's not. He's like, it's, I mean, it's, he's floored and they're like, what? the dude. And I showed Salka, I'm like, dude, this is a lawsuit. This is, they're like, algorithmic price fixing. So Salka has a firm looking at it. What the ? And John basically put together the whole case that he's all in this one video. So anyway, so I watched that. I'm like, that's interesting. I don't do any of that stuff. But, and then they were talking about like there is no one source of truth. And then they start, they start talking about Mercer and blah, blah, But, of course, I think they're wrong, but I only think they're wrong in the context of like a lot of that. don't think applies to me. So then I started thinking, okay, unlike, they're all dealing with clients. I'm not. So I do drop a first party cookie, right? So they're saying, And how like, well, none of these attribution models are real. They're all just models. You can't trust the data. And I'm like, well, I can trust that that lead came from a Google ad because I know it did because I ran the ad and I'm tagging it. And it's with the lead. Now, if that person buys later and they came from Facebook, let's say, or better yet a Facebook ad, how do I, and I don't know, I don't think I can do this in Google Analytics, or I think it's going to be like this combo platter. But if I have first, I don't even want to call it first touch. I want to call it something else because it's not a touch. It's like first contact or first something, some other word. Touch would be that they just click the ad and whatever. They click an ad and they submit and I know they're from Google and it's like, I've captured that. And then they subsequently buy and they come from a different Google ad. How do I or better yet they come from Reddit or they come from whatever? How do I start to correlate that and say, okay, and let's say they were new customer. So I go, all right, I got new customers. Where do I get new customers from? new customers that were also a lead came from here. They come from Google. They come from Facebook. Because their whole thing was like, there was another podcast that I watched. were like, you have to go full funnel and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, all right, yeah, that makes sense. But you still need to know what's working. Like, you got to have some idea of what's doing what you can't just say, go full funnel, go spend on all the platforms. And, you know, it's like, that doesn't make sense. But with this, when you have your own cookie, and potentially when you have this, the integration, then I have a segmentrix. I'm like, there's got to be a way to leverage that so that I am getting deeper insights. And additionally, watching Mercer's course, I'm like, OK. And there's other I could do on the Google Analytics side that's I'm never going to be able to get Google Analytics to show me, hey, yeah, this person, I don't think. Yeah, you have, it could probably show me this. You had this many leads and leads up again, customers. It'll never show me it was Tina, because it doesn't have that data. But if it could show me that in Google Analytics and I can just say, hey, show me how many leads I got this month, OK? How many leads this month also were leads and became customers? then how many customers came in that were not leads? And I could get that sort of reporting in there. And then you'd go to segmentrix and say, now show me who they are. Show me who was. as a lead and a customer. Show me who was just a customer. Show me where just the customers who were not leads, where did they come from? But the leads that became customers, where did they come from? And then try to figure out where and especially new customers, which you can only ever get, you know, you could never get new customers in Google. They're never gonna know if they were a customer before, mostly, most likely. Anyway, so then I started, I was just doing this. I was looking at funnel kit, which I think I mentioned like two weeks ago. They have stuff like they capture the referral, right? So I just looked at the most recent new customer and it came from Google because it's using my UTM's. But I'm like, okay, that's here in woo. I don't think that's in metric. I don't think that certainly isn't in segmentrix. So how do I access their attribution? They're coming. right? So they're dropping a cookie every time someone comes, and I'm like, okay, that would give me, if it's in a record, or I'm sorry, if it's in the order record, hey, this is the source, how do I get that into signetrics?
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How do I? I don't know. I mean, I doubt it. I'm seriously dumb to do it. But yes, I'm like on hour six of more Mercer stuff. I just stopped to do this call, and I'm going to go to the office and watch a a little more. Good times.
00:13:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who was it that you said, updated their reporting?
00:13:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I feel like you said in the same metrics. What's funny is none of these people mentioned signetrics, which I thought was funny, because I'm like, dude, they're better because you can do this tagging thing. That's what makes them better. But it's only better if you can tag, if you. If you have the sort of this additional data which I get on form submit through the cookie That's the trust me. I was sitting here. Yes, and I go. Oh my god. If I can actually put this all together Like this just puts basis on a whole different level like If I could go like if I show Mercer, I'm not talking about this before and he's like, yeah, But now I'm like oh Okay, I Can do this other people can't or basis can do this other people can't So but what is it? I did need turn it into something so I could get 20 30 new customers today. Let's go Because I did all that to Tina I figured out all my stuff and we have reached our ceiling Or we're gonna breach it. I would say sometime between the 11th And, actually, let me say what day of the week, what are the days of the week on this? Oh, July, once the fourth, so the fourth is a Thursday. Yeah, so we will probably reach it somewhere between the 8th and 12th of July. We will reach our proverbial glass ceiling. Based on the map. And I'm pretty confident that's correct.
00:15:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what makes it your ceiling now?
00:15:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That formula of new customers and the churn. So you divide your churn rate into the number of new customers you add per month, basically. And then that gives you that will give you your total. of subscribers that you can reach if those numbers stay constant. So if it's 900 months divided by 22, so I blended the, I was right. I was here in 25, it was too high. then when I looked, when I zoomed out, third of the average is 22, we'll call it. And then when I stuck that in, I was like, oh yeah, that's right. And then I went and looked and I was like, oh dude, we're there. Like, we're just about to get that. We haven't gotten there yet, but we're most likely going to get there by that time in July.
00:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that. How do you change your ceiling? what way does it come out?
00:16:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because you're, it's like, it's sort of like, know, when you pour, you pour the water in the glass, it's like the glass is only going so hot.
00:16:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't keep pouring water.
00:16:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I get that.
00:16:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this isn't that. So that analogy doesn't work for me. And also I am my boss. It is that hot glass right now, so I'm not thinking that you're always you're you're shedding a certain amount it's so I guess it's not that it's more like it's more like there's a leak in the glass right so you you're always you have a you're pouring water in and then there's a leak that's at a certain rate so that you're only ever going to get to the rim of the glass you'll never go over the rim because the the inflow and the outflow the map of the inflow and the outflow get you to this so I need to ask these questions because I get that um yeah but I think that there are variables that can be affected to make a change and so like if we improve in retention and reduced churn which may not be possible because it's the nature of what it is um but but also I don't see that they are, like, I see that there is a relationship, but I don't think it's necessarily, I don't know, feel like it's not an actual glass that has a physical limitation. get the numbers, like if the numbers say the way that they are, this is the thing, like we're not improving because we're losing at a certain rate. But the pace of the rate, so like, if churn is what it is, and we continue to bring in new customers, does churn increase?
00:18:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not really. So that's what's interesting, right? churn is across years, but the churn is sort of like the churn. And we've put things in place too. The ceiling is that so that you're up. So your outflow is very constant, so if you can increase your inflow, then your ceiling goes up, but our inflow has never gone up, so it's hilarious. From the beginning, this is the first time I've ever looked at it, but I have it like, we basically average, if there was COVID, there was this, whatever, but if you just look at like the line items, we, it's like a 3.2, 3.3, we'll call it great, let's call it free. It's a $3 million a year business, period, and it's always been in that area for six years, and it's because we always, because the churn's always been the same, and guess what, it. So if you don't get that, the only way up is to raise that number, get it to 23, 24, 25. And if you raise it like one or two, it's a compounding outcome, right? Because your churn does not change to your earlier point. Adding more in the front end does not increase the churn. The churn just stays there. Really, I mean, it's not weird.
00:20:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The reason I'm asking is because you were talking about trying to increase market share, which is, and you've done that.
00:20:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I don't understand how this is. No, we haven't.
00:20:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You didn't increase market share at all.
00:20:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:20:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're subscribers per day. So the market just increased, but your share of it didn't.
00:20:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, where if when you look at the numbers, it's we're all it's all the same. It's crazy. From the beginning, from the first year. We really haven't moved like we move a little up and a little down a little up a little down but when you average it out it's 22 when you average it out it's three million so we're not and when you look at like the total new customers acquired they're within this you yes there's a variation but they're within a very tight window right so let's say 7,000 like every year it's 7,000 and how they come in might be oh for the first part of the year you were averaging i'm going to make this up hey through Q1 you're average 13 a day but in Q4 you're average 40 but when i zoom out it was 22 doesn't matter that i was doing 40 and Q4 doesn't matter that it's 22 yes and it and it's only one year there's only this this was what was interesting was and i wasn't doing this the first and then i realized wait i now know right i learned learn last year that summers are high season so I did this on like the 21st or something I think or the 20th I was working on this for 19th so I was like okay I was looking at the 365 view right oh 22 and then I was like oh well well what happens from January to today so I looked at January today and it was like 16 was what we're averaging right now and I was like okay so that I know right away that like if we are on a rate of 22 that that number is going to increase now but in the summer during that that's new customers yes okay just making sure okay and that's the only number that matters new subscriptions doesn't matter because that's a different number so I was like all right we're averaging 16 right now then all right so obviously I know sales are going to go up over the summer so then by the end of the year that's how we averaged 22 so you can't even look at these numbers go, oh god, we're only averaging 16 a day. So then I said, okay, I'm going to go look at every year from that period, right? So I looked at 2018, 19, 20, 20, right? And it's like, they're all are between like 16 and 19, except one. So in 2019, for whatever reason, I don't know the answer which one. It was 22 a day, that first part of the year, the only time it's ever happened, but then it stayed 22 the whole year. And then guess what? That's the best that was the best year ever. Because it was because of that, but still, when you zoom out, it's not that much better. Like you still end up it was 3.2, I think. Yeah, it was like 200 grand more or something. Um, but so the take away from all of that is, I know we can't affect, I think it's a fool's errand at this point to try to affect your own because we've tried. And it hasn't really changed it, right? have these outgoing offers and day on for whatever. And that didn't even move at a point. So I'm like, okay, I don't think there's a whole lot we can do there. So yeah, you can increase lifetime value and stuff like that. But the one that seems most attainable is increasing new customers. It's that run and sort of thing. So yeah, that's where I'm at with that right now. And then I'm talking to this dude after this, the subscription guy that I do that I got the formula from, because he sent this emails like the universe. He's like, these are the four stages of subscription growth. He's like, you're growing from the beginning, right? You're growing. And then you hit it, then you hit a thing and then you lose some and then you get it back and then you just get stuck in this Like maintenance and I'm like, oh my god, but it's exactly where we're at. Like this guy nailed it. like, that's weird But I don't think he's gonna have the answer Unless he can unless he has some traffic guru , which I don't he does like bro where I we were doing all the things that you're talking about I need to solve for new customers and I think the solution is Like I was watching these dudes were also talking about how like Now this is funny How like the pixel is your enemy? Like hey, you're you're you're giving all this data back to them. They're using it against you So then I started thinking all right. Well, what if I gave them data and I've done this before What if I I give them data that they don't know what it is. I know what it is. They don't really know what it is. I tell them, oh, yeah, it's whatever, but they don't really know. So if you haven't really pushed this all out, but if you just look at a funnel from the awareness consideration, purchase, whatever the bottom is, right? And then we have our sites, which I was already moving in this direction, right? CPA exam was awareness. Another 71's consideration. And then Ninja is like the bottom of the funnel, wherever that stuff is called. I was like, OK, I do that? Can I take that idea and extend it to pixels? Do I have a pixel that's my awareness pixel? That I know the only people that are exposed to that pixel are through awareness. So if I go on Google and I buy these keywords that I know are top of the funnel, they don't know that Facebook certainly doesn't know it and then I'm only firing my awareness pixel and I'm only building these awareness audiences that seems like a viable strategy that I haven't really heard anybody do before Yeah, and I'm like, yeah, and then you're just isolating them in these pixels and you never cross between and then you move them from like pixel to pixel, from like stage to stage because if you're putting them all in one pixel, how could they, there's no way to know who's what in that one, in that sort of blue base, whatever, of pixelness of like random people going to your side whatever it is.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But I haven't quite worked it out.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I would really love to be able to look at the numbers with you, because it's like I've said, it's so hard to wrap my head around it without like, when we got the dashboards for sweet love. I don't know, I just processed the data differently, but that means I'm asking questions differently.
00:28:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And I don't know, I'm not, I have a right area.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you screen share?
00:28:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I can find it because I thought it was open, but it's not. This is.
00:28:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't realize until yesterday that I never got a reply to a message I sent you last week asking if we could reschedule today to my family's here.
00:28:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I didn't. That's right.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister, she went and got me some glutamine, which usually helps me with this and it's starting to help, but
00:29:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you want to bail, we can bail.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want data.
00:29:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I can't find it. Where is it?
00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you going to look at? Are you going to look at the second metrics?
00:29:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would love to see that. No, no. don't even know how to approach that at this point. No, I put it on a spreadsheet somewhere. It's clearly not named something about what I was working on. Oh, my God. Where is it?
00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's going to, like, recent.
00:29:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I am.
00:29:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm opening them all. hate that. Plus I have so many Google accounts and sometimes I put them in the wrong ones.
00:29:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Now I'm going to get. I haven't gotten this . I get it. up to do do do do do do All right, so so this is over here is basically your formula, right? So it's like you get divided by your 22% churn, or I'm sorry, you get 900 months divided by Come on, where he's must go. I think I'm this thing off. I can Bobby. He always does this. So no. All right. So we have a ways to go. He's like, where they are. I'm like, he counts another 71. All right. So that's what I get for listening to Bobby. All right. So this is my stuff's only based on Ninja.
00:31:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:31:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So we are a ways away from hitting 40, 90. So we'll probably hit it by the. All right. Well, I can tell you because I figured that out. I figured out how many we add a day. I'm going to do this, I like to do it. Well, I can tell you what So 2.2, so basically having eight new people a day. So 40 minutes, 36, So in 55 days, we will make the ceiling, which will be what this August 21st, And it's the ceiling because it's. Because we're not affecting new customers per day. It just is. So the less and I don't even know how that actually happens. So that's part of like. The Mercer's thing is like, you have to know what you're measuring. I'm like, oh, I know what I'm measuring, but I don't know how it's happening. I can take. So that's where the idea of, and I could be totally wrong about this. Like, I. Zoom don't know. It's true that some percentage of leads turns into customers. I don't know if that is a relationship that has any meaning, right? So if that did have meaning, it would be like, okay, go get more leads. But actually, actually, know it's not true, not that I think about it, because or whatever, I don't have to look at it. Bobby sent me the chart and our leads exploded like the fall of 2022 or whatever, and we're still averaging 22 a day.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So... 22 leads a day?
00:34:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, the 22 new customers, right?
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's like... Right. you just said leads and then you said 22...
00:34:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, know, weeks, right, right, because I was trying to think like, oh, if there's a relationship between leads and customers, then you go get more leads. But there isn't a relationship. Or maybe there relationship and customers. is maybe there's a relationship between certain leads, but leads as just this bucket of leads to customers, there's no direct relationship. There could be free trial leads to customers, notes to Google ad lead to customers. There could be some subset that does work, but it's not visible at the moment, nor have we ever looked at it before. So like, if I can figure out where new customers come from, does it shine a light on where I should be advertising more, or I don't know, right? I don't know. But just the idea of, I mean, when I say this to people all the time, more leads doesn't really mean anything sometimes. It's certainly the case here. And then God only knows, right? Like that one year, which is, So, 2019, most customers ever, this is like the ratio of one-time customers to returning customers. ratio is within the ballpark, returning customers, whatever. That was the best year because it got the most new customers.
00:36:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how the hell did that happen?
00:36:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't tell you. Way too long to go. I don't know if I could go piece that together if I tried.
00:36:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you said the market has stayed the same every year?
00:36:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Our market, right?
00:36:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no.
00:36:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
have asked the question before about the market itself. No, it's gone down.
00:36:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's gone down.
00:36:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, that makes sense. overall, market size is decreasing every
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
by what percent?
00:37:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We don't really know. I mean, the idea, I'm not even sure this idea was true in 2018, but it was like, oh, there's 100,000 people. Now, the number is more like 67. So you could, you could just say 10,000 a year if you're, you know, being kind. But yeah.
00:37:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
10,000 a year. What is that number reduction? okay. And so where would that put that roughly this year?
00:37:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
67.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
67,000?
00:37:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I think that's the number that I found, but I don't know someone might know, but the AICPA knows. And so it's probably lower than that. to be honest. So yes, we've increased our market share because the market reduced, but that's a metric, right? We have not increased. We have not increased, right? This number is 7300, right? We exceeded it last year, these two year, the COVID years, we didn't get it. But if you take the years that are unmarked, it's 7800.
00:38:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does that 38-93 throw?
00:38:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What date? Which one?
00:38:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2024.
00:38:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Whatever, Jada, did this like the 19th or something?
00:38:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this month, up to through this month. Yeah, through the like that, actually, where the dig for it. So the thing that I just thought that I... haven't thought before is if the market keeps shrinking, like there is a clock on selling this for what you do.
00:39:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes and no, because our business doesn't change. And from that per, from that vantage, it's like, yeah, these guys do 3 million a year. Like, this is a 3 million dollar year business on like, over and over and over.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a go away. I wouldn't imagine it would.
00:39:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Unless we actually get a flat tax, no. Right. And or we go, I'm a republic, one of the other and none of us are worried about our CPA review businesses.
00:39:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then, there's got to be a point at which it stops shrinking because people like our population is isn't our population increasing?
00:40:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, our populations. Or we were at a level where we're barely increasing or something. But it's that's the whole thing. Like it's going to be it's a cultural thing, right? No one wants to be a boring CPA. So there is there is now, I think, In the industry, they're like, need to start inviting people back into this career. Like we need people to do this.
00:40:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at minimum, OK, 1990 to 2000, the growth rate was 13.15 percent to 2010. It was 9.71 percent, 20, 27.35 percent. So the population is increasing, which means the need for CPA. is the market, whatever, should be slightly and somewhat proportionately increasing because that's just like, I mean, there's people, right? There's people that have to pay taxes. Yeah. So where would you get the data? Like, have you tried with any kind of?
00:41:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. get it. We get it from AICPA. No, we definitely get it. It's it's going down for short. I don't know that I believe them. I mean, I guess they have to be honest, but do they, right?
00:41:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just things like TurboTax and stuff like that impact your market share.
00:41:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, because most people that become CPAs don't do 1099 pilings.
00:41:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But are there less CPAs because less CPAs are needed because TurboTax and things like that exist?
00:41:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, they would they would never do that. That's not there. That's the whole thing, right? So the idea that the population's growing, meaning that that is a need for more CPA's, that's not necessarily true, it would have to be like the population's growing and the segment within there that uses CPA's as growing as well. Right, right, what I'm getting at. Yeah, no, so segment is shrinking because of things like that. I don't, it's not a, the issue is people not becoming CPA's, that's the issue.
00:42:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, but why would people not become CPA's? influences that?
00:42:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And so that was when I was saying, you just, you just said it because the number one career for kids today is to become an influencer who wants to be a CPA.
00:42:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's literally what it is. They're, they're not going into that as a career or educational path because they think There's a better battle. There's a show, demand for skilled accountants continues to outstrip the available supply leading.
00:43:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:43:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:43:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So there is, there was like, so then is the way of increasing market share to talk more people into becoming accountants, like to change the campaign, if not, how do you pass the exam, but you should be a CPA? For us, I mean, yeah, that's, that's the ultimate planting a seed and then hoping it's, right? It's like, that's years, years before they're ever a customer for us. That is, that is, that is, be the strategic of AICPA. They should be out there sewing the fields for that stuff, because they make all their money off of fees from licensed accountants, right? And, but, Yeah, no, for us, no, probably none. No, our thing is to steal market share from other people, like to tap further into the people who are here, or my whole CPA exam strategy is outside the funnel. If we can, and we are, but if we do that better, but I need to be able to track that and know that it's working, right? So it's really the whole thing now is like a what is working thing, right? I know so much of our stuff is brand driven. OK, well, how much? And if that's the case, the whole strategy of a CPA exam is a brand play. Well, if it's mostly brand driven, well, look, then it's like, and this was the case with another 71, too. Well, the reason, so it being brand driven is like a huge benefit, right? like I still argue I could turn off all the ads and nothing would change, but I can get that answer now, right? Like rather than go, who could time to do that? If I can go figure out what's working for real, what do I learn from that? And like, does it point me in a direction or not? And if it's a brand thing, it's like, okay, well, then we should go full funnel every channel or try to, in part of me, it's like, all right, this idea of top of the funnel CPA exam.com. And then if I'm back to like, CPA exam, another step would do one ninja. Right now, ninjas doing all the bottom of the funnel work, right? Yeah, all the ads run for that, it's done, which is the correct thing to do, go bottom up. So rather than go to the middle, I'm just going to go to the top, because the tops, Been proven to work the middle is not been proven to work. I don't know If it is actually true, I don't know if people look at another 71 that way anymore It's been so long and it's been so long since it's been our resource and Jeff doesn't really Make podcasts. I'm like, how do you know if that's viable? CPA exam comes viable all day long and it doesn't require Jeff and it doesn't require Anything really right. It's the SEO everything's happening there right now is outsource. I'm like, okay, if I go there and then on top of that start the seeds that I can plant are The keyword these top of the funnel keywords like CPA exam or do and bump up on and whatever and then let and then somehow figure out Because those have never converted Say that with air quotes Or is it that the conversion window is probably this the conversion window is so long on, I could never see it because I was always only ever looking inside of Google. So if I can get them to come in and be a lead and I get that keyword and I can watch them over a longer period of time and I can say, you know what, that keyword's never going to convert in a 30-day window. But I tagged that person, they downloaded the thing, maybe came with customer six months later. That's, that works, it converts. And then it's like, okay, yeah, so leave that out of it. That the signal from within Google is turn it off. If the signal from within segmentrix or whatever the hell I set up is, leave it on, then you'd leave it on. And maybe that's what I was doing in 2019.
00:47:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't know.
00:47:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I should go back and look at what was our ad spend in 2019. I'm going to do that.
00:47:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Just be writing down. what are the strategies points and that you could go back. but like I typed in help passing CPA exam and another 71 is at the very bottom of that page and if I was looking at it I'd never look at it first of all like Becker's up there were 35% off CPA exam review and we just know people are like discount let me check that out and then varsity tutors is like big old CPA exam tutor um CPA tutors pass first time conquer CPA exam one-on-one tutor that's pretty powerful and then there's all kinds of videos nothing from any of you guys and then more ads now there's university stuff and then there's like some girl that created a video a YouTube video there's like so many things way before anybody gets to you like page one of Google used to be like 10 and then like there was 10 results now there's like I don't know how many This is 50 before I even see another 71, which doesn't pop out because it's not visual. like with the videos and the images, like this girl, three years ago, and it's only got 108,000 views, but how to pass the TPA exam while working full time, five tips, but like visually, when I even do see another 71, there's nothing that pops out about it. How to pass the TPA exam in 20 days and not die, but it just doesn't really stand out and there's no, it's not in the sponsored results.
00:49:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, I can tell right now that's a keyword, right? But that's not even the point. The point, it's really about like, what keywords matter, right? then it's, I mean, I've had this idea before and I've just. never like okay I guess I need to really go figure this out to me there's the keywords have like and it's funny I just saw Jeff did this and I was like oh he was doing like no okay now that makes sense except he did it wrong but I'm like okay you got it so he used to run competitor campaigns and he would call the middle of the funnel and I was like dude they're they're they're not that they're they're they're not that but then I realized yesterday I'm like oh no they're bottom of the funnel right if our bottom of the funnel is our brand their brand is bottom of the funnel for their brand therefore it's bottom of the funnel for our brand so those should be going to if we ran those and I don't know we should it should be Becker versus Ninja but a really good page but the Becker keyword can't just be Becker CPA review. because that's potentially their top of the funnel, or their middle of the funnel maybe, right? Their brand aware. What's our bottom of the funnel keyword that converts? It's, I'm gonna make this up. Ninja CPA review coupon or Ninja CPA free trial. So I'm like, if I look at our bottom of the funnel brand stuff and I then apply that to all the competitors and then I go send those clicks to a ninja versus whoever, I know that they're close to buying the other thing. So it'd be my opportunity to like say, well, wait, before you do that, which year? That sort of makes sense, right? And you would do it with record because of the most traffic and if it works there, gonna work in other places, right? So, but as you go up the funnel, it's like middle and top, the top of the funnel would be the keyword CPA exam, right?
00:51:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. Can you can you look at the keywords for what I just typed? So two two things because when I typed in past CPA exam, it's the same exact issue. Another 71 is down at the bottom and I would not think that's a low hanging fruit type keyword, but I'd be interested to see because you said it was a crappy keyword. Like that's what I would type in if I was looking for it. So what is the volume?
00:52:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
OK, this is it. Well, a don't use a keyword to look if they lie. OK, right? that that's the whole thing, right? So here is a million dollars of keyword, a million dollars worth of keyword data, Tina. Mm-mm.
00:53:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you export that so I can just look at it.
00:53:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's going to be ginormous.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I see.
00:53:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What I'm going to do is go. The thing not let you do this anymore really.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the word that gives you the most business.
00:53:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Brand name to CPA.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the second. That's not brand.
00:53:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no, it's like I'm in the wrong account so I can't really tell you. I mean we could go in here and just do it. This is based on old data so. Oh, yeah, we don't want these 700s, these are bullshid. Okay, why don't you go from converting to zeros. Good grief. This is not going well. Let's do this. So ninja nodes, another silver wand, brand, brand, brand, brand, brand, brand. CPA exam. Well, converted, but. I don't the value. Well, I can play right now. I didn't know this. So this is great. This is over 10 years. But let's just say. 13. I think it's two forty eight. So CP exam. Technically speaking, which is what I was saying earlier, right? It's like, okay. You have to say, if I can, if you start looking at like these other keywords, non brand. Like, that to me, the, and you can categorize them as intent is top and middle. what are those keywords? This is the easiest one for me. like, this is top.
00:55:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Scroll down. Like, can we like look at the first one or just kind of slow? Hi, Sally.
00:56:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And I'm to competitor. This is so I'm running this right now. And it doesn't actually convert. So I'm like, don't know that these are actually customer conversions. These are probably leads. That's the problem. So it's like, if you have the system set up to know, right, going back to mercy or something, what do you want to measure? Okay. Well, then go set that up.
00:56:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So if these work, if these were customers, it would make sense. But I don't know if they are. Yeah, test bank is MCU. Right, so that's a good example of that, to me, is middle. They are looking for a software if they just don't know which one. So it's like, okay, middle. This is neither, but you could say middle because they're. The assumption would be there in the exam. Same thing, taking the exam, probably.
00:57:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 47 conversions across 10 years.
00:57:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, but God only knows when that one was running, but the key is that the. The phrase the actual keywords are in here. there's a million dollars worth of keyword data here. So if you. got rid of all the ninjas.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The last two years.
00:58:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, actually maybe not, I'm not sure this account is around, not long, I don't know what your account this is. Come on Google. Yeah, I mean, I don't know that this was set up right. But what's real is the key words. Like, this is real.
00:58:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This data is real.
00:58:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
conversions might not be. And then it's like, okay, if you dump this and you go through and you say TOF, M-O-F, B-O-F and just start categorizing these things. And then my other argument was then you test those. on the different sites, right? again, maybe you don't use another 71, right? So, they're looking for a test bank, you send them to another 71, or it's doing the test bank comparison or some . So, anyway, it still comes down to, I gotta figure out where customers actually come from. don't even believe that they're coming from I'm like, okay, yeah, like, sure, Google will take off this credit. Right. Yeah, But is it real? Is it true?
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I do think you would benefit from talking to win. He just is really, really smart and, you know, help you ask better questions. Um, he tell you, you know, he knows more than most people about the validity of the data and what's not valid, right? And I just think that plugging in another brain where you can actually ask questions of somebody who knows what they're talking about, um, would, yeah, I'm not opposed to talk to him at all.
01:00:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just saying, now I'm like, Oh, you know what? I need to, I need to understand what I want to. Understand like I when I started doing this I was like, oh Okay, like I really thought That this was gonna be different like that. I'm like, oh my god. This is the same the same. It's so the same And I'm like, all right, that doesn't make sense It just it's not what I thought it was gonna be Right, and then it's like this year had or I thought of the this breakout room I mean that in this whole freakin three-year period to me even this year's act It's like, okay, we're not even in a normal year Yeah Yeah Okay, well I would like to introduce the two of you because I just think even just having one conversation There will be at least one aha for you. That'll be worth it
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
sure so yeah but I think I'll be I'll be done with mercy stuff very I mean like I'm it's all I'm doing now I'm now I'm like oh okay it if me learning this and understanding this will just help everything 100% nobody else is going to drive this it is the only way you're going to increase that market share and grow the numbers where you want to like I mean you could sell it if somebody's gonna buy it and be happy and you'd get a lot of money but your goal was to grow it to get more money out of it and you know so let's do that let's see what or at least see what's possible explore all the options that are right around us and when being the expert that he it he's just very smart And you can just, like, because he does video calls, um, he did it with my client. And so he just watched him thinking about it. And then he'll go and show a report and show this and show that and just, like, he just thinks differently about it. And definitely at the very least on Mercer's level.
01:03:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. other bit I, I, I, I could tell like I was listening to Mercer for now. I'm going to go watch his stuff like a bunch of his stuff is going to be URL based. And I'm like, nope, I'm not doing that. Like, but that's fine. I don't have to do that. I can do like the way that I set a lead event is the form. So I'm like, okay, so I can just think of things like I know how the site works. And then I think, okay, like I'm going to wait to hear back from funnel kit. Like that date is in there. If they're like, yeah, no, that doesn't go to Google analytics, then I just turned scenario and say, Hey, I need to get this. This is within the data. based. I need it. How do we get it out? How do we get it to? I'm not sure where yet. Definitely Google Analytics, I think. So it's gonna be stuff like that.
01:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go do this email intro and I really hope that you guys will have a conversation because I think that I mean I'm the thing is that like you're the brain for it and there's nothing else and you have lots to do but this is really a big puzzle like it's a complex puzzle that requires a lot of data processing to be able to do and obviously to do it in a way where you're mitigating loss that you can't just you could but it'd be stupid to go just pour money out on it and see this work is this for her right so to be strategic about it get all that data so that's gonna take some time and Um, you're the only one that can drive that.
01:05:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yes, I'm I'm like, I got to build the fishing net and I'm going to fish.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, like I've got all the stuff.
01:05:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I've got all the stuff here.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I just need to put the net together.
01:05:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Now, like, yeah.
01:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will go introduction and then I will. I am planning on doing my Monday meeting calls with sweet love, but I will be on vacation.
01:05:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So it's just that. then I'm not coming to the one o'clock call, but I will talk to you on Monday. Okay, have a great weekend.
