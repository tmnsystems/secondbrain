Hello. Hello. How are you?
00:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, wait. Hold on. The volume's not working.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not maybe this time.
00:00:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There we go. Hi.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good.
00:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
are you, Fuji? Good. You're here.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry. I have a little bit of a fever and my brain is a little extra slow today.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Awesome.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Think about where we're at. Oh, I got your guys' Christmas card.
00:00:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's so beautiful. You guys are so beautiful, family. I forgot that, Dad.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. How are you?
00:00:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you?
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:00:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sorry if you were using all these things when you feel better.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. I think it's just this place that I live is killing me, but things will be raised in three years and I'm out of here and down in Arizona or Vegas and then just traveling all over, so I can do this.
00:01:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Get it through, get it through. Yeah, so good.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get your end of the year report? Your finances?
00:01:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Did you hit your goal? Oh no, we haven't. I get those on usually the 10th of the month, so I'll put that in before next call.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but hopefully I did. Good celebration time.
00:01:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm hoping on today's call we can go back into Delta.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just kind of want to finish it off and kind of talk through what I was thinking of.
00:01:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, issues we raised, and I think where I and this is where I kind of want to get help. Maybe you can probe me with questions and I probably should have done this with you when I first started it. That would have been more helpful, but now that we're at where we're at, I'd like to share where I think we're at and then maybe just kind of probe me with more questions and see where we can go from here as well, whatever.
00:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's do it.
00:02:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I really so first of all, I haven't put really money into this except for the website I committed $3,000 to build it and then another 3,000 to finish it. That's where we stand right now other than that just been my time and The reason I like this is because it's very it's no money on my end There's no out. There's no cash output required to have this product essentially. I make the sale You know and then I pay the thousand dollars with that sales proceeds, right? That's why I think I was initially attracted to it and you set up the call last time like Fuji If you're trying to make a quick buck, you know, that's one thing But you know and you said that like three times and you know after I thought about it I think yes, you read on the situation of 100% I heard that that I didn't have to put money down I'm one of the only clinics willing to do that You know because I can run a nationwide network and order from any state and that's what attracted me. I was like I I know how to do this. It's very simple to set up. No money on my part. Great. Let's do it. And that's what attracting it to be very straightforward. think you keyed in on that very quickly last time. And so I would like to be honest with you. And that's that is probably why I've been into this deal because because of that easy. No money. I know how to do it. And I've done that. And that's the part where I'm at. I've set up the clinic. So I have the ability to write orders from any of which I don't really have to do anymore because the company brain key is handling it. So really all I have to do is sell. But like you said, last time too, there's a lot of problems with that. haven't sold it. I would like to get good at it, know, internet selling to consumers, but I'm not good at it yet. And I think that's why I've just been paralyzed over the last seven months trying to even get a website together and what prompted me to just end up paying this money to this web developer. Cause I'm like, I just want something and once I have something, I can work with it. Um, that's where I'm at.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just a reminder, and we talked about this last week, but let me go back just a little bit further. Cause one thing you have a habit of doing is kind of shaming yourself for, I should of this, I should have that. Who we are is a combination of all of our experiences and it's our experiences that teach us the most. Sometimes we get a mentor and somebody points something out, but the thing that really stick with us are the things that we've felt and experienced. That's why my angel is famous for saying people won't remember what you say, but they'll remember how you made them feel. It's because we remember feeling more than anything. So like when we started, there was a lot, you have several things. different things that you were working on, different businesses, but also different goals. You had a new baby of that to be on the way. This is a new working relationship. There's a lot that had to be just kind of oriented between how we're working with each other and the me even trying to figure out what's priority, not just in terms of businesses, but in the business, in your life. All of that takes time, especially when we're only meeting and talking for one hour a week every week. So you have to keep that in perspective and relativity, right? The other thing is, I think all entrepreneurial people are going to be excited about low hanging fruit at one time or another until they realize what the cost of the fruit is. So your math was basically, uh, I get by $1,000. I turn in $1,000. Easy peasy. I've got the access to it. What math you were doing, and this is what most people do until they have enough experience to train them to do it, which is account for the time, account for the rent in your head, account for effective hourly rate, account for scale and opportunity. That energy and that mental space in your head is really prime real estate when you look at what you could be applying it to and the return on investment that you could get from it. It isn't just that. You have a relationship with another person. know You like to please themselves, which means at some point or another, probably throughout every week or a few times and at least, there's probably some pressure that swells up in you that goes, I gotta move this thing forward. You know, I have this person. Okay. So that is a cost. That is an energetic cost to you. That is a time cost to you. And we know that stress cortisol is a health cost to us. So that math has to include all those different variables when we're talking about what's an opportunity. So as we proceed to talk about this, I need you to always keep those things in your mind. Because some of the questions that I asked you is, you know, what do you want to do it for? Did you want to do it because it just seemed like easy money or did you want to do it because it seemed like easy money and you really are passionate about the technology and passionate about the opportunity. my premise was that you aren't passionate enough off about that particular opportunity and that idea because of what you told me about why you went into medicine like you're if I was going to prioritize what your values are it is and I'm like this so I'm not this is not a judgment how do I make the most amount of money in the least amount of time and enjoy what I'm doing because I don't work to live or live I don't have to work I work to supply my life so running it through that kind of culture how do you feel about it as an opportunity?
00:08:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
When I looked at the offer so the the potential to earn right if I make 50 sales a month that's fifty thousand dollars is an extra half million I thought that that's an attainable goal that I could shoot for when I'm thinking of trying to get customers across the nation but yeah when you look at the cost of you know how long it's been in my head This is one of my most frustrating projects in my life I've ever taken on because I just don't know how to move. And I think it comes down to I don't know how to sell this. I'm passionate about that I think people should have had brain scans. I still am. I think my grandpa should have had it. think my whole family should have it. I'm actually going to have them get scanned whether or not I continue this or not. I'm passionate about that, but I don't know how to sell this because of all those points you brought up. I don't think there's enough benefit that I can just gush about and I've been struggling for like five, six months trying to nail how to sell this and I still can't do it. So that's what bothers me.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's start with that. So one of the things is you have to understand that this is a long game play because you're talking about innovation. This is so one of the things that's. It's still innovative, like there are people doing it, but it's not the norm is baseline measurements. It's not the norm across businesses. It's not the norm anywhere. Most people don't even consider taking a baseline measurement. They will have a non-specific goal of I need to be better without qualifying that. I'm not, you know, good enough for one reason, whatever. My health is a enough, whatever. So what people are generally doing and their typical practices, I go to the doctor, the doctor tells me what's broke, tells me how to fix it. Generally speaking, that is a band-aid approach. It's reactive, not proactive. So longevity is handled as a proactive approach versus reactive. So the first thing that you have to do is know that, so the uphill battle is convincing people to be proactive, but you don't really have to do that. There is a market of people, there is level of awareness in the market of people who understand. one, that longevity is a thing. Number two, that it's something that they're interested in. And number three, that it is a proactive approach. What they may not know is data is going to be a huge part, a huge tool, right, for them in their arsenal. the data that they need, so like DEXA scans and a brain scan, how amazing would that be to know your composition and to be able to know where you're starting from. So people will buy thousands of dollars of all these different healthcare protocols. the only data feedback they have is what they can notice in their bodies. Most people aren't super aware. I am hyper aware. I can notice the tiniest degree. I'll go to the doctor with the doctor be like, well, you shouldn't feel that. I'm like, okay, well, I I told you when I got here, you're going to tell me I should have feel it and I'm going to tell you it's minute and you're going to see the results and that's how it is like I am super sensitive. Most people are not like that. So they may be getting a result and be completely unaware of it. And if they're unaware that they're actually improving it, then they're going to get disheartened and they're not going to be diligent with a protocol that actually could be improving their brain health and improving their gut health and improving their muscle composition and all these different things. And so having a baseline, having these scans can help people know for sure. It's quantitative data, qualitative, quantitative, both probably, to let them know if whatever they're doing is actually making a difference. So it's not that heavy. It's not, it's not that it's not doable or that it's too hard to do. It's that that hasn't even been the conversation. that's what has to happen. So you're like, okay, and what? So the issue was you have these brain scans. Why would I buy them? Because my chiropractor told me, okay, fine, you've got this tiny bit of a market that's not scalable, right? There is a portion of gratuitous sales that's called them that you can make. But if you want to take this out and be able to market it and get your 50 million or even 20 million or tell me whatever it is, right? You can't be relying on gratuitous sales that may or may not come through from over-exuberant chiropractors and why would they, know, like that's just that's hoping and that's not a good business practice. That's right. But what you can do is tap into the longevity markets and teach people. And now the thing is, there's going to be these caveats that we're going to talk to you, right? And so the conversation is going to go a lot like this, because it kind of requires a spokesperson to get some awareness. And this is why I was talking about, you know, maybe coming with some kind of affiliate arrangement with somebody who already has a platform and already has these eyeballs and is already super interested in this type of stuff, who doesn't have the ability to get this kind of baseline data for themselves or for their audiences, because their audience are primed to say yes to this. All they have to do is be pointed as to where to go. And so what you need to do is to be able to create a case and a presentation that says brain health is, you know, we're going. We can look at genetics and we can make prediction that you've got this kind of percentage odds of. Alzheimer's or this or that or the other thing we're also living in a time where DNA we're noticing that DNA can be altered by the way we eat has been negatively altered by the way that we eat can also be improved by the way that we eat we're learning things that amyloid plaque can be broken up with ultrasound that's insane we thought there was no cure for dementia and Alzheimer's and turned out there are opportunities so participating in this innovation and being able to offer it to your family and the people that you care about as well as being able to have a global impact on other people's families that's huge and you have access to the guy who has the scan that nobody else has right now that can be done in your clinic and a few other clinics yeah so the other clinics would benefit from your work your guy doesn't do any marketing so again we did make the play to try to go get some celebrity people in the longevity space. Before you even open your mouth of what that does, you have to have a contract ready to say, I'm going to suggest something to you. There's an NDA, there's an on compete. I get this. If you agree to this, we'll continue with this conversation. If we don't, I'm pulling back because this is an uphill battle.
00:16:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm not willing to fight for you. I brought this up about affiliates and he said the company owner doesn't want to have anything to do with affiliates that aren't doctors. He said if they're a doctor, then just like a chiropractor, MD, they can order the scan themselves. He said where I get is any influencer that is not a doctor because they have no ability to order. Even if they sold this to their listeners or the followers, a non-doctor can't get it for them because they're not a doctor can't order. He said those are the people that you can absolutely own that if you have with an influencer that's not a doctor, they need you. They can't order the scan without your clinic. So he said, you can drive the sales, earn whatever the cut is. I don't want to deal with it. He only wants to talk to doctors that have their own clinic that can actually write the prescription for their. That's where he said, I will handle those.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what we could do with the developer on some kind of coding is create, let's say, a front-facing kind of application that would be insight only to specific types of influencers who, I don't even know if their doctor's home on this. I know that not all of them are. I should give her a name, give me a doctor. Neuroscientists, not the kind that could do this thing. And then I know that, well, did I say, what's the space? I see you say, stay vast. right would be another one. So anyway, let's say that we've got this invite only invitation, but you're you're like these are going to be personal connections, conversations, introductions, if anybody's going to promote this. And so what we would need to do is have a way that you own a like a database, right? That says, so if they make a sale, they have to have a way to connect and it could happen through API integrations where they have a customer that says, okay, I'm interested in this, but before I pay for it or order anything or whatever, let me see if there is an office in my area that has the scams available. And so they put in their location, they pull up an office. So yes, there's an office now through other chiropractors, celebrity. is writing the influencers, then we set up some kind of integration with their office and they're scheduling that says, yes, you can do it. But you own the piece that connects the influencer and their chiropractor office and you get a percentage of the sales off the top. That could happen. That could be built out.
00:19:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, but I like the idea of just going straight to like an influencer like that one.
00:19:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
were looking at his website last week for the marketer guy.
00:19:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll handle the prescriptions. You just get people that come to my website by the chiropractor things interesting. I essentially outsourced it a second time and I'm not the one writing the physical scripts and yeah, like you said, just take a cut essentially as a referral fee. think that's interesting. Heart little that that's a little harder for me to wrap my head around initially. It's more of that more of like a network effect but I can see like just partner and straight with an influencer who's not a doctor and just say I'll write the scripts for you and collect the money you just sell you know that and that makes sense to me and have like a website that essentially the website's essentially like when the influencer's like go here to get your scan it's just a simple website that says yeah you know this is what it is right and so to make it real simple they could say go to um so day of forward slash delta and so it would redirect which would allow you to cookie it and say okay this came from Dave and to second that you say hey if you're a friend of Dave make sure that you say where did you hear it from Dave and then you get a special savings code Dave Asprey right so he gets credit for that he gets his code and credit and then because you own it you get your code and credit from brain key the chiropractor gets their business everybody's like we love Fuji oh I see Do you mean like as a follow-up way to treat it after I have this client say hey, there's a chiropractor in your area that knows what to do with it.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No, no, no, no. So, so let's say they were like, I want this scan and Dave told me about it. So I'm going to DaveAspiray.com. Now it is your website and they're putting in their address and looking for if they're a clinic nearby.
00:21:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I don't need to do that. My clinic, my online clinic handles it. My clinic would do that. My clinic would give them the script. They don't need it. That's, that's my value add. I write the procedure.
00:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But your clinic doesn't, isn't the one that does it and they need another clinic to do it because of their location.
00:21:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I do it. I do it in all 50 states.
00:21:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I said. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah.
00:21:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I write them their script and then they just walk into the hospital and get the scan. already, I already have contracts with the scanners.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They just need hear the money, I do the prescription, I pay the facility, they just walk in and get it done. Yep. Yeah, so the biggest thing is whether we hire a copywriter or that's the great thing about somebody like if you did business with Dave Asprey, he'd probably want to write the copy himself, he'd probably want to have a conversation, maybe interview you if you were interested about it, interview the creator if he was interested about it or just talk about it himself, you say, look, I don't want to be, you know, I want to be faceless really, but let me tell you everything it does and then he could just talk about it and say why he's excited about it. He'd probably want to get the scan himself, see what it is, learn what it does and it might even be a year waiting long. He might want to see, he might want to get his baseline and wait a year and see what is the change, you know? Copy. even notice the change before I go tell my audience about this.
00:23:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's right. That's right. Or if he wants, or if he thinks he could sell it with just saying everyone needs a brain baseline, maybe he'll just be like, oh, know, I don't need the weight. It's just good to have a brain and rise a baseline.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And his understanding that might be that might be all that needs to happen.
00:23:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, I like it. So maybe not. I'm just still paralyzed. Okay. So I've been wanting to do this influencer thing. was just, you know, find one influencer that wants to make this their thing. And I'll give them most of the profit. You know, I just want to slice. They can keep it. But I've been paralyzed again because I'm like, well, I just need a website that when they start investigating me, but it's interesting. You're kind of saying, well, maybe they want to have the creative license to do your website, the landing page, make it so they know how to convert. And then I pay for obviously I'll pay for my own website, but maybe they want to create a so you're what you're kind of saying is that, you know, some of these influencers actually might be okay with not seeing the website as long as I do it.
00:24:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. He was a nerd on a marketer first. So of all people, that might be the biggest thing. He attends lots of marketing events, lots of different events. You could meet him in person and have somebody introduce you to him. But what you would want to do is have an elevator speech very quick, like get him excited kind of presentation of what it can do. Delta, as far as what I've seen in brain key, that doesn't exist. No, it doesn't have any kind of a good pitch. So it would work to take in that you could really and Claude does way better than chat TBT on this. Have a conversation and tell them just like, Claude, I need you to be a world cloud these are the things. This is my plan. I'm going to reach out to Dave Asprey. Like, this is our mission. What can we do to have the best success at it? Thought is amazing at that kind of logic and job. We could do it on a call together. You could do it on your own and then we go tweak it and improve it.
00:25:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But I want to come in with prepared so even if they don't look at it, want to have a deck. And, you know, obviously it's probably not, we don't need to go through slides. But I want to be prepared if I get in front of people like that, you know, to have a deck. Show them I looked at it, show them I ran the numbers, you know, how much we stand to make. 100%. Well, my clinic can do on the back end to power his settles. That's essentially what.
00:25:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're also going to want to have a pitch of what you would pay him, what he would get, not eight percentage. want real numbers and then you want the real numbers compound. So let's say, you know, only 1% of your audience size. then here's where you go do homework and find out what his audience size is. Isn't. Listen, let's say 0.5% of your audience is interested in actually goes and does it. Here's the amount of money that you could earn if they go book it and they do is. But let's say 5% does Dave. Here's the money. Let's say 10% does Dave. know what mean? Because those are those are realistic numbers that could happen. I don't know about 10%, but 2% potentially that actually book it and go do it. But then that compounds over time, Because they're going to come back and get their baseline. So if you say, hey, I'm not only going to give you a percentage on the front end sales, I'm going to give you a percentage on all recurring sales. That makes it super . Most people don't offer that. But you could do that and say for the first 5 years, you know, after you first share it, we will give you recurring scan sales for 5 years.
00:26:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And we have like a friend and family code too. So if a friend gives it to them, I could say if they bring their friend in, I'll give
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
your cut of that too because you brought me the initial guy and then he told his friends. You can also have second tier affiliates. So that means that if Dave refers another affiliate to you, he gets a slice off the top of their sales.
00:27:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like another influencer?
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So a sad influencer, let's say he does a podcast with somebody says, Hey, you want to get in? Okay. Well, I'm top tier. I get 25% of all the sales. If you go under me, you'll get 20%.
00:27:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll get 5%.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you still keep that commission 25% for affiliates, but Dave gets a slice and they get a slice. Dave gets a slice for referring people who refer people.
00:27:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right. Oh, yeah. would, you know, I would pay that every day because it's. You are brilliant, Tina. I should have talked to you about this six months and you hit on the just to start a step back, but. Oh, no, you can.
00:27:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't have the positive after saying I'm really.
00:27:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You really hit a, you really hit a chord about the mental toll. Because, yeah, you're right. took on this project. I know the founder real well now. Oh, yeah, you're right. I want to, I want to do well, just not only to pad my own pockets, because I also want to see this technology go. I like it. I believe in it. And I think people should have a baseline head scan. But you're right, that mental toll. I'm not a stressed person. I don't get stressed about this, but it's like, gosh, dang it. It's more like a frustration. I'm like, man, I need to be doing this and I can't do it. So I've done all the other stuff, right? Set up my clinic, set up the business structure, set up the back end, set up the scanning. have all that, but I'm not doing the one thing which is get business that really is important. And so, yeah, you hit on that, that kind of that, the mental headspace. Yeah, man, it's just, that's the thing that, yeah, it's been driving me crazy for six months. I can't. I'm not sure how to do this, but yeah. I like this plan. It's more of a B2B plan too, right? Now, instead of selling it to consumers, I'm changing my business to sell just to another business. Another business owner, in this case, it's an influencer. It's a business. So I make one sale and I put all my effort into making one big sale, convincing an influencer to take this on. And that's what I do. Then I could do what I do best, which is run my clinic on the back end, make sure these guys have prescriptions, make sure they get to their scan on time, call them, make sure they're happy with the results, all that I could do. And just essentially fulfillment.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it involves two of my favorite words, which is leverage and compounding, because it is a lot of work on the front end, but they go through most of the rest of the work for you. then that first of all, the message gets out there, the message lives on the internet, people keep finding it by keywords. They do some research and chappy GPT sends back to this podcast about brain key or delto, right? It just it just keeps feeding you over and over again and you getting to your 10 million net worth goal, just you get there exponentially faster, while also making a difference in the health community and in families and everything else, like that is those are my favorite kinds of wins, like why do you to do that kind of stuff? But so yes, we have been working together for six months. Lots of people never hire anybody to come in and inspect their jobs, inspect their businesses, don't be accountable, don't actually do stuff. You have done so much and your option was a $40,000 watch or coaching and you chose coaching, so like you really got and I think you earned enough money to go to the watch also. That was my goal is that you make enough money that makes it worth it. So like, really, it's good for us to be humble and go, well, could have done this differently. better, but it's better for us to really focus on our wins because the positive reinforcement, right? The energy of those wins automatically filters out the negative behaviors that we have because we just want more of the good. So keep that in mind too.
00:31:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I want to put together kind of a plan for this next week. I just don't want to make sure I don't run out of time, but I really want to take action on this and I have time this week. What I would like to think about doing is keep the website on thought is obviously, but what I want to do is put together at least one presentation if you think that's what I should be doing and just put together presentation like next week I'm going to actually talk to someone and I don't really want to target Dave.
00:31:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay hold on one sec please.
00:31:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Can I drive for a sec? Yes please.
00:31:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay so there's two things that I would like you to do. Number one is I would like you to That's a conversation I want you to go to chat GPT and Claude with. so what I want you to do is get a list of 15 other influencers that make sense to promote this. Okay, now averaging those 15 people and their personalities and their followings and what they're interested in everything else, help me to create a craft, a presentation that will make the value of this brain scan so crystal clear and the fact that they can't get it anywhere and that it's so unique, so crystal clear that they just want to sign up immediately. So I want you to pretend like you're a world-class marketer, Claude, GPT, right? I want you to ask all the questions that you need to ask in order to know everything that you need to know to make successful and then I want you to help me craft the presentation. Start the conversation. there. If you spend all week on that, what you have and come back to me next week, then we will work on improving it from there. But please do not talk to anybody until I tell you you've got a presentation we're showing. It's not about me per se as at least getting some feedback from somebody else. We are very blind to our own. We just have blind spots and we need feedback. You can share it with Mark or anybody else that has, know, marketing expertise that you believe in and say, like, just nothing, just give him the pitch. okay, say, like, I'm going to do this pitch. is my plan. Can I just like give it to you? And you tell me how you really feel about But I know that Marcus definitely focusing on things like that now with. peptides and and whatnot so it's good Yeah, so thank you Tina.
00:35:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is what I needed. I I can't tell you how I've been stuck in this Esther as just told me that in the you know the six years seven years She's known me. She's never seen me so Stuck in the project because usually I just you know whether it fails or not I just I go through and at least I figure out what I'm doing wrong change it make it better this I have to even I feel like I haven't even took it taking a step. I don't even know What the step is so thank you for giving me at least some direction here like just at least a way I could swim And then if I up, then I'm gonna you know then we could change it, but I A lot of confidence in this I know but like in the last seven months I haven't even taken a step where I can iterate like yeah, I just I Want to take like one step and be like, okay, that's not right. Let's Change it, but I haven't even done that which is insane and I know yeah again So thank you for giving me little kick here.
00:36:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are very welcome. So I gave you a book I don't think you read it is um break through advertising Break through advertising.
00:36:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I did the uh, what did we do? We did the blink not the blink coin. It was It was that one of the the the marbles and the cup the sand. That's the book I read I did it on books on tape and then I read email. I read the two books that I've done so far Switch. Yeah, switch.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. breakthrough advertising is a master class in advertising and marketing There if you had had breakthrough advertising in your brain, which is a very dense book It comes with a companion kind called through advertising mastery, which was written by a client of mine Um, and it's actually owned by client of mine. But the book was written in 1996. And it is a 200 year study of marketing and the marketing tactics. But the reason that you got stuck is because you weren't looking at it from a marketers perspective. You were looking at it as business like you can see that there's value and it can make money. But a marketer would have said, okay, and now what? That's the question I asked you. That's the question the clients asked you. What am I going to do with this? What is the value? What is the unique selling point? How are you going to sell me? And that had been asked or answered properly. And once it did, it opened everything up. So if you would study Breakthrough Advertising and go ahead and get the commanding guide because it'll make it easier to at least get your toe wet and dip your toe on, know what I mean? My brain. Anyway, even if it takes you a couple years to get through it, Fuji, you will be better. like I've been doing marketing for 22 years and like professionally and before that just kind of natural sales probably you as well but I'm still learning from it. The client that wrote the companion guide Breakthrough Advertising Mastery so he would write copy as a copywriter I would improve it every single time. He went through Breakthrough Advertising again because he'd read it several times in order to make the companion guide. I cannot ever improve his copy hardly ever anymore. He just got so good at it because he understands the psychology and it created a systematic approach in his head who's like these are the questions I need to ask. This is the way I need to answer it and so he does it and my point is that you will be able to be an even better coach to yourself and run into less of these problems. and it will change the paradigm and the way that you look at things so that you don't get stuck like this. only that, but when things approach you as an opportunity, you'll have a whole new set of eyes to filter it through automatically and go, I see the potential, I see the issues, I could solve those issues, let's talk about it. I see the potential, I see the issues, that's an uphill battle that would take years to overcome, not interested.
00:39:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, yeah, I like those books that kind of fundamentally change how I think, I think Rich Dad, Poor Dad did that for me when I was young about, you know, the value of assets. Yeah, yeah, I, you know, there's other, like, Emith Mastery, I remember reading that early on about how you need to pay attention to the operations of a business. And in business, I think stuck with me. So yeah, adding a book about the marketing angle, which is kind of that piece about how do you sell something, know, where the revenue comes. And I think that'd be helpful in the long term.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I'll take a look at that book. Okay. All right. Well, you still have like 15, 18, whatever minutes.
00:40:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, can we, uh, can we work on refining? Okay. So I, I have asked CPT, you know, how do I market the value of this? I haven't asked them about, you know, a presentation. So is it helpful to share about me? Like, why am I doing this? Because I have a personal story.
00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My grandfather very well to do far away better than anything. Story says better than anything.
00:40:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes. And that's what prompted me. When, when I heard about this technology, I was like, this is no brainer, right? Because my grandpa was rich. wasn't super rich, but he had a lot of money. And, uh, if he would, you know, if he would have just taken a scan of his brain and we had asked, which is the sad thing that we said, you know, shouldn't my grandpa get a body scan? Doctors like, Oh, no. Are you having headaches? He's like, no. Well, you don't need a scan, but you know, then that year he was 70, know, it's 80 86 had a stroke and died, right? like frustrating for us because we had the money, we could have scanned them and who knows if we would have saw the clot, you know, we, you know, we might have been able to fix it. So anyway, that's my personal story about why I'm like, absolutely, people that are that have a little money should hate to find out if their brain is okay or not. You know, that's my personal story about why I really feel this and there's been people with Alzheimer's in my family.
00:41:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. You know, especially if you're genetically predisposed to it, you want to get that information. But the other thing that is really important to point out is that apathy can happen even at the highest levels. It can happen in doctors, you can go to an apathetic and place a doctor who's like, you know, nonchalant, whatever you want to call it. But, but nobody's going to care about your health as much as you do. And so if you are road blocked by a doctor who doesn't want to work as hard as you do working on your health, then one of your alternatives, you don't have a lot of alternatives, this is putting the power of your health back in your own hands. And when it comes to the medical field, that's really difficult to do. There's not a lot of venues where you can do that. This is one of them.
00:42:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yep. And then if you have the right influencer, they can help create that story about, well, do you do with it? What do you do with knowing this data? Yeah. And even if there is a road block, you know, at least here's some stuff that you could do. And that's maybe that's what Dave Aspiray's his whole platform is about, right?
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and here's the other part of the pitch for them is like the things that they need to do is going to involve them purchasing products you're already selling. So like they sell products that have to do with gut health and brain health and all these other things. So this brain skin is going to be a gateway to helping them sell other things that they're already selling ethically because they have the same interest. want to maximize their health. Dave's goal is to live to like 200 years old or something like that or 148 or 98 or some long time. Um, like Brian Johnson, that guy that's like, I'll live forever. Yeah. Yeah. He wants to live forever. That that doesn't whack job. Anyway, I need to not be so judgy. Calm down, Tina. Anyway, honestly, where would we be without the people that are crazy? I mean, honestly, everybody that's changed the world has been crazy one way or another. And I get called crazy too. So whatever.
