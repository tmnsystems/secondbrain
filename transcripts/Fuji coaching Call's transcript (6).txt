00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Tina Marie: Oh, finally, okay. Cool.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hey! There we go!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Tina Marie: Hey? Sorry.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh! No all good.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Tina Marie: Is, that. I don't know why.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tina Marie: Well, I know the second time was because I started the wrong meeting, but the 1st time I don't know what's up with that. How are you?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Good. Doing well.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Tina Marie: You guys get some new art on that wall.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: No, it's a. It's a.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's a TV.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Tina Marie: Screen. TV, I was gonna say, like.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Tina Marie: I don't remember that, but it looks like a screen.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: We got some magical mushrooms. There you go.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Tina Marie: That's cool. So how did your conversation with Mirka go.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Tina Marie: Don't do that, man. I'll be yawning all day.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: No happy Easter. By the way. Um.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Tina Marie: Thank you. Did you guys have a good Easter.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, good. We had our family over, and big breakfast and everything. So yeah, it was all good.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. My Fuji Alarm.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Tina Marie: Um. Yeah. America, America. Oh, and happy Easter. Sorry. I just dove right in. It's Monday. I've got to work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, well, so I first, st I, you know, because Paul is. Technically. Still this, you know, CEO, right? So I brought it up with him first.st

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: And. I was kinda I I explained why I wasn't. I don't think this is a good fit for this right now with, you know, the managing role.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: And he brought up that. On the email front. She's still doing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, right? With the with the exceptions that I was frustrated about last week. And and that's right. You know, most of the sorting is very mundane. You know, it's 90, 95%.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Simple stuff. Right? I hey, I need to schedule a visit, hey? I need the medical records. Hey? Did my patient get scheduled right? So she I agree she's doing it right. The things that she struggled with, and what I got frustrated was was kind of the outside of the box. Things things that I think someone more experienced would have picked up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. But I do see, I I do see a way where.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: He's right. I don't want necessarily him doing the Monday and emails all day. He's right. I'd rather have her doing those. You know, and then passing up.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: The uh. The complicated ones.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I, you know. So that was resolution on that part about like the roles. I think I'm happy with Mirka sorting the emails is, you know, with the caveat that when something's out of the ordinary there's like a.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: A case manager that's even the slightest bit frustrated like, hey? Where's our thing, you know, like. Anything like that. She escalates it to me, and Paul.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I think, like on that front. I'm okay with her keeping that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Now the separate question was, was her her strength with managing. And that was the second problem I had right, like she delegated a task to one of the doctors.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: And didn't tell the doctor. Why it was different. She provided no context.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that was just a completely rookie mistake, you know, just she's never managed before, so she didn't like Esther was saying. She didn't even think to tell the doctor like, Hey, you've done it a hundred ways this time. This way is different. Here's why she didn't say that she was just like, Do it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: And the doctor fucked it up, of course, or messed it up and. That's why I got so frustrated a second time.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: And on that. You know. I think.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: What my reasoning was originally was correct, that Mirica is not a manager. She's never supervised others. She's never led a team. She's never had to manage up. Um.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: And it was a rookie mistake. But it's a mistake that you know. I'm not really. I'm not keen on letting her.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Train for 2 years as we talked about on our call last week, you know, till she's better at it. And so, too. That's why I didn't want to pay her the the rate that I was offering the other people as managers, because they've one of them. Ollie has been managing for 9 years. I found out when I talked to her, and then um, Paula, which is Paul's sister, has been managing for 3 to 4 years now at, you know, at call centers.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. That's why I didn't think the pay parity was fair on that end, and I still believe that it's not the right path at this time to have her manage people.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: So Paul agreed with that, too. He he didn't have any problem with that. Um where he fought me was her pay right? So I did increase her pay to 1,500.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: And so he was fighting me on the the pay part, not fighting me. He was just explaining that, you know miracle was our second hire. Ollie was our 3.rd And you know Mirka does. You know he was arguing loyalty. So he's you know she does a lot of overtime. She doesn't ask for any more money. She's working 8 to 8, and this is her whole life, and he says, because of that loyalty she should get paid.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like Ollie is getting paid now, and Paula. As a manager, 1,500.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: And originally I was paying her 1,200. And uh.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think that's where I kind of got really front, because I was telling him like, well, experience matters too. You know I gave the example of the Us. Army. Like the most faithful recruits in the Us. Army, they can only become what's called a petty officer. They cannot become a commander, a general, or a sergeant, because they don't have college.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: But they can get up, the petty officer, and I was like. You know there's a reason for that, that if you want to be higher, you have to have either the experience or you have to go to college, or you know Mba school.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Just like the army. Uh uh.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: And so this is where like I got, I got really frustrated because he kept saying, Okay, well, that's fine. But she's doing the job, and I was like, she's not doing the job. She's messing up the job. And he said, Well, you know, if we condense her role a little bit, and I help her. Well, then, I was like, well, then, I'm paying 2 people to do one job. So he kept talking about this, and I was. And ultimately I was just like. Nope, I'm not paying for inexperience, you know you can. I'll I'll reward loyalty. I've given her a raise every 6 months.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: But there's a certain point where I'm not paying her as much as Ollie. I'm not paying her as much as Paula. They have more experience. You know, and he kind of was like, well.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Ollie and Paula. Sometimes aren't as reliable as Mirka. He's like, look at how many vacations. So he actually pulled up the vacation schedule. He's like, look how many vacations.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: They're taking. They're taking an average of, you know. 2 days of work, you know. Vacations a month. And I said, Well, that's fine. That's our Pto. Right? They get a Pto day every month, and they've saved. There's.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: So he was just saying that, you know, like Mirka doesn't take anything off. She take it. He kept arguing that you know the loyalty thing. So it made me frustrated because I was like.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: If there's anyone that values loyalty, it's me like I promoted her to manager because of her loyalty. I gave her this shot because she's. Loyal, and so I got. I was like really upset when he kept pushing on that so.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Anyway, I I just I let it ride. I didn't. I didn't really after I kind of told him like, no, I'm not gonna experience um. You know that was on Wednesday. I had that talk, and then Thursday and Friday I just let it go.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I've just been thinking about it. So. That's where I'm at right now is I'm going to keep her in the in the role where she's doing my email triage because I do agree that it's better to have Paul not doing the email triage.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, but with the caveat that she escalates. Difficult or angry emails to me. And Paul immediately.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: And she did that on Friday, a couple of times. There were like emails that were strange and. She gave it to us that was perfect.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: But where I'm at with her role is, I'm gonna take away all managing duties. I think Paul is. Gonna take over. She was supposed to manage 2 people, one person doing our data entry and one person doing our uh. Kind of a coordinating. I'm gonna I'm gonna move that role to Paul again.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then regarding her pay. My plan is to drop her because she's not managing. I'm gonna drop her back to the 1,200 that I was comfortable with. So.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's the last part I haven't really aired out. But I think I'm gonna I'm gonna do. Is the is the drop. The payback to where I was comfortable, which was 1,200.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: And keep Ollie and Paul up. The managers at the 1,500 rate.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: When you promoted Mirca. Did you tell her it was a trial basis.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: I did. I think we we had a talk that you know. I I told her. I you know I recognize that you're uh. You've not managed before, but you know. That's why you'll have Paul to help you along. I didn't. I don't know if I explicitly said Trial, though.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Tina Marie: Did she realize that she was at risk of maybe losing that money.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: No.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Tina Marie: And. Um.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Tina Marie: The new role that she's doing. Is it more complicated than what she was doing.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Tina Marie: So she's upgraded her value to you.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Tina Marie: And we're talking about $300 a month.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, her. Her pay at the old role was 1050. And when she took the manager role or this new role.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: The email. I call it the email triage kind of like the email sorting. Email sorting plus managing 2 people.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's when I gave her an increase to the 1,200. Technically, it was 1,200. Yeah, 1,200.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So are we talking about 3 different or 2 different promotions.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: Bye. No, it was that one. You're right. It was 1,200. And then right, and that's that's where we settled. And then, when Ollie and Paula.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Said, Hey, we'd like to work for you full time. I offered both of them $1,500.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then that's when Paul came back and said, Hey, that's not fair. America's been your most loyal, and you just paid Paula.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Tina Marie: No. Okay, I I don't. That that's good. I I got the answer that I needed to have.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tina Marie: So. I think the issue.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Tina Marie: Primarily. Is actually comparing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Tina Marie: When there probably shouldn't be comparing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, interesting!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Tina Marie: So we've talked about the fact that there are multiple currencies right? Like.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Sure.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Tina Marie: Time. Energy.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Tina Marie: Um. Money is just one of them.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Agree.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Tina Marie: Mirka did add more value.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Tina Marie: Value is something we do correlate with money, we pay for more value, we pay for convenience. We pay for peace of mind, we pay for reliability, we pay for loyalty, we pay for all kinds of different things.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Tina Marie: Muka did.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Tina Marie: Up, level. Is it not a $300 a month value.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Tina Marie: Stand alone. Do not compare to anybody else. What did she take off of anybody else's plate to do that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Tina Marie: Or.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: But freeze Paul up. Um. I mean, you know.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: It frees Paul up like 3 HA day.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Tina Marie: Approximately, how many. A day. Fuji.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tina Marie: That kind of stuff.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's why Paul's been able to help me with more reports and.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tina Marie: Paul, you pay $4,000 a month. So now let's go do his effective hourly rate and see if that $300 doesn't make perfect sense. But I bet you it will.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, okay. I see.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Tina Marie: So actually, you know what we're just gonna do this real quick super fast. So. What does how many hours a week does Paul work.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: For. Oh, I just I! His rate is 25 an hour.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Tina Marie: And and so we'll just do that math. Then hold on! Where's my clear button? Okay, so.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Tina Marie: 3. Times 25 times 5 times 4.5 equals.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Tina Marie: That's not right. 3 times, 25 times.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Tina Marie: For or no. Damn it! Done it!

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Tina Marie: One month. Okay? So it's 3 HA day, 3 HA day, times 5 days a week. Times 4 points.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Tina Marie: 2 5, roughly weeks per month is 63 h, 6. Ah, times, 25.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tina Marie: $1,593 worth of money time if you looked at it that way. So pretty sure she earns her $300.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Didn't think of it that way. Yeah.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Tina Marie: Perspective.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: That was comparing. Yeah, I agree.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Tina Marie: Perspective is everything, and value is not. Comparable.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Tina Marie: Always it's apples and oranges. They're doing different things for you that are valuable and needing different things. But.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Tina Marie: Taking care of something that was so important that you had Paul do it. And freeing him up, is still.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Tina Marie: Higher level value to you.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. That's true.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Then they are.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Tina Marie: So. Taking all of the things into account.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Tina Marie: It's not. The other people's fault that she doesn't take vacation, but that's still a blessing and a value to you that she's available more often.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: It is.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Tina Marie: That she works those kinds of hours, that this is her life. You know.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: To give something and to take it back when it has such an impact on her life and so little. Impact on yours.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Tina Marie: Due to. More than anything, an error on your part.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I was.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tina Marie: Should eat that cost just on that merit. Alone.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Tina Marie: But. You're not really eating the cost. You got the value you're paying for. It.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: No, that's fair. I didn't think of that one. Yeah.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Tina Marie: And you will actually increase your value to your team and to Paul. To explain what you recognized.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Tina Marie: And what you fix, assuming that you'll fix that. Um.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Tina Marie: Because they'll understand the difference between a leader and. A ruler or a boss is that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Tina Marie: You're willing to recognize. Fallibility in yourself.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Tina Marie: Or. Even if we don't call it that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Tina Marie: Um a perspective shift, a willingness to consider other perspectives. And to.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Tina Marie: Look at the whole, and the value of the person. Not just as a.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Tina Marie: Did you do exactly what I wanted you to do? Kind of thing. Instead, what value do you bring? And will I look at all of that? Not what you did wrong, but what you do right.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Tina Marie: That's incredibly important. And if you show that the loyalty you already have is profound.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Tina Marie: But I mean you'll get people that will stay with you till they die. If you wanted.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Alright! Yeah, I think it's.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think it's good. I I didn't think about that, but. Yeah, it does free up, Paul. Did you help help me out a lot more so.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Tina Marie: If we're talking 15 HA week. That's huge.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay, you also have to consider, though, if it's a mundane task. It's not just 15 h. It's part of his soul.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Tina Marie: A person that thinks and manages and is as creative as he is is problem solving. To spend 3 HA day doing that type of stuff.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Tina Marie: It eats at you, it grinds at you. So he's not only going to have more time, but he'll have more energy to put to better.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, I mean, the emails aren't necessarily grind. They're all a little bit different. But yeah, I mean, ultimately, you're sorting the emails and just need scheduling.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Tina Marie: Admin task. Fuji, how do you feel about admin task? And what does it do for your energy?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's not not wonderful.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Tina Marie: No. Paul is not, you know. He's not that kind of person, Mirka probably is. They're the type of people that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Tina Marie: The people that show up day in and day out, and don't take vacations. Those are your worker bees. They're actually happy doing that.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Tina Marie: You can't be. I can't be.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Tina Marie: I have to do it. I make myself do it. I am unhappy doing those types of things. There are people that are truly just.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Tina Marie: Content. Operating like that.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Tina Marie: But those people are not the problem solvers. The leaders, the advocates, all the things that you've explained to me that Paul is. So I promise you.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Tina Marie: He will be much, much happier. Which also means he will be more productive and more valuable. You may not notice it right away, but I bet you pretty soon you'll start to. You'll have to look for it, maybe, and just go. You know what.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Tina Marie: You may not be able to quantify and and tell delineate whether it's. The time.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Tina Marie: Or the task. But there will be some of that in there.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep. Okay. That's fair.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Tina Marie: And I'll give you one more thing. Imagine that the price is.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Was. Okay.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Tina Marie: It.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: Paul was asking, Well, how about? He asked for compromise. He said, Well, how about we? We take away her direct management of people. Let her focus on the email triage. He said, I'll take, you know. I'll take.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'll take back those 2 other employees, and they'll be my. Under my management, directly.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Let miracle do the email, and then she'll she'll she'll do 1,400 a month instead of 15. And so that was.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Tina Marie: I still think. I still think you should do the 15, and just really show them that, you know. That's.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Tina Marie: Because you get to do 2 things in in 1. 1st of all, you get to show Mirka your honor and respect for her. You also get to show that to Paul. But you also get to tell him you know what, Paul. I did. The math.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Tina Marie: And what it saves in your time, I really value. So just having you available to work and do these other things for me is worth paying, Mirka the extra 300. So now you're showing, Paul that that's his value to you. Um, so those those are.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Tina Marie: Pretty significant, and he advocated for her, not for himself. He was being a great leader. He was not being selfish.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's true.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Tina Marie: Maybe maybe because he doesn't want to do the emails there, there could be some selfishness and that but the way that he advocated for her pay. I really doubt that that's the case. I think it was really for her. So this is like.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Tina Marie: You know. Be like Paul. Paul was. Paul was great.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, well, they are. They are like dating. So it is kind of free.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh, well, you know. Okay. Other incentives. There.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. So then, anyway, okay, I agree. No, I agree. I think I think the value that she takes. Because yeah, Paul, like every day when he start. He started like a month ago, for the 1st hour, 2 h. He was just doing emails.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because we get like 50 to a hundred in the morning. So, yeah, I mean, yeah, just his time alone is is worth the upgrade to have him help me more. I agree.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Tina Marie: We can move on. But I I do want to say one more thing because Paul has brought to you ideas about spreadsheets and reporting and things like that. Um. It was just a new thought that I had.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Tina Marie: He's definitely going to be more valuable and more useful, just knowing that that type of brain. Isn't getting bogged down with emails, especially at the start of his day, because that's generally where most of us are in problem, solving mode, math, time, things like that.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Tina Marie: So the benefit is there. Hopefully, it's something you'll be able to notice. Maybe not. But it will definitely be there.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hope, so, yeah.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And and you can even say, you know, like, explain to him. That's what I want your brain on, you know I want you looking for. How do we make things better? Better for the clients? Better for you, better for the team, you know, like he's in a leadership role that is almost 3 times what everyone else is. Not quite, but.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Tina Marie: Um. You know. That's that's what you value him for, and that's what.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Tina Marie: Hopefully. This will give him some more time to do. It's like, what can we. What can we do even better.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. And then subsequently, because of this, I looked at all the other roles which I probably should have done anyways.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: And uh. So we Paul had brought in um.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Susanna, which is her name, is Susanna Susan. But she's a Mirka's sister, and what happened was she doesn't speak English. She was like a she was doing kind of admin work for a.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Some company in Guatemala doesn't really speak English, though. But uh she came in to fill the old role.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um that Mirka vacated. Mirko was doing the um. She was emailing the reports to law firms. So after I done, I'm done typing my report. Miracle was emailing them to law firm. So we so Paul brought in Susanna.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: But what I realized. Is that because Susanna doesn't speak Spanish or doesn't speak English.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: Susanna can't do. Um calling to get signatures. We always have to get the law firm signature and the patient's consent.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: Before we send the reports. Um, and because. Susanna can't speak English. I realized that she wasn't doing those calls so like.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: She was only doing the Spanish ones, which are, which are between 25 to 33 per like, 3rd to a quarter of our patients. But. She was only doing the Spanish one, so the rest were falling on.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Paula um, but because I brought Paula on full time. I didn't really know that it was a problem, because.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Now that Paul is full time she can technically handle most of it herself. So when I started looking at Susanna, um.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Again, like her rate of pay now is at parity with. Like our other people that do scheduling and things like that.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: But it got me when I was talking it. I got frustrated because I was like, wait, you're telling me that like.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. She can't speak English. So I got on the phone, talk to her. And yeah, she can't understand. Right? Like I was like, what do you do for fun? Oh, what did you do yesterday? Can't understand. And I talked to Paula, and Paula said, Well, yeah, you know I give Suzanne all the Spanish ones.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that's. That's how we do it.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: But um. Originally, I think the other reason we brought her originally, Paul was saying, well, we can use her to fill in when people go on vacation. So if a scheduler goes on vacation, and or if uh, miracle goes on, vacation, um, my text and call person goes. And then I, what I realized is like, well, she can't do any of those things. She can't speak English.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Right like. So what what do we? What are we doing here? And I told Esther I was talking to Esther about it, and uh.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Esther was like, you know, the problem is is that Paula kinda. Just because she's a manager. She shifted her process to give her all the Spanish people, you know, when ordinarily she would have gave her half the work, or whatever she does.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: But Esther said, you know, sometimes in processes it's not good to have people with that glaring of a weakness.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then. And then what happened was on Friday. Paula took her Pto. Off. She took her Pto off, and then the whole day we couldn't send reports to the English speakers because Paula couldn't, can't speak English to get the signatures.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Tina Marie: You mean Susanna.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. What?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Tina Marie: You mean, Susanna? You said Poly. Can.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: Susanna. I'm sorry. Yes, Susanna. Paula took a vacation a Pto. Day, and Susanna was left.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: But we couldn't send almost half of our reports because they weren't there in English, and there she can't do English.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Tina Marie: Let's deal with this. Again.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Tina Marie: This is. Your shortsightedness.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Tina Marie: Because you you trusted your people to make a. Decision for you, and you didn't.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Tina Marie: Do your due diligence.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's right.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Tina Marie: However. You do want to put some accountability on the team as well.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: Um. You want to say? Ultimately, I own this decision. And responsibility, because I failed to.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Tina Marie: Um make sure that she was fully qualified for the job. But.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Tina Marie: You know, we have almost kind of like a family type team here. Um.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Tina Marie: If something doesn't work out, or if a person doesn't work out, it affects everybody. So if you guys want to make suggestions to me about who I should hire ever in the future, I need you to make sure that you're not bringing on somebody that we're going to have to change our business, for they need to come in and improve the business for everybody and be able to carry their own weight. You cannot value getting your family person a job over.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Tina Marie: The quality of work that we all have going here.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, that's right.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Tina Marie: That that is not. Um, that's not okay. That's not having the company's best interest.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Tina Marie: And by having the company's best interest. The company is there to have your best interest. So this is a failure on all of our parts.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Tina Marie: She should probably be let go. There's no probably she needs to be let go. She's not, she's she can't do this. Now.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Tina Marie: It. Terrible to think about it this way, but it's almost kind of.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Tina Marie: Good timing, because you get to show. Your willingness and understanding in one vein.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Tina Marie: But also be able to hold firm in another one. That this does not work.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Tina Marie: We? It is not a charity. Um. It is not.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Tina Marie: You know, kind of a safe house to give people work who don't have work. It can't be that it would be detrimental to everyone.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Tina Marie: Um constantly trying to accommodate the schedule. So Susanna has some value. Just doesn't make any sense. It takes up too much mental effort.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Tina Marie: In order to do that, and that mental effort is being pulled away from all of the other tasks that need to be done. That's not an acceptable trade-off.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Tina Marie: So. You know, whatever you may want to pay her like a compensation. Um!

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Tina Marie: For a month or something like that. I've done that before in the past, when I've made a bad decision for whatever.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Tina Marie: Um just to. I don't have to, and I could compare myself to the rest of the world. I don't really care about that.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Tina Marie: I care about the fact that I did a bad job putting somebody in some place, and I didn't think things through. And ultimately I just. That's a human being that's going to have to go do something else.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Tina Marie: You know I let them have hope that they shouldn't have had. So I've I've paid. I've never paid more than I have once.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Tina Marie: But a month, and and that's good to let them go. Figure things out.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, I was. Gonna I was gonna let her keep working for another month.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Yeah. Well.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Or or you know, or, as just said, 2, 2 to 3 weeks. But yeah, yeah, that's fine. 3. I could do 3. But essentially, you know. Yeah, that.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: You could work for another 3 weeks, or whatever.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. You know, and that's that's fair. Um.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Tina Marie: But you definitely. And the other thing is, once you said what you have to say. Um.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Tina Marie: People are going to want to argue because it's a family friend. I would say, I need you to hear me. This is not open for discussion.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Tina Marie: Um. Sometimes some things will be. But.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Tina Marie: I've said what I need to say. And it's important that you respect that.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Tina Marie: And that that we move on. Period.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Tina Marie: Don't engage. Um.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Tina Marie: It's not going to be helpful. It will be emotional for them, probably because they want to protect somebody.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Tina Marie: That's natural. It's a community where. You know, work as hard, whatever it's.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: It's life. It is hard, and people want to help other people out. It's just.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Tina Marie: More helpful and healthy. If you say what needs to be said, because that's all there is to do.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Tina Marie: And then. Just.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Tina Marie: You know. Okay, Susanna, would you like to work for the next 3 weeks?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Tina Marie: Or. You know.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: And and then. That's it. Or would you rather go now?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Tina Marie: But those are the options. So you do have a choice. But the choice is, go now, or go in 3 weeks. It isn't stay longer.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Tina Marie: It isn't learned how to speak English. It isn't. Do this for this person, and do that.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tina Marie: Those options are not on the table. This? Is it.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: So it should be a short discussion. Um a clear discussion.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Tina Marie: Just think over in your head. Um.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Tina Marie: And you might even frame it with. I'm going to tell you something.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Tina Marie: I need you to hear me. I need you to understand. This is not open for discussion. This is the conclusion I've come to. I'm 100%.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Tina Marie: Feel good about it. Know it's right. Then.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Tina Marie: I made a mistake. We made a mistake.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Tina Marie: Here's what we're going to do about it. The end.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, yeah, I think that's that's fair. Um. Yeah.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: It was pretty cut and dry. Nestor's eyes, too, and uh. Um. Because, yeah, I mean, I was. I was trying to make accommodations, too. I was like, well, what if she just, you know, worked for less, or I said, Well, what if Esther's like? You're so young in the company like? Don't make? Don't change your simple processes.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because someone can't speak English. I was like, Yeah, that's that's true.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Tina Marie: Also it. Also remember that there's multiple currencies and your brainpower and everybody else's brainpower trying to make those accommodations. It costs you more than just the money that you're paying.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. That's true. That's true.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tina Marie: Well, some leadership learning this month. Huh?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yup, yup, okay, Esther. Uh, yeah, I think Esther is in agreement with you that like a lot of it, a lot of this stem from me. Ab, whatever that word was, abdicate.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Tina Marie: Advocating.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Advocating. Versus delegating, so.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Tina Marie: Delegating. Yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I really gotta. I really gotta take that uh under more control. And. Um.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. So.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Tina Marie: Usually those lessons just come like this, though they come through experience like we can hear other people. But until.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: I've done this. I've done this before, though I I this hack his keeps happening. So I need to like.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But you're not the only person in the world that has to get the same lesson multiple times. Fuji, that's. You know.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: It just is we. We tend to have the same weakness. What happens is. We get a different application. So we see it from a different perspective.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hmm.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Tina Marie: But generally our weaknesses are the same, but also something to pay attention to is, they also tend to be. The opposite side of the same coin of our strengths.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Tina Marie: So. Your kind of laid backness, and just move along.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Tina Marie: Is resilience. It allows you to not be bogged down by things and be broken.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Tina Marie: Like the the issue that you had with your partner, that could have just destroyed your whole entrepreneurial spirit. For a little while for a long time. It could have just destroyed you emotionally. It has happened to people. It tends to happen very, very deep depressions.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Tina Marie: Um uh. What do you call them? Depressive, major, depressive episodes.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Tina Marie: For long periods of time, having to go to therapy, losing relationships. That kind of thing that you experienced.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Tina Marie: Can be really destructive to people. But your willingness to just move on, brush it off and try new things.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tina Marie: Um, that's the same type of thing that's like, yeah, whatever we can hire you. So.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Tina Marie: You have to understand this, that your strength. Is the same characteristic as your weakness.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Tina Marie: Just applied differently. So when you learn how to kind of.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tina Marie: Build. Um.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. 1st of all, just recognize. The application right of when that easygoing is helping or harmful.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Tina Marie: And then just kind of build in that um. Check system. But here's the other thing. Let's say you always make this mistake. Um.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Tina Marie: You'll be able to move on for it. But be from it because because you can, because you can let it roll off. You like, you know, water on a duck's back.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Tina Marie: Most people can't. And so the reason it is important is because. You need people in your life. You need people in your business. So.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Tina Marie: You do need to improve the skill. If you don't want to burn through everybody and always be alone. And having to do it rolling off your back, but still, like Dang, this is hard, because I'm doing it alone.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. I hear that.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tina Marie: That same lesson may come up again in a different way.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Tina Marie: But the more it happens the better you'll be able to recognize. Oh, wait. Slow down. I really have to pay more attention to.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: Who's coming in my house. That's really what it is.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Tina Marie: Who's coming in my house? What are they gonna do when they're in my house? What are my requirements while they're in here under my care?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Tina Marie: Am I taking care of them? The way that I think that I need to. Answer all of those questions, and.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Tina Marie: If you're not good at answering those questions, or even asking those questions. Part of your system is, go to the 1, 2 R. Esther, for sure.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Tina Marie: If I'm around, I'm around. Paul. Maybe he's probably going to be a little bit more like.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Tina Marie: How can I help everybody? So he's not the guy. But but I mean Esther will probably look at who's coming in the house and go.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Good idea, no bad idea.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Tina Marie: So it could just be as easy as having counsel and still being able to just let things be pretty loose for you, because it is. Part of your genius.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tina Marie: And skill set. That allows you to do things most people will never do in their lives.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Sounds good. Yeah, I think, bouncing it off. Some would be good. Besides, Paul, I like that idea.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, we we all have those kind of blind spots.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Alright! Um. And then on Paul side, you know, we talked about Paul salary. So this also made me look at Paul's salary.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: And what. What we what he was originally at 3,000. And then I kind of we gave him a thousand because I I was like, well, if you're gonna if you could help me market and.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, cold call, and all this I'll give you an extra 1,000. Essentially, that's what brought him up to the fore.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, because he was starting to look for other side jobs, and I said, Well.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Tina Marie: Oh no!

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know. Why don't you just. Yeah, why don't you just stick with me? And and uh.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: But you have to increase your role to helping me market, and that was the deal. You can't just manage the people, but you have to market with me.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: So that's where the last. Well, you've been working with me on this 3 weeks. We've been trying the coffee, so we've kept track of his coffee. You know the food he was he. He's still sending food. We're making the Stanley cup the custom Stanley cups. So those are the things that he's working on now. Um! And then, if we look at our numbers um, we did have a bump last week in the new Referrals the week before we were at 67.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

00:36:49.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: The week before that we're at 57. And then last week we're at 81, a lot of that bump came from the 2 law firms, Lalazeri, the big one, and procare.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: Both of both of whom we had offered, you know, the coffee cups to. Um. So we saw bigger numbers from them. That that's kind of, I think. What? What accounted for the the uptick in Referrals.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. And the other thing that we talked about is that you want to make sure that you continue to serve and massage kind of the relationships of your best providers.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Tina Marie: So, always making sure that you know who they are. We talked about making some modifications to your spreadsheet, so that we can see some of this.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: Contact. And these correlations. But you've also been making all these changes.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Tina Marie: Were there any changes to that? Yet.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: I was working on a transposed view in the 30 min before this call um to try to put the case managers in a. In like a vertical line like the case. Managers names.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, and then put the how many referrals per week that way. I could see all my case managers in a row. Um.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Tina Marie: Is this something that Paul can't see for any reason.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Ah! No, he could see him. He actually did it for me. If you look on the the second tab of the the weekly report.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: At the end of day, Friday, or whatever. Um. If you look at Tab number 2, called Count.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: That tab actually. Starting, in.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Row, 54. That one actually has it kind of how I want it mostly how I want it.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Not quite yet.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: But if you look at row 54. Column L.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's uh. This is kind of how I want it, where it's like listed in this fashion.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh, awesome!

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: See. So Paul has a group by law firm. And then you could see how many total each law firm sent.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then if you drop down, then you could see the the counts for each case manager within the law firm.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Tina Marie: I love that.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Tina Marie: So what I was gonna say is one of the things that we can do in the future is when we want to make a modification. Let's just try. Well, so.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes it helps to create kind of a wireframe. So like, maybe you could just write it out by hand. Um like, draw it like. This is what I want it to look like, or some kind of example, because it gets there faster. But then I want you to completely pass it off to Paul. If it's.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh!

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Tina Marie: A modification of something existing. What we want him to do is duplicate that, copy it, whether it's copy the tab that we're working on. If we're going to make changes in a tab or copy the workbook so that he can make the changes without messing up the current system. And then show you his work. So either you guys can just switch to the new thing and roll that out.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Tina Marie: But I would like you to just get him to start doing it from the beginning. He'll get better and better at it. He'll get better at seeing you know what we're doing.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. One of the things we can also do is take the transcripts from our calls where we're discussing it. And kind of lay out the outline so he can have your conversation.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Tina Marie: Your iteration, like kind of drawing. Basically wireframe. Plus the notes to kind of fill in the blank. And let's see what he can do. But based off of what he's done already.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Tina Marie: I feel like um. That will help him earn the money that you're giving him that extra money.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Tina Marie: That will make you happy, because I know marketing was what you wanted help with, but also. How many times did this? Some of these things just take months instead of a day or 2, or a week.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Tina Marie: To get things done. But you know, that's that's part of what you're doing, Fujita. That's not a slam. There's been constant growth.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Tina Marie: Um. But this is one of those things that has massive leverage. The data right? The way that we look at the data.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Yes.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Tina Marie: So we've been growing. I think I you haven't ever said anything about being unhappy about your pace. Um. What you do get unhappy about is oh, I didn't do this.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Tina Marie: But but that's not the way to measure things. The way to measure thing is the growth. There's always growth. So how can you be unhappy about that? There was growth.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tina Marie: You had a brand new baby. You guys found a new house.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Tina Marie: Moved into a new house like you've had all these changes with the systems. There's so many things that have happened in the months that we've been 9 months, 9, almost 10 months, that we've been working together. And.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Tina Marie: I mean the numbers that you guys close with last year like you've just had win after win after win after win. So there's there's nothing to be like. Yeah, I did bad on that. No, there, there's not.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Tina Marie: But there's opportunity to look at. There's leverage to be had, and that leverage is what gets you there further, faster, without more stress. So.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Tina Marie: Using Paul to get to these things that. Are necessary, and you can do. But don't love. I don't think you love this part anymore, either.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Tina Marie: But also you make him more valuable. It's pretty clear. That you could keep Paul.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Tina Marie: Indefinitely as long as you do this business as long as he's healthy, and you know everything is good. So.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Tina Marie: Um, you know it's the difference between renting versus owning a house. Right? You don't want to improve the property too much. If it's going to be going away soon, and you don't get that value. But this this is value you get to have. So everything that you put into Paul. Comes back to you. So let's let's do that. Let's make him more and more valuable. Worst case scenario. You end up having to pay him more money because he makes you more money like.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Tina Marie: That's terrible, you know.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: No, no, that makes sense. Yeah. I agree.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Tina Marie: And again I think he'll be happier. People like him love they. They have joy in bringing value to other people.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Tina Marie: Um. They have joy in solving problems, they have joy in creating these systems and solving these puzzles. That bring more results.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Tina Marie: And he can't do the going to the offices. He can't go to. Going to um.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Tina Marie: Events, you know, like conferences and things like that. You can't do a lot of the stuff that you can do that, only you can do so. You really want to get better now about the segmentation of the roles. And look at.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Tina Marie: What can food you do? That is like nobody else can do these things. Those are the things that you should be doing, and that's only the things that you should be doing.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Tina Marie: Everything else. You should be looking to offload to the ones who can do them, probably even better than you. You want to have people that do things better than you.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Or more consistently at least. Yeah.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Tina Marie: No, truly, you want to have people that do things better than you do like. That's the goal. Have people in your business that do those other things better than you do, and you do the thing that you do best that nobody else can do.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Tina Marie: For whatever reason, whether it's skill, proximity, whatever. Um, that will be the optimized company for you.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Tina Marie: Get you the best results.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: I like it. That's really good.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So um.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Tina Marie: What? I mean, we could dig into lots of things, but.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Tina Marie: Uh, not a ton that we'll we'll have 10 min. What is the best way to use this time for you today? Where is your mind already going.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. Well, my mind was just going to. Uh. I was sort of feeling frustration because um.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know. I'd hope by now. My trajectory of what we were gonna earn this year.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thank you, by the way, for the spreadsheet that I track my, you know, monthly, but you know I was hoping to see, you know an uptick this year.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, you know, hopefully getting closer to 5 million a year revenue, or, uh, you know, distributed revenue for us. But. Yeah, I mean.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: January, February, March, you know January and February. Uh, you know, they're okay. Um. Little bit more than last year, on average, maybe, but then, like last last month, March like dipped again.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Her, dip.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Tina Marie: Thank you. Compared to last the previous March.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: Uh, no, it's still higher than the previous march, but I'm saying like, if I looked at it.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Okay.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Tina Marie: I want you to understand this, this correlation. You don't have a lot of historical data. But this is the reason why the historical data is so important.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. I see.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Tina Marie: If you look at this, if you look at these lines right, and you're going above last year.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. It was lower than last year. But yes, I see.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Tina Marie: And you can. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Tina Marie: Well, that that does change where we're going. But but.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Tina Marie: Not really, if was March the only down one compared to last year.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thus. It's really hard.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: I I don't have like last year was such a mess with the different companies like money still coming in. It, like the our numbers like, for instance, in January, it was like 400.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: February was 43,000. And then March was 340,000.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then the month after that was 200,000. So it's just like this.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Tina Marie: And that's kind of the nature of your business. So it's really difficult.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Tina Marie: Difficult to go apples to oranges, but what you can look at as visits. So let's compare the visit. Totals.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Tina Marie: Um! What, Doc, can we look at where we can see that together?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: I don't have that.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So that's a new assignment for Paul.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Tina Marie: Go get the historical data. What were the 1st visits? Second, 3, rd visits. January, like all of 2024.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, well, I I do. I have the monthly data. That's right. I do.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Tina Marie: Fuji. We're gonna. So let's look at that where which one is that in.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: And monthly visit, report.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Tina Marie: Or is it. Alright. I've got that on open, I think.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Tina Marie: Let's see. Okay, that was 2024, right? So.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: With cold coffee. I guess.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Tina Marie: Um. What I want to see is a bar graph, basically.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Tina Marie: Of year over year. So January to January.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, this is right? Yeah. So March, yeah, that's right. Column 13.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Tina Marie: Because you have it back to 2023, right? April of 2023.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so let's do where we at. March was stupid.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think you're on the wrong. Are you on it? No, you're on it. Yeah.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Tina Marie: So march just to compare Row 13, March 12, th 253 number of referrals.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Tina Marie: And then march of 2020. That was 2024, sorry, 2025 is 293.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Tina Marie: So total visits. Um. Let's see.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Tina Marie: Gosh! They're almost identical. That's wild, but you still had more this year.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Tina Marie: So hold on, let's do. February, February 2, 79. Um, 2142.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Tina Marie: Plus 2 79. And then that, so.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Tina Marie: February. This year was a little bit lower. January, 300 and.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Tina Marie: Forties. 6.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: January. Okay. So this January was better. February dipped a little bit, marches ahead. So.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Tina Marie: You're not. Doing, less.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Tina Marie: Than last year. And actually, let's do this, I'm gonna add up these number.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Tina Marie: February, January, March 9, 62. February, January, March 1,044.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Tina Marie: So you have almost. Uh 80.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: You have 82. More visits.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Tina Marie: Total. This year, January through March than you did last year.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Tina Marie: So. You're improving, no matter what your numbers whatever you're looking at, that's making you feel like it's less.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Tina Marie: Um. It's not.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Tina Marie: Um. If so, let's do something else real quick. Let's look at the whole year. So then April went bigger. May, July, August, September, October, November.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Tina Marie: I mean, look at that. Yeah, food you're growing. I don't know what you're looking at.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Slower, though.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay, mark. Yes, you guys have the same disease.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But you have a very consistent system and foundation that you're building here.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tina Marie: You were.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Tina Marie: Kind of hustling, guessing. You know.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Tina Marie: Now you're business building. What you were doing before was all over the place.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Tina Marie: How are your stress levels in comparison? You don't strike me as a stress person. But generally your type of person sometimes.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Tina Marie: Does it differently. So. Um! You don't not necessarily even aware.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Tina Marie: That you're stressed. But other people around you might. But what is your awareness of. How you feel about business now versus this time last year.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, last year I was Comp. Almost complete. Well, last year at this time I was seeing month over month growth right through April. Almost uh since I started. So it represent last year at this time was my company was a year. July was a year old.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I was ecstatic, because every month. We were going up, up, up, up, and that's that was um! That was when I became apathetic. I think I I saw the success.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that's around the time when I start bringing on the manage, not management company. The marketing companies. I brought on 3 of the largest marketing companies. Pro power leans lean on us and doctors on lean.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Tina Marie: And that's when you abdicated your marketing, not delegated.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I was paying. Yeah. And I paid 1,500 a month for each of them.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: And uh, that's where I kinda like, because everything was on autopilot. Um, I just all I did was I was check, and I had all the doctors that I have now pretty much, or the. I'm sorry not doctors, but Nps and pas.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: And yes, all, all I did from April of last year, until when I started giving a shit again in December, was I just checked notes every night. And that's where I think we started working together around June or no. Yeah.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Yep, mid-june.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that's that you caught me at the time when I was just completely apathetic. All I was doing, and we had the timing right. I was trying to set aside 30 min a night just to check my notes and fuck like, Get get out. The.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's all I was doing. And uh.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: So that yeah. So last year at this time. I had very little stress. I was.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I was focused on like jujitsu and the new baby coming and.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, I was doing the other thing, that fun thing I was doing the brain thing at the this is this is the exact month last year, starting that stupid other business where I wasn't.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Tina Marie: Delta.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: Where I split my focus.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: I worked on it until I shut it down with you in December. Um.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, this is that this is actually the month I I started that. So.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Tina Marie: So, and it was actually um. April.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think it was April that I started the brain thing. I actually have, like the date here somewhere. But.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Tina Marie: Did you happen? Let's see. Um! That was 2,004. So.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, it might have been May. It might have been May that I got I started the brain start trying to start the brain company. And I was like thinking about it every day about how do I sell this? What's the problem that people had that makes them want to? Yeah. Wasted 6 months on that.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Or learned how not to focus. So anyway, um.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Tina Marie: How are you still.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I think it feels good like in December, whenever I close that other company.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Tina Marie: Sorry.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Esther was like, can you just focus on July for 6 months? Kind of similar to what you've been telling me. Just focus. And uh. So, yeah, I think, uh.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I'm I'm gonna try. Just keep heads heads down focused on July. And uh, you know, for at least another 3 months and see where that gets me. Hopefully, hopefully, I'll I'll be in, you know, encouraged that I want to do this for another 6 months and just focus on just July for another 6 months, and doubling the size of it, or whatever, and see where I can go. That's what's kind of making me excited now, like I have like a niche. Even when I didn't care about it, there was still people wanting what my service. So I found a successful niche.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I just now I just wanna try to go after it as much as I can like you said, uh. Yeah, and see where it can go. And.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: What it can do.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Tina Marie: Good, so. Let's talk about uh.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Tina Marie: I don't have a lot of time, really, though.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: No, it's okay. I I have my to do because I wanna, I wanna take care of the Hr issues and uh smooth that out. And I actually.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Tina Marie: Here's. Here's what I would. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Good.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. Here's what I would really like to for you to have for me next week, though. Is a report on how each of your um marketing companies are doing for you. If you're still using them.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: I I rehired 1 2 weeks ago.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Tina Marie: So only one.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000
