00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.610
Tina Marie: Oh!

2
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.670
Dan: Yellow so annoyed. It's never taken anything this long.

3
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.439
Dan: That's that's life, girl.

4
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.518
Tina Marie: That might be all the things I've been selling while I've been like writing apps and adding code.

5
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.650
Dan: Because you don't have a Mac.

6
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.430
Tina Marie: I do have a Mac. What you talking about, Willis?

7
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.580
Dan: Oh!

8
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.209
Tina Marie: I got 2 of them.

9
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.739
Dan: Oh, there you go!

10
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.269
Tina Marie: But this last update must have been a beast

11
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Tina Marie: never, ever taken that long, even just to upload update or boot.

12
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.469
Tina Marie: But speaking of

13
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.729
Tina Marie: things taking a long time, have you tried? Have you tried the pro version of Chat Gpt and deep research.

14
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.240
Dan: No.

15
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.450
Tina Marie: Bonkers.

16
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.689
Dan: I believe it.

17
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:44.009
Dan: I definitely I run out of memory with regular $20 Gt. Gpt all the time and then have to go in and delete old conversations that I don't want to retain.

18
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.910
Tina Marie: Billing

19
00:02:44.910 --> 00:03:02.389
Tina Marie: memory, the memory across chats, and then deep researches, capacity to remember and use everything that you've already discussed in a single conversation. Nothing else has come close to it yet.

20
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.560
Tina Marie: and the speed and the iterations just I exponential increase

21
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.480
Tina Marie: in productivity just in the last few days.

22
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.580
Dan: Does it carry over everything that you've already done?

23
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:35.819
Tina Marie: Not perfectly but incredibly well, yes, it has memory across all of your chats, plus the added new 25% memory plus the length of the conversation doesn't cause it to become incoherent.

24
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.250
Dan: Right.

25
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.339
Tina Marie: Yeah, for all those reasons

26
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.840
Tina Marie: so worth it. All you have to do is have one or 2 useful conversations, and you've got your money's worth out of it.

27
00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:59.939
Dan: Yeah, so you could probably like, get it to summarize your old conversations and then bring that over and be like here. Here's where we're starting.

28
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.279
Tina Marie: Yeah, not only that.

29
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.939
Dan: The book and all that stuff.

30
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:14.039
Tina Marie: Yes, so not only that. So today or yesterday, one of the things I did to test it, because I noticed it seemed to be recalling things that for sure were not in memory.

31
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:31.770
Tina Marie: And I so I'm like, do you remember? You know what our master plan is, what we're working on, and it spit it out. And I'm like that was a brand new conversation that was a new thread, and all of that stuff was not in memory. And so I asked it to explain to me what all of its updates were. So yeah.

32
00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:36.280
Tina Marie: crazy. But deep research. So

33
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.070
Tina Marie: one of the things that I've learned that I have to do is so like deep seek. Have you used deep seek.

34
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.800
Dan: No.

35
00:04:43.800 --> 00:05:09.790
Tina Marie: Okay, so deep seek is really fascinating because you can watch its reasoning and logic. And it'll say something like, Okay, so the user is asking me this. I wonder if that this is interesting and fascinating. I'm going to go do some research at this site. This is what I read. Huh? Now I'm going to go explore the left menu. Item, this is fascinating to watch this unfold as I do it like it's so crazy. Well.

36
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:36.769
Tina Marie: deep research in Chat Gpt does that as well. So you can watch it processing. So I can see the sites that it's using for references. And, for example, so like if I'm getting it to help me with business strategy. And it's going to a site like it went to social media examiner. I'm like, no, that's not where I want you to go. So these are the people that I study. These are the books that I read.

37
00:05:37.000 --> 00:06:01.130
Tina Marie: And then, after I told it that it came back with some more stuff. I said, Okay, well, here's what I want you to do is go back to these, and I gave it more books. And I said, These are the books that I like for business strategy. These are the things I like for marketing. These are the things I like for assistance and tools. These are the things that I like for overall life, perspective, right? Like Victor Frankl's man, search for meaning.

38
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:25.180
Tina Marie: And so then it was able to go. Oh, so then, what I said was, I want you to tell me if you can find the correlations between these people and their material and my material, because, you know, maybe I'm smoking crack, or whatever. And it came back and it had studied. You know, my all of my transcripts that I had cut down only me right, so it only has my words in it.

39
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:34.769
Tina Marie: And the 1st version of the book that I wrote, as well as the AI plan that we had come up with up to that point before we even had deep research.

40
00:06:35.340 --> 00:07:03.219
Tina Marie: And so it gave me examples of how each of those things that I used is supported in my material. But it also said, This is why Tina's offering has unique value because it does this, this, this and this, and so then it adjusted the plan that it had built to be very, so much more specific in the way that I would do things in that strategy.

41
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:23.500
Tina Marie: but the whole point of it was like I was trying to get it to build instructions for me to set up a custom Gpt, and I'm like this almost really just does that because the custom Gpt I wanted was a business strategist. So it can do that now. But it's just, but the speed, like

42
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.720
Tina Marie: the longest search, has been 15 min

43
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:37.290
Tina Marie: roughly, but when it's come back, after spending 15 min the quality of what it comes back with is

44
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.540
Tina Marie: is is just crazy. So in terms of like.

45
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.170
Tina Marie: I think I think you could feed it a book

46
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:58.699
Tina Marie: and write your book and have it do your tone with deep research, like, I haven't even tried to do that, because since it came out I've been using it for this strategy. But I think the continuity capability now.

47
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:07.670
Tina Marie: And the. So a couple days ago you couldn't upload a file to deep research, you can today you can, as of last night.

48
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.340
Tina Marie: and.

49
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.020
Dan: Couldn't upload any file.

50
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:25.559
Tina Marie: No, no, but you can upload Pdfs and text which you could not before yesterday, and you last week you could not upload a.md file to chat, Gpt anywhere. And now you can.

51
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:42.530
Tina Marie: And the Markdown file is like 10% of all the other files. Well, obviously, text and Pdf. Are not even comparable when you start getting bigger and bigger. But Markdown files are tiny. You can put hundreds of pages, and it still be less than a megabyte.

52
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.289
Dan: Wow!

53
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.580
Tina Marie: Yeah, so

54
00:08:48.040 --> 00:09:09.699
Tina Marie: the ability to feed it, information that it can retain and process has gotten better and its ability to go through large amounts of data, and then summarize it and extract it to refeed itself to say, Okay, here are the guidelines, the boundaries, and the summaries. But don't forget that we've got all the details inside of this thing

55
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.199
Tina Marie: over every single day. It's changed for the last week.

56
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:23.169
Tina Marie: Gotten better every single day. They've released some sort of update that I just happen to like. Come across.

57
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.819
Dan: Well, they need to make money.

58
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.129
Tina Marie: Yeah. And apparently

59
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:48.070
Tina Marie: Gpt 5 is coming out within weeks or months and is going to be free to everybody. But the higher level accounts are going to have higher level thinking, capacity and strategy. But even Gpt 5 will. Basically, it will have all of the existing models.

60
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:57.010
Tina Marie: and it will be able to choose for you what model you should use, based on the query that you gave it and the prompt that you gave it.

61
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:04.530
Tina Marie: So the user doesn't have to try to choose. You know what's the best model for figuring this thing out.

62
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.850
Dan: Right.

63
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:15.540
Tina Marie: Yeah, and for yeah, for free. So just, you know, basically, they're all forcing each other's hands, which is good for us. For right now

64
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:27.410
Tina Marie: I'll tell you what's not good for us this whole elon and trump thing I was. I'm you know. I'm like, whatever you can't control shit so like, what's the point? But

65
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.290
Tina Marie: it's a little scary, that amount of power like if you imagine it as

66
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.700
Tina Marie: potential power versus kinetic. Right? It's not activated.

67
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.119
Tina Marie: But that is the makings of an atomic bomb. Right there.

68
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.899
Dan: Or it's the dismantling of the power that you didn't recognize was already there.

69
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.500
Tina Marie: Oh, shit we! We knew that that was there, Dan. We bought.

70
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.340
Dan: There.

71
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.720
Dan: No, we didn't, not to the not to the degree that it's wait till they get to the Defense Department.

72
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.540
Tina Marie: Yeah.

73
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:05.019
Dan: In 2020. I think it was in 2020. There's an article, I think it's.

74
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.679
Tina Marie: So the the the long, like the the social media thing.

75
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.069
Dan: No, no, no! In 2020 there's an article I think it's in. The New York Times

76
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:20.520
Dan: has nothing to do with. This just has to do with the Defense department, and it's called the. It's like.

77
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.870
Dan: I think they call it the 35 trillion dollar black hole.

78
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:31.580
Dan: meaning 35 trillion dollars went into the defense department that disappeared.

79
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.580
Dan: Well, it didn't disappear.

80
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.250
Dan: Yeah, that's the entire. That's the entire debt.

81
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:48.009
Dan: So oh, where did that go? And nobody cared right. So now the difference is, somebody cares.

82
00:11:48.800 --> 00:12:01.709
Dan: Elon's whole thing is, I mean, if you look at the things that he talks about, one of the big things that he talked about before. All this, and the reason he got involved was like, we're going to go insolvent. It's all math. He's correct.

83
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:12.300
Dan: This only leads in one direction his other thing that he talks about all the time that people poo! Poo! But he's 100% correct because it's also math is population implosion.

84
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:29.119
Dan: And he's like, we're on a really bad path. We're on a bad path of debt. And then many, many countries are on this path of population collapse because they do. The birth rates are dropping, and there's no way to turn that around. You can't make people

85
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:53.180
Dan: when you need them right. So once you hit a point in the population in the birth rate being too low, there's no pulling out of it, it only it only continues to spiral down. So like Japan, South Korea, I think those guys are on the edge of crossing over, hitting a number where it's like there's no turning back, and you cannot fix it with by importing people. It is not fixable.

86
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.480
Dan: And

87
00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:10.420
Dan: people don't. I? I just think you can't. They can't process that idea, just like you can't process, not you. But like most people can't process that like they would actually waste billions and trillions of dollars like, of course they would. Oh, yeah.

88
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:31.709
Tina Marie: That that doesn't surprise me. What concerns me is the power and ability to infiltrate, and the speed that the infiltration is happening of data inside of the country and the power and the influence. And what I'm concerned with is that while they're going doing good on one hand, what are they doing? On the other hand.

89
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.239
Dan: Well, they're going to break shit, for sure, but it's like.

90
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:43.829
Dan: what's the other side of it is, if you let it continue, it's going to break things on such a grander scale that we're all fucked.

91
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.009
Dan: What they're gonna.

92
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.300
Tina Marie: Concerned with, like the Nazi salute, and some of the things that.

93
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.629
Dan: I know.

94
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.610
Tina Marie: Juan says.

95
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:54.619
Dan: No, because he didn't do a Nazi salute. That's like the dumbest thing ever it's like, give me a break.

96
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.300
Tina Marie: Really, you don't think that that's what that was. Did you.

97
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.400
Dan: No, yes, I don't at all. I wouldn't. I wouldn't think that for a second.

98
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.690
Tina Marie: Wow! Cause I wouldn't think anything else.

99
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.479
Dan: Why people do?

100
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:07.880
Tina Marie: Bye.

101
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:17.850
Dan: Do that right, but it usually is followed with some words like, Do you have? Many people have done that exact maneuver and didn't. Why him? Why do you? Why would it apply to him.

102
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.550
Tina Marie: Fingers the pointed finger. Right now he show you feet together.

103
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:27.550
Dan: No, we didn't. I can show you video upon video of other people doing the same thing, and

104
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.320
Dan: no one said it. Then.

105
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.529
Dan: So why are they saying.

106
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.809
Tina Marie: Oh, I don't care what. I don't care that no one said it. Then I I think that there are a lot of things that people, miss.

107
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.700
Tina Marie: I don't know what it is. Damn! I'm just saying like.

108
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.310
Dan: Yeah.

109
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:53.940
Tina Marie: I'm definitely, if nothing else, the fact that they have as much money and power, and they don't care what people think makes them dangerous. Whether or not they are the potential. That's my point.

110
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.479
Dan: Or if it makes, or it makes you the perfect person to do this.

111
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.969
Tina Marie: Totally possible, totally possible.

112
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.209
Dan: Dude has nothing to.

113
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.810
Tina Marie: And also multiple things can be true at the same time, you know.

114
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.589
Dan: The beauty of those 2 is they? Who what could you possibly offer them?

115
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:17.140
Dan: To do something for you right there they are unassailable, like. They cannot be bought. They cannot be bought.

116
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.359
Tina Marie: I think. Well, and I always think that our good and our bad are 2 sides of the same coin, no matter who you are.

117
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.629
Tina Marie: That's the issue. That they're good, and their bad is the same thing. Right?

118
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.000
Dan: The.

119
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.570
Tina Marie: Power.

120
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.160
Dan: The dude's track record like, what has he ever done? That's been bad.

121
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.270
Tina Marie: Which dude.

122
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:39.570
Dan: Elon, like the dudes, just had one success on top of the other.

123
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.399
Dan: He's doing the electric cars for the right reasons.

124
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:52.109
Dan: Mars, I mean he believes in that reason. I don't know if it's the right reason, but he does believe we need to potentially get off this planet in the future.

125
00:15:52.380 --> 00:16:00.490
Dan: I mean he does. The reason Spacex is so successful is because he can do it at like 1 10th of the cost of the government.

126
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.660
Tina Marie: Trying to buy Openai's nonprofit. Now.

127
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.550
Dan: He should, because that guy screwed them. That guy's a scumbag.

128
00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:10.220
Tina Marie: Sam Altman.

129
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.760
Dan: Yes, he's a liar, and he's a scumbag.

130
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.370
Tina Marie: I don't want to trust anybody.

131
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:22.409
Dan: I mean, he's the dude that said he's not in it for money, and now drives a 4 million dollars car. It's like, really Bro.

132
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.920
Tina Marie: What even is a 4 million dollars car.

133
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.750
Dan: Exactly. Do you know who doesn't drive a 4 million dollars car, Elon?

134
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:39.920
Dan: So it's like, I mean, even the way the guy lives. It's like he's literally sleeping on the floor in a building in DC, like, okay, that's interesting.

135
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:49.760
Tina Marie: Brought his child to the White House office, and when his child interrupted him, just dealt with it. That was a little wild to me in like a good way, but still

136
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.490
Tina Marie: nobody made it go away.

137
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.000
Dan: That's maybe his detractor is that he has multiple baby mamas.

138
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.650
Tina Marie: Well.

139
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:10.319
Tina Marie: I mean there's so much of that in the world, anyway. But how he handled his son! How Donald Trump handled his son, and, like all of this, is surreal to me. You know.

140
00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.519
Dan: Oh, yeah.

141
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.490
Tina Marie: The world is like it doesn't even exist. There has been no version like this ever.

142
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.829
Dan: No, it's it's wild.

143
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:32.519
Tina Marie: So to think like there is no pattern to predict rationally what will happen, because the possibilities are infinite in a way that never has happened before.

144
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:41.170
Dan: Yeah, they're doing something that is literally inconceivable. And the people that

145
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.260
Dan: are in these positions that are, you know, these positions of power that they shouldn't have

146
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.490
Dan: that they've had that they shouldn't have. They are having the biggest. What the fuck moment of their lives.

147
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.820
Tina Marie: I am happy about that.

148
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.349
Dan: They have no recourse.

149
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.270
Dan: Right?

150
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.569
Dan: They thought they did, and nothing is working.

151
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.430
Tina Marie: And it's like like the light.

152
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.040
Dan: Yep.

153
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:13.390
Dan: So I mean, that's the whole thing like that's why, when they get the Defense Department is the biggest slush fund on the planet. So it's like, Oh, boy.

154
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.390
Tina Marie: We all just not pay taxes this year and let them all pay it. I think that would be fair.

155
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.889
Dan: No doubt.

156
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.779
Tina Marie: And then let's get to the Ftc. And the sec. Because how many people have they robbed?

157
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.160
Tina Marie: Oh, God, millionaires! Yeah.

158
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.860
Dan: Yes.

159
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:35.591
Dan: that's why I love. They're like they're talking about bringing Ron Paul in to audit the fed, I'm like, yes, please.

160
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.430
Tina Marie: Thank you.

161
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.740
Dan: I would love that.

162
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:55.599
Tina Marie: Where is? See? This drives me nuts. So my Zoom Meetings on the desktop app do not match the Zoom Meetings on my phone app. Do not not match the Zoom Meetings in when I log in from the web, so like I'm trying to join this call from

163
00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:01.049
Tina Marie: My desktop, and I can't.

164
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:07.780
Dan: It's funny, is you were texting me, and I was in the wrong meeting, because apparently I had another meeting right now, and I was like, I didn't agree to that.

165
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.790
Tina Marie: Yeah.

166
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:16.130
Dan: So I'm like sitting at. I'm sitting on like this, the infusion soft meeting. But they hadn't shown up yet. It's like, Oh, thank God.

167
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.219
Dan: I didn't want to be on there and then bail.

168
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.290
Tina Marie: Oh, wait! Does AI companion not work? If it's on? I don't know.

169
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.920
Tina Marie: So that was cool. It just switched seamlessly from my phone to the desktop.

170
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.420
Dan: That's interesting.

171
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:42.129
Tina Marie: Yeah, like I. There was no process to it. And the reason I didn't see it in the meetings was because I'm on it. So I had to join it from home. Zoom keeps changing so fast.

172
00:19:42.130 --> 00:20:03.520
Tina Marie: and I appreciate the growth and the evolution, but because it keeps happening so fast like. I don't even know, because it's changing in between calls, and I look like an idiot because I'm not prepared. But even if I tried to join early, anyway. It's just weird. But everything the speed, Dan, the speed. Have you been playing with any of the AI music stuff?

173
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.029
Dan: John and I messed with it a couple of weeks ago. I mean, it's it's super interesting, but it's like

174
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:22.690
Dan: mean. They sound realish, and it's like, you know, it's very formulaic, but also real. So

175
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:31.519
Dan: Sean and I did like he, he! We would have like this fake band that he made inside of fanflowy for like testing.

176
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:43.329
Dan: And then he I don't know. I like I had AI write lyrics, and then he used it in Suno, and I was like, God dang it! Actually, I go. We should actually like we should just make an AI band

177
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.700
Dan: and just release songs like this.

178
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:58.579
Dan: because if you can coax pretty good lyrics out of it if you just keep talking to it is what I've figured out. And so you it's not like a hundred percent. AI, right? So it's like Sean knew what to tell. It.

179
00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.340
Tina Marie: Yeah.

180
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.810
Dan: Good music, and then I knew what to tell it, to get good goodish lyrics.

181
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:13.200
Dan: So it was interesting. I was like, Oh, you you could put it, I mean, I don't know if you could put it out. It didn't. At the end of the day it wasn't like

182
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:38.600
Dan: like the mix wasn't great. So from that perspective. But yeah, it wrote a song, and it had the parts, and it followed the instructions. It didn't follow some of the instructions. But I was like, damn dude! That's that's kind of interesting. Now, if you could get that as like multi tracks and then mix and master it for real, and then it would just you. You would never, ever know.

183
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.459
Tina Marie: That's crazy. Dude. Where are you at with the book right now?

184
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:54.390
Dan: Well, I was unaware that you can run out of clawed credits multiple times a day, and then it kicks you out for hours on end.

185
00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.380
Dan: So I am on step.

186
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:09.380
Dan: So I it it. The book expanded from 7 and a half steps to

187
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:16.580
Dan: I think 9 or 10 steps. Let me see 2.

188
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:23.140
Dan: Look at this table of contents. Work to 9 steps. So I am on Step

189
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.310
Dan: Devin.

190
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.610
Dan: Oh, see, am I done with 7?

191
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.069
Dan: I think I just finished 7 like an hour ago.

192
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.020
Dan: and I'm waiting till 3 o'clock until it gives me more credits.

193
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.029
Dan: which is so dumb, and you can't increase the credits I'm like, this is so stupid.

194
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.879
Tina Marie: So can you export what you have.

195
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.270
Dan: I mean I have it in a G dock.

196
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:57.739
Tina Marie: Can, can you? are you at a computer right now?

197
00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.135
Dan: Yup!

198
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:08.579
Tina Marie: Do download as Md. Which is also a new option that Google Doc did not have before. But deepseek or Claude made that happen.

199
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.220
Dan: Download? What.

200
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.909
Tina Marie: Your book right now.

201
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:24.159
Dan: No, no, I'm taking it and putting it in a Google Doc, because I don't want to lose any of it. And then at the end. I want to feed it back in, because I can see

202
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:30.579
Dan: it's better in some respects, and it's not better in some. But no, I can't do anything. I'm out of. Credits won't do anything.

203
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:42.039
Tina Marie: No, no, no! The reason I was asking is, we could output what you already have is because I would share my screen, and we could let deep research while we're talking. See what it could give you to improve.

204
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.450
Dan: I mean, I could send you the Google Doc, and you can just.

205
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.320
Tina Marie: Yeah.

206
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.809
Dan: Cut and paste it in there. Yeah.

207
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.899
Dan: I don't know what it would output.

208
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.460
Tina Marie: Okay.

209
00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:57.508
Dan: I'm gonna have to email it to you.

210
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.410
Tina Marie: Okay.

211
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.220
Dan: It wouldn't look like anyone.

212
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.149
Dan: Think that Link will work.

213
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.910
Dan: Oh, wait! It didn't send hold on!

214
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.760
Dan: They're fine.

215
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.540
Dan: Alright sent.

216
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:20.320
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh! A couple of days ago I went to go get my hair done. I came back, and my daughter was like mom what she looked like. She was crying. She tried not to step on Hudson because he got under her feet while she was walking, and she's trying not to squish him. She fell into the TV,

217
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:29.419
Tina Marie: can't even tell from the TV, but if you turn it on, it looks shattered. So the outside is fine. The inside is shattered.

218
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.849
Dan: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

219
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:39.189
Tina Marie: Felt so bad. She was like all stressed out. And I felt because I wasn't there. And she's for like I'm gonna get in trouble like, why, why would you get in trouble?

220
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.739
Tina Marie: Yeah, anyway. So we get a new TV. But yeah, okay.

221
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:45.920
Dan: Serial, broker.

222
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:55.140
Tina Marie: I swear every freaking thing what do you call it? They use the North Star stuff. It drives me nuts.

223
00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.090
Dan: No, it's the whole. But the whole book is a nautical theme. That's why.

224
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.949
Tina Marie: Oh, but did it come up with it, or did you.

225
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.469
Dan: I came up with the nautical theme.

226
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.340
Tina Marie: Okay.

227
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.779
Dan: The book is called the Indie Artist Compass, and it's like, so then there's all kinds of nautical.

228
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:26.990
Dan: It's that it's all a metaphor for like building a ship like you have to build a ship and captain your ship like your career is, hey? 1st you're gonna build a ship, then you're going to get out, and so you'll see it's like it talks about the seas.

229
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.310
Tina Marie: I just asked, because it did that with my book, and I was like, this is annoying. Now.

230
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.409
Dan: So it's it. As a result of the medicalness.

231
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:47.229
Tina Marie: Okay, so just for comparison, if I downloaded that as a Pdf, it's 1,112 kB. If I download it as a Markdown format. It's 148 kB.

232
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.380
Dan: Oh!

233
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.660
Dan: So interesting!

234
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.100
Tina Marie: Not quite 10 times smaller, but you could see how that adds up.

235
00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay? Oh, so let me share my screen. Zoom, zoom share. Zoom chat me.

236
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.690
Tina Marie: Okay, so we're going to upload a file.

237
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.010
Tina Marie: Md.

238
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:22.769
Tina Marie: alright. So let's give it some information about this. What we're doing and what what would you like. If you could wave a magic AI wand.

239
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:28.650
Dan: Well, what I usually do is say, tell me, give me a summary of what you think this is, and then see how close it is.

240
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.650
Dan: and then then start querying it.

241
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.909
Tina Marie: Deep research probably shouldn't take long to do that.

242
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.950
Tina Marie: It really. Only, yeah.

243
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.149
Tina Marie: Okay, let's answer that question.

244
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.120
Dan: Oh, yeah, like a general summary.

245
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.300
Tina Marie: General, summary, good.

246
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.059
Dan: Yeah. And then the goal is like.

247
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:27.829
Dan: does it? Is it an end to end solution? Like, could, could could a user use this book and the tools mentioned within it, to

248
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.939
Dan: to navigate, there to start, build, and navigate.

249
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.080
Tina Marie: Hold on, hold on! I want to type that, so say it again.

250
00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:35.799
Dan: Yeah.

251
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.280
Tina Marie: Or do you want to read this and then ask.

252
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.120
Tina Marie: oh, okay, it's doing deep research. Okay, so let's let's what's the questions.

253
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.380
Dan: It's actually it actually just answered it.

254
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.480
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

255
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.589
Tina Marie: that's almost kind of like a good synopsis on a cover.

256
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.030
Dan: Yeah.

257
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.059
Dan: Oh, yeah, that is, I like that. It serve. This book serves as a practical guide for independent musicians.

258
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.450
Dan: Yeah. So like, then I would be like. Do you think anything is missing? That's.

259
00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:31.220
Tina Marie: Let's tell it who it's for.

260
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.820
Tina Marie: or what it's for, what? What is its purpose? Who is it? For? Whatever.

261
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.819
Dan: I mean. I think they nailed it.

262
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:47.519
Dan: They got it. It's a practical guide for independent musicians to help build grown. They nailed it.

263
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.590
Tina Marie: So, then the.

264
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:54.560
Dan: Especially like in today's music industry, very accurate.

265
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.060
Dan: Oh, this is! It is interesting how it's going.

266
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.689
Tina Marie: Oh, wait! No, no, no! Let me show you actually.

267
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.380
Tina Marie: Can you see this.

268
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.980
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I see. I'm like, Oh, it's going out and reading these websites, or whatever.

269
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.789
Tina Marie: The user intends concise, logically structured markdown summaries with sections on. Oh.

270
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.330
Tina Marie: it noticed, the format is marked down.

271
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.639
Tina Marie: Let me know when you read all this, and I'll scroll down.

272
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.700
Dan: I read it all

273
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:56.539
Dan: so like the the the main issue that these people have is they have no strategy.

274
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:08.900
Dan: That's the that's the overarching message, like the overarching thing I found was there. There is no strategy at a at a at a level of

275
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:16.060
Dan: your career, and then there's no strategy at the level of even releasing a song.

276
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:23.359
Dan: So we're trying to provide that in this book.

277
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.809
Dan: And with the tools mentioned in the book, fan, flowy distro flowy.

278
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.010
Dan: So it's like creating and releasing songs.

279
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.760
Dan: Right? The and the other bit is that

280
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:26.919
Dan: then we and we also want to provide a like centralized community that fosters collaboration. Blah, blah, blah.

281
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.429
Tina Marie: Say that again.

282
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.830
Dan: The other bit is that we want to create a centralized community like around

283
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:49.830
Dan: around the book, and so that people get to foster collaboration and networking, and Yada Yada Yada, so that these people aren't alone.

284
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:55.289
Tina Marie: Okay, you got too low while I was typing for me to hear that around the book, so that people.

285
00:32:55.290 --> 00:33:04.550
Dan: Can collaborate network and collaborate and provide support and accountability.

286
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.966
Tina Marie: In July, the summer to emphasize strategic framework, for example.

287
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.740
Tina Marie: whoa! It's it was still working.

288
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.830
Tina Marie: Let me know when I should scroll.

289
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.399
Dan: You can scroll.

290
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:05.620
Dan: It's super interesting how it's saying, oh, brand branding is important.

291
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.548
Tina Marie: Wow! It's still going.

292
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.710
Dan: Oh, yeah, it's it's going through the entire book.

293
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.015
Tina Marie: Oh, oh, crap! I did not mean it.

294
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.459
Tina Marie: march collabs, licensing sync. Yeah, it really did.

295
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.719
Tina Marie: you know. See what I told you about the length, though.

296
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.900
Dan: Oh, yeah, it's nuts.

297
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:17.179
Tina Marie: Look at all these sources with links to? Okay. So.

298
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.929
Dan: It's funny. Yeah. Case studies is what

299
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.539
Dan: that's what Claude said was missing.

300
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.959
Dan: It does have worksheets and templates.

301
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.980
Tina Marie: Okay, so let's just answer these questions. One

302
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.870
Tina Marie: does.

303
00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:55.859
Dan: It does. Yeah.

304
00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:06.470
Dan: And it will be a, we're gonna use circle for the community. And it's literally going to be like

305
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.289
Dan: the the structure of the Circle community will be based on the book.

306
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.680
Tina Marie: It is circle.so right?

307
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.589
Tina Marie: Could there be built in challenges, group coaching mentorship programs?

308
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.150
Tina Marie: What's the answer to that.

309
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.328
Dan: We are. Gonna we're gonna do

310
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:37.470
Dan: song writing and releasing cohorts. And there is group coaching and mentorship.

311
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.200
Tina Marie: Okay, 3.

312
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.910
Dan: Well, I don't know that they'd have to tell us, are there?

313
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.630
Dan: I don't know if.

314
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.899
Tina Marie: There are areas where the language could be. Do?

315
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.730
Tina Marie: I asked you to answer that for me, or.

316
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.460
Tina Marie: what are more, real life, examples of indie artists who use these.

317
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.159
Dan: So we're gonna add those. We just haven't done it yet.

318
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:21.260
Dan: and we have worksheets in almost every chapter, and and templates and reflection prompts. We do all that

319
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:32.959
Dan: which is weird, that they use, the exact. It knows that because reflection prompts is very specific.

320
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.840
Dan: I want you to send me the summary that it did because I was like, Oh, my God, that's like a podcast episode.

321
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.520
Tina Marie: Good kiss.

322
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.190
Tina Marie: Yeah.

323
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.089
Dan: Go through. That's like the structure of an episode.

324
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.920
Dan: So they could do an episode on the book and then use this.

325
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:31.130
Tina Marie: Okay. Speaking of this could help you just create the transcript for A,

326
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.760
Tina Marie: podcast we don't need Delphi, or anything else, or Delphi or.

327
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:45.329
Dan: Those those guys have recorded 4 episodes already. We're like, they're doing it. We have it, a real podcast so the mom sites being built. Right now, I'm sending notes

328
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.200
Dan: to Abhishek and Vijay on the podcast pages so they could finish them.

329
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.050
Dan: They're doing the first, st

330
00:38:53.100 --> 00:39:03.020
Dan: they're doing 2. They have a shooting schedule of Tuesdays and Thursdays. So they're gonna try to put out 2 episodes. They're gonna try to have 2 episodes a week in the can.

331
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:13.729
Dan: And I'm waiting for Joe to get back to me about like, do we release with 4 episodes? Do we release one a week like is there any strategy around podcast launching

332
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:24.560
Dan: But they've done it like they've they've 4, 4, edited, 2 more. I think they're gonna have 6 done. And they're doing 2, 2 more this week.

333
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:34.860
Dan: But we hadn't talked about doing the book. But what I just read there, as I read that I was like, Oh, shit, that's the podcast episode.

334
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.190
Tina Marie: That's my point, right? So that was

335
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:45.749
Tina Marie: 5 min worth of work. Imagine, if you use this every day and the iterations of the other things that you're doing.

336
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.856
Dan: Well, I wonder, I wonder how this

337
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:54.489
Dan: like so Claude does write better. I wonder if this writes better than Claude now.

338
00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:03.860
Tina Marie: Okay, so while it's doing this work, let me show you what it gave to me after I

339
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.209
Tina Marie: it reads better. Actually, you know what.

340
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:12.110
Tina Marie: Let me do this. Okay, real quick, quick as a test.

341
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.440
Tina Marie: Can you write a version.

342
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.250
Dan: Move.

343
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.490
Tina Marie: Of Chapter one for me with

344
00:40:20.522 --> 00:40:25.859
Tina Marie: all the new things you have learned about me.

345
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.650
Tina Marie: my values, my styles, etc.

346
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.920
Tina Marie: I want you to direct.

347
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.880
Tina Marie: I don't need what I really want.

348
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:51.840
Tina Marie: Class business, the editor. And do you know what books me.

349
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.939
Dan: Wait. Are you in a different.

350
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.590
Tina Marie: Can you not see it now.

351
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.679
Dan: No, no, I'm just looking at what's above it. I'm like, what is that above it?

352
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.750
Tina Marie: Yeah, this is, this is my stuff. I've been.

353
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.740
Dan: Oh, okay. I was like, Gotcha.

354
00:41:13.084 --> 00:41:22.550
Tina Marie: I want to show a client what how great you can write.

355
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.459
Tina Marie: Remember, I want it to sound like me.

356
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:41.909
Tina Marie: So use my written samples, not for the as that was AI's.

357
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.815
Tina Marie: But

358
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.219
Tina Marie: Oh, where did I put my post?

359
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.150
Tina Marie: Let's go back to yours. Looks like it's done, maybe.

360
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.590
Tina Marie: Okay, look at all of this.

361
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:25.779
Tina Marie: So nuts, okay, review recommendations clarify language. I'll just

362
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.800
Tina Marie: instead of you're feeling.

363
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.529
Dan: Oh, that's interesting!

364
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.150
Tina Marie: yeah. So this is one of my pet peeves with people is using abbreviation.

365
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.680
Dan: Didn't know what that was, but

366
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.439
Dan: those guys were throwing it around. I'm like, what's an epk.

367
00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:05.380
Tina Marie: Right. So for instance, if explaining touring challenges share a quick anecdote.

368
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.550
Tina Marie: vary the rhythm, make short and slightly longer sentences. I love that

369
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.819
Tina Marie: helps maintain engaging pace in the narrative. Highlight key phrases

370
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.630
Tina Marie: is there my gosh, simplify and structure overwhelming concepts.

371
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.030
Tina Marie: You want me to send this to you.

372
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.190
Dan: Yeah.

373
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:54.309
Tina Marie: All right just to have it a test. You want to have it rewrite a chapter for you.

374
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.120
Dan: Oh, no! I thought you already asked him to do that.

375
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.680
Tina Marie: No, I did that for me.

376
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.860
Dan: Oh! Oh!

377
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.620
Tina Marie: Because let's see if it rewrote it, because I wanted to show you what it could do. Writing.

378
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:19.179
Dan: Yeah. But you know what's so funny is like, I'm going to finish this book, and I'm probably going to rewrite it again. And now I'm like, Oh, looks like I'm going to rewrite it again, except I won't run out of credits. If I upgrade to this thing.

379
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:26.719
Tina Marie: Right? Well, so it does have a limit of 100 searches. But what you can get out of that

380
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.320
Tina Marie: I haven't run into the limit. Yet I could.

381
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:29.930
Dan: Coach.

382
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.380
Tina Marie: Every query to deep research.

383
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.250
Dan: Oh.

384
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.860
Dan: well, would you even would you even use deep research if I gave it the book and said, Let's rewrite this.

385
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.100
Tina Marie: Yeah, I would.

386
00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:41.700
Dan: Okay.

387
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.313
Tina Marie: Okay, so

388
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:48.040
Dan: So I'd have 9 queries, because there's 9 steps.

389
00:44:53.100 --> 00:45:05.309
Tina Marie: So what you would want to do is take this whole conversation and put it into an Md. File, so that you could also train it with what we just did right to save yourself in that.

390
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.439
Tina Marie: I don't think.

391
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.490
Dan: Well, and the good thing like Claude doesn't seem to be good about

392
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:23.610
Dan: formatting, and this like, if you have this rewrited.

393
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:29.179
Dan: I mean, this would probably rewrite the entire book in one. Go and then

394
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.150
Dan: then, and it. It can export a

395
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.469
Dan: word, Doc, and then you bring the word Doc into Google. Doc.

396
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.660
Tina Marie: Yeah, alright.

397
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.200
Tina Marie: Let's see.

398
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.689
Tina Marie: Great. Which chapter would you like it to rewrite.

399
00:45:49.187 --> 00:45:55.729
Dan: The I think the most complicated chapter is 7

400
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:02.850
Dan: or, Yeah, step 7 should know that.

401
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.490
Tina Marie: Okay.

402
00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:03.980
Dan: Yeah.

403
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.080
Tina Marie: What was it about?

404
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.999
Dan: That's about building your funnels and all that stuff.

405
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.720
Tina Marie: Oops. Stop!

406
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.630
Tina Marie: It's not using deep research.

407
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.430
Tina Marie: Now we'll go.

408
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.709
Dan: Get? What do you have to turn something on.

409
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.930
Tina Marie: Yes, down here. Deep research.

410
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:38.820
Dan: Oh.

411
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.359
Dan: so it's called, Step 7.

412
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.829
Dan: gotta go back to my computer.

413
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:08.346
Dan: Yeah, there are no chapters. That's why it's like what it's called

414
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.930
Dan: cultivating the tide. Step 7. Colon. Cultivating the tides.

415
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.810
Tina Marie: Step!

416
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:42.704
Tina Marie: Or do you want me to keep all the original content intact while enhancing clarity? Or are there any sections you feel should be expanded, restructured, or removed.

417
00:47:43.520 --> 00:48:00.950
Tina Marie: we will leave it to your discretion as do let me change, but remember well, let's see.

418
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:03.860
Tina Marie: we'll just see what you do?

419
00:48:23.355 --> 00:48:24.420
Tina Marie: Alright. So, while.

420
00:48:24.658 --> 00:48:26.330
Dan: The issues I ran into is like

421
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:32.878
Dan: the logical flow, like I wrote the whole thing. And then when I started looking, I was like this. This shit's out of order.

422
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.479
Dan: It's like you can't do this before that.

423
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:49.680
Dan: But I hadn't picked up on that, and it never picked up on it. But Claude, today I was like, Hey, Claude was like leaving stuff out. I'm like what happened to this. These 2 sections. It's like, Oh, you're right. I didn't.

424
00:48:49.680 --> 00:49:08.869
Tina Marie: So Claude's issue also is in projects. So I thought the solution was projects. But it's not because you run out of credits way faster, because it's like it's processing all of that information every time as a single conversation. And so you're running into credit issues faster. And it can't be coherent.

425
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.719
Tina Marie: so this, so far, is better than everybody, for.

426
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.589
Dan: Yeah, I'm I'm.

427
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:14.580
Tina Marie: Continuity.

428
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:21.400
Dan: Yeah, I'm not. The cloud running out of credits is driving me mad, I'm like, Oh, my God!

429
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.640
Dan: So I'll be canceling.

430
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.930
Tina Marie: Yup.

431
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.109
Tina Marie: The one thing it did do.

432
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.249
Tina Marie: See if I can find my Claude.

433
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.540
Tina Marie: We have to go projects.

434
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.880
Tina Marie: Hold on!

435
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:57.189
Tina Marie: I don't think you can see it. Anyway, I wanna go find it, and then I'll put it in. Here

436
00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:04.209
Tina Marie: is project knowledge, Tina's voice, distinctions and style.

437
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.429
Tina Marie: So let's see, can I download this

438
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.330
Tina Marie: Google, drive

439
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:35.889
Tina Marie: alright, new talk, create and share? Oh, I think I might have put that in book content.

440
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:49.980
Tina Marie: Nope, you feature style guide, copy.

441
00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:02.760
Tina Marie: where is because this will be relative for you? Hold on.

442
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.520
Tina Marie: And this is called gosh! Dang it!

443
00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:19.229
Tina Marie: There! Okay, so file download. One thing that Claude was able to do really well

444
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:27.930
Tina Marie: after a lot of prompting was, Find the patterns of how I talk.

445
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.899
Tina Marie: That's not the one hold on.

446
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:41.079
Tina Marie: Let's see, what's this? It style guide.

447
00:51:44.630 --> 00:52:01.219
Tina Marie: Oh, so one of the things. Okay, Tina seamlessly weaves together insights from business systems and optimization, psychology and human behavior, spiritual principle pulls and eternal truths, scientific understanding, real world experience. This creates a holistic understanding that's both practical and profound

448
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:10.729
Tina Marie: examples using temple renovation to explain business fundamentals connecting neuroscience, insights to productivity, practices, applying spiritual principles to business growth.

449
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:27.840
Tina Marie: precision, and language. This surprised me. Tina is extremely careful with word choice, meaning distinguishes between similar but different concepts. For example, effective versus full effect, challenges oversimplifications, teaches others to think carefully about language.

450
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:35.469
Tina Marie: so in terms of like capturing a writing style. Or let's say you're using it to write lyrics.

451
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:41.820
Tina Marie: You could create a persona for a writer

452
00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:47.050
Tina Marie: and capture like what's unique about that songwriter

453
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:51.320
Tina Marie: and probably model after it, which I'd never thought about till just now.

454
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:57.810
Dan: It's funny you say that I learned something the other day from from AI like I was.

455
00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.780
Dan: I don't know how I got on this.

456
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.320
Dan: So I've been learning music theory by

457
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:14.130
Dan: asking it. Like not. I'm not asking it theory questions. But I'm getting like theory answers. So

458
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:27.120
Dan: I was talking to. I have like a song maker gpt right? That just again doesn't have its own memory. So it kind of sucks. But anyway, I was talking to it, and it was like, Oh, blah! Blah blah!

459
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:32.680
Dan: The who writes songs using Mixolydian.

460
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.369
Dan: So I know Mixolydian is a mode I'm like. I don't know what the Mixolydian mode is

461
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:54.480
Dan: Mixolydian mode has a flat 7. I'm like, okay, got it. That's it. So it's the D with the flat. 7 is Mixolydian. And I'm like, how do they use Mixolydian like? I don't understand. And they're like, Oh, so instead of using the 5 chord

462
00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:19.049
Dan: in whatever Mixolyn you're doing, they use the flat 7 and play it as a major chord. And I was like, Wait, what like? That's a thing. And then I was like, what who songs do this, and it gives a list, and I was like, holy shit. They do it all the time, and I'm like what that's it. You just flat. You use the flat. 7 note as a major chord, and you don't play the 5 chord in that song anymore. And they're like, Yup, I was like, wow! I never knew that.

463
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.260
Dan: So I'm like, I'm going to play with that.

464
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.800
Tina Marie: That's awesome.

465
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.750
Dan: I know.

466
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.709
Tina Marie: There's so much to learn. So here's step 7.

467
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:34.940
Dan: Oh, yeah, this is better, damn it.

468
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:44.710
Dan: cause Claude just keeps spitting out bullet points, and I'm like Bro. Too many bullet points.

469
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.520
Tina Marie: Worksheet right here.

470
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.070
Dan: Oh!

471
00:54:57.088 --> 00:55:00.280
Tina Marie: So I don't like any of that. I would get rid of all that.

472
00:55:00.792 --> 00:55:11.740
Dan: Yeah, like we. And this is what the discussion I have with Claude. I'm like, no, we don't want to give them specific things to do on a social media platform, because that'll be

473
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.490
Dan: redundant next week.

474
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:27.560
Tina Marie: This is what I do when it spits. This out is, I go through the numbers one at a time, and I will copy and paste what it said, and I will rewrite a thing. But then, from that point forward, I usually don't have to rewrite that type of thing anymore.

475
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:34.600
Dan: So interesting like that. It keeps going to this idea like there's nothing in the book about behind the scenes, content.

476
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:39.370
Dan: And it it kept saying, Do that, do that.

477
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:49.669
Tina Marie: So then, because deep research is so good, you could go do that and say, for some reason this keeps coming up right, and it comes up with different models. Here's

478
00:55:49.800 --> 00:56:05.669
Tina Marie: it. It doesn't say this. Here's why it doesn't say this. Here's why we don't want to say this. Here's what we say instead, if you do that, it will get better and better, and its ability to ma remember, across these conversations is so huge. So I'll copy this and send this over to you.

479
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:08.900
Dan: Say, like you should go get pro narrative

480
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:19.119
Dan: writing is good, but some of the stuff it's saying to do it's like, No, it's like it's completely ignored. Fan flowy, set up your email platform. Nope.

481
00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:20.350
Tina Marie: So

482
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:27.410
Tina Marie: because it can retain so much more. Even if you've done all this before, you should go, do it with deep research.

483
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.885
Dan: Yeah.

484
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:35.313
Dan: Well, I'm gonna finish it with Claude just to. So I can be like, put a PIN in that and be like, all right, I did it.

485
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:36.380
Tina Marie: Oh!

486
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.456
Dan: Which should take me 2 more days.

487
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.569
Tina Marie: Oh.

488
00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:45.690
Tina Marie: Yeah.

489
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.750
Dan: You would think they would just sell you more credits. Nope.

490
00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:58.029
Tina Marie: I know you would have to just go buy a completely new account and train it from the beginning. I'm like it. Yeah, that is is so dumb.

491
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.020
Dan: Yeah, it's so dumb.

492
00:57:02.823 --> 00:57:08.280
Tina Marie: Yeah. So this whole thing was a pitch for you to go by.

493
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.239
Dan: Yeah. Do you have your affiliate link or.

494
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:21.310
Tina Marie: No, no, just go build something freaking, awesome and but the way that you love puzzles this is your new puzzle, Buddy.

495
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:28.870
Dan: Well, I do like that. I can. I mean, I could probably pull some interesting shit out of it. Long term.

496
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.669
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, it for sure. Gets your $200 worth.

497
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:33.410
Dan: Yeah.

498
00:57:33.838 --> 00:57:35.929
Tina Marie: But it can also code way better.

499
00:57:37.542 --> 00:57:42.190
Dan: Norio's like goes off about how good Claude is at coding.

500
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:46.579
Tina Marie: Yeah, until deep research. I would I would run them against each other.

501
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:55.939
Tina Marie: Claude was better, Claude. I don't know that deep research is better up until like last week.

502
00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:02.679
Tina Marie: So, Claude, for example, if you like. So both of them have

503
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:13.010
Tina Marie: not fully current Internet access. Right? So, for example, if the repositories have changed on Github. They're all outdated.

504
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:22.080
Tina Marie: Chatgvt would go in circles, even on pro which was the beast mode and reasoning and coding, and

505
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:38.430
Tina Marie: it would just keep running into the but this is supposed to be here. But this is supposed to be here. Why is it not there? We must be doing something wrong. It must be the user right. Claude was like, wait a minute. Let me see all of the files. Right? So runs the command to see all the files in the terminal

506
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:53.520
Tina Marie: and like Oh, well, this is not what it's supposed to be. They must have updated it. I must not have the current system. Let me read the readmetxt. Oh, they did change it. Here's the update. This is what we actually should be seeing. Now let's adjust our approach.

507
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.270
Dan: Right.

508
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.560
Tina Marie: Yeah, but

509
00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:10.509
Tina Marie: I don't know that deep research couldn't do that now or do it better. So that would be worth trying. But worst case scenario. You pay $20 for code support from Cloud. You know it's still cheaper than a whole lot of other things.

510
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.050
Dan: Yeah.

511
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:13.880
Tina Marie: Anyway.

512
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.039
Dan: Well, then, it's just like your your

513
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.889
Dan: time. Right? It's like, then you do effective hourly rate. I'm like, Okay.

514
00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:22.250
Tina Marie: Yep.

515
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.840
Tina Marie: okay.

516
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.280
Tina Marie: While

517
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:38.150
Tina Marie: I mean, really, the book is a thing. Is there anything? You were sick for a while? So that's probably as good as.

518
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.860
Dan: Sure was.

519
00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.410
Tina Marie: Conversation, no deal any better now.

520
00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.980
Dan: No, we're also sick of.

521
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.269
Tina Marie: Well, I mean, like functional, better.

522
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.920
Dan: The danger.

523
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.880
Dan: Certainly. Functional. Yeah.

524
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.640
Tina Marie: Your mom.

525
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:54.580
Dan: Well, I'm

526
00:59:55.330 --> 01:00:10.719
Dan: I don't know when I agreed to this, so I guess my brother's out of town, and they're like, Hey, can you sleep. Stay over while he's out of town, and I was like, I guess. And then I go over last night and I'm like, what am I doing like. I don't even understand. Like, what what have I agreed to?

527
01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:19.139
Dan: And my mom's like, well, your brother said, you do it. I'm like, Yeah, obviously, yes, I said, I do it. And now I'm saying, what did I agree to?

528
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.020
Dan: She's like, you don't know. I'm like No.

529
01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:29.960
Dan: 4 nights. I'm like what what the what is wrong with you. I'm like I have to babysit you for 4 nights like. Come on.

530
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.699
Dan: so that's what I'm doing. She's she's not sick, though she's definitely better.

531
01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.850
Dan: although she's having some issue with like.

532
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:47.100
Dan: there's like a side effect from. She thinks from her new cholesterol medicine that like makes her hand cramp up.

533
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.020
Tina Marie: Oh!

534
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.149
Dan: She's like I I so she's like, I can't open a doorknob.

535
01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.670
Dan: I'm like, Oh, yeah. Well, you should. Probably that switched.

536
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:03.280
Tina Marie: Yeah, doesn't medicines and their side effects.

537
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.180
Dan: Yeah, that's.

538
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.089
Tina Marie: Those are rough, the body is so complicated.

539
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:19.779
Tina Marie: not fun. Well, I hope she feels better. I hope everybody heals up quickly, and also I am looking forward to see what you've done between now and next week with deep research, because I think it's gonna be cool.

540
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.730
Dan: We're gonna finish this damn book.

541
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:41.040
Tina Marie: You want to finish that book, and then probably other things before next week, even without doing a lot. So just so, you know, the Ios Update now has deep research on it. It looks like this little, that little icon. I don't know if you I stopped sharing, but it looks to me like a telescope.

542
01:01:41.450 --> 01:02:03.869
Tina Marie: So you tap on that. And it does deep research. It's not doing it by default, because there are limits to how much you can use. But by being able to do it on your phone, you can, just, you know, answer the questions that I ask you. It'll take anywhere from a minute to like 1520 min, sometimes 30 min, to do a long thing, and the more specific parameters that you give it, like

543
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:26.049
Tina Marie: these are people who agree with the theories that I agree with. These are the people that don't. So don't ever give me these types of examples. Don't go to these types of sites do go to these examples and these types of sites, and you'll get even more stuff. And so you can just have like a 2 or 3 min conversation, put it down, go to the next thing, and then, when you're ready, come back, and it just keeps working.

544
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.200
Dan: Yeah, that's cuckoo.

545
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:29.990
Tina Marie: Yeah.

546
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:38.092
Tina Marie: you're yeah. I'm I'm looking forward to our next conversation, even with a sick brain. I think that you'll just be like Whoa, let's go.

547
01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.401
Dan: Well, I was gonna tell you so.

548
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:52.999
Dan: it's like the 1st month of another 71 wraps up. And I'm like, Well, okay, let's see if sales have gone up. We're averaging 40 a day.

549
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.900
Dan: So I'm like, is this really happening like.

550
01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:07.220
Dan: did we really just increase new customers a day by 9, just introducing this new subscription.

551
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.959
Dan: The answer may be, yes, because the last 7 days we've been averaging 50 a day.

552
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.856
Dan: And I'm like, Oh, okay.

553
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.170
Dan: So Bobby's like, alright. So now we need to analyze the churn. I'm like, no, Bobby, we are not gonna know for months.

554
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.719
Dan: like all we can do is watch the new customers a day and

555
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:29.950
Dan: see what happens. But I'm like.

556
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:37.630
Dan: on Monday. I was like we shouldn't do anything. We should just leave everything alone, we shouldn't change anything. This is this is way better than I thought it was going to be.

557
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.060
Dan: So.

558
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.119
Dan: Stop working. Everyone.

559
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:45.810
Tina Marie: Yeah.

560
01:03:46.460 --> 01:04:12.009
Tina Marie: it's yeah. Anyway, it's good. Like, I, you know, cautiously optimistic and excited. But there's still real work to do. It's just that the work is so much more leveraged, and the pace can increase without adding too much more stress without adding any more stress. The bigger issue is putting guardrails on, because it's so easy to be sucked back into the work

561
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.029
Tina Marie: because it can.

562
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:13.420
Dan: Well.

563
01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.070
Tina Marie: Cast.

564
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.979
Dan: Yeah, I mean, it's now it's getting to the point where, like

565
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.910
Dan: the. So there it's like, well, we shouldn't do anything like. Now I'm like, well, I really shouldn't

566
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.629
Dan: like we have to let this probably run 3 months and then see

567
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:47.609
Dan: what really happens before we do anything like a social media strategy or really go go after Cpa exam.com. I'm like, because we won't really know, like we need this number to settle in. If it's 38 a day. If it's 39 today, like, okay, then that's what it is.

568
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.149
Dan: And then because we can't measure this other stuff

569
01:04:52.710 --> 01:05:00.539
Dan: and like, it's like, this is the test. The test was, just launch the new subscription. See what happens. And in theory you should wait 3 months.

570
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:06.873
Dan: And I'm like, okay? Well, which which I'm fine with, it's like great. We just increased the business like a shit ton.

571
01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:15.790
Dan: And then the with the fan flowy, it's like we put we launch the website on Monday, Tuesday.

572
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.970
Dan: And now I'm gonna see, I just want to see if, like, we get organic leads. And then we started running some really basic ads.

573
01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:30.070
Dan: Norio did a bunch of stuff. So it should be like all buttoned up also by the end of the quarter.

574
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:33.259
Dan: And then I'm like, okay. And then that thing is just

575
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:37.449
Dan: gonna be running. They're they're they signed up like 3 more bands.

576
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.580
Dan: I'm like, Okay, this is this is going.

577
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:44.964
Dan: So it's like, yeah, I think I can just do these 2 things.

578
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:51.090
Dan: I think I think weirdly, it's going exactly as I planned.

579
01:05:51.546 --> 01:06:07.080
Tina Marie: I was. Gonna say, like I, I'm I'm here looking like Duh. Everything that's been happening for several months has been leaning up to that and that conversation. But but of course it's

580
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:12.649
Tina Marie: theory and concept now being validated further and further. So I get it.

581
01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.683
Dan: Yep, yep, totally.

582
01:06:15.437 --> 01:06:25.279
Tina Marie: But that is nice, though, and especially because you're in this transition period. I mean Mariel. Is she going to go to school? Does she know? What does she want to do?

583
01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.330
Dan: She does not want to go to school.

584
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.590
Tina Marie: But what does she want to do.

585
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:39.079
Dan: She wants to get like a 2 year degree like she was talking about being a dental hygienist, I'm like, where did that come from?

586
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:39.920
Dan: So she.

587
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.840
Tina Marie: It. They make easy money, and it's a quick degree.

588
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.230
Dan: Oh, yeah, I think.

589
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.840
Tina Marie: Here.

590
01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.260
Dan: I think she just wants to get right to like making money and not

591
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.890
Dan: stick around in school for 4 years, but we'll see. I mean, that was her most recent version.

592
01:06:56.150 --> 01:07:18.830
Tina Marie: Well, either way, to be able to have the money to have the work that you do put you in a good mood because it's fun. It's the things that you want to do, and it's got purpose and meaning. And then also just to have time to be with the family and do things, but you'll also be in a situation where you can help Denise and Mariel and maybe Evelynn, but she's busy with school.

593
01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:35.089
Tina Marie: find their purpose, and the thing that like makes them happy, because that is the thing I think that most souls seem to be craving right now is this world is full of busy things, but not purposeful things, and people are drowning in the

594
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:39.349
Tina Marie: void of it all, and they don't even know it

595
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:49.770
Tina Marie: because they feel like they're constantly getting stimulated, and they are. But it's without meaning. It's like, it's like,

596
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:56.970
Tina Marie: I don't know like filling up on food that has 0 calories right? And.

597
01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.360
Dan: Yeah.

598
01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:05.040
Tina Marie: Nutrients. You're busy eating. Your tummy's full. You're going through all the motions, but you're getting nothing out of it. That's pretty much what this

599
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:08.899
Tina Marie: this world has a lot of it's not all it is.

600
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:15.100
Tina Marie: but there's a lot of that. And people are really stuck in that. So the freedom that you have with

601
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:18.630
Tina Marie: this business is that it fills you up

602
01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:25.369
Tina Marie: plus it finances you, plus. It frees you up so that you can go give that to your family.

603
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:26.880
Dan: Right.

604
01:08:28.299 --> 01:08:33.809
Tina Marie: New Years go, Mr. Diane. All right, get better. That's a command. Do it.

605
01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:34.549
Dan: Yep.

606
01:08:34.909 --> 01:08:39.369
Tina Marie: And I will talk to you later. Try to have a good weekend. Don't work too hard.

607
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.560
Dan: Cool.

608
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.909
Tina Marie: Talk to you later.

609
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.709
Dan: Alright! Later.

610
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:43.290
Tina Marie: Bye.
