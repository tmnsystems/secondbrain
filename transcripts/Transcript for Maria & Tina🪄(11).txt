Hey, hi, hi girl. What's going on?
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not talking about it. Let's think about work. Let's see. Trying to go get the notes from Babam and set it up so that you automatically get them. No, go away. Let's see. What's your joggy's name?
00:00:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Merlin.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I gotta remember that. I love that name so much. Do you remember when I was a kid? This was a navy blue phone and it was called Merlin and it was like they were Simon, you know, you pressed the button.
00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Marlin was kind of like that, but I don't know I just love everything Celtic Merlin, you know, the whole things But he looks like a wizard because he's all black and white, you know, he's oh, just like it looks like a little wizard a Merlin There he is coming again Hey, there he is he is Hi Marlin Hey Marlin, that's a cute boy. I used to do a boy He's gonna sleep well tonight.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the thing just I'm almost there Let's see, I'm just closing a bunch of Causing one step Project management methodology recap meeting includes including need to create agendas for the future Focus on securing a few high-level clients. Yeah, but what was the task? Action items review the camera Yeah, you suck at this.
00:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I suck at this?
00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, not you. Never say that. No, Father, I'm sorry.
00:02:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well, I do suck at project management. Ironically, when I'm with the business office for engineering, it's helping for price of our house. is ironic.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what?
00:02:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that?
00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you excel well enough in your own sphere, it compensates for not doing well in others. And that's why we don't have to be great at everything. Yeah, it didn't do a good job. And it didn't say what the agenda was.
00:02:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just said that we needed to create an agenda. Oh, that's what I was like.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, yeah, that is not useful at all. Thank you for telling me that's an obvious, but I already knew. So, let me see how I got. Yeah, I. What I was thinking, so I was thinking about next steps, and I don't thank you for your uselessness by the time I will go open my own notes and do this. Let me get into the right. What'd you call it? And actually, I'm waiting to hear back for my client because I wanted to reschedule half an hour later, because I thought was not gonna want to go to school until lunch, but I think the massive mommy massages and a little ibuprofen and a home baked wiener wrap helped her be able to push through.
00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what was I doing?
00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my brain. Yeah, I'm going to go back and forth between crying. And I'm so sad. I've lost 20 pounds since April, by the way.
00:03:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because you're really in.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's why I tons of muscle on. I have done lots of healers. been hypoglycemic. had just taken. diabetes, I knew that this was going to be a battle, but yeah, so I'm upset, but I ordered a continuous glucose monitor and I fix it. But in the meantime, good, good. One more thing I have to think about constantly. Yeah, because it's not just like, Hey, it's high blood sugar. Hey, you could get neuropathy. Hey, I already have to use and I kind of need kidneys and I don't enjoy suffering and I already actually have chronic pain and suffer every single day.
00:04:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, I really don't want more of it. Hmm. Well, I know that my best friend, Derby kind of got diagnosed with that too. He's on the glucose monitor and it surprised me because he's like, yeah, he's not not that overweight at all. And but he's having success now. So anyways, I know you don't want to talk about it. But I'm just saying it seems to be prevalent. I'm on the verge.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like I'm on the you know the markers that say hey you're close to it so you got to watch what you do but that's where I was and in April I was like okay I've lost 20 pounds I expected the number go down it went up so but the good news is like I know what to do and I'm not doing all of it but that's the thing is that you have to be vigilant at all times you have to either decide like do I want to be super disciplined or do I want to allow the things to happen that will happen and it's a choice like I don't get to choose do I have diabetes and do I deal with it but so and with the propensity towards hypoglycemia I feel like crap if my sugar is low I feel like crap if it's high and going low so it doesn't even have to be low and I think a lot of people don't take that into account and understand that the impact on mood and productivity when your brain is your job as a mom, as a business, whatever, when mood has such a big impact on it, like they're like, we just eat better. Yeah, it's not at easy.
00:06:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's yeah.
00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't eat terrible. That's the thing.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't even even working out as well. So yeah, yeah.
00:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but it's just when my God has a plan for me, he needs me to know what I'm capable of. And he needs me to make decisions. And also the one thing I need to know for sure is he needs me to lead by example. And instead of telling people what they should do, I get to be a walking testimony of this is what happens when you do the hard things. So now it's hard to be in an example though. Okay, let me share my screen because that'll haunt me stay focused. Is that the right one? It's not the right one. This is the right one. Dan and my attorney client are just like blowing up email right now. Don't know how to, oh actually, want to, that would stop notifications. don't know how to put my iMac in advanced strum. If I put my phone in do not disturb, it should put my computer. Okay, how many, oh look at my conversion thing. So let's do Trello first of all. And just work on our board there and get that in my way. So I'm going to create a new board. Let's see how workspace settings board creates. And we will call this. So, Good to do. What's called a business launch and scale template board. Okay. this can be like the one board to rule them all sort of thing. And Do that and see what their templates are. I have a job board. I don't know what that is. Go to markets. You know what I don't want to start with the template. I will just create it. Whoa. Well, that's kind of cool. guess I can deal with that. Little dark. I'll deal with what it looks like later. So let's create a 30,000 foot view list and the card is map out master plan. So this is, what does the entire business look like when it's reached full maturation? Okay, I'll grown up. Yeah, that's part of my intake process. I've been using for a long time because sometimes the language, you know, people struggle. with it. So when it's, when it's become the fullest version of your vision, vision, what does it look like? Um, most people think in terms of revenue only making 20 a year, but we get there. Really need to back down. Do this template to be, of course, all of itself. Yeah, if we, if we do it right. So what are you selling? That's the offer stack. How. How. How. How. is it fulfilled, supported, so filled at map out the entire process and ideal stack, including vendors and suppliers and softwares. So if it's digital, right, where's it? Where's it housed? Where is it housed? Yeah. What is the customer experience during that process? Support in, who supports the products, services, and how many people. I'm sorry. does, employees, powers, works, ideal, wages, go level, what level of autonomy leadership they have. So again, we're talking about what is it look like when it's all grown up. Now this is way too much for most people, but this is, but if we're thinking about it in terms of reverse engineering, because even if they're not coming to the table telling you what their big dream and vision is, they have one. And we talk about a lot of times entering the conversation in people's heads. And the other thing is where frustration happens, where offense happens, where disappointment happens, is when expectations are Met and whether they communicated or not and even whether they are conscious of it or not The expectation is that whatever I'm doing right now is leading me to this actual drain and vision. I have in my head The burden then is to make that happen even if they haven't communicated it They're holding accountable whatever they're doing right now to this and most people they're not even conscious that they're doing it They don't know a lot of times people don't ask for help because they don't know how to ask for help They don't know what to ask for help with because they're going like yeah, but I need this I need this I need this Like I can't ask for all these things. can't afford all this help I don't even know how to get from here to there. So That is the thing that most people need is they don't know how to get from here to there. You could tell me any situation that you're trying to do. And I could probably figure out a practical plan to get you from here to there. We can vicariously guide them through getting from here to there by walking them through the mental process this. I almost guarantee you not nobody but most of the people have never gotten this specific in what their big vision is. And most of them even with the specific questions won't be able to tell you what that looks like. But if they can get a version, and this is what we'll say at the bottom if you if you can get a version how what now this doesn't mean that you're going to build what you plan out here. But if you can't even build a specific version in your mind of what you're going for you're having an Alice in Cheshire cat conversation. What path do I take? Where are you going? Don't know. Then the path doesn't matter.
00:15:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we could throw in an image like that, too. Let's see if I get the image. So because we have limited time, this is, this helps kind of just give an example. Let me see if I can add an image or maybe I could just drag it in. Let me just complete that particular step in my head. It's not a desktop. There it is. All right. right. Yeah, so what I would like to do, however long it takes, is spend some time, a lot of it I can do myself, and then I could show you, and then on calls we can kind of work through it and go, I'll go like, well, here's what I've come up with. And then discuss it, and as we discussed it, I would imagine because this is what happens is I'll either get inspired to make modifications or you'll have some modifications that you'll suggest. But at the end of the conversation, however long that takes, we will have a template that a person can pick and choose and say, okay, I want this board I don't need this board. This is not applicable, right, but they'll have the master thing. So instead of going and adding boards, they can just remove, remove, remove, being able to visualize the whole thing can help. And so it in and of itself could be its own product and service. The other thing is, though, if we get a high level client, then we go through and say, okay, these are the boards that are applicable. now we just create. eight assignments, like, who's going to do this? When is this going to get done? Who's going to do this? When is it going to done? There will be dependencies that are built into the template. For example, if you're building a sales page, first of all, you have to have a domain. You have to have hosting. You have to have the, you have to have a merchant processing. You have to have, maybe you have to have a gateway if you have a merchant account, know, like all of these things. But then you have to have copy. You have to have images. The images need to be inspired by the copy. So the copy has to come first. So there's a dependency, right? The copywriter has to know what the name of the product is and has to have some information on them. So the copy is dependent upon market research and definition. So all of that stuff can be created in a, not necessarily linear, but somewhat chronological process and for people. I've never done this or never done it well. Most of the people that have done it did not do it well, did not do it quickly. It'll be the first time they've seen it mapped out like that. Even on a high level, because a lot of the high level, and I'm talking about seven and even eight bigger earners, I think it's very different once you get to nine and above. They didn't get there by not systematizing, optimizing, even if they're not good at higher somebody who is good at it. They understand the process because somebody else was helping them in doing it. They did it themselves. But seven and eight figure earners, a lot of the times just got there by grit, determination, charisma, that type of thing. Lots of times. It's not through good business structure, organization, and optimization. Anyway, I would like to do this. So what I was talking about is for us to create an agenda. And the agenda can be we progress on it even if we can't meet because stuff is going happen. Yeah, we can't meet but then we still know what we're working on. So to me and I'm going to go ahead and save this for now and pop over to this one, questions for next meeting, I'm going to say agenda, meeting agendas. I'm going add a card so big rocks call it big rocks so big rocks are not that open card. Really the big rocks so I'm kind of prioritizing them. So the big rock is one, two, four, five, on the through three not two three one two three anyway one three um high level df done for you um clients or done with you either i'll say df y slash the clients um that we work on together in either well in some marketing plus project management capacity in order to fund everything else and keep our saws so we'll put this here then the other thing would be so i see the next level down would be hybrid coaching group. Yeah, I'm not gonna call it group where we get to serve mid to get, I'll say mid level. Because this helps us ascend our audience. The higher level helps us refine our teaching serves as energy for us because we're in the community of people who are doing things and have experience, but don't need a ton for us. Yes, we end. they are doing things that we don't. have a high level of commitments to them. Also funds, whatever we are building.
00:22:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
To me, this gets the most time.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is the, remember I told you, there's 10% of people that will succeed no matter what you do, 10% that will fail no matter what you do, and there's 80% in the middle. To me, this is the 50 to 80% people. 50% people that are most are 90% actually, who's 60 to 90%. Most influenceable. Most kind of. Yeah, most influenceable. So, it gives us. this greater opportunity to impact the market on a larger scale, also should inspire content creation. So the high level of people in that top, they're in the top 10%. Their content, the only content they really need is going to be bite sized nuggets for the most part, something to inspire them because the rest of it is they're going to need a book, a masterclass or like a tactile thing that is too high level for most people, it needs to be really specific.
00:23:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whereas this group of people, they, there's a lot that they need to learn. So this is basically school, like they need to go to school every day, they need to learn the basics and the fundamentals. Um, maybe they have one fundamental mastered, but for the most part, they probably have zero fundamentals mastered and so they, they need the constant fountain, but they also need somebody that they can ask questions to from time to time. Um, but because of that, interacting with them should help us to know, hey, if we go go make a YouTube video on this or do a podcast on this or whatever create content around this, it should have a pretty large audience that can attract more people into this group and the goal would be to ascend, either continue to be there as a support, right, and we can ascend them maybe into a higher level group where there's even less, but they, um, members, but they get maybe a little bit more touch or maybe that it's box or access or whatever. I don't know. But anyway, that's where I'm thinking is that this, this takes up the most of our I'm in energy and I don't mean it in excess, I just mean that that's, that's the greatest need group. And then the other one would be do it yourself, coaching, they get software well, not software. They get courses, courses, emails, videos, curated content, but not Ascent, then higher level, low ticket, but low vibration also. That's, that's, that's, what it's going to be for the most part. There will be high vibration people in there that are going to move up. for the most part, we don't want to spend a lot of time and energy here. This is just we're offering it. It's a magnet to attract people. If you're looking for something and you can't afford more, this is here for you. But if you're the kind of person that is going to multiply what you have, that's when we want to work with you. But first, you have to prove it by consuming what we've given you and taking action on it. So this is our kind of, it's give back, it's taking advantage of giving use of our library, of wisdom, knowledge, products we've created. So they are just creating these are the big rocks. So, big rocks are everything that we do throughout the week. If it isn't serving a big rock, either we need to redefine our rocks or it shouldn't be getting done. Unless, you know, we're getting into, I'm acknowledging the fact that I'm just doing this because it's shiny and it's fun and I want to, but I'm not doing it at the detriment of these other things. So, one of the things we have to do is do we want to agree that these are the priorities of what we want to work on together.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think so. I have to think about this more to see if there's something to And writing it down helps us to do that.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you can look at that. So then the next thing would be so in order to support the big rock. So the first big rock is this. And so, in order to do that, we need to create Trello board template. And we'll do this. Right out. Already. Slash pedigree. Post page. That's what I was looking for. Products. Already created. And define which ones need to be updated. Okay. All The sub task is create tasks and due dates, assignments, can we repurpose it, can somebody else do this, can we delegate it or not, for updating those products. And then, um, that creates a webinar or VSL or VSL or video, either way, however we do it, um, Our history, um, how we grow businesses and how. The power. of, you know, your marketing specifically, and my project management and ops is a powerhouse catalyst for sustainable growth. Something to that effect. So we've been talking about, that's what people need to see, right? They need to see who we are, what we do, how we can do it, we put it in some content where, because first we have to increase their level of awareness, just that we're even there. We need to have a application form, qualification form in order to talk to us, paid time that is given rebate, basically, on towards working with us. So to me, that's it for this big rock, because we have clients at some point, right? So potentially create maybe YouTube ads for getting eyeballs on this content, slash offer, whatever. I mean, but that's, it wants to this. But to me, that is the overarching kind of view of like, what we've discussed should happen. And that if we do this, and if we do these things well, it should attract the people that we're looking for.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
we don't. I agree. Yeah, yeah. it eliminates all the time on the sales calls, pre-selling, right? Because a lot of them are, you know, haven't been, yeah, exposed to our content, so you don't have to answer it one-on-one, you know? Yeah, I like that.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll do this. Everything that we do for my level clients helps us here. That content can be repurposed to be to this offer. The solo board becomes, we template, we sell rather than use for that, right? So we're creating it, and we'll use it for our content. at high level, but for the hybrid and the low level people even, you get it, you manage it, you do it, but we created it.
00:33:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If my power goes out, that's why I lost you. We just thunderstorms coming in.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, both the dog and cat's heads went up and look it around. It's funny, but not, you know.
00:33:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it right when you're not a huge city. these storms cause power.
00:33:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and we used to live out in the country where the power went out part of it, and it's only 15 minutes away from here, but the city grid and county grids are different and the upkeep on them and the quality of them. My girls are now because because we used to live out there and we'd have outages for like 12 hours. so we're like, I wish the power would just go out. only way it happens here is not usually from a storm unless we need a train call or if a car ran into a transformer. So that does happen, but because We are dead in the middle of the city and the impact is so huge they get the crews out immediately Okay But it also does never take down the cell towers, and I've got Wi-Fi like they'll service for days, so Okay, um anyway, so What I think that we could do and this is something like I could work on and then just go okay I finished it. Do you want to add anything to it? don't actually have to do this on the calls? I'll sometimes like and This is what I was talking about when you're like maybe it could be a support call Sometimes my brain is just like I can't draw the energy like I need the conversation Then just being here talking about it together my brain goes. Oh, yeah, let's see this this isn't this But I cannot get myself to sit down and even open this and look at it It feels Overwhelming and I feel sad and I feel impressed And it's just the way my brain works and it stresses me out and frustrates me, but if I talk to somebody about it And I'm like, Oh, I love this again. Let's do this. And it's a social thing. So, um, I don't. So, so to me, like, for, for here, through next week. And so you close the one client, right? have income coming for, yeah. to me, that's bought some time you've got enough. Yeah. So, so what I would love to do is just kind of set, first of all, the, so the first thing has to be, let's agree on what our rocks are. And, um, generally speaking, I'd like to set rocks for the quarter, but sometimes they'll extend past. Sometimes they don't take up the whole quarter. But to me, these things, building these out through the rest of the end of the year, like, if we go fast, amazing. But if we don't, and it takes us until like, you know, it would be really great if we have an offer ready. for the new year energy. Yes, people are setting goals and targets. I'm not a huge, like, I'm on a constant path of evolution. I don't need something to tell me I need to redefine myself and change myself. And but that's big energy for for a new year. People like have a sudden awareness of where they're at.
00:36:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Whereas I'm constantly taking stock of it.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I've never really been big into that. But the more that I realize like there really is a surge. And I do have seasonal energy shifts and awareness. So something happens. Like when everything gets cold and dies, like my perspective shifts when fall happens and the kids go back to school after I'm done just because in the summer, all I want to do is set up the sun.
00:36:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't really care about anything else at all.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to be in the water. I want to be outside. I just want to be cleaning and organizing, so I have natural seasons that are very different operationally and mentally, but I have noticed that there is generally this whole surge of people evaluating themselves and feeling a pressure and a depression and a sadness and an overwhelm during the holidays probably increased also by the fact that they might not have the family that they want to have. Christmas Day is the biggest day of suicide. At least in America, I don't know how it is worldwide, but given that Christianity isn't as prevalent throughout the whole world. But that's it. So anyway, if we could have working backwards, since you um, I don't know. So And next week I would love us to figure out some targets of what could we have and do we do we go do we target more the the high ticket and let the high ticket work trickle down and to feed this this lower level. I'd love to come up with names for each of these. And so it's like this one could be pocket COO, CMO, right? It would be great if we and this could be just what do we have it right now? Marketing Accelerator, I have a new school group.
00:38:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is yeah, perfect.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect because that's my hair is driving me now.
00:38:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so if we could figure out what is marvellous. I'm like, oh, yeah, the purple.
00:39:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see the purple. Oh, yeah.
00:39:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's pretty.
00:39:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
love it. Go ahead. Sorry.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you've got the colorful picture behind you and then you've got the red shirt and the purple and I'm just like, it just goes.
00:39:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's awesome. I know. Well, the funniest thing is I did no videos today. So we're just wearing a t-shirt here and no makeup and hair was in like up and ahead, Ben.
00:39:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at you.
00:39:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Look at you. Yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, well, right now the business accelerator, honestly, is 99% the gears. So I don't think there's that many mid-level people in it. I don't think we should think about what's there. I think we should think about what we want to be there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we could, yeah, so it could become something else. mean, I'm a little bit of a fan right now, just someone I'm seeing and then how we could potentially attract a lot of good traffic from YouTube, especially when we start, you know, really, you know, everything else we got going on here with the pedigree and, and, and, hold it on the messaging. I think, yeah, to like a webinar VSL funnel to sell like a 197 or 297, I think could be the coolest thing as the middle one.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That hybrid coaching group, maybe and 197.
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My eyes just really well was opened when Cara showed me that productivity funnel that is charging $297 for course, make $100k a month. Like, wow, that's nice.
00:40:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I think though, so here's the thing about pricing. When you can show a person the value and how they're 297 at the very least, they make it back. If not, they make more. So that requires is then to already be making money. We don't want to have people going broke in here. If you are not able to get your money back, if you're not making money and we can't help you get your money back, we don't want the energy of your stress and your overwhelm. Anyway, go to our go get our other stuff.
00:41:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
