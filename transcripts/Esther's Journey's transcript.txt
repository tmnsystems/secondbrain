Tina Marie: Gotta go to the salon. But anyway. So yeah, um.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tina Marie: A lot of. I've learned that a lot of the aging that we thought had to happen Doesn't have to happen. A lot of it is diet based

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Tina Marie: And a lot of it is diet based Like.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Tina Marie: Are. Food is just so corrupted

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. But the more that I'm hearing

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Esther: I I agree with that You know, my grandmother on my actually, all of my grandparents lived over 90, and my my mom's mom was a hundred 2

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Esther: When she passed, and she probably would have kept going. Um, you know. But

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Esther: You know. She grew up Um, and near a little fishing village in in China. It was not so little anymore. It's actually no. It was a major like

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Esther: Port, and Every single day, just fresh fish.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Esther: From the ocean, and Their food was so clean.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Esther: In our, our, in our parents, generation are even in our generation like, let's just say, you know, with, you know us growing up. It's just so much like cleaner than it was. Um, and it's you know. And again, it's hard as a parent. You're only

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Esther: Like it's, you know. You can only get what's available to you unless you do have the time and the energy to grow your own food, you know, like

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Tina Marie: Bye. Yep.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Esther: Yes, yes, I I mean I am.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Tina Marie: Part of my family plan is is to be able to make enough money that I set up a family homestead, and my sister and my nephews will run it, because that's what she wants to do. But she'd never be able to afford to do that, and I'm like you do it for everybody. You grow all the things for everybody. I'll teach you all of it. I'll buy all the systems, you run it, and we all get our food and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Esther: The agreement.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. I'm just like I I'm 1 of those. I don't wait for somebody else to fix something. I solve the problem, and I don't Believe in limitations. I just believe in overcoming them. So if I lack

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Tina Marie: I make more, whatever it is.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Tina Marie: If I lack the skill, I get more. If I lack the people, I get more. If I lack the money I get more And it takes a little bit of time. But if I get to the end of my life I'm never going to be like oh, I wish I'd done this, even if I never complete all of those things

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Tina Marie: I was on the path I was Engaged in doing what I believe in doing, and so I don't see how I could have regrets with that. You know.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Esther: I I think part of that is also like the joy from the journey uh

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Esther: Than actually reaching the goal right?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tina Marie: That's that's how I am. Yeah.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Esther: Hi Mhm.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Tina Marie: I I love that. That's why yours is Esther's journey. The name of your meeting

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Esther: So aptly named. Um

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Esther: And you know, I think that's a good segue, because You know um

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Esther: That's what I consistently struggle with. I can I struggle with Finding the joy in the journey, you know, and I think myself like a lot of people

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Esther: Are conditioned to Feel that we can only be happy

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Esther: Once we reach the goal

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Esther: Um, so that also ends up becoming very um. It's just not helpful in terms of how to live life

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Esther: I imagine because If you're only doing things for some sort of express purpose or goal all the time, and you don't know how to find joy in the journey that just makes

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Esther: That just makes it really hard to live the kind of life that you could be living or

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Tina Marie: It just means joy is always out of reach. You can't get there

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Esther: Oh! Joy is always out of reach. Yes.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Esther: Stuff.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Esther: And you know, and it's really interesting, because this is kind of the exact

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh, wait a minute

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Esther: Uh conversation that Fuji and I happened to be having last night actually You know, and and it

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Esther: You know, it was very interesting, because Like I'm

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Esther: I told you know I I've been telling, you know. I think, in conclusion, we're I'm just very unanchored right now. Um.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Esther: In the sense that I told them. You know. The times when you and I were really in sync were really difficult times. We were just going through

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Esther: So much. You know. But I told him, you know. Think about how in sync we were

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Esther: Like we were Um, passionately solving and actively solving this problem that we had, together with our awful business partner.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Esther: You know. Um! We were supporting each other day to day Through something that we were both like, really dialed in and really passionate about

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Esther: You know. And right now, I told him. You know the Venn diagram of where we're overlapping is just not overlapping very much

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Yeah.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Esther: You know um And Luji is one of those people that

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Esther: You know he can get excited and Joyful and interested in just about anything

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Esther: You know. Um, you know, even the most obscure types of things. He's like, yeah, if you told me you wanted to start a garden just like start planting things, and you're really into. And you, just like went all for it. He said. I would find that interesting. I talked to you all day about it, you know.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Tina Marie: I love that

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Esther: You know, so he's extremely supportive in that way. And I told him that, Michael, you've never given me any reason to believe otherwise, that you wouldn't be supportive of anything that I choose to do. He's like, I just want you to choose something that'll make you happy that you're interested in, and that you're

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Tina Marie: I was. Gonna say, I'm just gonna change that wording for a second. He just wants you to choose happiness, because that is actually the choice

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Esther: Yes.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Tina Marie: It's choosing happiness. All of the things are irrelevant

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Tina Marie: When you choose happiness, you find it in all the things, Esther. Now some things make it easier

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Esther: Huh!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: But You're still focusing in your conversation right now on the thing being the source of your happiness.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Tina Marie: That's not it.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Esther: Oh, okay.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: Happiness is the thing

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Esther: Oh! That is an interesting idea.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Esther: Okay.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Tina Marie: I promise you it's the truth. Um, there's my guy sends me something. There's this meme he saw, and it's a there's 2 little stick people, and there's 1 person holding a jar, and inside of the jar it says Happiness. And the person next to him says, I've been looking all over for that. Where did you get it? And the person smiling says I made it myself

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Esther: Okay.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Tina Marie: And he says, That's you, Tina, like I just

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Tina Marie: Make joy.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Tina Marie: Because it isn't anywhere I looked for it. You know I've got. I got some years on you, and it's it is not a thing, it's it is the

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Tina Marie: Thing. You just look for the things to be happy with, and one of the ways

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Tina Marie: Really the thing that it started with for me was gratitude. Because there's another saying that is, it isn't happy people that are thankful. It is thankful people that are happy So.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Esther: Oh!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Tina Marie: It was starting a practice of gratitude. But I have so many health issues. I've been hospitalized with pneumonia 4 times. I've almost died several times. I'm not being dramatic Truly on the verge of death.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Tina Marie: In a way where I could feel Mortalities, fragility.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Tina Marie: And that it could just be gone Um

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Tina Marie: But knowing that It.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tina Marie: It puts things in perspective, because You know it can be gone at any moment. So what do you do with it?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Tina Marie: But because of that also struggling to breathe. Last 2 years ago I was on an oxygen machine. I didn't know that I had

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tina Marie: A Peanut allergy And so I was. I had always eaten peanut butter

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Tina Marie: But somehow I developed This thing, but it wasn't a rash or anything, and it didn't happen immediately.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Tina Marie: But my airways just kept constricting, kept constricting, and my oxygen levels were dropping down to the seventies And it was just this.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Esther: Oh, my God!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Tina Marie: Feeling in my soul like stop eating peanut butter And to me, that's God. But anyway, so I did stop. But but I had to be on oxygen just to live, and I'm like this is ridiculous like I'm a strong woman like I can do all these things

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Esther: Okay.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Tina Marie: Like what is happening to me. I'm like, I don't want to die. I don't want to live like this. Something has to be fixed and Anyway, it was peanut butter of all the things in the world. But the reaction time was so off that I had. I I didn't know that

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Esther: I mean, who would have known when it's something that you've never been alert

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Tina Marie: My whole life right so um!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Esther: Hammer.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Tina Marie: But gasping for air all day long is exhausting And when you get that tired you're tired in your soul like, and I've been tired in my soul for so many things. I have literally struggled from infancy because of abuse and all kinds of other things.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Tina Marie: And I realize, though, that

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Tina Marie: Every moment is a gift. Air is a gift, vision is a gift.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Tina Marie: 2 hands are gifts. Strength is a gift. The ability to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Tina Marie: Look at a child and see a child to hear laughter, to feel sun on my skin. All of these things are Gifts.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Tina Marie: And I find joy in them And

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Tina Marie: Nobody can take that from me. As long as I'm alive, and I have these gifts that God gave me. Nobody can take it from me

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Tina Marie: And so Then my focus became on multiplying it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Tina Marie: Um, sometimes just in my focus, but also in Growing it, growing it for other people.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Tina Marie: Um. I find joy in Accumulating, amazing women around me has been a mission for the last few years.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Tina Marie: And I'm telling you I have never been so happy in my whole life. Because

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Tina Marie: I to the point of what you wrote about the intimacy Esther, I could have written the same things you did. I was the girl who loved to climb trees

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Tina Marie: I was rough and tumble, but also I loved the romance, and I loved magic, and I still believe in magic. But to me it's More like this

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Tina Marie: Gift of God. But either way the source doesn't matter. But when you see some of the things that happen in the world, there's no other explanation than Something that could be called magic. It's just

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Tina Marie: Beautiful. And

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Tina Marie: Um Hold on a second I have to like. Where did I go with this

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Esther: You know, whatever it is that inspires a sense of wonder. Right? And you know

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Tina Marie: Yes, oh, women women women so um! I am a super affectionate, physical, intimate. All that

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Tina Marie: But I don't get any of it hardly in my life. And um. My girls are grown so I don't have babies to snuggle with anymore.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Tina Marie: But

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Esther: I'll bring you my baby one of these days. You could snuggle her

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh! I'm just coming to come down. Hug all of you!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Esther: Or you could come over and snuggle my babies

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Tina Marie: I know. I also I also wanna hug um Mark's mom's schnoodle cause Ronan is the cutest dog in the world. I don't know if you've seen him. But oh, my gosh Um, but having women in my life like they hug me, and they kiss me, and they hold me tight, and sometimes I hug them, and they want me to hug them longer like I get

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Tina Marie: It. Physical touch doesn't have to be sexual. It can just be physical touch

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Esther: Yes. Mhm.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Tina Marie: And a lot of people don't understand that. But I know that. So having these women that love me, and that can just hug me and kiss me, and make me feel connected Has filled a gap that I needed very badly, and so my joy has increased because of these

00:13:44.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: Beautiful and amazing women, and some of them are physically close, and some of them I just feel this exuding love for you, for Tona and Um. So there is joy, and there's no like. Obviously there's a purpose in our conversation.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Tina Marie: But The purpose isn't why I feel what I feel

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Tina Marie: It's just you. It's just getting to talk to you.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Tina Marie: So. Um learning.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Tina Marie: The things that I lack Understanding what makes me feel happy. So physical touch is a big thing, laughter, fun.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Tina Marie: Sunshine, water. Um innocence uh, just

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Tina Marie: You know. Um overcoming obstacles so like having a common purpose and fighting a common struggle with somebody, and being able to attain that victory like you and Fuji, when you had that, you know you were united in in an obstacle

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Tina Marie: Those types of things. Make me feel alive. They make me feel powerful. They make me feel grateful for all the things that are happening in the overcoming

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Tina Marie: And so I just put those things in my life and They do have goals at the end of them.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Tina Marie: But it is the process that makes me happy. The goal will also add joy. But that's momentary. Once you get to the goal, then what That that doesn't last

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Esther: Yes, I think that's the crux of what I've kind of discovered. Is that okay? I've Gotten to the goals

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Esther: Like, now? What

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Esther: But you know it's so interesting. And I think this is what Fuji was trying to Express or communicate with me. Last night, when we were having this discussion

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Esther: But I think you put it in a way that I'm I'm finally starting to kind of comprehend

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Esther: When people say, Oh, the joy is in the journey, the joy is in the journey, or whatever it is like. I'm like, Okay, I can repeat that, and I kind of But I I was having a really hard time, like

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Esther: Understanding, that

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Tina Marie: But how like How is it in the journey? And and that's important.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Esther: Hmm. Mhm.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Esther: Yeah. Oh, my gosh! I was sniffling because I'm having allergies like like this allergies. Then it's just like really getting to me

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Tina Marie: They're all same

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Esther: Um, anyways, I know. Where am I?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Tina Marie: Everything's in bloom here, so I completely can relate

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Esther: Yeah. Um

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Esther: Anyway. Um, no, I think I think, combining what he He was um talking what he and I were talking about last night

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Esther: A new kind of Uh having your way that you explain to me. I think I'm

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Esther: A step closer to Understanding.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Esther: And I think I'm a step closer to Being a little bit more clear as to what I'm

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Esther: What I'm Overcoming or trying to overcome

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Esther: And it was very interesting because Last night. Part of you know. Our conversation came up

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Esther: It was because I had a I had a phone call with my, you know, with my parents.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Esther: Quite poorly, actually um. And it's really funny because I was. And I literally told them, all right. Well, if you guys Are gonna just

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Esther: Shout and argue. Uh! I'm hanging up by, you know. And it's fine like I just told him that. You know this is, I thought to myself, well, on a scale of one to 1010 being like the worst, blow up

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Esther: That was probably about a 3, but Fuji was sitting there. You know we were speaking in Mandarin, so he didn't know. You know what we were saying.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Esther: And he was just like hanging out Um. But again it was one of those things where um

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Esther: It was a good opportunity to practice my boundary. For example. And I said, Oh, yeah, that's I told him. Oh, yeah, that's why I hung up, he said. You know, he's like, you know, next time you could even hang up like earlier as soon as he starts like being

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Esther: You know bad behavior and insulting you, and like saying all kinds of shit about you. You can just say, All right. Well.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Esther: Ah, I'm not gonna talk to you until you can have a civil conversation And you know, he said, just cut it off

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tina Marie: Sorry.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Esther: And it's really interesting, because that then Let me the rest of the night to kind of think about my boundaries. Right? Um!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Esther: etc. Um. So I kind of considered some, you know. Think, thought about okay. Well, you know, if I bring the girls over this weekend And he, if if any time I bring them over, my parents start being rude or shouting to each other, then you know it hasn't happened before. It's fine, but I know that I'm gonna just up and leave nothing to be said about that like

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Esther: And, Mom, if you want to tell me that I'm rude, that auntie already cooked all this food. And why are we leaving? And maybe Emmy is upset because she doesn't understand why we're leaving grandma's house. I'm like, no, this is my boundary, and

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Esther: I want to demonstrate these boundaries for my girls. And they might not understand it right now, and we might be upset because she can't understand why we're leaving

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Esther: But one day, you know, I hope, that she will understand You know how important it is to hold certain boundaries

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Esther: Anyway, that just got me thinking about a lot of things and Kind of all in a nutshell to say that

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Esther: I was telling Fuji. I think I'm starting to understand why I've been walking so much, and why, like

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Esther: I've got just so much anxious energy, you know, that prevents me From that, I'm allow not prevents me. I'm allowing it to prevent me

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Esther: From like feeling and finding joy Because it's you know. And I said, when I have something to focus on like the company is something I'm excited, he said. He told me. I've seen you

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Tina Marie: It's important. Oh, it's biting orange. Sorry!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Esther: Oh, sorry!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Tina Marie: I was trying to get a video to show you, but it started playing automatically. Go ahead, keep going

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Esther: Okay. Oh, oh, all good!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Esther: Um, he said. I, he said, I've seen you. I've seen you work, and I've seen When you're drawn into something and you give it a hundred 10%

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Esther: And you're passionate. You're all in, he said. I've seen that from you. And I said, Yeah, I know I know I can do that. You know, it's like right now, but right now I have

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Esther: All this anxious energy that I don't know where to channel, because I don't have something right that'll draw me in. And so I told him that it seems that because I'm unanchored right now. Um!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Esther: I'm you know that I'm defaulting To a lot of those inclinations that I was like that's been really wired in me

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Esther: You know. My parents? Never! I can't think of anything that my parents

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Esther: Do because they like they like it, you know, and then, you know, we've always grown up You know. Oh.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Esther: Not doing things unless it serves a purpose You know, like

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Esther: I can't tell you the number of times that I even actually remember where I was made to stop doing something that I felt was fun Like so many times. Oh.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Esther: Esther, you like singing. Shut up! You're singing too loud. It's annoying

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Esther: You know that kind of thing, or you know. No, you're not allowed to climb that tree, or you know. Oh, you're having fun and copping and jumping. Stop doing that. It's unladylike

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yep.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Esther: Up. Every single thing, and just like

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Esther: Just how suppressed and how suppressed it is To the point where

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Esther: It's like. Oh!

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Esther: I would catch myself if I am having too much fun Or I don't want to let them see that I'm having fun

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Esther: Because if they see I'm having fun, then I've got another lecture coming, or I've got something coming. So I told him, Michael, this is what has happened to me my whole life. It's no wonder that I have hard time finding joy, you know, and just Being, you know.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Esther: So. Yeah, it's

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Tina Marie: There, there are 3 things I wanted to tell you Um

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Tina Marie: First, st I'm gonna show you this video Hold on. I gotta find it again

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Tina Marie: Because I I think I saw this on my psychology. Class.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Tina Marie: It's important. Okay. Pause.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Tina Marie: Let me share, screen. Share.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Tina Marie: That one. How is the input of parents using on a child, and how they change their behavior to avoid making adults angry

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Tina Marie: Watch what happens when an experimenter comes in. Who's critical and angry Before this the baby was playing and engaging with the toy in the necklace

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Tina Marie: The new experiment starts a fake argument with the other person. We watch the effect this has on the baby Aggravating. That's so annoying.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Tina Marie: Well, that's just your opinion. It's aggravating The experiment is doing amazingly intense, but it's already affects how the baby is going to play with that necklace again.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Tina Marie: So it sees a necklace, and this one it doesn't pick it up It looks confused. It knows that it's doing something wrong by engaging in this toy that the adults got angry about

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tina Marie: A high level of anger and emotion stayed by the adult is having a direct impact on what the baby does to avoid making the adult angry So he simply sits and looks at the toy

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: Without playing with it. Up until this

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Tina Marie: Before that the the version I'd seen of it the baby was playing, and was happy

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Tina Marie: Be, and was just. And then that happened, and then it shut down, and I I cried, because I've seen that so many times in my life and in my family.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Tina Marie: And with my girls, which is why I took them from where I took them. Um

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Esther: Well, and I'm sure it happened to you, too. Given

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: It was really weird. Oh!

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Tina Marie: All the time, so

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Esther: The environment that you grew up in

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Um, and and I've been guilty of it.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Tina Marie: Uh, and and seeing it in them and trying to fix it. The crazy thing is, though. They can remember just single instances where it happened. And those would be the same times when I'm like, Okay, Tina, you can't ever do that again.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Tina Marie: But that's all they remember. They don't remember the growth. They don't remember the improvement

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: That's how damaging those moments are

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Tina Marie: They become the truth, even if they were actually the exception

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Esther: Hmm. Mhm.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Tina Marie: So that's 1 thing so, and and the importance of that, why, I'm telling you that is because Emmy may be sad, and she may not understand why you're leading, but you're still probably doing the best thing for her by minimizing her exposure to arguments.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Tina Marie: Because that tension and that stress it lasts long. Esther.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: When I was 14, my mom finally told me that what had happened to my brother, that my dad Killed them, that it was in front of me, that it was in the room

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: When I was in the room. Up until that point I'd had nightmares. I had visions. I didn't know what happened

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Tina Marie: Um. I just knew that I felt all of these things, but my mom had told me that my brother died of sids, so I didn't know What had happened to him, but when she told me

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Tina Marie: I drew a picture of the room. I drew the crib. I drew the door, I drew the dresser, and I said, I can't draw this, and my mom said, it's because you were sitting in front of that wall I drew the picture from the perspective. When I was a year and a half old.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Esther: Wow!

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Tina Marie: That's how That memory lasted. That's how much it imprinted

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Tina Marie: I knew where I was when it happened And I could still draw it. At 14

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Tina Marie: With nobody having ever told me anything about it. And I was only in that room

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Tina Marie: You know, for a matter of months in my entire life.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Esther: Mm-hmm Hmm.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: So. We think that children don't remember things and don't know things, but they do

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Tina Marie: And they might not be able to put words to it, but it has definitely impacted them and affected them.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Esther: Mhm. Uh-huh.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Tina Marie: So um One of the rules that I set in my house is, don't steal someone else's joy. If a

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Tina Marie: Person is singing, they are joyful. If they are dancing, they are joyful. If they're playing, they are joyful Unless you have a very good reason for it.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Tina Marie: Then you don't steal someone else's joy so like

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Tina Marie: My girls would be singing, and somebody else would tell them, Shut up! Don't you do that! Don't you ever do that. If they're being loud, you know, maybe you go somewhere else or something, but don't steal another person's joy

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Tina Marie: Because Like. If you interrupt me when I'm singing, I won't sing again for a while.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Tina Marie: For days, maybe

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Tina Marie: Um. And I don't sing that often anymore, because I haven't been that happy for a long time.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Tina Marie: So understanding what joy looks like in other people, and protecting it And prioritizing, that joy and that freedom and that childlike

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Tina Marie: You know, physical expression of joy.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tina Marie: And and so In the, in the vein of that

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Tina Marie: You don't want to just seek Joy. What makes you joyful? But you want to be aware of where joy exists around you and protect it and everyone around you by natural extension, you'll find more of your own joy

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Esther: Mhm. Mhm.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Tina Marie: Um And just just being an advocate for it. So like, if the girls are making a mess and they're eating dirt and whatever. And they're just having fun if it's not truly dangerous.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Tina Marie: Let them do it, get down there and do it with them. Be free. Allow yourself to be free One of the things you know I've learned because I just hated messes, and I hated looking messy, and I hated all of those things because I was trained that way right? But I realized I can shower

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Tina Marie: We can wash things. Things can be cleaned and

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Esther: Yeah, that's that's also You know, little tidbit as something I'm like

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Esther: Working so hard to unprogram, too. Yeah, last 3 years with Emmy. I'm just kind of like That's fine!

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Esther: We can wash it, and I was telling Fuji that you know

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Esther: All these things, that with Emmy and stuff I I have to. Physically.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Esther: Stop myself. From opening my mouth

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Esther: From trying to stop her, from some, from something that is really not harming anyone, and she's just expressing herself I literally have to stop and not say anything, and I told him

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Esther: You don't realize how much effort and energy it takes to just Unprogramm that like deprogram, that phone

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Tina Marie: That's the word

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Esther: Yourself.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Tina Marie: Because that is now reflexive. Now, can you stop a reflex if somebody hits your flexor on your knee? Can you hold your leg back. You can't. You're going to. Even if you try to. You're still going to flinch like your whole body is going to move. And people need to understand that programming becomes reflexive

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Mhm.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Tina Marie: So, for example, I have Ptsd, if I hear a loud noise right here I'm instantly outraged, ready to fight. I don't have fight or flight or freeze. I only have fights

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tina Marie: I'm Ready to go. I hear a loud noise. I'm up. I'm turned around, my arms are raised. I instantaneously doesn't matter what it is.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Tina Marie: The immediate thing that happens after that, because I'm never actually in danger. Nobody's ever actually hurting me anymore is then I feel like crying because I just felt rage, uncontrollable rage.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Tina Marie: And I didn't choose that it was instantaneous. My kids can see it on my face. They say you look like you're going to kill me, I said

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tina Marie: I'll be honest. I feel that way, not towards you, but towards whatever the thing was that was imagined. In an instant I said, now I can choose to correct that. But what you need to understand is that takes moments

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Tina Marie: It is not instantaneous to bring myself back and regulate myself So the things that I can do is let you know that I have these responses, that I'm aware of them, that I work on them. So the things that I do is I try to eat. Well, make sure I'm rested, you know. Not. Put myself in a heightened state where I'm more reactive

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Tina Marie: I do everything that I can. But outside of that, you know, you screaming in my ear, you're you're not 2 years old now. There's something that you can do about it. I'm not excusing my behavior, but

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: We have to understand that everybody's going through these different things, and that, regulating ourselves from reflexes

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tina Marie: Takes time. And so

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Tina Marie: I give myself accountability, but I also need space To.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Tina Marie: Reprogram myself because What I'm doing is from the inside out. The programming that happened to me was from the outside. In it was aggressive, it was constant, it was fierce, and my voice is quiet.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Tina Marie: It's alone. Nobody sees it happening. I'm doing it from inside. And you're not aware. All you can see is this reflexive? But you need to understand and trust me, that The work is happening, and I'm doing it.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Tina Marie: And It's just practice

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: It's just practice. You didn't become afraid instantaneously. Children don't get broken instantaneously

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Tina Marie: Even from this time.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Esther: They get worn down They get worn down. It's like, just

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Right.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Esther: Time and time again, like being graded on like that And you know that's a perfect example of what we were seeing with Emmy

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Esther: And my mom and I was just like, Look And Fuji and I just realized, and he said, This has got to stop

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Esther: You know, and I was still like trying to make it work trying so hard to make it, you know, partly as an aside, because, oh, my God, I you know I You know I feel bad for my mom, you know again my

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Esther: You know, feeling that I'm responsible for someone's emotions or their bad behavior. But You know. Um. But yes, I saw that. And then once we took my mom away. Yes.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Esther: My my Emmy misses her grandmother, you know, but I you know. But Fuji and I we have to decide, and we deciding, you know. All right.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Esther: We want her to have a relationship with her grandmother. But we got to be clear about what the boundaries are

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Esther: Like Fuji's, very clear about his boundaries, and I used to think, like I said, that he was just being an asshole And my therapist was like

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Esther: No, he like he knows where his boundaries are, and I'm like Oh, my God, you're right! He's not! He's not being a jerk

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Tina Marie: What's that word? What? I didn't remember that Mm-hmm

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Esther: He's telling me what his boundaries are. And he's trying to sh like

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Esther: He's trying to demonstrate what his boundaries are, so that I can I can think about like what my boundaries are too

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Esther: So. But anyway, I I agree it's 1 of those things where it just it grates on children. Children are very resilient We're um, so it takes a while to break them down. But unfortunately.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Esther: It happens if that kind of behavior just Continues.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Esther: To like go the way it does

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Tina Marie: You. You also have to be aware of that Stockholm syndrome

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Esther: Um

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Tina Marie: So the wanting. She knows that grandma's not okay, because grandma has a conflict, and there's issues, and she wants to take care of her.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Tina Marie: Children instantaneously. They are nurturing They want to take care of the person that that is harming other people, because they can see that that person's not happy. It's why, kids are, you know, just trauma bonded with their abusive parents, and they will defend them, and they will protect them, and they will lie for them

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tina Marie: So. The only way to protect the children is to not let them be in that situation because they cannot Understand what's right or wrong, they will be torn, and that torn

00:34:41.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Tina Marie: Is real, and it lasts a long time. So, but the great thing about them is that the more distance from those traumatic environments, the more space from it, the more that the healing can happen. But if you try to continue to heal, you know, go expose her, then pull her out because it doesn't work. Go expose her, then pull her out. Does it work It's still tearing her. Um, but she's not old enough

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Esther: It is. Yeah.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Tina Marie: To understand that and to go. Oh, Mom, setting an example for me of what to do and setting boundaries. She's too young to understand that she's born

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Esther: No, she is Well, this is why, you know we

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Esther: Kind of really limited. In the last number of months. How much my mom sees the kids

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Esther: Um, partly most partly because it's for me, too. I I need that space I need that space and

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Esther: You know that behavior last night on the phone with them was just another example of why We have this distance from them

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Esther: You know, and I told Fuji like what you listened to or heard tonight, I said. And, Michael, imagine Like? Why do you think it

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Esther: Takes me so much energy because I was like. This is what I grew up with like every other day.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Esther: It's just like stuff like this. And I said, You know, why do you think I'm so blue Is because

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Esther: You know. Um, I need to offer every single explanation in the world so that someone doesn't jump on me for doing a shitty job You know.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Esther: I told them, like, you know, the kind of thing I dealt with them on the phone tonight like Michael, you've never had to deal with this, and I'm really glad you never have had had to deal with it. But please understand, like

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Esther: How much energy it takes To for me to like, try and deprogram myself

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Esther: So that I don't want those things happen to my own kids.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Tina Marie: Let's just add it, David. Rain.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Have you? Did I? Have you read the book switch?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Tina Marie: I want you to read the book switch. Okay.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Esther: Oh, okay.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Tina Marie: It's by Chip and Dan Heath It's how to make change when change is hard.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Tina Marie: There's also a book that they wrote, and it's called made to stick. But um The thing.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Tina Marie: About. There's there's a couple of things that really stand out in switch, and one of them is Finite willpower.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Tina Marie: So. This is not something that people think about is that there is a limited amount of willpower, and that when used, it's used

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Esther: Yes. Absolutely.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Tina Marie: So you have to be very strategic about how you use it. But you can also Manage those resources by creating an environment that does not drain your willpower. So if if we have, you know, we wake up in the morning with a certain supply of willpower, and you have to start it by getting out of bed. So if getting out of bed is a struggle, it is not a struggle for everyone.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Tina Marie: Is not. Um. So if getting out of bed is a struggle, there comes willpower. That's you know. You've you've used up a portion of your willpower like. Imagine if you're playing games right and you've got the Life Force bar

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Esther: Mhm. Yeah.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Tina Marie: That just dipped

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Tina Marie: So then let's say that you also have to. You want to eat one particular thing, but you know that you shouldn't. So now you used a little bit more willpower 1st thing in the morning, right out of the gates Um, and and maybe because the good thing that you wanted maybe your partner eats this good thing, but you can't have it. And so it's right there in your face. So that's even more willpower right? Because it's in the house. It's in your face versus you didn't bring it into the house. In the 1st place, right

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Esther: Ball That's why people are like, oh, if you want to eat healthy, don't keep the snacks in your house

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Esther: You know, because you're gonna use up a little bit of willpower every single time you have to say no to it.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Yes, so I'm gonna go through the whole day, though real quick. Just imagine then. Now you've got a commute

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Esther: You know.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Tina Marie: And somebody cuts you off, eh?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Esther: Wow!

00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Tina Marie: Or willpower is gone. Let's say you go to work, and you've got to deal with this coworker. You know that that is just constantly belittling and complaining about ever, and you have to bite your tongue, and you're using a little bit more willpower. Well, what happens by the end of the day, and now your child has scribbled on the wall

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Tina Marie: Being a kid doing what kids do What's going to happen to that relationship and that conversation? What happens if your your significant other comes in and he's had a bad day. Now you have to listen to his stuff and use, you know, like it just drains and drains how much is left for the things and the people that matter most. When a person works outside of the home, or has to go through all these other things.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tina Marie: So there's all kinds of extenuating circumstances. So if you've had a bad day, that is a day that you cannot give anything to your parents because they're not your priority. Priorities have to exist The people, the relationships that matter most to you

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Tina Marie: Um, your joy has to be at the top of it, because, in order for you to give your best version to the people that you care about You're going to have to be in a place of joy if you're in a place of survival

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Tina Marie: You've got nothing to give to them, anyway. So You know that doesn't

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't bode well. So making sure that you get what you need physically, emotionally, making sure that you get sleep Knowing that sometimes that's going to be out of order. But if that's your overall pattern, then you're going to be okay with it. They're going to be okay with it.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Tina Marie: So just thinking about this. And the other thing is is that In the book switch

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Tina Marie: They give an example of in in ourselves. We have these 2 elements. One is an elephant, and one is a rider. Okay. The elephant is a big, huge beast. You're not going to control an elephant. An elephant will go where an elephant wants to go, and whatever the elephant wants

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Esther: No.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Tina Marie: Is what's going to motivate it. So the elephant is kind of like Um! Our

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Tina Marie: Our wants and our desires, our passions, and all of that stuff The rider is intelligence. It's the one that can do logical reasoning and make a choice based off of logic.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tina Marie: The rider's job is to direct the elephant. But the rider is this tiny little thing on top, and if the elephant wanted to ignore the rider. It's going to ignore the rider, so Um. Our big feelings and emotions can override logic. That's the point right

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Tina Marie: How do we get logic to be in alignment with all of our Passions and our wants and our physical needs, and all of these things

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Tina Marie: And So the book gives some examples of that. There's there's lots of different examples. So I think that you would light that book and find some kind of

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Tina Marie: Ahas in there that would be applicable. Um

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Esther: Okay.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Tina Marie: And useful. It's a book I read like

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Esther: This stuff looks very familiar. They handed that book out to us like 10 years ago, when I was

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Esther: Google And I never I never read it. It sat on my desk for a long time, and I wonder if it's

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Esther: Around here, somewhere

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Tina Marie: It. It is a great book. Um, it's I have probably a handful of maybe 15 to 20 books. I guess that's a little bit more than a handful

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Esther: Okay.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Tina Marie: That I go to. I've read tons and tons, but you know that's 1 of the things that stopped after I stopped reading for years. I was always an avid reader, and then I had kids, and I had 4 of them. So there wasn't a lot of time to read And I felt sorry for myself that I didn't have this anymore. And then I realized

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Tina Marie: Nobody's keeping me from it but me. And so I started reading again, and I felt I was growing again, and I was happy again.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Esther: And then

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Tina Marie: So reading for the sake of Um, not just the enjoyable ones

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Tina Marie: I cannot do that. I can't put books down. I get angry if I get interrupted, so I can't do the joyful ones. You know the good story ones. I just can't Um, but the the

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Esther: Ones that really suck you in and

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Tina Marie: And if they don't suck me in, I'm not reading it Because I've got too much to do in life. Like I I love life, I have. I am passionate about so many things like there's not enough time in the day. If I didn't need food asleep I'd be happy

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Esther: Take care! Yeah, I,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Esther: Well again. It's

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Tina Marie: Wasn't always like that

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Esther: Limited time and energy. Right? You don't. You only have so much to give? I'm not gonna go out and spend time with people. I that drain me, that are toxic or that take away my energy? Just no

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Tina Marie: Nope.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Esther: You know.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So just finding the things that um. So.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Tina Marie: Noticing what it is that is exhilarating to you. So you talked about the stuff that you and Fuji were going through. That was a struggle, but it was also a common purpose So it may be that you want the struggle right? Like I love lifting weights. I love hard things. I do love to struggle because I love to overcome, and I am always amazed at how strong I am

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Tina Marie: And how much stronger I can get. And I love that feeling so. I do love a struggle and a fight. I don't Look for fights. You know. I don't create fights

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Tina Marie: But but I I thrive off of opposition, and I know that about myself. But also purpose. It doesn't have to be opposition. It could be just a goal. I love progress

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Tina Marie: And I love progress with my people. By myself. It's really I'm not

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Tina Marie: You know I do have. I have my internal goals and internal competition, but I am much happier When I am working on something with

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Tina Marie: Someone else.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Tina Marie: Collaborating and and um having a common goal. So I didn't know that I didn't know that that was so important to me, because I'd been kind of this Lone Wolf for such a long time, because I didn't have my people But when I realized it, I'm like there is no comparison to how happy I feel when I'm working on something that I'm passionate about with somebody I'm passionate about, you know, in a like

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Tina Marie: Just Whether it's Platonic or not.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Tina Marie: Learning about. So we talked about like you gave all these examples. I love these. What I would love to see you do. Um this week. I know we're running out of time already. But um

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Tina Marie: I love the example, and I do want to make sure that we get to talk about it. And you talk about kind of the plan of the things that you want to do with Fuji. But One of the things I also would like you to do is pick out like of all those things. What could you do now like. Could you go to the park and show Emmy that you can still climb a tree? I bet you can still climb a tree. I could still climb a tree

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Tina Marie: Um You know. Just can you? Can you get back to some of that childhood stuff

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Tina Marie: What would happen if you did it? How would you feel like when's the last time you went and just put your toes in the water or um, or climbed a tree or threw a frisbee, or like played a game outside, played volleyball, do like play. When was the last time you played And get get some more of that in your life, and

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Tina Marie: If you could find the kind of micro joy you know where you could do a little something that doesn't have this big, long plan. It's not a big, long event But if every day you can make a little bit of magic

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Esther: Micro toy. Okay.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: That is. Yeah.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Esther: Okay, I'm writing that down. Micro joy. Okay.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Tina Marie: Sorry I gotta restart my tens machine. It automatically goes through a cycle and then it turns off Um

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Tina Marie: Then you can start doing it now without having to create this big plan. You could just look at your list and go. What's a couple of those things that you know we can do this week. What's something Um! Is there something I can do every day that is just

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Tina Marie: You know, this is the joy hour, like, what are we gonna do today? To just Have fun and be silly, and we can clean up the mess later.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. We can deal with the bruises and the scrapes later, and we can be okay with them. You know I used to skateboard. I taught my girls how to skateboard, and I was so scared doing it, but I'm like, if I fall I fall, but I'm going to teach my girls how to skateboard and

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Tina Marie: It was fun. It was fun watching them. I had to teach them how to play because they had so much trauma in their lives. They didn't play that much anymore.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Esther: Mm, Mhm.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Tina Marie: Anyway. But so let's talk about Um the the Fuji side, like whatever you want to do to

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Esther: Yeah, the last bit about that is, you know, it's kind of interesting. Um. Playing outside with them and stuff. And even if I'm not

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Esther: Particularly comfortable. I think my 1st phase right now. Um, you know, in the last couple of years, is literally just Even if I don't participate myself, is like not stopping

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Esther: Their participation. Just because Whatever it is like makes me uncomfortable, you know, so I think

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Esther: It's 1 of those things like, you know, we we have this Beautiful long driveway and

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Esther: Emmy's like, mommy, I want to run outside. I'm like, Okay. Let's go run outside like I was just kept inside the house so much

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Esther: That. That's just where I was comfortable, you know. And also I told Fuji, like my allergies, were so bad that every time I walked outside. It was just like, but he gets allergies, too. But that doesn't stop him from going outside. I'm like, Okay.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Esther: So, you know I I love the idea of micro joy. I'm going to keep working on You know, not stopping them, you know, if they want to go outside, and they want to get dirty, and they want to have fun

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Esther: I'm not going to stop them from doing that, even if I'm squeamish about getting dirty. At the very least, I can behave in a way Where they don't have any qualms about getting dirty.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Esther: You know. Yeah, so.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Esther: Um! I love that I will. I will work on the bits that you talked about for for microjoy. Yeah, I will Find at least one or 2 things every day that bring me a little bit of micro joy

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Tina Marie: Um some things you might find. Also jump, rope. Hopscotch

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Tina Marie: Drawing a little hopscotch, chalk drawings. Um just little things like

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Tina Marie: Go look up some ideas for activities, for three-year-olds or things like that And and see, okay, this week we're going to try this

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Tina Marie: And just Let yourself have the experience, and even if you don't like it, do it and see

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Tina Marie: Because In the same way that we deal with trauma and everything. It's exposure, therapy.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Tina Marie: You're not going to just suddenly be okay with being dirty and things like that But

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Tina Marie: If you want to not let Mess have power over you and control you. Then you're going. The only way to break that is to get messy

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Tina Marie: And so do it at your comfort level. But frequent exposure is the way to break it.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Tina Marie: Not everything that's fun is messy, but a lot of things that are messy are fun And if we can stop ourselves from

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Tina Marie: Stopping ourselves from having fun simply because it's messy, or I might look silly, or I might look too old for my age to go out there playing jump rope with my kids, and just let yourself have fun. You will break it You will not think yourself out of this

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Tina Marie: You will only Yourself out of this

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Esther: Yes. Thank you. That's really important. Like.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Esther: Bias to action, you know, and I think that's something that I need. You know, just Probably constant daily reminders of for myself is that

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Esther: I'm like you said. I'm not gonna think my way out of these things like Bias to action. You're not gonna find

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Esther: Some sort of passion because you thought about it so much. And you decided, oh, this is my passion. The only way you're gonna discover where that is is. If you actually just go out and do something

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Esther: Um and Yeah, okay.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Esther: I just And I think that's what Fuji was trying to get across from me. He was like, you know, you've had all these

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Esther: Different opportunities to come up and you tried it. You didn't like it, but You know. Um, I, you know. And I told him, yeah, I think I just really need some bias to action right now. Yeah.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Tina Marie: And also one time isn't enough Because the one time you're going to spend the whole time wrestling yourself

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: You're going to have to have multiple exposures to the same thing. To allow yourself to have some change in your reaction and your thoughts and your feelings about it. You didn't develop them out of an instant. You're not going to unbreak them or break them and deprogram in a single time.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Esther: Uh-huh. Yeah, okay.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Esther: Yes, thank you. Okay.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Esther: I I have a lot to chew on again this week.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Tina Marie: Good. That's the goal.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Esther: Okay.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay. So for the stuff with Fuji, one of the things that you had said, you just want to talk about some of the his weaknesses and areas that he can improve. I do not talk about other people while other people are not present

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Esther: Oh, sure! That's that's fine! Mhm

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah, so. And and I know that the intent is not malicious or bad, but the but it's a boundary that is set in order to protect

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tina Marie: And make sure that the conversation doesn't get too casual. Doesn't get too, uh, you know, like

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Tina Marie: Um So what we could do is we could have a conversation, and it be framed in a way where we're all just open. Say, you know. Hey, Fuji, do you want to talk about where Esther might be able to help you like? Where is the thing that you feel like you could use some support. So the language is slightly different. But it's the same thing like, where can we fortify you?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Tina Marie: Um and and and support you so

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Esther: Or it's 1 of those things where I literally one of these days next week, or whenever he has time We just invite him to sit in with this expressed

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Esther: Um Specific purpose, of

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Esther: Hey? Let's the 3 of us Talk together.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Esther: You know, Michael, where do you think I can most help you with? Where? What are the things that you don't wanna do

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Esther: Yeah. And he talked about some of it already, and I think, part of

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Tina Marie: He's making phone calls. He hates it.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Esther: He hates it. I hate making phone calls, too, but also know. I also know enough to know that he doesn't like managing the day to day. He doesn't necessarily like managing people

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: He hates it.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Esther: You know. Um. So I was like, Okay, well, the things that he doesn't like doing and that still need to get done. Maybe it's better that his energy is Put on the thing that really drives him

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Esther: You know, whatever whatever that is. Anyway. So he and I did talk about um, you know, having me take over like the idea of having me take over, you know. Yeah, the housekeeping pieces like I mentioned on here. I think that's a pretty low hanging fruit

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Tina Marie: And then

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Esther: You know? Yeah.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Tina Marie: So I'll give you. I'll give you a quick example that I feel totally fine, especially because you've you've been there during lots of our conversations, even though I couldn't see you. He told me. He's like Esther's always right here, so

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Esther: Um

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Esther: I'm not always like listening, because I'm like doing other things. But I I do hear bits and pieces. Yeah.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah, but it is that um, like he, and and almost everybody that I work with drag their feet when it comes to organizing financials and creating spreadsheets, and he, like we would talk about something. It would take 3 or 4 months before he actually created it. And we've not even been working together a full year yet right

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Tina Marie: So that kind of stuff. We would get momentum and would get there faster. But the thing about the data is when you see it organized in a proper way. You have this Aha moment, this epiphany, and you understand the relationship between this thing and that thing and this thing and that thing. And so when he looked at that and goes, oh, my gosh! I just realized that the reason my numbers are dropping is because I haven't been doing my outreach like it's It's all of that. So you know, we're only spending an hour a week together.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Tina Marie: And and then he wasn't doing much Afterwards

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Tina Marie: To get that done. So if if you know I'm

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Esther: He's spread very thin. So.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Tina Marie: And but he doesn't explain that because he's so easy going right? So um he so so there could be even just a liaising and and giving a different perspective. Well, Fuji, maybe you're downplaying that a little bit. Maybe this is harder than

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Esther: S

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Tina Marie: Tina knows that it is because you're not really representing what's actually happening

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Tina Marie: That type of thing. So you know, if we have one of those calls, maybe once a month, and just kind of pow. Wow! And then maybe I share the notes of our call like, however, you guys want to do it. We've got these 2 h together that you guys can use how you want to use, and you can prioritize how you want to do that

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Esther: Mhm. Okay.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Esther: Hi

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Tina Marie: Um. I don't think it would take a lot of time of all 3 of us being on the same page once we get there because you're so good at

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Tina Marie: Distilling um I think I can give pretty clear instructions, and I think you'd probably run with it so that he could spend more of his time um doing

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Tina Marie: Going in and doing sales like in person, like he did this week, and he still didn't tell me how it went Anyway. Um, that type of thing would be really great in in growing the business. Um, and just looking for the little ways that we can optimize it. So I I love that. I think that that

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Esther: Mhm.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Tina Marie: Is um a way to tap into your existing skills and to start kind of Bringing you 2 together on a common goal, and I think it will reveal other opportunities

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Esther: Okay.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Tina Marie: And also just kind of get you back in sync of, Hey, this is fun working together Maybe then you find a new project that's not related, or whatever. But but

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Tina Marie: I always find that I find the answers while I'm walking. Not while I'm thinking, while I'm doing, not while I'm planning

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Esther: Yeah, mhm Um, I yeah, I agree with that. And you know he's very

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Esther: You know the parts that he's very like yesterday. He's like, Okay, are we gonna do this July thing or not? I'm like Whoa, you know. Um, we only You know, we talked about like 2 or 3 days ago, and then I literally haven't thought about it that much, because, you know, we had a whole weekend. I'm like with the kids. I'm like

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Esther: You know, we were just talking the other day about how to deal with Emmy's whining right, and again I told him, all this stuff takes a lot of energy out of me. But anyway, so he's very like, Okay, when are we going to do it? Are you going to do it or not. I'm like Whoa! You know I needed you to like chill out. I was like, oh, let me sync with Tina 1st on you know what the best way to approach this is

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Esther: Um. But anyway.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Tina Marie: Go out!

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Esther: So um

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tina Marie: I think somebody's here because my dogs are going nuts. So just

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Esther: Oh, okay.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Tina Marie: Letting them.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Esther: Yeah.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Tina Marie: Figure it out

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Esther: So um I think what I'll do is I will just take a stab at this, whatever which way? Um

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Esther: You know. July. Um, it sounds, you know it. It'll probably be kind of a bigger thing To tackle um, and I have to think about where I'm going to devote my time

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Esther: Um, and how I have to set a timeline or whatever about how quickly it's gonna move, because he's gonna wanna know. Okay. When are you ready to

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Esther: You know, take over all the questions from my staff, so that I don't have to reply to them on signal anymore. And I think those are probably the like. The key milestones that he's looking for, you know. Cause that's kind of how he operates. He just needs to know. Okay, do I still have to do this, or do I not? My in or my out So um, I think I just have to come up with like

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Esther: A phased approach

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Tina Marie: I will give you advice on that

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Esther: Okay.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Tina Marie: Because I've experienced that. And he really wants to just Like. So I'll be explaining something sometimes. And he's like, basically he gives language and energy that wants to cut it off.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Tina Marie: And move on

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Esther: Yes.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Tina Marie: And um

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Esther: He's like I get it. Let's go

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Tina Marie: Right and Hold on one sec. I'm being interrupted. Come in.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Esther: Oh!

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Tina Marie: Or don't But don't. Yeah, anyway, like I can't think my daughter just got here. Um

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes, so I've had to call them out on that and say, Okay, I need you to let me finish this. You're very eager to move on, but I haven't said what I need to say, and I do need you to hear everything so that so that we're clear

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Esther: Hmm.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Tina Marie: Um. Also, like we'll be talking about something. And and so he just gets dismissive and wants to move on. And so I have to tell him like my brain doesn't work that way. So I need you to just be okay. And let me say this and and not cut off. But what he said was, he wasn't aware that he was doing it

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Esther: Yes. Mhm.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Tina Marie: And and I believe that. So you know, making sure that you both get what you need. So knowing that he wants to just cut it off and move on, and there's nothing wrong with that. That's just him. And you needed to have

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Esther: He's very red.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yes, yes, yes, um, and having and and you needing to have a runway and a plan. And and uh, you know a pace that works for you. Um

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Tina Marie: So you need to tell them, look, look, okay. So what what you want is a an exit point. That's clear. And you want to get there. Now.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Tina Marie: I can't do that. That doesn't work for me. But what I can do is say, um, let's have a conversation, you know, today, tomorrow whatever, and I can figure out what I would need to do. And then what I'm going to need you to do is give me what I need. So if I need to ask you questions, then you need to let me have it and and provide the answers to my satisfaction, so that I feel like I understand And then what I will do is tell you when I feel comfortable letting go. So what you need to do is stay present

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tina Marie: Keep doing the thing Yes, I'm going to take it. That's the plan, anyway.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tina Marie: And um, but it needs to be a a process. You can't just

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Tina Marie: Um. One of the things people like to do, especially Fuji, is abdicate, not delegate.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Esther: Yes.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Right, and that's very common, because when they don't want to do it, they just get gone. So and you just need to use that language, just remember, like you don't get to abdicate. This is

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Esther: Uh-huh.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Tina Marie: July is yours. Um, I'm I'm helping with this. But but in this process of me, helping with you You've got to give me everything I need to feel comfortable and do it right.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Tina Marie: Um, and and just Be clear about that

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tina Marie: In advance. So as soon as you have, you know the conversation. Just start saying, and And make clear that you know it's not wrong that you operate this way, but it's also not wrong that I operate this way.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: So. You know. Let's give each other what we need and create that. So he needs timelines

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Tina Marie: That he can focus on He needs steps that are outlined clearly.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Tina Marie: And that works for you as well. But you need to be the one to make that decision, and also say what has to happen in order for you to get those. Does that make sense

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Esther: Mhm, yes, it does. Yeah. And I I can envision. You know, instances where he was like, okay, meet with Paul. Meet with Mirka. And you know, you know. Just meet with him, and sit with them all day

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Tina Marie: And I'm looking

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Esther: And I'm like.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Tina Marie: No. That's not gonna happen

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Esther: That's not gonna happen, you know, or you know. Again he delic. He He abdicates, you know, and I and I get it. He's spread really thin

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Yeah.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Esther: So um You know, there are moments where I probably would have to handle him the way that I would envision myself handling someone like Ben, for example, right? It's like, Okay, you know, this is what I need. I don't know. And I keep telling him things, you know, in different situations, Michael. I don't know. I can't tell you exactly what I need right now, because I don't know what I need yet.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Tina Marie: I don't know what I don't know. That's 1 of my favorite things to say

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Esther: I need to get I don't. Yes, exactly. I tell him I don't know what I don't know, you know. Yeah.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Esther: So um! And I will just say, as you know, as a final thought, that You know. Does this work excite me?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Esther: Not entirely, you know, but I think it's a good compromise. Um between what I think we need together right now, as a couple running these entities or these business together.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Esther: And a good compromise between that And just the fact that I'm searching for something. So I you know, he he kept stressing me to me last night

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Esther: She told me Keep stressing to me, Esther, you don't need to do anything like you can literally just like

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Esther: Fuck off from all this, and you don't have to do anything. And I said, Yes, that's a very nice sentiment. You know, and I believe you when you say that. But

01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Esther: Like, you know, like the guilt in me is too great that I always feel like I have to be doing something. And I told them, maybe it's Not so it maybe it's less effective for me to continue to to like, fight, and fight and fight that inclination in me.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Esther: Rather than to just lean into it

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Tina Marie: But also, maybe it's not just guilt

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Esther: And you know

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Tina Marie: Maybe it's maybe it's just that you have drive It may be that

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Esther: It needs to go somewhere, and it needs to. I have driving. It needs to go somewhere

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Tina Marie: Yes, but you have energy. You have that little girl that wanted to climb trees and read All the magic stories.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Tina Marie: That That is a, you know, a heroine heart, right, a hero.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Tina Marie: Um, that is power. Power does not want to be stagnant. It is not just guilt that makes you feel like you have to do something and be productive. That's part of your spirit. That's part of your soul. You you responded to it because of guilt, because it was guilt that made you choose specific things.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Esther: Oh!

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Tina Marie: But the drive was innate and internal. It just wasn't allowed to go where it wants to go. So the drive exists because it's your spirit

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Esther: Okay. Oh!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Esther: Okay, I'm writing that down. I know you're gonna like AI

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Tina Marie: I'll give you the notes for sure.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Esther: Yeah. Oh, my God, I've never thought of it that way. Yeah, maybe it isn't guilt

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Esther: Yeah, if I if it You know, like

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Esther: If I really didn't have drive, yeah, I would probably be okay, just sitting here and not feel guilty, or whatever it is like about not doing anything

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Esther: Um I want to be doing something.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Esther: You know.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tina Marie: Yes. You want a tree to climb, you want you want a um uh

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Esther: Yeah.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Tina Marie: What is it not? It's not a journey, a quest. You want a quest

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Tina Marie: You need a quest.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Tina Marie: And so this isn't the quest that you maybe would dream of and create. But it is a quest that exists already that you can go. Help your companion with

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Esther: Mhm.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Tina Marie: So it is something Um. I do have another meeting coming up, and I do want to see my daughter real quick.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Tina Marie: But uh, I love this growth for you. Do think about those things. I'll send you notes, probably by the end of the day.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Esther: Okay. Thank you.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Esther: Okay, take your time.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Tina Marie: And Yeah.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Um. But but yeah, I'm excited for

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Tina Marie: Where you're going, and just keep Contemplating that a lot of the things that you think

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Tina Marie: Are actually a natural part of you that just got tainted. And so you've been resisting them because Of another person's voice and logic around that thing

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Tina Marie: Um Which is actually probably part of why you're so unhappy because you've been fighting them, thinking you're just fighting them. But you're also finding your own nature out of

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Tina Marie: Spites. And anger

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Tina Marie: Because of what they were doing to it. So these natural qualities you've been denying yourself

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Tina Marie: Because somebody else had corrupted it

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Esther: Oh!

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Tina Marie: And so what you have to do is remove them From this pure part of you.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Tina Marie: That is still good and true, and went in a similar direction, but only With with only you, and without their corrupted presence.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Esther: Oh, my God, that is really profound. Okay. Yeah, maybe there are, okay.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Esther: Yes, I will chew on that, because I know you have to go. But oh, okay, thank you so much for that. That makes You know. I think if I sit with that

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Esther: There's gonna be things that come out of that that make a lot of sense to me. Okay.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Esther: Thank you.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome. I look forward to talking to you soon

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Esther: Hey? You, too! Alright! Thanks, Tina! Alright! Have a good rest of your day.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Tina Marie: You too.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Esther: Probably feel better.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, thank you. Magic

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Esther: Oh!

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Tina Marie: I just dropped it this, and I've shocked myself so many times. But anyway. Natural healing. I love it.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Esther: Yep.
