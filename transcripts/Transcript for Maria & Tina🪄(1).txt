00:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey, hey, how are you good video on there we go. Hey, hat. Thank you. My video hat I'm going to record video this.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it.
00:00:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Obviously not in this background setting upstairs. love it. Yeah. So we had major snow last week like as in highways were closed down. And now we like warm weather like sweatshirt and jeans weather.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so weird. So it's like where I live. We call it bipolar.
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If you don't like the weather, just wait 15 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. And now it's all like muddy though, because everything was so wet. I'm not even letting it all go out in our backyard because I don't want money footprint. So I just take more W's.
00:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, my puppy. That just made me think about him.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm so excited.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Um, they told me sometime between the 18th and the 22nd.
00:01:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So. Oh, okay. So, but still before Christmas.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:01:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's good. That's really good.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did. Yeah. Need to have me.
00:01:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so divine nudge. Yeah. Yeah. Like, that's funny. Cause I guess that's not, that's why we're talking. But like, it's so weird that you also were thinking we got to start thinking about what videos to do together and stuff.
00:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I wasn't thinking about work at all. was just, um, looking at my desk and looking at the elements of it and thinking about my daughter moving out and, um, cause we're going to be reorganizing the house cause we'll have, it's a fourth item house, but there'll only be two of us living here. So we're like, okay, how do we use this space? Yeah. at my microphone stuff and thinking, well, I should give it to the girls. Cause I don't want to do that. then I was like, Well, we need to be making videos and I am everything I think I see, so in my mind I saw, you know, us sitting down and thinking about we've got to make the storytelling kind of video. So I was watching this girl on Instagram and she was talking about how people can make viral videos on accident and that it's a random reward system that is like at the casinos and the lottery so it has nothing to do with the fact that you actually made a really good video. It went viral because the algorithm made it go viral and it did that so that creators will keep creating and so that scrollers will keep scrolling. So it's meant to feed the system the house always wins kind of thing, right? Okay, interesting and She said so you need to stop trying to create viral videos and you need to create what you already know Because it's what you teach also, but it was a different hook and angle Things that attract your right audience and your your particular buyer and I was watching I was noticing my own engagement with her Because I realized you know number one she was giving a fact that My brain understood and could validate immediately even though I don't have proof I know that there's a system that works in the casinos that keeps people coming and it's just this random You win, right? That's why gamblers keep going back because they keep thinking they're gonna win But it's really random almost everything is just random chance. Yeah, now there are some statistics to it But the statistics are engineered and they're engineered for the house's ultimate profit not your profit You Yeah, so anyway, but but I was looking at her and it was just kind of a simple background Like it was just a regular office setting. She was she was pretty but there was she was just teaching talking and she Said so we'll we'll teach you a systematic approach. It was data driven systematic approach and Now almost every other type of Hyped kind of marketing video. I don't watch I don't engage with I feel like it's engineered For outcome and for Brainwashing right just selling rather than informing and giving me real useful knowledge And so I thought like if I'm the kind of person that engages with her and I know I want people who aren't Like how do I get rich fast right not a super high-level intelligence necessarily? they could be, but when you're 60 years old and you still think there's a way to get rich fast, you're probably not the smartest.
00:05:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:05:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, right? So again, and we don't need millions. That's the whole kind of 1,000 true fans or 1,000 true fans, I think it is, and something like that.
00:05:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, is that, you know, to have a really successful, happy, satisfying, fulfilling, profitable business, you don't need everybody, you need a lot of the right people. So anyway, you know how things can just instantaneously happen in your mind?
00:05:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That all happens in my mind instantaneously. It took me like five minutes to explain.
00:05:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, and at the same time was having that thought, I was just thinking about our pace, you know, you've got stuff that's coming up, and I've got stuff coming up at, but there are measurable, um, there's measurable progress. And I was thinking about how it always works that way. doesn't matter what client it's been with. It's, and there are those who don't, who always try to push past it. I used to be a person that tried to push past it because I'm powerful and I can push through obstacles. And I learned that the best things don't come from that. The best things come from me showing up consistently doing the work, but recognizing when the resistance is not me, but it's somewhere else, something out of my control.
00:06:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If it's out of my control, it's not me.
00:06:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So as long as I'm honest about what's in my control and what's not in my control, then I can be aware of it. So anyway, all of that was kind of simultaneous and it was just like, you know what, these next few weeks are probably with winter and holidays and everything else. Probably going to be pretty slow, but as always, if we're strategic about the time we do spend. If the time. that we do spend, first of all, if every week we're consistently putting something into it, sometimes even thinking is strategic and intentional, right? So you were thinking like, I've noticed something but I'm not positive that it is exactly this, right, in terms of having to make a video every day. And so what I don't know that I understood the full promise of what it is that you're trying to test, but wanting to have, well, because I would like just woke up, I'm thinking about a lot of things. anyway, wanting to test and validate a concept that you're teaching to me is strategic and important. So it could be like, I noticed this, but I've also found this. And so because what I find is there's not, except for the eternal and divine truths, everything out is relative.
00:07:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this may be true, relative to these things. This may also be simultaneously true, but relative to these things. So Christmas, Kelly, I got mine done yesterday. That's funny.
00:08:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
love it.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, because most of those types of truths, especially when it comes to success and operational things, are relative, I love being able to teach the multiple truths so that somebody else can kind of triangulate their path, which is relative to them.
00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense?
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, yeah. Yeah, no.
00:08:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And, you know, it's interesting. Also, I think because I'm feeling brain energy too.
00:08:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like now I'm into the second week.
00:09:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
the hormone therapy. I started like a week ago Saturday. I also just have more gumption that you know what I want to do a video every day. Like and you know next week it might be maybe I want to get active again in my prosperous female entrepreneurs. Oh my god Santa cookies. Oh my god, so cute. Hello.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aww. She likes hugs.
00:09:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Aww. You need to have her YouTube videos. That'll get a lot of news.
00:09:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. And my other dog, Coda, he's got a sweater on that says naughty.
00:09:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. I tried.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, boxes. But the marker is Velcro. And so you can move it to whichever one, know, maybe today he's naughty.
00:09:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Maybe tonight. my god. Oh, I'm sleeping away. You know what I'm saying is that like I'm going with the flow what I feel like doing. Like I feel more in flow. And that's what you know like and who knows maybe next week I'll just want to do a. You videos just to the old guard of people that have been in my Facebook group forever that I haven't really You know, I've been ignored basically, you know for the longest time, but you know, maybe maybe you know, yeah I'm just doing what I Once I am I can you please get the dog?
00:10:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emma Can you get the dog please? Um, the one that said it would say though is is kimmy Sorry, I knocked over my It's like It's one of my favorite scriptures. I don't know if you can kind of get the angle It says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares It's heapers 13 too. Oh, I love that. Anyway, um I do want to make sure that we we do focus on the foundational course and for the most part any adjustments you want to make. I think that they should just be that adjustments, enhancements, additional things. I think we need to focus on getting the foundational program there and sold because doing what you want and exploring is important. But if we're going to be doing it together, then we really need to get the foundation where there's something to be worked on and then remember the foundation buys your freedom to just explore whatever.
00:11:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
True. Got it.
00:11:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Because otherwise then it's just there. It isn't divine pacing. It's just distraction a little bit.
00:11:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah.
00:11:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The foundation just I just want to say just like let's focus on the foundation. And so considering like your week, what could you do that foundation was like, right? So we wrap up what we have and also get to explore what you're doing. So you don't have to spend a ton of time doing it.
00:12:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, if you say, okay, on day this week, I'm going to work on just trying to wrap up the existing course as is. And then I'm also going to go explore this area. I feel like, great, because we made that for us. And we can get that aligned. then we will have new information and new things to teach people. That's what I think is really great about this topic and this model is that because it's YouTube and because it's marketing, you're going to get to have lots of things to chase and explore that, you know, keep you excited. Well, because you if you're, if you can get bored, we don't want that that would be done to the soul.
00:12:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I agree. Like, because like this morning, I probably spent about an hour because of my researching a video, because that's just like now my mover supper. And they sometimes get into using vidIQ for that. you go see other people's videos and then I was like, wow, This person's got a fairly young channel as well, and she's taken people, and I thought it was going to be $27, like she'll teach you a YouTube video editing course, because you know how I was saying, like, you don't need to over edit things anymore, because that yeah, anyway, so she was talking about that that was one of her viral video titles, how YouTube video editing has changed, but when I clicked on her link for sales page, and it's the shittiest sales page, you know, it's like, $197, I was like shocked, and I was like, but interested, because I wonder how many sales she's making, so I thought, well good on her, you know, but still, it looks like the simplest, the YouTube video editing, that would be like, like, 100 of what's in, like, the VA outsource to a VA OTO course of ours, right? So I was like, oh my God, like she's just showing you how I looked at her module, showing you how to edit and cap cut.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or your sound of the video, and I'm just like, oh my God, you know, is one of the things I was trying to talk to you about pricing. So, yeah, first of all, you can turn whatever you want to and people will buy it as long as they see the value in the worth in it. What you're able to teach and what I'm able to teach is almost, you're nerdy enough to probably understand a Tesseract.
00:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I wrinkle in time.
00:14:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you get from point A to point B like that. That's what optimization does. That's what leverage does. That's what data-driven processes does for people. You can skip ahead of years, experience by learning how to analyze data, where to get it, how to analyze it, and then how to get your own information, right, and then analyze it and use that too. forward because most people are just kind of they're getting lucky or guessing or whatever. So if we're attracting really intelligent people who let's say they're changing careers, they could be internet marketers changing careers, right? They could be internet marketers that have been around doing the same thing forever and they're like I want to get into YouTube. They could be people that were you know business managers, online business managers, making other people millions of dollars and like I want my own thing. So they understand leverage and they understand optimization. They just need somebody who can teach it to them but because most of the people are teaching hacks and types and things that are not timeless. You're teaching timeless principles, that's what I teach, right? Data always works, studying what works, always works. coming up with a system that is created by the data of the things that works always works yeah yeah okay but almost nobody is teaching that now there are some people who are teaching it right but um maybe they'll identify more with us because of our ages oh yeah and where we're at in life but but at this point though they also understand the value and so like my girls when they do stuff when they do chores they get paid roughly like 30 to 50 dollars an hour it isn't about hourly but when they went into the chore and I paid them for it they'll I'm like do you realize how much you just made on an hourly basis if you were to calculate that hourly and they used to not but now they do I said here's what you need to understand I don't pay you based off of what the average person earned I pay you based off of the value of it to me so if I offer you a hundred dollars to do something you're not going to complain. and you're not going to wait you're going to get it done and you're going to get it done right and quickly and i don't have to wrestle with you so i bought the result that i wanted exactly i got the cleaning done that i wanted to do the organization i did i don't have bad energy between me and you and i gave you money without giving you money you earned it so you you had to participate in i didn't just hand you an enable you thing and now you're responsible for managing your money i don't buy them the things that they want for the most part they buy their own stuff and so they can work for people who will want to tell them what the average person earns and what they think is a competitive wage or they can work for somebody who understands the value of what they're bringing by showing up consistently doing a good job and just taking stuff off their plates and that could be several multiples over the average wage so what we're charging if we can first of all attract the right people who understand what do and the value of what we're teaching and people who can afford what right everybody can afford $27 even if they're on food stamps that's just the way the world is right now they'll find a way to do it not everybody can afford $200 but anybody who has any experience making money and knowing the value of autonomy and running their own business is going to find a way to pay $200 and if they really need it to work they're going to show up and do the work so I think that we should use pricing to filter out the wrong people as well as attract and the right people and so that's why I'm not and generally not a huge fan of low ticket funnels unless the entire purpose of that is simply giving back and not and knowing that we might escalate maybe 0.5 or 1% of those people into something else but we are not managing them we're not putting hardly any energy G into the low ticket version. No, it's automated. Um, the customer support can be incredibly cheap and we can do large volumes. But otherwise I want to repel it. The reason I don't want to repel it is because I do want to give back. I do want to even if it can, even if it takes them five or 10 years to grow from where they enter to, you know, any kind of higher level, then I feel like I've taken the gifts and talents that God has given me. And I've shared it with the world and I'm still okay with charging money for that or even giving it away for free.
00:19:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It really doesn't matter.
00:19:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then, but the business model, because everything I do is optimized and leverage social, my pricing structure, social, my offer, because one of the foundational things I want everybody to learn is to do exactly that for themselves. So I want to model it from them from the beginning. So I can say, Hey, you came here and you drop this amount of money. Why did you do that? Is it because you want to? how you and that you were willing to pay that. I want you to know that other people will see that in you as well. So feel okay that doing it don't feel like you've got to go compete with the 497 girl and the $20 you know person. Go ahead and charge what you need to. So it's a big it's a big thing anyway. So that pricing and ugly still converts as long as you can get the point across that there's value and somebody can understand it. What it looks like doesn't really matter.
00:20:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Agreed. Yeah no totally. know um yeah like there's still like like I mentioned to you earlier there's some old school funnels that still convert you know. Yeah yeah yeah I agree I agree. So what do you want to do now? you want um you just go and get some done work done or do you want to.
00:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well how about we come up with a couple ideas about some videos that we should make and get some target dates for how we make them and what we do to put together.
00:20:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So Okay.
00:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A YouTube channel that it could be the GenX CEOs, is that what we were talking about, something like that?
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So it's really generic. Like I said, right? And I like that. The only thing that it's really specific about is the generation and the business CEO represents business. So we can make topic, and also here's the thing, like when you have a women's only thing, men want to come in. When you have an age specific thing, other ages want to come in. They're like, yeah, I can't be out. So I don't really think it actually repels. I think that it is even more attractive to the rebellious types who want to go, I want it. And what are you guys doing?
00:21:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So what if, and let me get, let me just open up the YouTube research planning. So, why don't we first come up with a couple of ideas and then go do the research specific to validate the ideas rather than go get the ideas from other people because we should be divinely led and I think we are. And then we can go find the data that corrals the vision that we have. I think the first thing that we do is just introduce ourselves, who we are, where we've been, how we found each other, what our mission is. What do you think? I feel like that will create a lot of little clips that we could use if people are asking who are you, what's your background, whatever, all of that will come out of that one thing.
00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That will be our authority maybe. Yeah. that can also be, because I don't even have it on my channel, but lot of times when you land on a channel, there's that first introductory video about the channel video.
00:22:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what that would be.
00:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah, agree.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So from that though. If we create multiple clips, then we can get our own data about how people are engaging with us, and what type of content that we created in that video are people engaging with us. So it can be something that we create that's, you know, it's an hour or 90 minutes long, Nobody's going to probably watch the whole thing. But the clips that we get out of it, we can use on web pages, we can use members area, we can use on YouTube for sorts or five minute videos and just break it all up to serve different purposes because we're going to cover so much. It just happens like that. There will be stories inside of stories if we start talking about our story. That's that's what I think that we should do start. So maybe just a bullet some bullet point list for you and for me of, you know, what our origin stories were, how we met kind of the progress of our conversation so far. are and what we're looking forward to creating, why we're creating that, who we're looking to serve and what we think we bring to the table. What you think?
00:24:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. Yep.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think just that and then go doing some editing, I think that'll keep us busy for about a month. Honestly, if we first plan it, then we actually have to do it because there's holidays coming. So there's a lot of stuff that Mike has from having that we might do it once and want to redo it. I hope it should be organic enough that we wouldn't need to. And then work on, so normally I think not editing would be great, but I think if we're creating this one giant piece and its purpose is to be chopped up and to use in multiple places and then to get some feedback, I think it's worth a little bit of time really paying attention to what the clips are and maybe any kind of supporting material that might come from it. Maybe there'll be some Facebook posts. Maybe there'll be some blog posts, things like that. But I think we don't have to plan anything else. I think that that will be an a former piece to us.
00:25:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you think? Yeah. You don't want to talk about other videos that we would want to do.
00:25:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying I don't want to talk about anything.
00:25:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
saying that's an idea I have. Yeah. No, I love that idea of that and former piece. I don't think it'll be something that a ton of people will watch because of the way the YouTube algorithm is. Maybe I'm wrong. So that's why I was thinking there could be some cool. Further on videos to have that we plan out. And I don't know if we want to talk about the topic of. Okay. I don't know if we want to go beginner or just straight up more than like talk more about like, like who are we talking to?
00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess that's my question. I think we should go with intermediate because I think beginners will, like I said, want to go where they want to go. So some beginners will automatically be drawn to us and go, you know what, I want to just figure out how to get there.
00:26:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we should start where we really want to work.
00:26:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. yeah, like, because my make money online for a school community and the way my channel is right now is attracting the people that I need money. Like, if I would read out to you a couple of the messages that have come in school lately, it's like, how can I make money fast? You know, I've got to, I'm retired and we had a money downfall. We need to make 10,000 fasts, you know, and there's like, I don't like that energy. And it ain't going to be a digital office. My answer back to them, and that's why I was just coaching Sally on to answer these people with is like, they need to get a feel and do freelancing like my first job was building 5,000. Yeah. So, um, you know, and maybe, you know, down the road. So anyway, what I'm saying is I want this video right there. Yeah, exactly.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was part of my origin.
00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That was part of your origin. Yeah. So this video, I don't want to attract the, you know, the people that are like back to the wall need money like right now.
00:27:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I actually think it repels them because we're like, you're looking for a quick solution. And we're telling you it's elbow grease.
00:27:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. down.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. if you're coming to us after that, it's because you know, we're going to teach you how to use your elbow grease, but nothing.
00:27:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, so what's cool too, is that it would be cool to like, I, it'd be kind of cool to talk to a few videos of actual, as if the person's across to the room. this is what we want to say to them like, Wouldn't be cool to have a video of okay. So you're you're a teacher and you think you're retiring soon But you're wondering you want to become a coach How do you even start that you know so you're attracting someone's already making six figures right or or you're like so the person's already making a six Figure Sally that's thinking to leave you become a coach that would be cool And then there's also people that want to have a digital offer And then there's people who already have a successful whatever agency Digital offer little ticket offer mid-ticket offer forces, whatever, but they are frickin frazzled You know and because they don't have an SOP. They don't have KPIs.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't know how to delegate, you know just Or they're a person who is a service provider of some sort they could be a Media buyer they could be a business manager ops manager project manager a copyright or anything But they've used their time and talent to make other people money and it's never grown the way that they know that they could and they want to finally create something for themselves teaching their expertise and so but they're alone and that loneliness especially if you add in ADHD and executive dysfunction that happens with a lot of R types keeps them from being able to create the stuff from themselves so they kind of need some accountability they need somebody who's going to keep them focused and keep them motivated because that's the issue that you have with executive dysfunction is you need that mindset you need the energy you need the society as well as the tactics they probably already know the tactics but because they're missing the other things they're just not doing anything they're just staring at the screen wishing they could get themselves to do the things they know they're supposed to do yeah or there's a type of people that because i'm guilty of this we'll just invest in another coach or mastermind to try and get something like one of my friends kara i was shocked that she just spent five thousand
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's to be coached privately by Evelyn Weiss and her mastermind. I'm like, Kara, why would you do that? You already know everything.
00:30:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, she goes, yeah, do that.
00:30:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she goes, yeah. When I had my first call with Evelyn, I said, I'm kind of intimidated by you. Like, yeah, I think I can learn from you about Facebook apps, you know? So she just, I think just needs permission to play, permission to shine, whatever.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that would, yeah, that would be a whole not to be lonely. I bought your offer. I can do all the things that you do. I bought her offer for you.
00:30:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's it.
00:30:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wanted to talk to Maria and have Maria help me do it.
00:30:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That was it.
00:30:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my point is that there is a huge array of people that that applies to. So it's not small. And we think they won't spend that money. They will. Oh, so we can really target people who got money and will spend money. who needs something that very few people have to offer. And try to think of a duo like you and me, like there's maybe a handful, but none of them that are don't have giant, giant followings that can give the personal attention that we can give right now.
00:31:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, we are incredibly rare.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a huge blue ocean right now.
00:31:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah, and then, you know, down the road, just I think new topics ideas will come up based on also, because this is happening to my other channel, what questions people ask, right? the video I'm going to go create now is because someone asked, well, how do I know? How could I reduce the risk of a YouTube video? do flopping, know, so I'm going create a Q, Q, K-E-W-L video on that. But, you know, I'm sorry. There's, we could also, I was going to ask you about this because you mentioned before how you're an AI geek and stuff. So I think it'd be kind of cool to, like not, I don't want us to be like Matt Wolf's channel by any means, but I think it'd be pretty cool to talk about what you can use AI for. Like I'm checking out swell.aii.com only because I follow his YouTube channel, I love that guy. Like the guy's really good. He's really, like, he's just refreshing to watch because he's the real . But that's his software, but it'll, you can take a YouTube video, put it in there and it'll create like all these tweets for you and it'll create all these LinkedIn posts for you and because you connected LinkedIn and Twitter, it'll schedule all out for you too. And I thought that's freaking awesome.
00:32:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we could do it once a month or twice a month where we do a video and it's just right it could just be a picture while like look over my shoulder while I'm doing this and or you know we could be there and it's our little things and we're we're talking about it walking through because I would love to have it be real-time feedback you going oh that's cool I wonder if because the commentary helps right and then you ask a question or maybe you feed me a prompt and I put in your prompt and it just be um something and then we can be watching comments like maybe it's a YouTube live and people are saying hey I want to do this like what would you do and then we would come up with a strategy maybe we would go to one of our solutions that we know and maybe it's a subscription we pay for and say oh I use this tool and blah blah blah like live well it reminds me of do you remember when Russell Brunson first came out with his funnel Friday on YouTube okay so when he and the copywriter this is years ago before ClickFunnels was so big he started doing these funnel Fridays on YouTube and I tuned in because they
00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Build a funnel from scratch and either it would be a client of theirs, or they would even like maybe someone who's on the YouTube live or whatever, okay, say what nation you're in. We'll build your funnel for you. thought that was really cool. So we could have A.I. Friday's or A.I. and Tuesday with that. Ooh, that could be actually Friday's.
00:35:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
S.R. A.I. D.A. Y. Ooh, like a little S.R. Capital A.I. and then D.A. Y.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God, I love it. F.R. A.I..A. Y.S. I just put down my notes here for Friday's. But it would be fun, like whether B.H. we're going to client right now or what like because you probably have so much stuff you haven't told me about like that you could do like, you know, sorry, my daughter's here, what?
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, um, I don't know whether or for that, and I'm going to go through my course there. Okay. Love you. Just. Okay. Thank you. Bye. He's updating me on her day and taking my other child of the school. Okay. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt you, but I could not process both and I wanted to hear you and hear her.
00:36:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. No worries. So, yeah. No, I think that, like, was going to say is that we don't maybe even know what we're going to talk about when we start that live because you might show me stuff that I'm not even aware of with AI to do. Like you might say, Hey, what about the metrics of your funnel or your Facebook ads or your visitors is now, you know, pump this into AI. you, anyways, I'm just saying there's probably stuff that have no clue.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think we'll both learn. I think I will for sure learn as we go, but the thing is as I am learning Other people are learning at the same time and my if my mind is blown their mind is blown, right? then there's it leads to the next thing. So that's it's a self-feeding machine And it will be engaging just because our energy would be like, you can't believe that So it will be energizing as well as will be, you know, people can ask questions and you can't just ask any smart person a question. So There's there's lots of smart people.
00:37:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can't access all of them. Right?
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so Sorry, I just have to show it to you so don't you? Aww, you know He's third boy.
00:37:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He was six hours at doggy daycare today. So he's like, I'm done. tired
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
will be and it would be a way that I'd be comfortable. I wouldn't be thinking about what I look like whatever even even if I do because I'd be focused on what's happening so it'll kind of help me get out of my zone but it also could be a way that we start figuring out how do we make faceless YouTube so that we can teach people how to make faceless because so many want to do it and we can say hey you know we did this video you know we were on there but they were just pictures or we were on there and they were AI avatars or it was a zoom avatar it was a panda face like there's a guy like let's play around with it and show people how to explore how to test and really teach them that really is what's most important is the content and the energy of it and above all else yeah I love that and then also to help address
00:39:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Market changes because like you tell me if you want me to give me the link to his YouTube channel and he has a podcast now But this guy I've been listening to for me. It's not a distraction because keep me up to trends.
00:39:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So well marketing is your thing.
00:39:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah Yeah, so if you want me to give you the link to his stuff great, not no worries, but at one time he recently interviewed He was just he was just saying yeah like honestly like all the people who own blogs have made a lot of money through seo Back in day Their whole world's gonna change soon because they I now and there's even a thing called humanize me You know service that you can create all your content like 10 000 blog posts You know and then use humanize me or whatever higher va from the philippines to add more humanized words to it So it's not and google's liking those things. Um, he said, you know, you literally Can wipe out so many niches and all that stuff when i'm just like whoa Also, I just learned because my attorney client went to an AI
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
conference and it was not recorded, they were not allowed to record of it, there was a lot of like speakers, so it was new unveiled stuff. But one of the things, and I know this has been released because I've heard other people say it, is that Chad GPT uses Bing. So being search engine optimized for Bing is probably going to be important moving forward, which means that Bill Gates and anything related to him is probably going to be a little bit more important than we have felt like it has been when it comes to building businesses online.
00:40:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is Bing owned by Microsoft? Okay, that's it. That is a big sense. Microsoft has their Gemini like they want to get on the AI space really big time, but I've not really, you know, come across them as much. Interesting, okay.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want to type that? Yeah, it's owned by Microsoft.
00:40:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, I don't know much about Bing, that's all. No, I just wanted to confirm because you asked it Do you want me to give you the link to that guy's podcast on YouTube? Yeah, his name is Cody Schneider. Like I just love the guy. love watching him. He's like just full of all these ideas for businesses. it just fills my cup sometimes to watch his stuff. But without. Swell AI is one of his things. Yeah.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looks like Bradley will.
00:41:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That they will.
00:41:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. He and I am from like way back.
00:41:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, OK.
00:41:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way, way, back.
00:41:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So he's like, yeah, I were to share screen here, I mean, he's obviously appealing to the Silicon Valley, dudes, right? Because like he was 10 years of building online companies, employees, six at Rupa Health. We went from 20 million to 110 million valuations six months. Currently building Swell AI and draft horse draft hosts. another SEO blogging thing. And I talked about them on Twitter LinkedIn. So what he's doing, like if you look at his Twitter, like it's he's basically doing a lot of videos, but then sells while AI, which is pretty smart, but he's grown his Twitter channel or X channel quite a bit. And if we come back here, I'll give you the link to his YouTube. These are the videos I like to watch is on YouTube. And yeah, like latest, this the one that I was watching last night. This guy makes 200,000 a month entirely from SEO. Well, you highlight a few of his other ones so I can see the background, but it looks like it's just basic, basic, basic, like. Oh, yeah, there's no way to get on his stuff running.
00:42:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's just talking.
00:42:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But but but just like us, we open our mouths. know our ship, he knows his . And he has a lot of good business ideas too. So besides interviewing people he gives business ideas, but But like this this interview here this guy sold a million on TikTok shopping under such a days They were using a lot of Hagen and 11 labs and avatars on which by the way, I've used a lot I used to clone like Dan will be like, can you clone this voice? Can you clone this voice and I would do it and I send it back to the team. like holy crap I can't tell yeah, yeah Yeah, when zoom I just gave you the link to stuff So yeah, like it's crazy. then they just started he's just starting something else I forget what it's called But where they'll do like 10 TikTok channels for you in the US and all this anyways. Yeah, it's just He's got perpetual brain on Combining trends right now. This is why you'll like them because it's all data driven decisions You'll see what's trending on Google trends and all that stuff and then you'll take those keywords and you'll do something with it Or he'll just create a YouTube video saying, I don't have Tom to do these business ideas, but here's three business ideas that can make you probably 600 K and 12 months.
00:44:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome.
00:44:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyway, so there's that. Um, yeah.
00:44:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, in terms of like when we want to make that video, the first one, the just the origin one that gets us started and can, can be the home for, um, the channel, when should we plan on doing that before Christmas, don't you think? I literally haven't even thought about it. So let me open my calendar. Um, and if you're feeling that, then I want to.
00:44:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just think it might be a nice way to enter the new year or maybe between Christmas and the years, like, just kind of might be a cool way to enter the new year with this, you know, fun.
00:44:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um. I feel like you like to do things in the morning.
00:45:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I'm getting better energy now.
00:45:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Once I come in, did I have them? Yeah, yeah. That's helpful, huh? I'm just looking and thinking about next week is kind of potentially chaotic. Well, if we did morning, it would probably be better. I'd have to get up and get myself going and I can, but I think morning would give me the best time to be able to do it because my daughter's either asleep or gone, but generally asleep.
00:45:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, well, how about between Christmas and ears?
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your? I would not want to do it between Christmas and ears.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay. Sorry. Um, you're are you taking all of that week off and everything?
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. The only is that I don't want to make plans for something would drain me.
00:46:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This would drain me. Ah, so I don't want to, but what I was trying to get at was maybe next week on in the morning. Yeah.
00:46:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Tuesday would probably be a Tuesday or Thursday. Uh, which probably be the huh?
00:46:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's your Thursday.
00:46:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, wait, is that the 19th? Yeah.
00:46:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because I'm that day I'm taking off and going to London.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually have a lot of things happening that day now that I think about it. So, and it's not all of my calendar. So I, how about Tuesday?
00:46:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you want to shoot for like, um, is, is 10 a.m. time? Wait.
00:47:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's one o'clock?
00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, for you. Is that too late for you?
00:47:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, what it costs good.
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, and if I sometimes I just wake up early and I can't sleep if I get up early and we're like prepared. We've got all our bullets and everything and we're ready to have that conversation. I can let you know if I want to go early. If you're ready and if not, just keep that time.
00:47:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sounds good.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I think what we should do is maybe by Saturday have our bullets for each other. Yes, this is these are the things I have. So, how we got started in our business, like how we gained our skills, who we are kind of background. Which should include some of the things that we've accomplished. How we found each other. And what we had.
00:48:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, what we're working on and just just what we're what we're building together. Yeah, okay.
00:48:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that it's still new and exploring, but like these are the foundations of where we come from. So this is what we know will will always be interested in right for me technology systems operations and happiness like giving people a happy life and feeling free. These are, I can't think of the word that I want. Anyway, but the pillars kind of of everything that I do. And that one of the things between us is that I don't love marketing like I like tweaking it. I like looking at it while like spending a ton of time on it. I'd rather be building and kind of optimizing and so. Like that.
00:48:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, anyway. Love it. All right, so there's that and then. Do you want to use I can look into it riverside for us recording cuz I've heard good things for when you're doing two person Kind of videos rather than just zoom like this.
00:49:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They I Do we can try it cuz I've heard from people that used it religiously that it can be glitchy Anything can be glitchy. I think some that any standard platform has its pros and cons So I do think learning new tech Generally comes with a learning curve. So then we should do a practice kind of a couple minute run or something Or do you want to just do zoom then? Mean let's talk about what we wanted to look like I was just gonna do like side by side. I think zoom works fine Are we doing it live?
00:49:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I don't think live because if it's gonna be a video that lives and breathes as that main video when they come to your channel. think it probably makes sense to not have it live so that we can caption it or something maybe to and stuff.
00:50:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if we were going to do Riverside, I'd want to know why what that has that Zoom doesn't. That would be worth learning a new technology for.
00:50:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, from what I understand, because I've just used it once or twice and that was a while ago, but when I see some duo to people interviews or podcast episodes on YouTube, I do see that with Riverside. It'll show the two people in boxes that the graphically user-friendly looks kind of nice. And from what I understand, the audios are a little bit better, but again, I've not used a lot of it either. I know there's a button you click in Riverside that gets rid of the Ohms and Oz as well, which again, I don't really care as much.
00:52:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:52:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:52:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right.
00:52:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, how about tomorrow? We just work. Yeah. then they we meet.
00:52:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So let me just stop going to calendar. I'll just cancel my Wednesday then for that. Perfect.
00:52:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. That was a good productive conversation.
00:52:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was very good. I love it as always.
00:52:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:52:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm looking forward to your adorable YouTube video with your hat. Bye. Bye.
