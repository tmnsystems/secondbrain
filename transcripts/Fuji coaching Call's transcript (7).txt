00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hi! Good morning!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Tina Marie: Good morning. How are you, Fuj

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Good, good, good.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Thanks for accommodating this different day. Appreciate it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Tina Marie: I do not like being up early. I'm barely awake

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Esther let me sleep until like 7 50 today, that was amazing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Tina Marie: Nice

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Ugh

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Tina Marie: My brain is just getting going. It's not the being up thing that bothers me. It's the not being fully just. Woof

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. I hear that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Tina Marie: I don't get paid to be like groggy. Okay. Um. So besides having talks with Esther about how you guys might be collaborating what's new

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. Well, last Wednesday, after our talk I got inspired, so I booked a ticket to La, and then I physically went to La, and you know, handed out uh

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. Mhm.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think. What did I buy? I bought 30 dozen donuts

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Tina Marie: Nice

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. So I gave it. Obviously, I was hitting the most of the law firms that have sent me cases In the past are the ones that are continuing to send me cases

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. I you know I did have, I think, out of the 20 something law firms I visited. I There was about 3 of them 3 or 4 where the you know the receptionist blocked me completely wouldn't even let me. But you know most of them, even without a visit.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: They at least tried to get. You know the case manager or a case manager to come greet me So, you know, overall, I think it was. It was pretty successful. Um

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: There's a lot I learned One is, I don't really think there's a difference between handing someone a dozen donuts and 4, you know 3 dozen. There was a couple firms. I walked in with 3 dozen

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, because I knew they're bigger, and there was no real like I got blocked just the same as if I had brought one, you know, on, on those 4 that blocked me Um

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I think when I'm Walking in cold like that in the future. I'm just gonna bring in a dozen and say, Hey, you know, I'm Doc Fuji. Do my dog and pony show to the receptionist

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: And say, Hey, is there a case manager or a paralegal? I could talk to And they say, Oh, yeah, let me see if someone's available, then I can go back in my car and get another, you know dozen if I really wanted to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: But I don't think I was thinking, you know, if I had more

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: The receptionist or the you know, the front desk person would be more motivated, but that that wasn't the case. So I learned that pretty quick, and uh Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tina Marie: That's good. So If you were to compare your access level from phone calls versus um. Being in person

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Tina Marie: How would you rank that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean. And so the other thing I looked at is, I flew in, and I got Into Lax at 7, 30, and I I got my car and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Got on the road, and by the time I got to Wilshire Boulevard, where all my law firms are It was about 9

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: 15, and then I had to get the donuts. So by the time I saw the 1st law firm it was at 1030 Um, and so, and then I had to get back to the. I had to leave for the airport at 4, 30, or 5

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I really I had 1030, 1130, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, like 6 h where I was Actually making the rounds. And yeah, in those 6 h

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: I probably talked to at least like 12 or no, not 12, probably about 10 new case managers that I'd never met before.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: And that's more than when I make 8 HA call. Oh, yeah, it's It's a higher.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Tina Marie: My term.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Rate than when I yeah rate than when I You know. Do 8 h of calling, for instance. Um

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Now I'm we're still tracking to see if this yielded any new cases. We did get 2

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: And it was. It was actually a law firm that I ran out of donuts. So I just walked in with flyers. So one of them did it And so we got 2 out of it

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um Yeah, so we'll we'll see if uh

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: More trickle in. I'm still I'm working the leads now. The other second mistake. So the 1st mistake I made was I should just hand out one dozen unless I'm thanking someone. Then I could do 2 or 3, or however.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. So if I'm just cold walking, and I'll do a dozen. My second piece of learning was Um. I need to get someone's card because I

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: I wasn't. I don't. I wasn't remembering The names of the people, even if I met them

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um And that's a problem. Um, so that's that's frustrating. I forgot a few people I met. And uh, yeah.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Tina Marie: Ooh Yeah.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then, yeah, I think. I think the last thing is uh

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like what I was handing out. I was handing out like I printed it out, I think. Oh, yeah, you helped me. You did it with me. The canva thing I printed it out on a 30 weight paper. So it's it's heavy paper. Um.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: But I'm actually thinking, next time I'm actually going to print it on more of a actual tag board Like a harder piece

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Tina Marie: I like it. Cardstock, or

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because the clock Yeah, that's right, that because the cost of just like the normal 30 weight paper, it's heavy

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: And it was still like a dollar a piece. But for a dollar more I could get a tag board And I think

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Something even heavier might be kind of cool So.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm gonna try that next time. So that's my 3rd thing, I would do differently. Um, and the 4th thing is For the firms that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: I have done business with. I think I should like spam message all the case managers that I've ever worked with, because we could do that, and just say, Hey, I'm going to be coming this day Can someone meet me at the front? I have donut, you know, like

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Just giving them a quick heads up. Um

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: And and I think that would help the other ones that I'm doing cold. I think it was fine with the donuts But I think if I do this again

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, yeah. The firms that I've worked with before. I would at least give them a heads up that I'm gonna be there. Can someone meet me at the front with the donuts on this day Um. I think that would help, because at the end of the day I started doing that like, for, like the last 4 or 5 firms, I said, Hey, I've worked with you before. I have donuts for you.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Can someone meet me? And they're like, Oh, yeah, sure. So I think I'll do that for the ones

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: But for the cold, the completely cold law firms. I'll still bring the donuts. I think that worked fairly well to get access

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Tina Marie: I love that. Um, yeah, it'll be interesting, especially Um! When's the last time? Sorry I have something in my eye

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Tina Marie: When's the last time you ran your numbers to see if It's still holding true that if somebody, although I guess it was probably a um

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Tina Marie: Not a small snapshot, but anyway.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: It was a snapshot. We did that

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Tina Marie: If they send you 3 cases that they'll keep sending you

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I haven't done that in a long time, so we could take a look again.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, cause it. It would be interesting to see, you know, the longer we measure it. Is there a threshold that does seem to hold true, and what percentage of the time does it hold true Um, but it also, we definitely want to take notes of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Tina Marie: Um your trip? Where you went, who you saw how you were received, how you were prepared

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Tina Marie: All of those details, because What you've learned

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Tina Marie: Is really important that memory doesn't work the way that we think it will You know, when something's fresh in your mind, you think it's gonna stick there forever. But how many times have you looked at a photo, and I completely forgot about this, or heard somebody tell your story, and, like I complete like, it is gone from my memory until you said it

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Tina Marie: So um! My girls get so mad at me because I take pictures of everything, and that once they hit teenage years they don't want pictures But I'm like, Look.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tina Marie: You think you're never gonna forget anything. But we forget so much. So yeah, anyway. Uh writing all of those down. But the other thing is is the more thorough your notes are in tracking

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: Your interactions, whether they be phone calls or emails, or in person. The more detailed your notes are, the more we'll be able to go to AI and analyze. Hey? Do you notice any patterns I might be missing

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Tina Marie: And then we get to kind of tweak and improve our approach, but also What we'll be able to do is start to get some

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Tina Marie: Um Ratios basically

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Tina Marie: Um, some numbers that tell us, you know, after X amount of times, we can get this type of result On average. So that informs us, you know, like, so if you have a particular goal, and here's the gap you're from here to here. Well, we know the math that tells us how long, roughly, or how many efforts, or whatever um, and because sometimes it's not about how much time it's about how much effort is applied within a time

00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Tina Marie: Right? So the more data we capture same conversation we've been having right. The more we capture, the more we can evaluate, the more we evaluate, the more we Start to see those patterns emerging that tell us, how do we get where we want to go faster? How do we maintain it? How do we protect it? Because sometimes, you know, we lose what we've had

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Tina Marie: Uh, that would be great, all that data. But that's good. So how did you feel at the end of the day? Having spent that. Let's compare it to phone calls

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um I mean, it was. It was a lot easier day than phone calls, because

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, there's just breaks in between. Right? I had to park. I had to drive each firm on Wilshire Boulevard was a couple minutes away from each other so, and then you had to park So I mean overall the number of times I had to

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, you know, have high energy, was a lot less so it was. It was an easy day The expense of the day was

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know the cost of the flight about, you know, 4 or 500, and then the donuts was about 600, so Um

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean, it's about 1,000 bucks for the day. Pretty cheap, you know. Then, my time, whatever you you know you factor in for that. But Um

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean comparatively between a day of 8 h of calling and You know. 6 h of knocking on doors. I we'll have to see, but

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: I do feel like I made Yeah, more effect effect efficient relationships in the 6 HI spent so

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm actually thinking of doing another trip to um. Like, because I did all Wilshire Boulevard this time, but

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, you know, next time, if I did it I'd probably do kind of more of like torrents. Area I also want to do. Oc

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like Orange County law firms, and then, obviously, the Seattle I've never done. I never shook hands in Seattle But I probably should do that

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um And then, obviously just around my area. Here, San Jose, there's a bunch of firms here. I've never really met

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. It's I'm starting to think that it would be nice to to do this more consistently

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Tina Marie: I think you'll stand out if you start to do that. But there's another way. We can start doing this math, Fujit. That is

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Tina Marie: So. If we were to compare the day versus your 8 h, and if we find that, and I'm sure that we will, that you get more cases out of it and more connections. That's 1 thing. But the other thing is

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Tina Marie: You know, in terms of cost, and we've had this conversation before. There is a real cost, even though it's measured differently of you spending 8 h on the phone

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Tina Marie: That's 8 h. You can't be spending doing something else. But more than that. There is the buildup of anxiety before you make the calls, because you don't want to do it.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tina Marie: So there's that real wrestle. And you did read switch right? We talked about finite willpower

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I, read it. Yeah.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Tina Marie: Right, so That takes from your your willpower for all the other things that have to be done, but also that takes from all of the other things that have to be done in terms of mental power

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: Um and other other things so

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Tina Marie: You know the cost. The currency is not money, but there is still an expense For doing it with phone calls and

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Tina Marie: Um I would almost venture to say that the

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Tina Marie: The um. Going in person probably added more energy

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Tina Marie: Ultimately than it took, or at least comparison, because

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Tina Marie: You got to meet people, but I would imagine that there's some like hope on the return. There's some feeling of accomplishment that you got out of your seat, you went, did something. You knew that you stood out like. These are types of things that

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Sure.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Tina Marie: Kind of buoy us, knowing, you know we went above and beyond Um

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Tina Marie: And it's kind of human nature to You know, to kind of celebrate that, and that's a little bit of wind in the sails

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Tina Marie: So. When you're measuring these things

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tina Marie: It's important to measure All the nuance of it right, and all of the currency exchanges other than just time

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Tina Marie: You know the time, the money, the energy, the willpower, the all these other things, and also other than just the return. But I'm really excited to see What that return is. I feel like, you know, people are still busy

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Tina Marie: But the next time you call or email Um

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Tina Marie: There's a correlation. There's a there's an association with who you are. And so, you know, we don't know but but it'll be interesting, and it might be interesting to see um, you know, if you say, Hey, Dr. Fuji, like I was in your office last week. I brought you guys some donuts

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Tina Marie: You know I'm not just, hey, I'm Dr. Fuji. I'm just another guy, right? I'm the guy that brought you guys donuts

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. I definitely write that now in my follow up emails. When I was uh, yeah, I was like, Hey, hope you guys enjoyed the donuts last week. Yeah.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Tina Marie: Also um. Yeah.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it evolves. But also I I do think it would be amazing like, go visit all the locations where you're doing business and um

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Tina Marie: I think that you'll probably Learn new things too. My experience is that

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Tina Marie: The more we have a physical experience Um

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Tina Marie: The more that we're invested in a thing, the broader the experiences which means the broader the Learning and the understanding is, and you know that always has some kind of return where you can do something better. So

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Tina Marie: That was cool. I sent you a message. I'm like, how did it go? I had to wait all week long just to know

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, sorry I didn't see it.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, um, you know, interestingly, like the thing that I I you know I've done this once before in La, where I kind of went to different firms. This is my second time doing it, and I did it once, 3 years ago, or 2 years ago. But the thing I did differently this time was I had like a map of where to drive

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I. I edited it through the day. But essentially I just, I went on, all like I went on Wilshire Boulevard, only on the ones on the right side

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then I made a U-turn, and then I hit all the ones on the left, going back to the airport, and that's what that's what I did. So

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Tina Marie: Strategic, bing, bing, bing.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it's like a Fedex driver. So

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Tina Marie: We call you donut, Doc

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Hi Don't it

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Tina Marie: I love it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: So anyway. Yeah, I'll we'll we'll we'll be tracking. I'm I'm uh I right now. I have like a spreadsheet going of all the ones that I hit. And so we're just trying to track

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Putting. I'm putting like a big thing through the ones, and my follow up so We'll see if it works

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then the other firms that are completely remote, like I have a 1

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: One uh One firm. That's just they're 100% remote. So we're sending uh

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Stanley Cups Personalized Stanley Cups

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Tina Marie: I love that idea

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: So we're sending it to their 5 top case managers. And then uh for Law Brothers, which is my biggest one. I'm actually gonna send um Stanley cups to all 17 of their their largest case managers. So

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Tina Marie: You should deliver those in person. Fuj

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: We're doing Yeah.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I I thought about that. But the custom orders are really tough. Um, I'd have to store it somewhere Ah!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because they're not already. At the same time we're printing their names on it Um. So yeah, I mean, I could. But it's uh

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Tina Marie: So let's just think about these things. Um

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Tina Marie: It's almost like Short, stopping short of just the

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Tina Marie: There's so much potential. Let's look at the stacking. Right? Let's let's look at the impact power of you. Show up with donuts. You deliver

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Tina Marie: Mugs. There's no association with you other than your name. You have to hope that they remember the association There's a completely different impact and power when you deliver it in person, there's an association with a face

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tina Marie: A voice. A name and energy.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Tina Marie: How they feel, just talking to you and exchanging with you The cost. Difference is

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Tina Marie: More storage and transportation of the things. But what you could do is potentially, and this is bigger, depending on where you're going to do. It is like rent, a storage box or mail something wherever where you can have it delivered. I don't know that gets more complicated. But, man, that the personalization, just to be able to deliver that kind of thing in person That has a whole new level of impact

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Tina Marie: Um And it's not like you're going to keep doing personalized things. You could keep doing donuts. But

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Tina Marie: That it's kind of like a 1 time opportunity to have a bang level impact

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: I mean I know how to. I know how I could do it. I would just send it to my friend's house in La, and be like, hey, can you store this so Um

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Tina Marie: Take you out for lunch. Let's go

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: But yeah, I mean, yeah, if I did that for definitely like my biggest refers then uh Um

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean, it almost might be worth it. If I'm already doing the personalization thing To have a relationship to one place. Yeah.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Tina Marie: Outside. For the test like, even if you just did it with one law firm. Right? That you have okay with results or something like that like, let's be strategic about the one that you pick

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Tina Marie: But To find out like

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Tina Marie: Can you get a wow? Factor level impact

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Tina Marie: And if you do, does it have a return We're human beings are pretty simple.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Tina Marie: Um! There's a whole top of mind thing, which 1st of all, top of mind generally is just about frequency. Um, but

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Tina Marie: The emotion that comes with that top of mind. Right? So I can think about Fuji every day. But if I think Fuji is a pain in the ass, because he calls me all the time You know it doesn't matter that you're top of mind

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Tina Marie: Because you're not in a good place. Top of mind. But if Fuji's on my mind every day because he messages all the time, I'm like, Oh, yeah, that guy sent me that that like custom, Stanley Cup. I've never had a like personalized Stanley Cup. Everybody like I get a Stanley cup and not personalized

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Tina Marie: That guy's so cool I should give him a case, you know, like it's a completely different energy, and and ask yourself what I'm saying, like that kind of

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Tina Marie: Comparison to Um, a unique

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tina Marie: Right. The effort that somebody put into it the thoughtfulness we rank People like that? We we do. We go through this thing. So now, is everybody going to care? Are you going to be dealing with some people who are jaded and be like. Yep, that's just another guy with another gimmick

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Tina Marie: You're going to have those people And then they're going to be some people who are like it may be, but I don't care. This is so cool like

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Tina Marie: I don't know anybody who's had a personalized Stanley Cup. They they love their cups, things like that. Um. But if you're in a big office. Everybody's got the same kind of thing having your name on it. Maybe you just are never the person that stands out You know. Maybe you're always number 3, or always number 4, right?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Tina Marie: And don't really get a lot of attention You know, there's all kinds of different things in that human factor and experience where what you were just talking about

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: I see.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Tina Marie: Could really be like Stand out!

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. And I that that brought up a good thought in my head to the standout is um You know right now

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: We're collecting Paul. Paul's helping me collect the orders like, I make an intro to the case manager and then say, Hey, Paul's gonna be helping you customize it. Um

00:21:45.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: With law brothers, we're kinda we're trying to get a group Thing going. But you know, actually, I'm thinking now, maybe we should just reach out to the individual like I should initiate the conversation with the individual case manager, then give it to Paul to customize, because then it's it's a 1. On one thing I'm talking to just that case manager. So they know that you know I appreciate them instead of like, Hey, put your order on the you know the spreadsheet

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do that good idea.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Tina Marie: That would be really cool to find out. I mean, like you already, came up with the customization

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's a pain in the ass. I hate Stanley Cup. They're like a archaic

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Company and archaic website, and it's awful to work with them. But Everyone seems to know what this

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Cup is so

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well, it's because for the longest time Stanley Thermos was a brain. The the cups are newer

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's right.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Tina Marie: But there was no Other than the brand thermos itself. There. There was no comparison to Stanley, that was all. The the workers, the factory workers, the loggers, the blue collar anything if they wanted their stuff to say hot all day. It was Stanley

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Interesting.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: I never thought of that

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. There, there's there's no comparison, because it was

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Tina Marie: Um the 1st one that was double insulated. It was steel

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh!

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Tina Marie: Um it could. You could smash it, you could drop it like it. It lasted forever. And so there's nothing else, really, that has that brand power

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Tina Marie: Um That is probably a lot of nostalgia for their parents, for their grandparents. Things like that, because

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tina Marie: You know. Because because that's how old and how long the brand is. And there's not a lot that's like that. So

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. That's interesting.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Which is why they can be archaic

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Tina Marie: Because they really are that old, and they're living off of Brand power, mostly

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Tina Marie: But but they still do have, you know. They hold up, they stand up.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: Nice that makes sense

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Tina Marie: Um, okay, so We were working on more delegation with the team

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Tina Marie: What have you been working on besides that since we spoke last, although my experience is that other than the Mondays after we talk Not a lot of the Admin type stuff happens. So

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Tina Marie: I don't know if anything is Progressed.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: Well, but you've got Paul driving. So anyway, I'm quit making assumptions and ask the questions

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Tina Marie: Let's evolve

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, I was let me. I was gonna share the numbers from last week Um

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: Maybe we could do that first.st

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: I don't know how you share. Oh, here it is.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, there, we go.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Tina Marie: Is it That's so tiny.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Tina Marie: There we go!

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um. So last week we did. Uh 67 new referrals. Um. Yeah, I mean, it's down from

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: The prior March, and it's down from February

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Down from January The total number of visits we completed was 98

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: So that's that's kind of been positive. That's more in line with what we've been doing, which is a hundred total visits a week. Um, you know. Obviously, I'd like to see this referral number up, you know. Double that. But

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's concerning how low it is.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: We. Yeah.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then you could see um We did.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, that's yeah. So 29 return visits. So again, this is great. Anything over 20. It's been really helpful. And You know Paul's

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Continuing to try to get us return visits by essentially calling all the case managers, asking if we could see them again. The um.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: The total number, you know. The the handpicked 20 case managers that I picked

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like fell again right like You know, before most you know my top 20 case managers were sending me uh

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: Like up here. We're sending me, like most of my volume, like See, even just like in March here

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: They were sending me, like half of my volume. The top 20. But now, like last week and the week before, and the week before, it's been a very small part

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: The case. Managers

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Tina Marie: Let me ask

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Tina Marie: Let me ask you a question. What is the effort that you put into your best case? Managers

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, the base case manager is all pretty much from La Lizzieri. We're the law brothers.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Tina Marie: But the question remains.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um, not nothing nothing in particular I mean the donuts right, and then the Stanley cup. But that's

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's about it

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, Stanley Cup is coming. That's that's good.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Donuts happened last week. But yeah.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Tina Marie: Um Yeah, so, like.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Tina Marie: Do you have? Do you have case manager contact right where you can get to them directly

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Tina Marie: Um I would just be really honest, and communicate with them and say, Hey, so and so. This is Dr. Fujinaka. You have sent me these cases. And actually, I just wanted to thank you. Well, actually, a couple of things right? So you kind of set the stage that there's more than one thing coming. Pay attention.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tina Marie: Um. You've you've been one of my best case managers, and I really want to thank you for that. But I did notice that that volume has been dropping and I wondered if maybe you know, is it, you know, like, I can imagine a few different reasons why that might happen. Maybe business is slowing down for you. Maybe you've got a new doctor that you're sending things to, or maybe and I really hope this isn't the case. You're not happy with my service, and just a reminder. These are the things I do. Bing, bing, bing, bing! Right in house same day same day, same day, same day, right

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Tina Marie: And I just wanted to know if there's anything that I can do to earn that business back again, or um whatever. But I would be frank

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Tina Marie: I think that that goes a really long way, because what is probably just happening is somebody else is getting more attention for something, or maybe they are having a dip themselves

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Okay.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Tina Marie: Um, but I would. I would not assume that it's a performance issue. But what happens when you tell them, you know, hey? I'm concerned, and you're one of my best, and I kind of rely on you Um. And and here's how hard I work for your business. They're like, Oh, man, I want to help that guy out because

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Tina Marie: You know I I didn't realize I wasn't sending him as many

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I could start doing that like an email, even an email would be okay.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Tina Marie: And Yeah, I think I think an email would be great. Um.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Tina Marie: But what I would also do is just ping them like a voice, drop or text message, whatever you have, and just be like, hey. Shot you an email. And um just wanted to

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Tina Marie: Let you know that it's there, cause you know, emails are big or whatever I don't know. I like to double up

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: Um, and just let people know because text messages get missed. Emails get missed But generally one or the other is going to be seen right and serve as an alert for the other one.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: I think, yeah, I think something like that. I need to do something like that. I agree. Um.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Tina Marie: You know what else you could do And and I'm going to tell you, because Fuji

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tina Marie: Every single client I've ever had. Um! So There's exceptions, but the exceptions are that um. I always do a consult before I keep clients right

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Tina Marie: Um. And but even in that, so there was maybe 2%, possibly 3. But I don't think it was 3. I think it'd be closer to 2% of people that actually already tracked their own numbers Right.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: So. And that's at a CEO level. People that need to know their numbers are not tracking their numbers is definitely not really an employee.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tina Marie: Thing to do. I can just about guarantee you that nobody has any idea what percentage of their cases they send to a particular doctor They just send them. I can just about guarantee you

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Tina Marie: So. One of the things you might consider doing is doing a monthly summary, hey? So and so you sent me these cases. I just want to give you a quick summary about where we're at with them. Right? There's this patient you sent me. You sent me this date. This is the date we got you your report. This is the date we got your bill. It's all going to look the same pretty much all the time, and here's the total amount. Just want to thank you for your business, and just let you know that all these people were taken

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Tina Marie: Care of same day as promised um Your reports are built to win a case as promised

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Tina Marie: You know all of these things They start, seeing that every month. Guess what? They're never going to forget you for that, either.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Interesting.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I like that, actually. Or not necessarily like on the end, but maybe, like the 20th or some random date that we just do it every every month, and we say, Hey, the last 30 days

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: I. I don't like monthly things. But yeah, if it's like, on a random date, like we pick 20th day every Paul and I do, and Yeah, that's something we can easily do. Essentially, just a quick email that like you said

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, emphasize what our clinic does, but then also at the top, say, Hey, you know, over the last month, thank you. We you sent us blank referrals. On average, we we track the average time to to visit, so we could say, You know, the average time to visit for these 3 clients was, you know, we we saw them within, you know, 2.4 days

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: We got you the reports the same day. Blah blah By the way, if if anything's missing or you didn't receive anything, please let us know. That's another reason we could say is, we wanted to make sure everything's loops closed. If anything's missing, let us know

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um Oh, that's nice. Yeah, we I could do that. Okay.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: That is another way to stand out, though, because I could just about guarantee you. Nobody does it

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. Okay.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it could be just for the referrals that have been new, because um You know that most most of the firms only use me once for their services. So even just highlighting the the 1st visit they had with me

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. That occurred in the last 30 days. That would be a

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Tina Marie: Yes, if you do it for everybody, not just your best ones, but even your one offs, hey? Just want to show you. You sent us One this month, right? So that almost implies that there's going to be more

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Tina Marie: But then you give it that that line right. And here's another mental trick you can do. Show empty lines, show Like 5 lines, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but only line number one is filled out right? So there's like

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Michael Fujinaka: And put put like lunch at the 5th line

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Tina Marie: And something like that right? But I I would be careful that could be insinuated as as bribe, or whatever you don't want to get yourself in trouble

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: Stanley Cup at the Temp line

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Tina Marie: But yes, but but that implies that there's something missing that needs to be filled out. There's incompletion, and you know what a brain wants to do when something's incomplete, it wants to complete it. There's just like this kind of Angst, whatever. And it's subconscious. So They're not even necessarily paying attention to that. But what might happen is they send you another one in the next month. There's 3 lines filled out. Now it's almost like this internal competition. Let's fill this out. But then they don't know. The lines go to 10 the next one. After that

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Tina Marie: Gamify Fuji, gamify, play with these people, and they don't even know it. But but you're not manipulating in a bad way. So to me. Manipulation is getting somebody to do something outside of their

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Tina Marie: Morals, their beliefs right against Against what is good for them or what they would choose for themselves. Consciously, you're just helping them focus on

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Tina Marie: Because you're going to serve them on their clients really? Well. So.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Tina Marie: Uh um. The the intent is that it's actually, truly, equally good for everyone involved. But I promise you

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Tina Marie: Nobody's doing that And you will stand out, and if they start to see that regularly.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Michael Fujinaka: There!

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Tina Marie: Um You know? Yeah.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tina Marie: There's no way that, and it may take a few months That that doesn't start to have an impact. But there's also no way

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't start to become a water cooler conversation with somebody. Oh, Dr. Fuji! Oh, yeah, that guy always blah blah blah blah, you know, and if you're building a brand and a reputation, I promise you a couple of years of doing that. 1st of all, other people are going to start to copy you

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: No.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tina Marie: Promise you that Um, but

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I think I think that that is something that you could try

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Tina Marie: I'm gonna tell you what, Chat Gbt would have never told you that either.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah, I'm just trying to see um, you know, for each

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, each month we have. I don't like. We don't track the number of total We don't track the total number of cases someone sent

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: But I suspect it's about

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: I don't even know I don't have a I think it's like I think there's about each month about 40 unique case managers send me a case

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um Maybe I'll say at the worst case, 60 right or 50

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: So that would mean essentially 50 emails going out On 20.th So yeah, I think I could get. I mean, Paul. And I could definitely get through 20 emails a day

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: If it was once a month. Um, maybe like after he does this report, or something, he can He can say you think monthly is better than weekly weekly would be pretty easy, because there's only, you know we have. We. We know exactly how many sent us

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know, in a week, but

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Tina Marie: Well, okay, so. Weekly makes no sense for people that have sent you one like. If you've got people who are sending you things

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Tina Marie: Every week or every other week, then, maybe. But you know It's it might be easier to see through if it's weekly

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Tina Marie: And feel Like it is manipulative, right? Because

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Tina Marie: They're they're not. They're not trying to track their stuff weekly, but they are tracking it monthly. They're tracking their revenue monthly. They're you know what I mean

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Tina Marie: So that's falling in a line with what they're doing like, hey, this doctor is helping me accomplish my goals of getting a case closed And settled and paid out

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Tina Marie: Faster because he's turning everything around. So you're hitting the boxes of Scheduling fast same day, billing all these things, and then notes to win the case right

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Tina Marie: So you're reminding them that You're helping them meet their financial goals.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Tina Marie: Once a month. There!

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Tina Marie: And so, you know, I realize you. You said you don't like monthly, and you'd want to pick a random date. But the reality is, there is actual rhythm to their business And so maybe you're not doing it at the beginning of the month. Maybe you're doing, or at the end of the month maybe you're doing it at the beginning of the month

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Tina Marie: Where they've just gone through. Did they hit their targets? Did they not hit their targets? And so maybe it's like the second or the 3rd where they're like I was short. I was over. I'm like I'm motivated because I got to hit those numbers this month, and here's Dr. Fuji with. You know. This is how I helped you last month You know I can help you keep hitting your stuff because I'm going to be there and take care of your stuff quickly. Make sure that we are reporting every single injury from the wreck

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Tina Marie: Like really getting that one in the notes with the thing. Hey? These are the cases that you sent me. And I did this for all of them.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep. I love that idea

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: I like that

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Tina Marie: Now let's talk about the logistics of it.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Tina Marie: The email should have a template

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Sure.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Tina Marie: Um You know so

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Tina Marie: You should have a checklist of all your people like. What you're going to want to do is systematize this as well as possible. And actually, Fuji Um, we could probably create. We could talk, to chat, gpt about how to do this as quickly as possible. But you already use Gmass right

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: No.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Tina Marie: No. Who uses Gmask. Somebody uses Gmass. Okay? Well.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Tina Marie: Gmass is is built in, and Gmass does mail merges So um! But we might be able to do it with Hubspot. We we could. We could use our time to work with chat Gpt to figure out how to do it. But what you could basically do is some mail merging

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Tina Marie: That would pull the names of your doctors Um the everything, because you're already tracking everything you do have

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Tina Marie: You track all your patients individually, don't you

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Alright!

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, but but you also track where the patients came from, don't you

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep. Oh, yeah.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So all of the data is together. So you, we would have to create the system that pulled the data from the right places, so we might have to set it up For sure you're gonna have to set it up, but you could set it up so that it's all done um, almost automatically. And then you manually

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Tina Marie: Check that because you don't want that email going out badly. So the manual effort is just in reviewing the email and making sure it looks right, and the system is working. You don't actually have to manually do all the emails so we could do mail merge Through either Hubspot or Gmass.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Tina Marie: Where it's pulling. Um, the case manager, the law firm. They belong to the number of cases which it's getting from individually and um In the case in in the spreadsheet that is, tracking all the patients

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Tina Marie: You, you'd probably have to put in a column for how long it took like, how When did you get the appointment? When did you see them so that we can get the average time? It took us to see them. So we could actually report that

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Tina Marie: All of this could be automated because you've already been tracking the the data So then it would put it into the email as according to the format that you've already created through mail merges, which basically is

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Tina Marie: The email will say, Hey, name. Um, and it would be like, Hey, case underscore manager, right? Because that's a it's a

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Tina Marie: It's an id for the name that it would pull from the spreadsheet, and then so the top of your Columns in your spreadsheet would be case manager instead of like case manager written. It would be bracket case, underscore manager bracket, so that Gmask could go. Oh, that's the column. I'm supposed to look for Case Manager and it and it pulls in that file so it would go through everything. Row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right, and then there could be an if null right? So if this is

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Tina Marie: 0, then ignore it. So don't create an email for this. If this, if this number of cases is 0, This whole thing could be automated

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Tina Marie: And you just manually go review it and make sure that everything went

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, or if it pulls in the The column with the patient's name.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um Yeah. Could do that, too.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Pull in the patient's name For a date range, you know, from

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: March 1st to March 30, th or whatever

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, and then find all the people with this Email, the case manager's email

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then pull out the names of the patients. Yeah, I could do that

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: We don't even need the count. I mean, we could put the count to make it fancy. But yeah, essentially, if you just pull up the names and say, Hey, this is a list of who you've sent. Thank you. This is the time that

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know we we got them in Um

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: We keep it simple like that first.st But yeah, we could also try to add it up, you know. Do an addition like account Count, a

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Tina Marie: Well, here's a here's a way that you could do. It is you could have an average of all your visits, and then you're safe to say, you know, that

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Tina Marie: The average was the same for their people, right?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's easy. Yeah. We could do that.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Tina Marie: So um. And then, if you just specifically always hit the target of it's always under this number, it's safe to say that also

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Or maybe the final check could be we we look at or you know we we manually look at it, and we make sure that everything was completed You know that

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: We just do a manual check, because there's nothing that says that we completed the visit. But yeah, we could. Do, you know, before we send out the email. If it's only a matter of 50 case managers, then Um. I could certainly have Paul just make sure that everything was sent out on time

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Michael Fujinaka: Then they're like the case is closed just like it's double check

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Tina Marie: And You know, tracking the completion date wouldn't be that much harder, and would probably be a good idea, because then that's more data and reporting that you get that is necessary

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Tina Marie: And good

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh! Yeah, I would think about that

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Tina Marie: It's pertinent to their value. Right. It is incredibly important to that value if if you've seen them or not.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, no, no! I was thinking about how I would put in the tracking time, that how fast we sent out the reports because we send them reports either the same day or the next day.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um I just don't know how I'd get more granular than that

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you don't need to. That's that's enough. You know. You could speak in 36 h.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Tina Marie: You could say 24 h, whatever. But if you're not

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, within 24 is what we try to hit

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Tina Marie: It's Okay. So then, um, if somebody's going to go and try to prove that wrong, they're gonna have a hard time doing that right, they find an extension

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it would. I would have a hard time proving that wrong

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So then you can feel safe just saying, within 24 h, you don't need to really go and prove it, because you know that that's

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Sure.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Tina Marie: It'd be hard to disprove

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: These patients. Reports were delivered within 24 h of the visit Yeah, okay.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, okay.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Yeah. So the really, the check would be make sure the name got right.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know that who are addressing it to make sure that We pulled in the right names. Well.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: That shouldn't get messed up, but maybe it could Probably just the patient. The the case manager's name would be the thing we'd be checking

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Okay, yeah, I could. Uh, I could do that. It's called Gmas

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: So it's like a mail merge for Gmail and Google sheets

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Guess how long it's been around Like.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Tina Marie: More than 15 years

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, wow! Okay.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Tina Marie: And hardly anybody knows about it.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know what I was thinking of doing was putting us another uh formula on my spreadsheet, because You know I was coding the app script

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: But you know this would be a probably a more elegant solution, because then I could work On the email rather than in the spreadsheet level.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Nice. I'll give it a try.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: Gmas.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Tina Marie: Um It's Mark's birthday today

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Tina Marie: Do you know that

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: $18 a month. Sequences. Follow ups. Don't need Api don't need Ab. Don't need triggered

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, cool. This looks cool. Thanks. Tina.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Tina Marie: You're welcome.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Tina Marie: I know you love your G suite stuff like everything's in Google and your calendars and all that

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's just because it's the Simplest.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay, this is great. Okay? So that oh, and then I want to get back. So that's great. I wanna do that. I think that that is

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Tina Marie: Well.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Actually, that's an easier way, because what the other idea I had was to do a lecture Once a month for all the case. Managers, you know. Say, hey, I'm going to be lecturing on this topic for 15 min at lunchtime on this day

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Michael Fujinaka: You know. Click to join as a way to email them. But I think if I was doing a summary email at the end of each month. That's another excuse to email them

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: And not be like intrusive. So This is great, this is lower effort for me. Overall

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And the key word there is not to be intrusive, and also to not

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Tina Marie: Ask more of them It's a give. It's not an ask

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Give. Yeah. Well, that's why I thought the lecture would be like a give. Because a lot of case members are like, Hey, why did you do this, and I answer the same questions to them. But

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's why I was saying like I could do a a lecture, you know, every lunch or something, or once a month

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. But that is an ask also. So it is a gift like you're giving them information. But it's also more of their time. And of all the things people cannot get more time in the day

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, it's true.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Tina Marie: M, You know, like you'd have to. What is the return for them if they go through that lecture like, how are they going to make more money. How are they going to save more time? Going to be better? Right? But the email is for sure. Now, I'm not saying there's not value of what you're teaching, but you have to decide, and you have to. You have to

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, that's true. That's true.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Tina Marie: The the question is Is what you're giving them, more valuable than anything else. They could be spending their time on that day. Now that

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Tina Marie: The odds. You know.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Tina Marie: And

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: I agree.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. So I I like the idea of, you know, helping them. But do they want that

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Tina Marie: In that way But what they do want is to close their cases at the highest rate possible as fast as possible. They want as big of a return as fast as they can get. That email serves that purpose

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Tina Marie: What do they want? Most? Food. Give them what they want most. They'll give you what you want most. If those 2 align

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Tina Marie: What that email does is show them that that's exactly What's happening

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Cool. That makes sense.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Tina Marie: So. That should be something that you guys can figure out how to build. We can do it on our time. Um.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Tina Marie: So we've got a couple of things And then let's go back to priorities again for a minute. Right? That

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Tina Marie: There is no business without leads. There is no business without clients, like all of the things Don't matter if you don't have these things coming in. So this is

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Tina Marie: Spending as much time as you can to solidify, to fortify, to amplify your efforts on attracting new clients that's got to be Priority number one. The close second is serving

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Tina Marie: And keeping and taking care of the ones that you do get

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Michael Fujinaka: Making them customers instead of one time Buyers.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, retention needs to be at least as important as acquisition.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, one moment, and then pick up real quick.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Tina Marie: Certainly.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Wait right there.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Tina Marie: You good.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Tina Marie: Um Okay. So we've we've got some time left. How would you like to spend it

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: Uh, well, I'm just gonna go over with you. Your other question about um. What? What did? What did I do on the

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Michael Fujinaka: Operation, side Um

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. So we talked about my lead outreach. Um. And then we talked about what I'll do better next time

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then we talked about the strategy about reaching out to the case manager I already have with that new email with Gmask. So I'll get that. I like that. I'll I'll get that done. I actually love that idea

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um And then you asked about what did I do last week? Um, operationally um

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. Esther suggested that I now that I have kind of 3 high level people, 4, 4. If you include Paul

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: And they're each taking a role in the clinic. And so, Esther suggested. I put them all in a signal group like a messaging group And that when they individually bring up a concern to me and Paul that all the managers see it, even if they're not a part of that one

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: Process So now I have a a text group where it's like my scheduling manager

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Michael Fujinaka: My clinical like my My.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Clinical flow manager, and then my report manager And Paul and I all in a group.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I'm making everyone put their questions to me in that group. And then that way, everyone sees Esther said, well, everyone, even if they don't respond, they're

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: They can. At least they're gonna read it and then see what the other people are having problems with. And then You know, it'll just inform everyone what's going on a little better

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: So I've been doing that um. Yeah.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: They did that

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Tina Marie: When did that start?

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Well, actually, it started on Thursday, because I got super frustrated with one of the managers. Um. And uh

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. So then, after that, I was like. Whining to Esther about it.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Michael Fujinaka: And then that's when I implemented that

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Tina Marie: So. I know Esther likes signal something to think about, and is that potentially

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Tina Marie: Things could get lost in the signal chat. Um, it's not really an effective way to manage any any conversation

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Tina Marie: So there's a potential for conversations to get mashed up and then come back here and go down there, and whatever So you may consider something like Slack or Google chat, which you can also do on your phone

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, interesting!

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Tina Marie: Where you can create channels. And

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Tina Marie: I didn't even know about Google Chat working the way that it did until Mark Showed it to us for Chona and her team this week

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Tina Marie: So I just never use. I mean, that was like way back in the IM days. Um.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Tina Marie: But but you already have the suite, and everybody's got email accounts. Um. Where where you might be able to use that, and that's already, you know. I I don't think it's an additional cost

00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Tina Marie: Slack, has a lot of bells and whistles that you don't really need, but you do need segmentation of conversation Um, because over time those things will get stocked. Something will get missed. There will be frustration

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: And signal is just not built to have multiple threads at one time among particular groups Um. So rather than getting established on a system that doesn't have the ability to scale

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tina Marie: You might consider pivoting quickly right now. Um

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Tina Marie: So that you don't get. You know, people used to a particular thing, and then you change it on them. Have the conversation with Esther. Maybe um. But

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. The only thing I've been resistant to anything on a platform like that is, it's not um. The messages don't delete As simply like I can't clear my servers um on

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Tina Marie: They jump with slack You can set that time with slack

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, interesting. Okay.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Tina Marie: Um, let me let me go do it. So the free account automatically closes. In 90 days. Um! Hold on a second

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, yeah, that's fine.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Tina Marie: Hold on slack, can you? Um set messages To auto, expire in threads

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Tina Marie: One sec. Yes, slack allows you to set messages, including those in threads to auto expire. But it's not done at a workspace level. You have to do it individually, for each thread you can set

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, that's fine. That's that's what I do. On signal I set the I set the expiration timer

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Yeah.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Michael Fujinaka: Oh, that's interesting. Okay.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Tina Marie: Yep. Free plans automatically. Have a 90 day message limit

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I'm not really interested in adding slack, but um

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Tina Marie: Let's see if you can do it with Google real quick. Um. Google message.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Tina Marie: Jeez Google messages allows you to send messages to auto, expire in threads by using the vanishing messages. Feature

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Michael Fujinaka: Where does Google threads live? Is that like in Gmail

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Tina Marie: 30, Yeah.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: Wonder how I would check that from my cell phone

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Tina Marie: It's an app Um

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Tina Marie: It's a Google thing. Is there a Google message you have iphone Yes, Google messages, Google Chat and Google voice apps are available

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: So Google Chat would be less like a Text, message, group.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: And more like Like a room

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tina Marie: Let's go look at it real quick. App Store.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: I mean right now. The thing about the signal thing is is that something that that's a tool that I use for, like my own attorney, and, like my other work. Um. And so these questions that are coming up? It's not. They're not frequent. They're, you know. Maybe they have one or 2 a day

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Michael Fujinaka: These are for like outline situations, like last week we had it where one patient was like drunk Or like.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Michael Fujinaka: Our clinician couldn't understand them because they're like, Oh, yeah, it hurts. They're like, Where does it hurt, sir? It hurts

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Tina Marie: It's never gonna be crowded

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: Huh!

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Tina Marie: So it's never gonna be crowded You know lots of messages where you

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: I mean, it could be, uh, you know, but that was something where they're like, hey? They texted me. And Paul was like, Hey, this is happening. Can you tell the case, manager? We couldn't complete the visit, so they don't. Yeah. You know, the case manager doesn't think like The hell you guys doing? Not, you know. So uh

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: That was something where I was like, yeah, let me call the case manager, you know. So it's it's it's issues like that that are outside the scope of normal. We're not planning Um. We're not

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Michael Fujinaka: There's no like Executive planning, because when I do that, then I'll then I'm

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Tina Marie: Email

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Email. Yeah, or I'll I'll tell them what we're we're we're gonna do

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Tina Marie: Probably Okay, then signals, probably fine. If it ended up getting bigger. I just looked at it. You can create spaces. You could do polls. You can do all kinds of crazy things

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: I see.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tina Marie: From single app, you get the notifications. So there's if the conversations become convoluted and just ingested, whatever

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: I see. Okay, like a like a slack light. Okay?

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And you and I imagine they're probably going to increase it because Google likes to dominate all the things that they do. It's just their Mo. So, you know, if if that's a need that they'll they'll fill it so they can keep people in the suite

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Tina Marie: Um

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Um

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Tina Marie: And it has the expiring message, function and feature That you can set

00:57:49.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. The last thing I was uh I'll I'll mention is after um. Thursday. I got frustrated because the girl that I put in charge names Mirka in charge of like She responds to emails and then makes sure the encounters like she helps get people on the zoom calls right. She helps send them the link to their zoom

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Michael Fujinaka: Um she made like a pretty rookie error last Last week.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: And I got really upset because I paid her at parity with my other 2 managers, who

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Tina Marie: Bye.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Michael Fujinaka: Have, like 10 years of experience as supervisors in call centers. But Paul really advocated for Mirica because she's my most loyal. Besides, Paul, she's been with me for Over 2 years, now

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: And so I gave her this role of manager. But like she just messed up something that was just so like It's something that, like a call center employee would have messed up. But I don't expect a supervisor to mess up

00:58:45.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: And so I told Paul like the I was paying. I'm paying her at a level That's equal to the other 2 supervisors who have 10 years of experience. I'm paying her the same amount I expect her to perform at that level, and she's not. She's just not there, and

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: For me to have to go back and train her, and Paul's like, well, we'll train her. I'm like, I don't. I'm not interested in training people when I'm paying you at this level. So anyway, I The thing that I'm going to do this week is we're going to put up like expectations. Esther is like, well, at least be fair to them, give them expectations so

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm gonna give her expectations, and you know what I expect

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: And And you know, then if she doesn't hit those, then we're gonna have another problem. I'll also I'm gonna switch her out

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Michael Fujinaka: But um Yeah, that's why I got so frustrated. And I was like, Okay, we need to

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: We need to. We need to be better about that.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Tina Marie: Did you check her qualifications before you promoted her

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Michael Fujinaka: I did.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Tina Marie: Cause. We had a conversation about that, so I thought you did

00:59:44.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Michael Fujinaka: I did, and One of the reasons I promoted her was, she's done every single thing of the clinic, just like Paul. She's done the reports she's done the calls. She's done scheduling. And now she's doing the email. So she's done soup to nuts, everything. And that's why I thought, you know, if you're going to be in my clinical, the

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Michael Fujinaka: The person in charge of getting the visits together You know she's done it all. But she she lacks the manager. She lacks like

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: A supervisor manager, level of freedom, freedom of thought.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Michael Fujinaka: She's She acts like a minimum wage worker, like just following

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Tina Marie: So she can take orders, but she can't manage herself Okay.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: And she's never done it, you know, and I knew that. But

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Tina Marie: Oh, well, then, that was 100%. Your fault? If so.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yes.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Tina Marie: And how old is she? Roughly.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Michael Fujinaka: 24,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Tina Marie: By that time Somebody will have had leadership opportunities in their life, even if it's just a volunteer work

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tina Marie: When a person has leadership qualities, it comes out in childhood They become leaders of some point. They manage things. You can't stop a leader from leading

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tina Marie: It will have happened by that point So um, learning how to identify leaders and managers is a skill that you need to have

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Tina Marie: Paul needs to have it, but you, for sure need to have it so that you can identify it You cannot pay somebody to get them to acquire something that isn't within their

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Tina Marie: Require. One of the things that is very common among Ceos is throw money at it, and expect people to be able to give them back, something equal for their money.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Tina Marie: With no regard to whether or not that person can even has the ability To do so.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't work that way. A person may want to, and they're not going to turn down your money and opportunity Because you gave it to them

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Tina Marie: So. The onus is on you.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Choose your leaders.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yup!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Tina Marie: And also to not put them in a situation of giving them more than they can handle ultimately, because you are the leader. That is something a leader does is protect their people. From putting themselves in a situation that's going to harm them.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Tina Marie: She now has risk of a job where she was doing a wonderful job before

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Michael Fujinaka: That Yeah.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Tina Marie: And she did she. She was doing what she's built to do, and she was happy to do it, and happy to serve. And you gave her an opportunity she wasn't prepared for, and now she's suffering as much as you are, because this is hurtful to her also.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Michael Fujinaka: Following orders. Yep.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yep, that's not fair to her, either. Yeah. That's the piece I was missing. Is that

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Michael Fujinaka: It's not it Yeah, it's not on me. It's not fair that I put her in that. And now she's suffering. I'm suffering

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: When I knew I knew as a leader she wasn't ready for that role. Yeah, that's that's that's the piece I was missing in my reasoning. Yeah.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Tina Marie: We also have to look at the motive for it. You wanted to abdicate

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Tina Marie: Not delegate. Abdicate, and I'll tell you why. I know that

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Tina Marie: Because if you wanted to delegate you would have done it right When you're prone to abdication, which is

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Tina Marie: I don't want to deal with it. You make the move. Hastily.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Tina Marie: And with people who are unqualified That's something that's been happening with you since we started talking. You've got to fix that, Fuji

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, that's actually, probably. Yeah, that's very true.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Tina Marie: That Is a very key component of undoing, like I'm getting emotional thinking about

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. I have watched companies be destroyed because of that

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Tina Marie: And I, It's not going to happen to you because you're

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Tina Marie: It was way too much hubris But I have watched.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Tina Marie: 7 and 8 figure businesses. Just crumble quickly And everybody that was counting on that money that worked for that company

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Tina Marie: And It is terrible to watch

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Tina Marie: Nobody. Will do this in your company, except you

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Tina Marie: You have got to be responsible for Um

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Tina Marie: What people can do, but more than anything you, you cannot allow Yourself to ever be in a mood

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Tina Marie: Desire, or entitled to abdicate

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Tina Marie: You. Own all of the things

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Tina Marie: Everything is your responsibility. It.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Tina Marie: Maybe, that you delegate it to someone else, but their performance is on you.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: That's right.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Tina Marie: Everything, everything, everything like. Imagine like in the foot. We've got all the nerves right Everything in the body is attached to it, and everything attached to the brain. There's this full connection

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Tina Marie: It ultimately The brain gives all the signals to everything, and it's all connected top to bottom. So

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Tina Marie: You. You're the one that can make sure that everything works. Nobody is isolated. They're all connected to you. So. And I know I'm saying this multiple different ways because I need you to understand it. And it doesn't matter what it applies to. It does not matter how much you hate something, and it does not matter how much money you're willing to give to somebody

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Tina Marie: You own it

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Tina Marie: And If you've got loyal people, hardworking, good people never set them up to fail

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. And that's that's exactly what happened here. Yeah, I and I. I was missing the piece, too. That Not only does it hurt me, but it probably hurts them, too, because they're you know they're used to following orders. They were. They were a shining star. That's why I'm paying them. That's why I've kept them. And then I

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Tina Marie: Not. Probably And then happy that for sure, Fuji, right there, that's at the very least how it's going to hurt them. But now there's also probably a loss of pay on top of it. And now there's also losing face for friends and family where they probably talked about the promotion. This is not a small thing.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Tina Marie: It will affect her more than it'll affect you.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. Yeah, that was. And that was, that's that's and and you know me. I tend to be

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Michael Fujinaka: I'm not very good with human app Empathy right? I tend to be apathetic towards others. So it's really hard for me to put myself in someone's shoes when I'm pissed off

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Michael Fujinaka: And so, yeah, that that was the piece that I was missing was that I'm I'm also causing suffering to them

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because I know. Yeah, because yeah, she I'm sure she doesn't feel good about what she did last week, and I'm sure she's like, well shit, I should have done that differently. You know I'm I'm sure she feels that, and I'm sure she's not comfortable now that I had that talk with her

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: So. Yeah, this makes me feel better, I think. Uh I'll you know. I'll think about it a little bit. But

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, I knew she wasn't. Th. There's she was not. She's never been a manager, never been a supervisor, even um. And I knew that so

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, I'll think of stuff stuff to do. I think I think we have ways. I could salvage this pretty simply And still letters, you know.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Michael Fujinaka: Stay face um But yeah, I'll think about it a little

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Tina Marie: I think that you will find Foods, that

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Tina Marie: You know, down the end of the road towards you know the end of our life. We start to measure things people do. It doesn't matter what they believe. Whatever there's there's um Tons of journals, reports, and things like that

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Tina Marie: At the end of the day. It's going to be how you treated people that matters most to you, and how you measure yourself, and how you, how you feel about things. Um

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Tina Marie: Having taking the accountability for this, even apologizing, maybe just like, say, like, you know. Um at the end of the day. I'm the one who leads and and needs to know what people are capable of. You've been faithful. You've been loyal. You've been hardworking

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Tina Marie: Um I recognize that you didn't have this experience, and I put you in a situation that I probably shouldn't have, and all you wanted to do was take the opportunity. So I can't really blame you for that.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Tina Marie: And just just to show that honor. 1st of all, she's going to have conversations with people. It's going to be talked about among your team, you will really strengthen that bond, and that loyalty when they see that kind of humility in you and your leadership. I promise you that you will like double the power of the loyalty of your team when you handle an issue Like that

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Michael Fujinaka: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this is no different than if I put like a medical student in in charge of a an injection right? And and I

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Michael Fujinaka: And it's not anything about their intelligence, their hard work. They've just never done it

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Tina Marie: Variance.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Michael Fujinaka: Their experience. They've never had that. And they're just setting them up for failure to hurt someone else to hurt, you know, to make everyone else pissed off And I knew I knew better, and I well, and in this case I'm the owner of the business. I'm like that. I'm not. Everything stops with me so uh

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah, even more. So so, okay, no, thank you. This is uh, that's that's wonderful. Um. I was missing that empathy part, I think, about

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Michael Fujinaka: Because I was like, oh, shit! It's hurting me. It's hurting me What did I do this for? Um? But yeah, I miss that. Yeah. It probably hurts her, too, that she's used to being

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Michael Fujinaka: Good, and following directions and Um! This is probably stressful to her. I know it's stressful to her. After the talk I gave her so

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Michael Fujinaka: Yeah. Alright. Thank you, Tina. Appreciate the extra time. Thank you. Uh, but yeah, that was that was really uh, that was a really meaningful thing. You just taught me right now. I

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Michael Fujinaka: I didn't. Yeah, I didn't think about How it hurts the other person, and

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Michael Fujinaka: Clearly, yeah, this.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Tina Marie: You're

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Michael Fujinaka: When I do something wrong and put someone without experience, it doesn't just hurt me and my business. It hurts them, too. And uh Yeah.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Tina Marie: But it.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Michael Fujinaka: That was the piece I was missing

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Tina Marie: You like that, Fuji, because you're a good man.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Michael Fujinaka: I will see

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Tina Marie: No. You. You don't get to dismiss this

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Tina Marie: You are a good man.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Michael Fujinaka: Appreciate it.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Tina Marie: You you wouldn't care If that wasn't the case.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Tina Marie: And it is important that good people know that they're good people. You can be humble and still know to your core that you're good It's important.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Tina Marie: Because you need to understand your value in other people's lives. And also know that opposition comes up that can shake us, and and make us doubt who we are.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Tina Marie: That doesn't just affect you. That affects everybody, that you have relationships with So it is important that you're anchored in knowing that you are a good person.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Tina Marie: Um Because that identity has an impact about how you show up in the world.
