00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.390
Tina Marie: Hello!

2
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.020
Dan: Hello! Hello!

3
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.230
Dan: How are you sure?

4
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.600
Dan: Oh, rocket number one.

5
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.710
Tina Marie: What'd you say?

6
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.630
Dan: Rocking and rolling.

7
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.889
Tina Marie: Oh, with in and out audio. That's what you're doing.

8
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.690
Dan: With what.

9
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.919
Tina Marie: In and out, audio.

10
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.410
Dan: Oh, you know I'm gonna

11
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.539
Dan: get off the Wi-fi, and that should fix it.

12
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.410
Tina Marie: Good.

13
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.739
Dan: Yeah, yeah, that's the weird thing you would think it would like, hey? No.

14
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.919
Dan: you think we'd somehow know how to manage?

15
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.580
Dan: No, no.

16
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.190
Tina Marie: Better signal.

17
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.560
Dan: Hey? Hey?

18
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.970
Dan: Hey?

19
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.850
Dan: If

20
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.490
Dan: okay, that was a first.st

21
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.350
Tina Marie: What?

22
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.720
Dan: The neighbor's dog just came out of nowhere to this fence.

23
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.399
Dan: and then they all went ballistic on each other.

24
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.140
Dan: Okay, come here.

25
00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:44.948
Dan: Like yeah, that was good.

26
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.040
Tina Marie: We're not having it today. Huh?

27
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.280
Dan: No, I mean, I was like, thank God, there's a fence there.

28
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.780
Tina Marie: I don't need these 2 freaks.

29
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.590
Dan: They!

30
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.950
Tina Marie: But.

31
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.150
Dan: That's but that's the 1st time it's ever happened.

32
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.760
Tina Marie: Wow!

33
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.620
Tina Marie: Let's see one second

34
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.909
Tina Marie: Oh, do you know yet what you're doing with Mariel?

35
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.090
Dan: Nope, she wants to go over to the studio for something not really sure. Why.

36
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.550
Tina Marie: Oh, that's cool! Does she like to do music? I thought that was mostly an Evelyn thing.

37
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.059
Dan: Well, that's why Denise, like texted me this morning like I didn't see it.

38
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.469
Dan: and she comes back, and she's like, I'm surprised you're not like running down the street. I'm like, what are you talking about?

39
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.700
Dan: So did you get my text? I'm like, no.

40
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.320
Dan: she's like, Mariel wants to go to the studio today?

41
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:45.690
Dan: She specifically asked, and I go. Oh, why, she's like, I don't know. Well, she said something about singing. And I was like.

42
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.280
Dan: really, so yeah, I don't know why.

43
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.900
Dan: That's awesome. We'll find out.

44
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.809
Dan: Yeah. It's the 1st time anyone's ever asked

45
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.250
Dan: or out of the 2 of them.

46
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.840
Tina Marie: That is very cool, though.

47
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.429
Dan: I know. But what's funny is, she wouldn't ask me.

48
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.677
Tina Marie: I almost spit out my drink on my keyboard.

49
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.219
Dan: I'm like, why is she asking you like she's like, I don't know.

50
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.890
Tina Marie: So yeah, so she's a little shy.

51
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:28.760
Dan: I think she wants to practice or something, because she's really.

52
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.630
Dan: I think she's really she's joining a new theater group.

53
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.000
Dan: and I think she really wants to get apart.

54
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.400
Dan: so I think she wants to practice singing, and she won't do it at home.

55
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.149
Dan: and so no one will be there. She'll probably kick me out.

56
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.399
Dan: She'll probably like thanks later or or put me in the other room. But whatever

57
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.950
Dan: So this new theater thing, the theater. She was just in

58
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.320
Dan: the season, just ended on Friday on Saturday.

59
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.510
Dan: So now it'll be like she's joining this new one.

60
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.149
Dan: and I think she just wants to get a part. So she's gonna

61
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.200
Dan: do and practice some sort of audition piece is my guess.

62
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.350
Tina Marie: That's really cool.

63
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.285
Dan: Yeah.

64
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:21.799
Tina Marie: Go ahead!

65
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.480
Dan: I was. Gonna say, she did a thing like in the this last season.

66
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.740
Dan: She didn't get a part, but she did a bit for a song

67
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:40.650
Dan: from the beetlejuice musical, which I have never seen, but apparently it's really good

68
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:51.809
Dan: And it was unreal how good she was. I mean, I was floored. I was like, Oh, my God! Like I didn't know she I mean, I kind of knew she could sing. She used to sing when she was a kid.

69
00:08:52.150 --> 00:09:02.419
Dan: but like she nailed it like the acting, the singing like she she can sing, act, and dance like I'm like you are legitimately like a triple threat.

70
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.779
Dan: but it was unbelievable how good she was.

71
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.030
Dan: And then I'm sitting there watching it going.

72
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.549
Dan: They've never practiced together, like I know they haven't. And then, when they were hey?

73
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.620
Dan: And then, when it was over, come here, come here!

74
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.879
Dan: And then, when it was over, I asked her, I go. Did you guys ever practice that together? She's like? No.

75
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.739
Dan: you would have never known.

76
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:45.350
Dan: And she held it together because he screwed up at 1 point and she fed him the line and I caught it. I was like oh, he forgot his line, but she knew it, and she started the line for him, and then he picked it up. I was like good for you, but then it like breaks out. They both have like a solo section. So then she had to do like a whole solo

77
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.030
Dan: singing part. I was like, God damn.

78
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.039
Dan: I was like, she's actually good. So yeah, it was interesting.

79
00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.800
Tina Marie: And she, okay, hold on a second. So she's in between my girl. So she's 16, right?

80
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.420
Dan: She's gonna be 17 next month.

81
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.000
Tina Marie: My gosh!

82
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.120
Tina Marie: Where you guys have the same birthday month.

83
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.090
Dan: Yeah, she's her birthday's the day after mine.

84
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.570
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh! We might have had this conversation before, but and my family

85
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:31.070
Tina Marie: me, my brother and sister all are immediately before one of our parents, and it works because we have different parents. But anyway, so my brother is the day before his dad. My sister's the day before our mom, and I'm the day before my bio dad.

86
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.520
Tina Marie: which is not a common occurrence. So anyway.

87
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.680
Dan: No, that's like that's like I have a friend whose kids are the same, their birthdays the same day.

88
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.750
Dan: and they were born like 3 years apart.

89
00:10:44.910 --> 00:11:08.530
Tina Marie: Yeah. And what's crazy, too, is my brother married? He he got remarried last year, and his wife. She only has 2 kids. One of them has my birthday, and the other one has the same birthday as my sister's boy, so she has a child with the same exact birthday as one of his siblings or siblings. Child like

90
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:29.849
Tina Marie: it's just interesting, like that kind of alignment doesn't really happen. And I don't. You know, I don't know whatever. But there's definitely something to be said to it, because, like, if you've done human design, like of all the things that I had shared with Dexter for personality tests like cause. I was just like, here's a whole like, get to know each other kind of thing. Not that he would do that.

91
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:39.904
Tina Marie: but like the assessments. But of all the things that he was like, this is exactly you. It was the human design one, and I was like, let me tell you about that.

92
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.940
Dan: Funny.

93
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.890
Tina Marie: Because if you knew what that was, I'm pretty sure you'd have been like. That's bullshit.

94
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.899
Dan: They do?

95
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:54.540
Tina Marie: But he's like it's creepy. How exactly like that you, that is. And I was like, Well.

96
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.070
Dan: Well, you just ask Chat Gpt who you are, and you're like God damn.

97
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.883
Tina Marie: You know it's funny cause Mark sent me

98
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:28.669
Tina Marie: Was it yesterday the day before he was like, you know. Ask Chat. Tbt, 10 things about you, and then 10 things about your weaknesses. But I've done that exercise probably like 2 or 3 times now before, and it's definitely always more relative to the most recent conversations, so like when I was doing talking to it about different, like spiritual things, because I was writing or journaling, or researching.

99
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:38.760
Tina Marie: Half of the answers were God related, and this time none of them were God related. God definitely did not drop in my priority list. Yeah.

100
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.909
Dan: It's it's fallen out of it probably fell out of memory.

101
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:42.870
Tina Marie: Yeah.

102
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.780
Dan: Yep.

103
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.593
Tina Marie: Yeah, anyway.

104
00:12:46.920 --> 00:13:00.790
Tina Marie: so what's what's new this week? What kind of growth enough? I I need to stay focused. But I'm really just super excited about the growth and evolution that is happening with Mariel, that she's just like

105
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:10.210
Tina Marie: cause having 4 daughters, and knowing the whole phase of like going into the cave for a while, you know, and withdrawing, and also.

106
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.079
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.480
Dan: It's been moving.

108
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:21.489
Tina Marie: For this like there's a signal. It's like it's like the 1st daffodil of spring, like. All of a sudden the dead time is over like. That's what that feels like.

109
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:40.389
Dan: Well, yeah, she's like growing her hair out again, too, like she cut all her hair off a couple of years ago. It I mean, just straight up, looked terrible. And and then she like, there's a photo I'm like, Oh, my God, you're gonna hate that photo in 20 years! I hate it now you're gonna hate it in 20 years.

110
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.969
Dan: But like why she cut her hair off like we don't know, like I think she definitely had, like the.

111
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.940
Dan: you know, hit puberty became uncomfortable with her body.

112
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.550
Tina Marie: Yeah, right.

113
00:13:51.550 --> 00:14:00.180
Dan: So she's now growing her hair out again. She's wearing clothes that are. I wouldn't say they're more feminine, but

114
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:18.530
Dan: they definitely are tighter fitting where for years she wouldn't. She would never wear anything like she would go to her circus class and have like baggy everything on. I'm like, how do you swing on the like? Isn't that a detriment? Don't you need to be like? Wouldn't a Leotard probably be better?

115
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.460
Dan: But then.

116
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.130
Tina Marie: Yeah.

117
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.490
Dan: In this recent musical.

118
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:28.169
Dan: I don't know why they did this, but it was cool shit. They her and a friend

119
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.530
Dan: her and 2 with other girls

120
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:40.910
Dan: in the thing. They all do silks and lyra. So they she she did

121
00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:44.706
Dan: Lyra thing like the musical is

122
00:14:46.080 --> 00:15:06.820
Dan: little mermaid. So during kiss the girl. They had a whole setup on the side like, not on the stage, but down on the ground next to the stage, lit, and whatever, and she did like a solo Lyra piece during the whole song. And I mean, I didn't know I didn't realize I knew, like Evelyn's super flexible. So is Mariel.

123
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:26.859
Dan: Just never saw it, but she killed it like she was killing it, and my brother's like oh, my God! She is so intense! But for that she had on yoga pants whatever like tight clothes, and I know they didn't make her wear that she chose to wear it. So there's that she's growing her hair out.

124
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:39.460
Dan: Denise was at the last show volunteering, and one of the moms came up to her and was like, Oh, like Mariel's, just really came out of her shell. I mean, she's like a different person.

125
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:49.920
Tina Marie: You know what part of it could be. There's 2 things, and both of them could be true. I'll tell you the things that I've seen in a lot of young women, because, growing up like

126
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:59.950
Tina Marie: being part of our church community I've just grown up with. I've been there while a lot of young women have grown up. So we get to watch them right talking to their moms and stuff like that. But

127
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:22.820
Tina Marie: the boy factor, you know, that's that's part of it. Finally, having an interest in boys and wanting wanting the attention after like wanting to hide it. That's 1 thing that can happen. But what is a big thing with siblings is feeling like they're in the shadow of someone else that's bigger energy, and they just don't want to compete or be compared, and so they just kind of withdraw.

128
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.860
Tina Marie: But Evelyn, being gone for a whole year, mostly.

129
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.660
Dan: Oh, yeah.

130
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:42.279
Tina Marie: That that could be a huge factor, that she might just feel like, you know, there's no competition now. She can just be judged on her own merit. I'm watching that happen with mine, who is all my youngest, has always had tons of

131
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:59.490
Tina Marie: potential and hugeness, probably more than all of our sisters, but she was always in the shadow, and this last year, like her theater last year it she realized that. Wait a minute. I'm the only one here. I can't believe all these people like me. I can't believe they think I'm great. I can't believe all this.

132
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.730
Tina Marie: And then she just did a pageant she just did like.

133
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.019
Tina Marie: It's the county version of Miss America.

134
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.589
Dan: Yet.

135
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:09.149
Tina Marie: That feeds into that

136
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:14.809
Tina Marie: and like it was crazy because I always saw that stuff in here. But she would just

137
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:28.609
Tina Marie: I don't know she'd do things for a little while, and then, like somebody would say something, and she'd shrink again. So anyway, whatever it is, how fun that she's like finding herself and coming out of her shell. And

138
00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:36.519
Tina Marie: it's it's a bittersweet thing, though, because they go from like the cave to now. They want to be social all the time, and they're still gone.

139
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:44.420
Dan: Oh, yeah, she's purposefully like, you gotta take me driving. You got to take me driving because

140
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:53.500
Dan: she wants to join this theater group, and she's like, if I get my driving hours done by my birthday, I can get my license. And then I can just drive myself.

141
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.920
Dan: And I was like, okay, I'm like, I like it. I like it.

142
00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.950
Tina Marie: I love it.

143
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.499
Dan: Course I won't have a car, but that's okay.

144
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.910
Tina Marie: But Dan.

145
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.969
Dan: You can't afford. No, no, I'm just saying golf cart.

146
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.770
Dan: I no, I just go back to walking to the office. It's fun.

147
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:33.879
Tina Marie: And this is why some people that make money keep money, and why most don't whatever, although I did just buy my 1st brand new car, and I've never been like I'm always like that is the stupidest thing in the world. I'd rather buy something with 10,000 miles on it, or something, because it loses value right off the lot.

148
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.460
Dan: Yeah.

149
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:41.419
Tina Marie: But it was crazy all of the things that aligned to like get this particular car.

150
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:50.359
Tina Marie: And so I'm just like, you know, I feel like I'm just supposed to do this, you know, when there are certain things you're like that's almost eerie. How ding, ding, ding, ding!

151
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.140
Tina Marie: From.

152
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.590
Dan: Really.

153
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:59.670
Tina Marie: Riding in one of them in an Uber, which is actually the same model as my old car. Except for it's a 2025. It's a Nissan rogue.

154
00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:08.779
Tina Marie: You can't get that tech kind of package for this price. You'd pay like 10 to 15,000, any other model or more.

155
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:24.510
Tina Marie: But anyway, and then everything from finding it getting to test, drive it. So I, on a trip in Salt Lake, rode in it in an uber, then test, drive it with with Dexter, and we actually found, like the perfect thing. And

156
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:32.739
Tina Marie: he and I have different interests in cars to the fact that both of us were like this feels awesome rides, awesome love all these things.

157
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:45.680
Tina Marie: And then I I went to my credit union, and like within minutes get the loan to cover the full thing, and then some because I also had a trade in that, and my car was paid off.

158
00:19:45.860 --> 00:20:03.729
Tina Marie: Anyway, all these different things. Bing, bing, bing, bing! Just happened so fast. And also it happened to be that it was the end of the Nissan year, like, I wasn't thinking about this, anyway, the deal was crazy. I'm just like, you know what I'm gonna do it. And it was only $200 a more a month than what my old car payment had been.

159
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.270
Tina Marie: But my 1st brand new car. Very nice.

160
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.610
Dan: Nice.

161
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:17.429
Tina Marie: Good thanks, anyways. Okay, so where are we at with the book? And all things? Mom.

162
00:20:19.023 --> 00:20:25.546
Dan: I sent the final stuff for the book to her yesterday, so.

163
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.009
Tina Marie: Sizes or like what's what got added.

164
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:36.230
Dan: Yeah, it was, I think, 5 5 worksheet checklist things.

165
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.630
Dan: And then the the solution map, or whatever you want to call it.

166
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.880
Dan: So she's gonna add all those today. Probably there was. She ran into a bug

167
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.929
Dan: with designer, and so she opened a ticket. So whatever it's

168
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.160
Dan: it'll be done. She has it all. It's just a matter of the bug was causing a problem. Oh, yeah, she said.

169
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.519
Dan: The table of contents wasn't auto updating, which is supposed to.

170
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.030
Dan: So she's like, just, I'll try it again tomorrow and let you know

171
00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:13.369
Dan: but there's no way to like override it. Otherwise you have to fill out a ticket. So, but they're all added. And then the Toc just wouldn't update

172
00:21:14.145 --> 00:21:24.450
Dan: and then I expanded the glossary to. So she did. But she did that already. She did that the day before. Oh, no, no, she did all at once. I sent her everything she's like. I'll just do it all at once.

173
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.679
Dan: So she tried to do it all yesterday and added it. But the table of contents didn't update.

174
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.090
Dan: So it's it's done.

175
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.670
Dan: I'm calling it done.

176
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:46.790
Tina Marie: Benito. Yeah, love that. Oh, speaking of what is your travel schedule? When are you going to Italy? Was it Italy? You're going to.

177
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:53.500
Dan: Yeah, the the we leave on the 13th of June.

178
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.640
Tina Marie: June. Okay.

179
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.289
Dan: And come back on the 25.th

180
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.860
Tina Marie: Let me get that on my calendar, Jan.

181
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:12.600
Tina Marie: The 25, th so damn out of office. Oh, and

182
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.199
Tina Marie: I gotta edit it so it doesn't like. Make me busy.

183
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.430
Tina Marie: 13th through the 25, th right.

184
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.640
Dan: Yep.

185
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.150
Tina Marie: So that affects 2 meetings.

186
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.660
Tina Marie: And on the week of July first, st I need to. Actually, that won't

187
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.020
Tina Marie: affect you. I'll have all my calls Monday. Okay, that won't affect anything.

188
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.390
Tina Marie: because my sister is flying to Georgia with her boys

189
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:51.030
Tina Marie: to go visit their dad, and I'm like I will come with you, cause.

190
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.540
Dan: There you go!

191
00:22:51.540 --> 00:23:04.899
Tina Marie: He gets scared. And then I asked Isabel, I'm like you want to go on your 1st plane trip because she's been scared and she doesn't want to go. And I'm like that really sucks, because that means we can't travel. And I really want to travel. So she's like, Yeah, I'll go. So.

192
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.480
Dan: Nice.

193
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:11.520
Tina Marie: My daughter, her sons, and we're just gonna hop on a plane to Georgia and come right back the next day.

194
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:19.919
Tina Marie: But that means the only thing that she has to really deal with is that so? Not also a new place, because anxiety and teenage.

195
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.750
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

196
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.690
Tina Marie: You gotta break them in early, you know.

197
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.409
Dan: Yeah.

198
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:30.819
Tina Marie: Okay. So talking about the

199
00:23:32.066 --> 00:23:37.613
Tina Marie: like sales tracking. Ca, kind of keep trying to touch on this topic a little bit like

200
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.039
Dan: It won't work.

201
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:40.730
Tina Marie: Won't work.

202
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:47.929
Dan: Nope high levels like, Oh, no, it doesn't do that. So Eric had like built it

203
00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.139
Dan: so he should. He's on his 3rd version.

204
00:23:51.400 --> 00:24:04.219
Dan: which it should be. We kind of figured out all the plumbing. So I was like, let's get all the plumbing working first, st right? Because we have. We'll have leads coming from

205
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:14.229
Dan: rock rage, fan, flowy and mom. So I was like we should just put all the sales in in the mom sub account right now it was in rock rage.

206
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:20.539
Dan: Eric started building it on Fan Flowy. But then then I realized, Oh, no, no, we shouldn't build it there.

207
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:32.179
Dan: We should build it on Mom. So then he he moved. He was moving it to Mom, like, yesterday yesterday, and probably today or no, yeah, yeah, yesterday. And today. So it's probably done.

208
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:38.620
Dan: Then, once it's all there, it's like, Okay.

209
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:58.480
Dan: you can't use the high level widgets. They don't do the function that we need. So then it's like, All right. Where are we going to do this? Are we going to send it all to g sheets? Will that even work? Because then you're dealing with the whole Tag date thing.

210
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.080
Dan: So which I did somewhere.

211
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.769
Dan: Oh, no, no, that is part of the thing. So in theory

212
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:17.550
Dan: we could send it to a g sheet, or maybe air table, like we have to figure out which one's gonna actually do the thing we want with minimal

213
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.730
Dan: extra shiz, right and not just, and not just a

214
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.880
Dan: shit ton of zaps. I'm like, I do not want to deal with a bunch of zaps.

215
00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:34.170
Dan: So we we just haven't figured that part out. We figured out where to put it. We figured all the plumbing how to route the leads.

216
00:25:35.032 --> 00:25:49.420
Dan: You basically have to have, like each sub account, has to have its own follow up system because the leads are different. Right? A rock rage. Lead is not the same as a fanflow lead like fanflow started getting leads like organically.

217
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.570
Dan: So that was the 1st that's when we were like, Oh, shit!

218
00:25:52.820 --> 00:26:05.139
Dan: When those leads came in. I was like, Oh, shit! We didn't account for this. So then we had to strategicize, and then, knowing the book leads will come from Mom. And then the ads I ran in the past were Mom.

219
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:13.569
Dan: And then Mark was like we should just put them all in, Mom. I was like, yep. I already got there yesterday. So that's there, and then we will figure out

220
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:27.440
Dan: how to build the dashboard period. But then you also need to build a dashboard by source. Right? So what's the conversion rate on a rock rage lead? What's the conversion rate on a fanfloy lead? What's the conversion rate on a mom lead?

221
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.990
Dan: So that'll be like the second layer. Once we figure out the 1st layer of just.

222
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.819
Dan: you know, can we track a book called or close.

223
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.861
Tina Marie: Yeah, that really sucks that. You can't do this.

224
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.109
Dan: Big complaint, big complaint from the high level crowd.

225
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:47.430
Tina Marie: Ha!

226
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:55.890
Tina Marie: Is there, though, a way to do like wicked reports, integration. So not a Zap just

227
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.570
Tina Marie: connecting things so that wicked reports can put its dashboard in.

228
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:06.484
Dan: I mean, possibly. But this

229
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.450
Dan: wicked's really more about like tracking back to ads, which we'll eventually get to

230
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:19.869
Dan: so wicked, or the other one, so the other one I would use the other one, because they do tags.

231
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.350
Tina Marie: Remind my really, the one.

232
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.272
Dan: I can't think of the name either. But

233
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.619
Tina Marie: I want to feel like it's a woo something.

234
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.470
Dan: No stats something else.

235
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.710
Tina Marie: Oh, wow!

236
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.500
Dan: What it's called. I'm gonna I've literally just looked at it the other day.

237
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:46.979
Dan: I can see the dude's face. Anyway, I would probably use that because it uses tags, too, and this is very tag

238
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.330
Dan: riven.

239
00:27:49.560 --> 00:28:05.040
Dan: But you can use source, too. That was the other thing we had to work out like, Hey, use tags for this, and we're gonna use the source for when it's an ad, we will, you know, use the source field because Eric started using the source field. I'm like, no, no, no, don't do that. So we work that out.

240
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:18.360
Tina Marie: I want to ask a question, but I don't want to go there now, but I don't want to forget. Also the the founders, guys and the whole proxy like you.

241
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.280
Dan: Oh, so I hit.

242
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:19.870
Tina Marie: This will use.

243
00:28:20.096 --> 00:28:21.230
Dan: Yeah, I worked on that.

244
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.199
Dan: I

245
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:32.539
Dan: we had to wait for the bookkeeper to be done right. And then I hit them up the founders guys and said, Should we wait till the quarters over? And they said, Yup.

246
00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:41.079
Dan: so now the quarter's over, and then I hit up the bookkeeper, I think on Friday, and I was like, Hey, are, is everything reconciled through March?

247
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.760
Dan: She's like, yep, I said. All right.

248
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.770
Dan: I'm gonna hit these guys up, and then they're gonna want some reports.

249
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.250
Dan: Can you run the reports for me? She goes. Yep.

250
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.900
Dan: And then she wrote back, are you getting acquired?

251
00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:02.029
Dan: Actually, I'm not, but in 3 or 4 years, perhaps, so we'll see.

252
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.090
Tina Marie: Okay, just updating my notes.

253
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.200
Tina Marie: Okay.

254
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.020
Tina Marie: So.

255
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:24.729
Tina Marie: man, yeah, the I'm just thinking about the trajectory of a another 71. And how that changes that conversation, and

256
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:42.339
Tina Marie: especially the market share increase. I mean, they're the same thing, right? The the Daily revenue increase because there's only only way to increase it would be to take a bigger part of the market share unless the market is growing. But you were saying that it pretty much stays the same right.

257
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.040
Dan: The market's shrinking.

258
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.830
Tina Marie: Oh, the market's shrinking so even.

259
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.330
Dan: It's.

260
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.679
Tina Marie: That you've got a bigger share.

261
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.940
Dan: Yeah. So the market has shrunk, certainly

262
00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.299
Dan: in the last 4 or 5 years, like year over year every year.

263
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.460
Dan: But I think there there was like an uptick.

264
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:13.120
Dan: I think it's sort of reversed a little last year. I mean, we get we get the data late. So I think it reversed the last year that was reported. It reversed slightly.

265
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:21.116
Dan: But it's I mean, it's it's definitely smaller than when we started 10 years ago. Without a doubt.

266
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.210
Tina Marie: I don't.

267
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.500
Dan: So, yeah.

268
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.729
Tina Marie: So the Cpa market is shrinking.

269
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.570
Dan: Oh, yeah. Totally.

270
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:39.900
Tina Marie: I mean, I guess that would make sense, especially now with AI and all the tools and automations that have come in the last 10 years, even just as simple as quickbooks.

271
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.590
Dan: No, there's the problem is, they're

272
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.800
Dan: the industry is like, Oh, shit.

273
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.069
Dan: we're going to have a shortage of Cpas. It's a problem.

274
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.449
Dan: The issue is.

275
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.040
Tina Marie: Hi.

276
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.069
Dan: Tina, you can just become an influencer. Why would you go get a Cp. Why would you want to be a Cpa when you can be an Instagram influencer.

277
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.070
Dan: So they're not. People are getting like shitty degrees.

278
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:14.959
Dan: But there's also the belief that that's now starting to turn around as well that people are now realizing. Hey, these degrees are useless, like I need to. I need to live with a skill.

279
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.960
Dan: So I think

280
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:22.580
Dan: uptick in people going into Cpa. But it, you know, it takes 4 years for that to show up.

281
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:41.710
Tina Marie: I also think, and I don't know but but this is what's happening with skilled laborers, because we have the same exact thing happening. Is that less and less people were were getting these skills. And so we've had a shortage of laborers. Well, now, the laborers can make a killing. There are.

282
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.080
Dan: So.

283
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:59.099
Tina Marie: Money to be made, because supply and demand supply is very little. Demand is huge, and I'm wondering if that's 1 of the motivators, too, for people to go into Cpa again is that they could probably charge more now because the rates that I

284
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.870
Tina Marie: had definitely gone up.

285
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.590
Dan: Well, yeah. And it's it's a professional

286
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:14.949
Dan: del designation, right? So you're you're gonna you're gonna make money like you can go work at a firm where you can go, you know. Put up your own shingle, or whatever.

287
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.759
Tina Marie: You bet behind your name.

288
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.610
Dan: Yeah, so more and more people are doing it like.

289
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.690
Dan: But again, it will take years

290
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:30.670
Dan: for like that show up, which is fine. I mean, if we're making more money with less, we'll just make more money with more.

291
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:43.570
Tina Marie: Yeah, so market. But in the meantime, while the market was shrinking, so were the market holders.

292
00:32:44.220 --> 00:33:01.270
Tina Marie: And so you've got a bigger portion of a market that could be turning around like just thinking about the impact of valuations. And if you did want to sell, you know, because one of your patterns, is

293
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:08.980
Tina Marie: it not? It's not necessarily wait for stability, but wait for enough stability to know.

294
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.630
Tina Marie: Have a better knowing and understanding of what's real

295
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.120
Tina Marie: versus what it looks like in a snapshot.

296
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.770
Dan: Yeah, so that.

297
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:38.149
Tina Marie: The valuation, whatever it is, what you know, what you're actually making, what the results of your marketing is. And then also now, in like considering somebody looking at you and paying you like, making sure that you don't give them a gold mine and get paid for a copper mine. Basically.

298
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:48.429
Dan: Yeah, and it's like, I still gotta do the thing to see how many, exactly how many customers I think we're gonna add, and exactly

299
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.520
Dan: what

300
00:33:49.830 --> 00:34:05.759
Dan: you know increase in market share we will have achieved by the end of the year. And that's the thing, right? So but still I'm gonna start. I started, you know, working on some of the Cpa exam stuff. We've got the dude doing more SEO. And now I got to figure out all the tracking. But

301
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.459
Dan: you know, we're gonna we add.

302
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:14.380
Dan: we should add on the low end, $800,000 this year.

303
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:20.072
Dan: I would say it's probably gonna be closer to a million and that's

304
00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:26.659
Dan: like Bobby's hilarious. He's like dude, that's unreal. I go, I know, and we didn't add an employee.

305
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.440
Dan: We didn't add anything. All we did was take stuff away.

306
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.406
Dan: and like we added a new product by taking things away. It's kind of ridiculous.

307
00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.039
Dan: and that's the low end. So I'm like, okay.

308
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.830
Dan: if we if we're now gonna be like, you know.

309
00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.059
Dan: up in the 4 million area, I'm okay with that.

310
00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:57.019
Dan: And now I do think I can figure out how to know if the Cpa exam thing works, which I mean, it does work.

311
00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:06.279
Dan: So it's sort of like how the stuff with fanflow is working. It's like, okay. It worked. Now go, really. Make it work. Now you can go figure out.

312
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.590
Dan: pipe and then optimize the steps.

313
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.640
Dan: That's it.

314
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.670
Dan: Yeah. Go cuckoo with Gpt and figure it out.

315
00:35:18.588 --> 00:35:32.259
Tina Marie: Man the releases. It's it's just crazy. I really, I need to go build my own wrapper for Openai. So because the latest version 4.1

316
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:42.059
Tina Marie: is not in Chat Gpt, but it seems to be their best version to date. But it's only through Api access.

317
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.679
Tina Marie: So I want to learn how to build my own wrapper, or like.

318
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:56.150
Tina Marie: figure out one of the systems and tools to get one. But it's just so interesting because I love learning. I love the pace.

319
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.150
Tina Marie: but it's also crazy like

320
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:06.589
Tina Marie: I don't know. Maybe the only other comparable time in the world would be the the arms race. But that wasn't nearly as fast

321
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:13.300
Tina Marie: anyway, the innovation. It's crazy like there's so many implications of

322
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.040
Tina Marie: evolution, of humanity or deevolution depending on how you're looking at it.

323
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:28.000
Dan: So this buddy of mine yesterday was like, go into chat. Gpt o 3.

324
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:32.460
Tina Marie: And then type type in this prompt. I'll send you the prompt yes.

325
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:48.790
Dan: And the prompt was, basically tell me, it's like, from all the things you know. Tell me something you tell you. Tell me something you don't think I know that would help me, or something like that? And the answer it gave was unreal. I then spent a half an hour going. I didn't know that.

326
00:36:49.610 --> 00:37:08.050
Dan: and it mapped out how I can use, how I can better utilize my circle installation to deliver lead magnets. It was nuts. It was nuts. I was like, Wait, what? And then I started talking. Then I was on a 30 min conversation, and I learned

327
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:14.489
Dan: that you can basically do your own Oauth integration with that, if you have

328
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:23.550
Dan: the certain level account that we do have with Ninja, because that's all. Hap, that's all. Getting moved to our form is getting moved to circle right now. But

329
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:33.010
Dan: you can do this. So then you can have like a magic link. So it auto logs them in because it uses if they opt in to your form.

330
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.440
Dan: And then you're using infusionsoft, you basically get infusionsoft

331
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.190
Dan: to pass the login info to.

332
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.440
Tina Marie: That is a requirement for me, for all things.

333
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:57.020
Dan: Why I call it a magic link, because I knew you'd know what it was. So it just it acts like that. And then they don't have to log into circle, but then on Circle no one can join.

334
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:03.930
Dan: The only way to get into circle is through your landing pages. The join. Button disappears because you've turned on

335
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:11.390
Dan: Oauth, only you have to turn on Oauth, whatever. But it was nuts. I didn't know what it was going to talk to me about, and I was like holy shit.

336
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.190
Dan: But

337
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:20.819
Dan: I this this dude that I follow on Twitter always posts the craziest shit, and then I take it, and I put it in Chat Gpt.

338
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.289
Dan: So I spent an ungodly amount of time yesterday, like hours.

339
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:35.870
Dan: And I figured out so this dude was talking about like you have to give Gpt context.

340
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.800
Dan: and you do.

341
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.130
Tina Marie: For example.

342
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.509
Dan: And you do it through Json files. And I was like, really.

343
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:49.129
Dan: So I went down that whole rabbit hole, and then I realized I figured out like how to basically second brain

344
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:55.819
Dan: Gpt, and then I'm only gonna second brain it around me.

345
00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.350
Dan: Mom and ninja, like the only all the work things. And then I created like

346
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:10.479
Dan: 9 custom gpts. So I asked it. I'm like, what do I do in here that I could do with Gpts, and it was like.

347
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:24.259
Dan: it's like you shouldn't ever ask me to rewrite something. Make a custom Gpt for that. You should never ask me to do math, make a custom gpt for that. And I was like, oh, that's a really good idea you should. You should never write copy in here

348
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:40.169
Dan: for something that's not part of the projects that you want to be involved. You should just use, if you need a headline for one of your Google ads for law, or whatever. Don't do it in here because you're going to use up the memory. This is all a way to like optimize their new memory thing. So I made.

349
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.460
Dan: I made Gpts around all that stuff.

350
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.563
Dan: and then it gave me a list of

351
00:39:50.420 --> 00:40:04.499
Dan: So you make a context around yourself. You never make a context they're like, no, you only need a context about you. And then you need knowledge bases. And it's like you talk about all these things. So you need a knowledge base for the star principle. The automatic customer.

352
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:16.570
Tina Marie: That's where the segmentation comes in. So memory is about you, the way that you think, the way that you operate your values. And then the segment context, so that it has

353
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:21.990
Tina Marie: I get it is through all the topics. Because I that's the thing that I've learned is that

354
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:33.140
Tina Marie: the if you give it too much context, there becomes a problem, and it loses things and forgets. So you need to segment. You need to compartmentalize right

355
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.689
Tina Marie: and and really, basically by topic, by function, like the more

356
00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:44.759
Tina Marie: contained. A subject is right. So fanflow is too big of a topic.

357
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.430
Dan: No, it said, it's not.

358
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.110
Dan: It's.

359
00:40:47.110 --> 00:41:09.110
Tina Marie: Well, it has been. It has been so. Maybe maybe that's changed. But just because it says it's not, doesn't mean it's not the so explore with this, and and try it like. Try to make one. That's fan flowy. But then try to make one. That's fan flowy marketing so like in the project instructions. You explain everything that Fan Flowy is for context.

360
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.479
Dan: Well, you can't use projects. So projects have no projects, have no memory.

361
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.260
Tina Marie: Or custom, gpt sorry.

362
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.130
Dan: Have no memory either.

363
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.520
Dan: So what you do.

364
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.719
Tina Marie: And how are you doing it?

365
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:42.020
Dan: So you put the custom. Gpts are for things that you never want in memory. You just want that ability to like, hey, rewrite this email for me. So right now, I would just start a new thread and do that. And they're like, No, you're putting that into memory. Just here. Let's make a custom Gpt, that's built for you. So it writes all the instructions for it, and then I have rewriter. Gpt.

366
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:54.359
Dan: So then I go like today I used it 3 times. I just went in there and said, Hey, rewrite this, and then it rewrites it exactly like I want cut and paste, except I didn't use any memory. I just used it in in that isolated area.

367
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.719
Dan: So, then.

368
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.430
Tina Marie: Laptop.

369
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:07.129
Dan: No. So then, over in your. So if you consider that the Gpts are walled off from memory, but you're still using, you know. Open. AI!

370
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.139
Dan: Then your threads like they're like you shouldn't have

371
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.280
Dan: threads. You should have 3 threads, Dan, mom

372
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:31.859
Dan: ninja, that's it. Those are your 3 threads, and and they will share memory right? They can talk across each other, or they'll know what's happening in the other ones. But if you only talk about the mom stuff in the mom thread. It will just become smarter.

373
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.069
Dan: We can create. I can create

374
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:48.539
Dan: knowledge base for you to use in the mom thread. So like at the end of the day. What I figured out was, I need to extract everything out of here that's in memory right now that I want. Put it into knowledge bases, and then go delete all the memory.

375
00:42:48.710 --> 00:43:00.390
Dan: all of it, and then start with those 3 threads and custom Gpts, and that's it. They're like, you will have a second brain, it, will you? You'll be able to talk to yourself. And I was like, Okay, that's a little weird. But.

376
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.370
Tina Marie: Like? Was that a conversation that you could share.

377
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.870
Dan: Yes, it's still. I have not deleted that yet.

378
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.890
Tina Marie: I would love it if you share that with me.

379
00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:11.250
Dan: Yeah.

380
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:16.239
Tina Marie: Kids, you know, like, I've learned tons of things and it's helpful. But

381
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:25.710
Tina Marie: sometimes you kind of trip across like you did case in point an optimization that hasn't been.

382
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.019
Dan: Exactly. What happened? Yeah.

383
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:56.449
Tina Marie: Yes, and almost all the time. That's what's happened that I trip across the Aha moment. So. And it's almost like it's it's not even triangulation. Because it's multiple data points. I'm coming from this person, this person, this person, because very few people are thinking the exact way you do. But with the context of what you're doing. Even more so like, I have found some a couple of people that think very similarly and operate very similar to how I do. But I'm working on different things.

384
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:17.240
Tina Marie: right? So. And I have a different skill set. They're all programmers. Every single one of them is a programmer. The finding a programmer who's also very business minded very systems minded with articulation with, you know what I mean like they there's not a lot of those. But I have found a couple so anyway. But

385
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:34.429
Tina Marie: so I would literally just kind of trip across. Oh, this was is how it's gonna work for me that obviously sounds very smart. But then the other thing is, the features keep changing right? So it's not so much like shiny object and changing platforms.

386
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:45.090
Tina Marie: But that the platform changed so significantly that the way you interact with it. So anyway, it's crazy. It's

387
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:56.540
Tina Marie: awesome. But it's also like, I don't know you. You pretty much have to spend hours and hours learning every week to stay on top of it. But the 1st thing that I'm building so is my

388
00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:07.689
Tina Marie: damn it, I just keep watching my blood sugar. I could feel it dropping, and every few minutes it just drops more. It's just like straight line down. Anyway, it feels like caca, but.

389
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.110
Dan: Oh!

390
00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:13.200
Tina Marie: Caca, but my, a 1 c dropped 5 points in the last 6 months. So whoop! Whoop! I'm.

391
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:13.870
Dan: Dale.

392
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.620
Tina Marie: What was I gonna say? Damn it.

393
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.910
Tina Marie: hold on a second! I have it.

394
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.750
Tina Marie: Oh, it! It's so. So

395
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.999
Tina Marie: I still do want to teach the course thing. My my mom, time has been like

396
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:56.690
Tina Marie: tripled lately with the girls. And it's okay, though, because, like, they're almost gone. So I'm like giving it all like, if you want to spend any of my time you want to go spend my money. You want to go drive my car like I don't care. Let's go do it because they're almost gone. And I was still gonna love. So I'm not getting to play with it as much as I want to, and it creates a lot of disjointed stuff. And then I have extra work in my mission which actually just makes me really happy. But anyway, context, so

397
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:06.469
Tina Marie: tube to task, that's the gonna be the name of the product and all it is. It's really simple. And it doesn't even matter. If other people have created a version of it. Because you know

398
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.530
Tina Marie: New Market, you can sell, it doesn't matter. People will still buy who markets. Best wins.

399
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:19.199
Tina Marie: Yeah, well, and also best is relative to the individual that you're marketing to.

400
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.800
Tina Marie: So voices and things like that. So

401
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:32.290
Tina Marie: all it is is it will go scrape Youtube. But but you put in the the people that you follow, there could also be another version. But this would be

402
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:43.300
Tina Marie: an iteration that I don't have to have to make it function. So the people that you follow and it will get their content every single day, and then it will run it through a summarizer which I already have.

403
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:53.430
Tina Marie: and then the other thing is you can do is you can have that run through a master plan. So for me, I have, I call it my master revenue plan, right?

404
00:46:53.570 --> 00:47:21.030
Tina Marie: So that I can give chat, gpt context like, how does this apply to the master plan. How does this? So instead of having to give it huge context all the time calling it master plan, it knows. Okay, this is, and the other thing I have is prime Directive, and the Prime Directive is everything that we do has to make the next thing easier. So you do 1st things first, st order of operations always like. So if the choices between this or that which one is going to make the next thing faster, which one's going to get us to revenue faster. Blah! Blah! Right?

405
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:47.199
Tina Marie: So it gets all your content from your Youtube people. It summarizes it. And the summary is standalone like. So it doesn't have to have context. So it will look for all of the value in it and explain it in a way that you know, you basically get the most value out of everything that it's scraped in a good summary, because not all summaries are equal.

406
00:47:48.150 --> 00:48:05.199
Tina Marie: and then it runs it through your system, your values, the things that you're working on and says this is how you could apply it. But the other thing is, it will tell it's supposed to look at the content and go. Are you already doing this based on the AI's evaluation? Right?

407
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:21.749
Tina Marie: Are you using something better? Or is this something? Basically, should I ignore this? Is this relevant to me? Does it validate what I'm doing? Does it poke holes in what I'm doing? Or is there a way that I could be doing it better, based off of what we just learned in this video.

408
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:43.799
Tina Marie: And it will just do that automatically. All you have to do in is, go get a report each day of what it learned by scraping everything. So Tube Youtube to task, which is, here's the task of what you would do now with this new content that we learned, and just make it like a lifetime payment, get access to it forever.

409
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.230
Dan: So we're right. So like.

410
00:48:49.790 --> 00:49:07.489
Dan: forget I did this the other day. So it was like, there was some video I'm like, I don't want to watch that. Yeah. So I downloaded it, transcribed it into script, and then I gave it to Gpt and was like, Give me the blah blah. So actually, this is what I did this yesterday as part of my whole project, my second brain project

411
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:13.799
Dan: I had gpt, I was like, Hey, I want you to give you a transcript. Well, I did 2 things.

412
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:21.509
Dan: The same dude on. Twitter had this had this other prompt, and it was like the how

413
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.949
Dan: you know, understanding how you learn or a learning analysis prompt.

414
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:38.249
Dan: So he's like I, he's like, do this, and it will tell you how to learn. But then I, when I was in the Gpt thing, I said, Hey, would running a prompt like this, help this project? And it's like totally

415
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:44.570
Dan: we can add that to your context, right? So the Dan, it will just fatten out the damn context.

416
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:51.380
Dan: You know, there's the version I can come up with. But then this will just feed that more data. And I was like, all right. So I did that this morning, and I got that, Jason.

417
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.480
Dan: But I was like.

418
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.999
Tina Marie: Choose Jason, is it because of the size? Because I was using Markdown because Markdown was the smallest that I could find?

419
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.699
Dan: No, because it. The. So you use Markdown for knowledge bases. And you use Json for

420
00:50:06.238 --> 00:50:16.449
Dan: the context because it's struck the data structure. The data structure is what it said. But all knowledge based stuff is is marked down.

421
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.050
Dan: So that's what I was. So I was like, hey?

422
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:30.829
Dan: So what I want to do now is like it was like it, it knew. Hey, you, you base a lot of stuff off of these books, and it was like Eos, right. It knew it knew.

423
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:38.040
Dan: And I was like, correct. And it was like, I can create knowledge bases for those right now, and we'll just get it done. And then you can replace them later.

424
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:46.419
Dan: And I said, Okay, yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that. I just want to get this stuff built, and then I can. Then I can do it later. And I go. Okay. When I come to do it later.

425
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:54.960
Dan: You know, I don't want to read the book, and I was like, but I want to make sure that everything from the book gets extracted correctly. And I have Yada Yada Yada, you know, based on.

426
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:59.280
Dan: And it was like, I need you to write a prompt for that. And it wrote this killer, prompt

427
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:24.390
Dan: to like, take a book and distill it down. And I was like, Okay, right? And then it will dump it as Markdown at the end of it. I was like, this is perfect. So today I made like a Hermosi. This one other thing I made I made a hormozy Gpt that uses context and knowledge bases, and it's like, it'll be basically the best of both worlds.

428
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:36.510
Dan: So it's like it, will. You can talk to it as if it's Alex from Mosey, or you can ask it to analyze things based on the knowledge bases that will be both of his books. Right? So I got

429
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:39.430
Dan: his other book, and I'm transcribing it right now.

430
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:58.629
Dan: So run both those transcriptions through this prompt get knowledge bases, attach it to that, and then you can use that to say, evaluate this offer evaluate this business whatever based on all this stuff, not because he's great, but just that. I know he's absorbed a bunch of people. So I'm like, I'm not really going through him. I'm going through like a dozen other people.

431
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:05.850
Dan: but you wouldn't want to clutter your memory with the hormosy shit, which is what I was doing before, like I've uploaded

432
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:12.339
Dan: so many books into my memory, and it's like, No, no, no, no, don't do that anymore.

433
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.320
Dan: I was like, oh, I get it now.

434
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:23.459
Tina Marie: I cleaned, and one of the things I had the system do was make sure that the only thing that is in memory is my plan.

435
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:31.819
Tina Marie: like my logic, my reasoning, my values, and everything else, is supposed to be extracted from memory, and I don't let it add any.

436
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.180
Dan: Oh, you disappeared!

437
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.040
Dan: What's happening?

438
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.140
Dan: You're you're silent. I don't know what's happening.

439
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.160
Dan: Oh.
