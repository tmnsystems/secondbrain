00:01:04 - Chona Sweet
I didn't do one assignment. Did I just give you my stats for?
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
see. Let me get this into it.
00:01:25 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's too big. A spreadsheet and then the giant text. I did it through the notes app. It's bold.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. homework. It might be colder than I realized it was out here, but I really just needed to be out of the house for a while. Let's see. that's Fuji. There we go. Oh yeah, so you're already using dragon dictation, right?
00:02:09 - Chona Sweet
No, so what happened was he bought a dragon device, but it's not compatible with my apple and he bought apparently he bought me a laptop, but I don't he's all over the place. The one that has I don't have it, so I'm still using my Mac, so which and if I told you this I have arthritis and I can feel it now.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm a witch.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
You did not tell me that, but I have osteoarthritis and yeah, I have I have psoriatic arthritis, so mine is a different kind of different, but it's you know it's it's more of like a you know skin, I have two in one psoriasis and I That's fun. Yeah, that's lots of fun.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Mark decide if he's coming or not?
00:03:06 - Chona Sweet
I don't think so. He's slammed. He's like so short when he responded. he wanna, I'll let you leave.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what you want. So let's go back over the homework quick.
00:03:20 - Chona Sweet
So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?
00:07:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm really basis for her as well with me, so I have to I'm telling me shocked.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, we can shift gears, Tona. We can go back to that because I'd rather use Mark's brain for two things. So what you brought up is just...
00:07:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm suddenly you drugged up at the moment, so just as an FYI.
00:07:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fun? Oh, how's Ronan?
00:07:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He has a cough, he's adorable.
00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:07:43 - Chona Sweet
What? Well, looks fine, but he's still on capoeidic.
00:07:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. know what it's called, I mean, you can definitely...
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My little girl went to school for the first time in a week. They've got COVID. It's been going around yesterday. I almost want to cry just thinking about it, but I got her up, and I'm like, are you going to go to school? She goes like... I need to like yeah, you do and so I go out and she gets dressed and she's to the door and she's got her backpack on She's being a good girl, I look at her and she got tears down her eyes, and I'm like going back to bed You were not going to school Okay, I feel better now. Okay, wait, no actually she thinks that's distracting me I was trying to pay attention to what you wanted. Okay, so When you're talking about she has a first shot at first one shot at first impression. Yes What is good ice? Oh, look how cute.
00:08:30 - Chona Sweet
Shona is China you so I'm telling he's You're cute.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're adorable.
00:08:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're beautiful Cool sandwich place in New York City Tell it's based in Tuscany, I guess like all on Tonshio sandwiches So they make the bread fresh every five minutes and so it's really thin You guys get all this good food.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I live in redneckville, okay, and they're And when I get to go visit my sweetheart, I'm like this Let's have like just feed me. I'm I'm happy. Okay. So, okay, so the automation and follow up. Sorry, is a conversation we were having. But the fact that you brought up first impressions, make me wonder if there's an issue that's happening. Okay, so let's talk about that.
00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.

So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet
I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.
01:01:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
can call back and do a conference call with me, you and him.
01:01:15 - Chona Sweet
You want me to talk to him for his waiters, other stuff we need to talk and I'll call you.
01:01:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Plus, I mean, to me, you work with plenty of these types of founders and everything. They get excited by Shiny Ball without any help. That's him.
01:01:28 - Chona Sweet
That's you and him.
01:01:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I want you to think of the driving analogy.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
in a parking space for 30 minutes doing nothing to implement your phone is not going to get you to a spot you need to get to either.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No. Decompressing. That's called decompressing mark.
01:16:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I will slap you. You're just called procrastinating too.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't her sandwich. Then I know. Yeah.
01:16:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mental. She has food in the fridge.
01:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She has it. Mental. I don't even think you understand the mental load of a woman. Like it's a whole not a thing. It's not, it's not picking. Like our brains are different. Our brains are different. So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.
01:16:58 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:17:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, you know, but most of you are in better.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, maybe you can like, do you get more and better? Yeah. Yeah.
01:17:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Not a $406,000 bag nice and sweeter.
01:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Money has nothing to with literally got paid to $406,000 bag and we're both like what the F is. Why?
01:17:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I know. I know.
01:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bag of my house costs.
01:17:30 - Chona Sweet
Okay. That's a bad world. It's just crazy. And there are people that.
01:17:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So how many patients do you need to see to get that? No.
01:17:39 - Chona Sweet
How many houses could you build in the Philippines for that? Seven. saying no to this is, you know, something wrote me like I wouldn't even dare. It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.
01:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Draw that thing out for me because I can help you with that conversation and Mark, there's a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
01:18:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was it happy?
01:18:54 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
01:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:18:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm just, I don't even know what to do with that. think I was happy. My dad was happy.
01:19:01 - Chona Sweet
He's kind of drugged up. He was drugged up at the yeah, no forgiving too much drugs that helped him to sleep.
01:19:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that's okay.
01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.
01:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.
01:25:47 - Chona Sweet
Have a good night. will talk to you soon.
