So I don't know if we can just do a quick check in this week. I was all ready to work. I got tons for you. OK. All right. Well, actually the good news about that is that I wrote all of it out. So I can send that to you. Let's see. So one thing I would like you to do. So I've been kind of looking at the macros, but there's definitely the thing that stands out the most is when you go to bed.
00:00:36 - Michael’s iPhone
When I go to bed now.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So have you given any thought to trying to make that consistent? Obviously you've got the baby. So what are your thoughts about? Does anything stand out to you very quickly of you could probably do this a little bit better and be more consistent about when you go to bed.
00:01:01 - Michael’s iPhone
before the baby came I was I think I just talked to you like two times but we're Esther and I were both making it up for to get into bed by 10 p.m. and then wind down for an hour and then try you know be asleep by 11 but yeah since the baby it's so anyway yeah I think once the baby gets on our sleep schedule when she hits I think what is it five months old then Esther and I both because Esther has to do it too otherwise I never do it so yeah we did yeah before the baby came we did make like a like we didn't make it a routine to get in bed by 10 o'clock okay and so so I'm tabling that a little bit right now at least well we'll talk about it more when when you get your helper and as the baby gets there's not like a set time but as soon as her tummy's big enough to hold enough milk to help her sleep through the night that makes a big difference so and that is a case-by-case kind of
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
basis and it also has to do with the nutrition of the milk. There's all these different things. So Yeah, we think that'll be about like December.
00:02:09 - Michael’s iPhone
We're going to do the full because that's when Emmy at five months, Emmy was sleeping eight hours, 10 hours at night. So we think with this one, December, we'll be able to put her down and you know, let me just tell you, there's a lot of variety with children that it be earlier. It could be earlier.
00:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. So just the biggest thing is just kind of keep it in the back of your mind. Like the goal is try to be more consistent about bedtime and also know that whatever you can do to rather than take your cue from the baby, you want to try to give the cue. There's give and take. We have to, you know what I mean? You can't coerce a baby or anything like that. But there's something profound about being intentional and trying to create good sleep hygiene. And really, it's the intentional thing more than anything. It's the intention of, rather than receive signals, what can we do to engineer getting to bed in a more consistently early time because you definitely sleep longer when to show a rest to rest less and restful sleep is pretty consistent across the board. I definitely do think that when you're very low on protein and carbs and fat, just have a very light meal, your sleep tends to suffer. So be mindful of that. I've seen that pattern show a few times, but there are so many other things that can be taking into account on those days, and maybe you didn't exercise as much those days, and so what I would like to do is have you give me a very short and you can use audio dictation and put it into a cell in this spreadsheet, whatever is the easiest way. But you can also track exercise and lose it. So what I would love to do for just a few weeks, and then really we'll have enough information that you can just make decisions about how you will know what the things are that impact or sleep the most, like napping. So I hate napping, like I've said, but I have the most productive days when I nap, really annoys me. But it's true, they do. I kill it on math days. Anyway, so if we write down what your active calories are for the day, so your apple watch or your or ring would both track that, I think aura is more accurate, but I don't know if you wear it during the day. And let's compare that to sleep and what you're eating also. So possibly your eating less because you're moving less on those days. There could be other factors that have an impact on it. But let's just see what the relationship is for a few more weeks. I look at it just a little bit more for a few more weeks and see what we can figure out in terms of, okay, if I do this, I have this, you know what I mean? Because you can't fix all the things. You can just learn what things make an impact. So if you're really, really tired, you know, you can stack the odds with exercise, eating, sunshine, or taking an app when you need to catch up or power through something, you know what the things are that you can do for you because you've seen it in your own body that is going to help you be as productive as possible and also just not, you know, and it's stuck all week. mood definitely impacted too. And ability to deal with stress. So let's say all of those things are going on and your sleep is deprived and the baby's really sick for a while or ester sick for a while. So if you're not getting good sleep, Your ability to cope with that is Drastically diminished which means your ability to support them as drastically diminish which means you got to figure out how to get rested Very quickly no matter what because that's actually the best way to help them. You know what I mean?
00:06:13 - Michael’s iPhone
So all those things Okay, so I did I had a couple of days where I was That thing about my QME SIBTF work So I finished all seven of the reports, and then I did turn in the model I didn't train it to do the whole report, but I did train it to do one Subsection of the discussion and it I'm surprised like I took like an hour to feed it the reports and and Examples and snippets and then I loaded it and then it wasn't working and I was really upset like it wasn't I didn't do anything that I said and then I realized I was using the general public prompts. Oh Like my own GPT and then ask that. Yeah, so then after that, it worked. So it was a big help.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So one of the things I want you to do is, as we go through that and you do more of it, I want you to figure out and try to kind of project, this is how much time has saved you, this is how much stress has saved you. Because when you make that correlation back to coaching, you want to look at, okay, where's where's the benefit in this so that you keep the thing because we all need somebody that we talk to consistently, that is not biased, that's not in our business, that's not, you know what I mean? And also, that holds you accountable, that doesn't let you escape out of things, but also makes you feel safe enough to show up and tell the truth. And even when you're being held accountable, isn't too awfully painful, hopefully.
00:07:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I honestly like that GPT thing until you held me accountable to it. Like, it was something I knew I was like, you know, it should take an hour to do this. I just, I'd, for the last, you know, year and a half, I've known about strategy. Yeah, I just didn't like, oh, no, too much time. But yeah, I mean, just just holding me accountable and then saying, you know, that's my homework. Yeah, I was like, oh, got to get this done. So Saturday night, I sat there and I trained it and I did it. And yeah, I'm glad I did now. Now I think that section of the report, it'll pay dividends now.
00:08:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So do you think, okay, well, let's talk about next Monday because we didn't line that up before we get to anything else because I would like you to get back to Emi. Okay. So you were telling me next week, can you just remind me?
00:08:40 - Michael’s iPhone
Let's see. So yeah, one Monday, no, no, no, Monday is fine, right?
00:08:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think.
00:08:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Is it? Yeah, it was, it was this Monday. That's why we're talking today.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the week after that is an issue.
00:08:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no, no, the September 6th.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my one Monday.
00:09:02 - Michael’s iPhone
I have to work on September, okay, September 16th.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we can talk about that later. So if next week is good for the normal time, can you be at your computer at that time? Yeah, okay, because I would like to what I would really like to do is look at your systems for how you track your businesses for Q and E and for July medical. I'd like to ask a little bit more about Delto and really try to start diving into the business stuff more. I don't know how much of it will do because we're taking a systematic approach to the things that have the biggest impact, which is why we started with sleep hygiene, just kind of accountability processes, and then getting into where your time goes, which is what led us to the chat GPT conversation, because there's an activity that you have to do. You hate doing. How can we optimize that? So I do want to spend a little bit time in a chat GPT session. with you, watching what you've done, seeing if there's anything I can do to improve that process for you, and we'll just spend just a few minutes every week just until you've got a good system of this is really helping you and especially with that one particular attorney that is a pain in the for you, my mouth, pain in the butt, seeing what we can do to kind of reduce that friction so that you're never just sitting there with 15 cases that could be, or however many it was that could be making you 15,000 minimum a pop, we want to figure out all of that, and then the next thing is, you know, hitting some of the goals, so you have the goal of wanting to get 400 leads or something a month, on a second, referrals a month, but I'm also making the decision, do you hire another clinician? Well, there's some math that has to be done, and that also requires the report getting sent to you on a monthly basis, so that's That's an assignment we already have. So all of these things kind of stack on each other. And as they get done, that's what happened. So did you ask Esther's manager to do that? Did you have that conversation?
00:11:14 - Michael’s iPhone
No, we haven't, I haven't done that yet.
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:19 - Michael’s iPhone
That's the one about the reports, the, the utilization and the lottery pick that one.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll actually do that today. I'm just, but when I'm driving home, I'm supposed to chat with her about, I had, I had, I worked yesterday and the day before. And so I had, there's an issues that popped up. So I, I'll, I'll actually do that when I'm headed home today from the beach. Okay. on the call with the manager.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've talked about this for two weeks. So by next week, now, now the penalty kicks in. I don't think you should kick in this week because you did, to me, I think I liked to prioritize one particular thing. We're only going to give you one. on penalty that you can have each week. That one was right. That was draft five of them using print.
00:12:06 - Michael’s iPhone
And you did seven, you said? I think I did seven. And then I actually finished two more for two other attorneys.
00:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I'm happy with that growth.
00:12:16 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll see what happens when they when he comes back. But yeah, he should be able to give me feedback about all seven.
00:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I'll be able to feed that back in the model and tell what he said. Exactly, exactly, exactly. So my focus is less about, you know, how could we penalize Fuji and make him feel bad about what didn't get done and really focus on what you did do right. And what I want you to take from this too is how you can frame it when when you have conversations with other people and you feel bad about what you didn't do. I want you to focus on what you did. And this isn't justification or anything else like that. It's prioritization. It's being intentional about what matters most. None of us can do. all the things. But if we do the things that are most important, and you having a stack of work that needs to get done and not doing it because you don't want to, but also not getting that money for your family, not being reliable to Frank as a referral partner, which could cost your business. That's an unacceptable kind of thing in our lives, right? Either you should not to do it, and then you just cut ties and you don't do it, or you do it and you do it right, you know, and you do it in a timely manner. So to me, that was the coup for the week, and that's something to celebrate. I do want you to get the, yes, good job. I forgot you like those, so good job. am really, truly, honestly, placating.
00:13:43 - Michael’s iPhone
Good job.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. That was the priority.
00:13:47 - Michael’s iPhone
It did feel good to have those off my plate. Yes. And now that I've done so many in a row, I was getting, know, I'm a lot faster. By the seventh one, it was a lot quicker. So yeah, I'm hoping now I can, I can get closer to getting these done on the day of because all my other chemis, the other 60, 70 reports I do a month, I get them done, you know, within the visit actually, when I'm with the patient.
00:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:14:14 - Michael’s iPhone
But these, these, because they involve every single body part, they take a little longer, but I think I'm closer to getting it pretty quick.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really interested to see how Frank responds to that. And I'm very interested to see just how the process of feeding that feedback back to chat TPT does. Yeah, that's a major win. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to send the rest of this stuff an email. That was the one accountability thing that I really was focused on. And I feel like that made a dent for you.
00:14:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, it was fun. I mean, like you said last week, you know, maybe if we make it like a little more of a game, you know, rather than just a slog through work. And so yeah, it fun because When I, when I was like, okay, I guess I'm forced to make the GPT model, it made me like, make the GPT model and that was interesting to me, you know, and so, even though I was like, I don't want to be doing this, I did it. And so it was, it was interesting when I was trying to train the model, because I wanted to do it right.
00:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The system was like, this is what you have to do, Fuji, if you want my money, do this and you're like, I'm going to change the system.
00:15:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So, that's my favorite game. love that game. How do I beat the system?
00:15:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make it mine and be like, this is my house.
00:15:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, and I went ahead and actually, because I did that, I built a second GPT custom model to do one part of my normal, the normal everyday Q and E reports that are little challenging for me. So, it has a little work to do that part. It takes little more finesse, but I'll keep working on that model.
00:15:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Okay. So. I will send you an email with the focus and I will spend a good chunk of our time just really organizing that. So this is the thing I was telling you is sometimes calls aren't going to work out but you're still going to get my time because I'm going to take it and I'm going to put it into a really structured email that still is effective at moving the needle forward this week. So you still get your investment out of me but also you get the flexibility of...
00:16:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay, worry about that.
00:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I know that but that's my way of showing up at being consistent, right? Thank you. So because that's me honoring.
00:16:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Go ahead. How did you get the... So I got from my bookkeeper all my July medical... I think it was the July medical books. The balance sheet and the profit and loss.
00:16:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I only see... Oh, there it is. She didn't scroll down. I realized that there were multiple things in here. Okay. So, yeah, I saw, oh good, okay, P and L's by the month.
00:17:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So, have you read it? Yeah, if you want to, maybe, yeah, after the call, if you want to take a look at that for a few minutes and see if that's the right, because I also have it in Microsoft Excel. But the Excel sheets are not summarized. these PDFs are some of the rooms that I put together with the bookkeeper. So, it would be a little more succinct for me to read, which I still haven't read. But the idea was to make the PDFs.
00:17:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, these are probably the ones that I'll use the most. But I always like to take the 30,000 foot view and then drill down also and see everything and go, okay, this is the most useful version of the data. sometimes there's extra data sparks questions I may not have known to ask. Sure, sounds great. Okay, so I'll go ahead and write up the email. you. So is Emmy, did she just turn three or she gonna be four?
00:18:04 - Michael’s iPhone
It's today. Yeah. So she just turned three today. And then I'm still probably gonna take it to two at four o'clock. And then I'm gonna bring cupcakes for the class. There's like, you know, eight other kids.
00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, she's so precious.
00:18:20 - Michael’s iPhone
So precious. then my mom's next week. Yeah, my mom's here. And then my my sister brought her two kids.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're playing back there. I love your family, Fuji.
00:18:34 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I completely forgot. So I was like, what am I gonna do for Emmy's birthday?
00:18:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, let's pull her out of school and take her to the beach. So I don't think you can go wrong with that. So good job. job, dad. You guys are awesome.
00:18:48 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. need that. need to plan better. Maybe next year, you can help me plan this or set a reminder to plan there.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Little it's so simple. It's so simple. This is probably one of the best things you can do because it's family, it's memories, it's nature, it's pure.
00:19:03 - Michael’s iPhone
There's not a whole lot of pure in the world. Now, when she gets older, that's a whole another ballgame dad. Real birthday party.
00:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and peer pressure and pleasing friends, and it's a whole different kind of thing. And also, well, at one point, let's have a conversation about what nobody talks about and teaches us unless you paid attention to it in psychology. quickly, kids start leaning on their peer groups and pulling away from parents. We have these conversations and we think that it's the parents. It's not. It's human nature. Kids start pulling away by age seven. By age 10, they're leaning very heavily on peer groups. by age 14, it's pretty much 90% peer groups and not talking to the families. Now, of course, there are outliers, but yeah, nobody prepares you for that emotionally. So keep that in mind and really. please look at this little time because it changes really fast.
00:20:04 - Michael’s iPhone
That sounds good to me.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, take care.
00:20:07 - Michael’s iPhone
Please go inside your family.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send you a good email and you have
