Tina Marie: Let's see. Oh, my God!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I'm hoping so. Um.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Tina Marie: Especially because it seemed to pick up. Last week I thought it had gone slower, but.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
mark sweet: It should be.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Tina Marie: For I don't know what I was thinking in my head. Um.

Dan Ryan: He had to figure out some automation whether it's possible or not. But. But he never really.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Dan Ryan: Confirmed or denied it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000

Tina Marie: Installed. Okay, so can you, do you want to reach out to him and get an update? Or what should we do to move this along.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Dan Ryan: Just said I just did that. I did.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, sorry! I'm. I missed that part. Dan. Sorry.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Dan Ryan: But I did it like 1st thing this morning.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Good.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Tina Marie: One, and then.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Dan Ryan: And I'm yeah. He has the data, too. So. It's partner.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Tina Marie: That's awesome. Alright!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Tina Marie: Um. Where did it go?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so. And this is for him to upload things.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Tina Marie: Solidify.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's supposed to back state.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Tina Marie: And go over there.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Dan Ryan: All the. Valiant leads. And then he was gonna write, or he.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Dan Ryan: He said he thought. He could do an automation that would then carry that over to the matter, because they're not connected.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Dan Ryan: But they would. I mean they can be. I guess. I don't know. I don't know how automation is working in there. Ah!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Dan Ryan: So, yeah. And then.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Dan Ryan: Then it'll be done, and then I made sure I. I didn't ask this before asked it this morning. I was like.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Dan Ryan: We set it up so that the States are populating. But I've asked him to confirm that. That's what he's seeing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Tina Marie: Okay. See.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Tina Marie: Don't want that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
mark sweet: Then, on tracking, were we able to send over to quantify the data they wanted.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Dan Ryan: Eric's building that. It's a little weird, but we can do it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
mark sweet: Okay. While he's working on. Quantify.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Dan Ryan: Mhm.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
mark sweet: One of the fields is not coming over, which is the description.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
mark sweet: So if we can. Pull that over as well. That'd be awesome.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Dan Ryan: Alright, cool.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
mark sweet: And they seem to be doing what they're supposed to be doing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Dan Ryan: It's Bob. Or it never came across.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
mark sweet: It never come across.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
mark sweet: It's there. It's like one of the fields, but it just never come across.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. I'm just trying to get my notes done.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Dan Ryan: Of. I guess we already have a blank install board press for winter. It's free. So yeah, that'll definitely be going up today.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Tina Marie: Have you?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Dan Ryan: I don't know.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Tina Marie: Can we see the latest updates from Greg.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Dan Ryan: No, he asked some questions, and then he was like, he doesn't. Do partial things.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Dan Ryan: So he's like, what do you. So there was like a lot of content in that, doc. So I removed a bunch, and he's like, I don't know which. What am I doing? And I was like, Oh, shit! And then I so I.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Dan Ryan: Got Mark put a bunch of stuff, and I was like. I.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Dan Ryan: Move stuff to the bottom. I was like, just ignore. This, and then he had some questions about your notes, and I was like.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Dan Ryan: Make of them what you will, Greg. It's like, let me dazzle me.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Alright!

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Tina Marie: So. We can't use get paid, not played right.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
mark sweet: I mean, we can. We just don't have that website.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:21.000
mark sweet: So theoretically we can still post it up, and then I can go ahead and get both things trademarked. Theoretically from there. I can then try to actually take over the domain, and saying that they're in infringing on my trademark.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
mark sweet: Because I. Got it done before they got it done, and then me actually able to hostily take over their website.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. That'll take forever.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
mark sweet: It'll take forever.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
mark sweet: But concern. These people have had this web page for 20 years and haven't done anything with it.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I mean, but there are other top level domains you can get.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Tina Marie: That are like that's.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
mark sweet: Or we could do like you said, just have the you in front of it, and it's fine.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
mark sweet: So that'll probably what we do, you know. Just be simple.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean, there were all kinds of different variations, like, whether it be. Law, or.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Tina Marie: Pi or whatever attached to the domain. And then there's just the different level domains domain names like. Whatever. There's a ton of top level domain extensions.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Tina Marie: That you can use. That are all inexpensive.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Tina Marie: Just kind of like dominate all the SEO, for it doesn't matter if it's not um.com. There's a little level with that and trust. But there's a lot of things that you can do to mitigate low trust issues with.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Tina Marie: Certifications and things like that. Hello!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
mark sweet: Yep, I'm here.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Tina Marie: Okay. No comments. We've got it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. Let's see. Second voice tracking.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Tina Marie: Deployed. Version. History is gone.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Tina Marie: But it was all in slack. So what's what's.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
mark sweet: We're up a hundred 81,000. So that's good.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Tina Marie: 1, 25. To. For during what time, period.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
mark sweet: Since the beginning of March.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Tina Marie: So my thought that that could well, now, that's um, not your fees, though. Right.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
mark sweet: Yeah, it should be about an extra 63,000 of fees.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Tina Marie: Well. 2 weeks ago. No, that was almost a month ago, like, Oh, I don't know when I updated it. March was 34,000 is what you told me before.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Tina Marie: So about 60 what 1,000 piece?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
mark sweet: 63.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Tina Marie: 63. 3.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Tina Marie: That's some good growth.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:09.000
mark sweet: Then we cut a deal with Walker to get a guaranteed number of leads, because they've just been kind of up and down. Bad news is gonna cost us a little more per lead, but.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Dan Ryan: 4.th

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
mark sweet: I know. Uh! We do get some guaranteed.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
mark sweet: Commercial cases in there, but. Minimum. 35 leads in New Mexico and Arizona.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
mark sweet: So that should help those 2 States grow. New Mexico is going pretty well, so I want to keep growing.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: So what is that costing you.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
mark sweet: Um. Let's see.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
mark sweet: I mean they were gonna raise their prices, no matter what, just as kind of an fyi. Uh.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
mark sweet: 2,100. A lead in Arizona guaranteed 50 leads a month. And 1,100. New Mexico guaranteed 50 leads a month.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
mark sweet: With 4 comped truck leads.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Tina Marie: 1,100. Huh!

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
mark sweet: I didn't want to do the same with Washington because Washington, their leads quality has been all over the place, and. Held off on Missouri, because.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
mark sweet: I. I don't love Missouri.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:29.000
mark sweet: Um, we're definitely promised something that isn't coming true there, and I'm not thrilled about it. Oh, you're supposed to get all these doctor referrals, and I think we've gotten like.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Tina Marie: What system.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
mark sweet: Too, and I've spent a lot of money generating kiss for them, and we're not seeing much of anything. Coming back.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Tina Marie: Let's get back to that in a second. Um! What were the lead costs for Arizona?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
mark sweet: 2,100.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Tina Marie: Ooh. Twice the.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
mark sweet: No.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Tina Marie: For New Mexico. Almost you said 1,100.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
mark sweet: No, new Mexico is 1,100.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Tina Marie: Right. And 2,100 for Arizona.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Tina Marie: Which is almost twice.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
mark sweet: Arizona right now is 1750.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Tina Marie: I met twice of New Mexico.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, no, that's kind of in the case. New Mexico was 900 before this.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Oh. Wow is that are the case values that much different for you? Or is it just for them.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000
mark sweet: It's then more about the compensation levels of advertising in those dates. It's a lot. It's a lot easier to generate in New Mexico than it is Arizona.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Tina Marie: You know.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
mark sweet: Generally speaking.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tina Marie: Got it. Um.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Tina Marie: I am going to have to take my daughter to school. She's having kind of a rough day, so I'm still going to be here on the call, talking, but driving for just a few minutes.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Tina Marie: Um so hopefully we can have a conversation that I don't have to be looking at the screen. But um. There's a few.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
mark sweet: So I'm sharing my screen right now. Do you see it.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Tina Marie: Thanks. Smart. I like it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
mark sweet: And.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Tina Marie: No. Um.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Tina Marie: No, because I usually am working from my task list. That is on my screen.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Tina Marie: Let's see. Legalzoom.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Tina Marie: Not doing this until you get the sites intake team. Well, so a couple of things I want to talk about call control training.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Tina Marie: Where that's going. Um. You didn't really like you told me where we're at for the month with.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Tina Marie: A second voice, but not um. If your.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Tina Marie: Like. Going back and getting that historical data and organizing it.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I'm kind of just moving forward.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Tina Marie: So. Let me guess it's a pain in the ass to go get the data.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
mark sweet: Uh, no, I just am not a thousand percent sure. How to pull it all. Now, at this point.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Tina Marie: I'm.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
mark sweet: But the. It's.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
mark sweet: There's some I can pull. Not all of it. I think some of it I can pull. But.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
mark sweet: I don't know how much, so I kind of just said, let's just keep moving forward with it, and then in 2 or 3 months we'll have a much better idea.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Tina Marie: Okay. I mean, I would want to know exactly what that did, and I would want to use that to motivate the attorneys, to let them know what it's putting in their pockets so that they would continue to do it, but also maybe do a better job. Not that they're doing a bad job, but.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Tina Marie: When people understand what the numbers are, it changes the energy which changes the way that they do things and tends to have an improvement. And.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Tina Marie: You could. I bet most of them know what cases they second voiced on. So if you just said, You know, which cases did you do give me a list. Then you go into those cases. You go look at the notes, and it should be there, and if you can delegate that to somebody delegate it to it, get the raw data.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Tina Marie: Someone. Use AI to formulate everything if that's too much of a pain in the butt. But it really shouldn't take that much time.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Tina Marie: To find out that you potentially added, you know, half a million to an extra 1 million in. Fees for as long as you've been doing it.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Tina Marie: And what does that translate to? You know what went in their pockets.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
mark sweet: Look, they're they're in it right now. They like doing it. It's not a matter of convincing them anymore.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, but we should have the numbers, I'm just saying. But.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah. I don't.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tina Marie: Dead horse. Beaten can't be more dead. So.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
mark sweet: No, you run it over like 3 times.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. I know.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Tina Marie: Stupid things pissing me off. It's in my way. Anyway.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
mark sweet: Gonna tape it to your head at this point.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Tina Marie: Call control training. Something else that you're not getting done very quickly. How's that going.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah. No, very, very, very poorly.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, why is that.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
mark sweet: Uh mostly me.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Tina Marie: Hold on while I pick my job off the chat.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
mark sweet: Yeah, I know.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Tina Marie: Um. Okay, so any movement on it whatsoever.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
mark sweet: Uh, I fed a bunch of recordings to chat gpt. To have it give.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
mark sweet: Coaching, I guess, for lack of better term, so I give it parameters of what it's looking for.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Tina Marie: I thought we weren't allowed to use Chat Gpt. I thought that it violated, or even record calls, because I thought it violated privacy.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.000
mark sweet: We can record intake calls because we're telling them we're recording intake calls, can't record the calls internally.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Dan Ryan: Before. With a lawyer.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: Oh, insects. Okay.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
mark sweet: I know it's a it's a distinction without a difference to some level.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Tina Marie: No, I get it because it's before the contract, and before they become clients, and before. Whatever privilege, I guess, comes into play. But.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
mark sweet: That's some level. And then, like, even if that's discovered, it's fine, because it's still in the initial consultation phase. So we still don't. Know everything.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
mark sweet: If that makes sense.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Tina Marie: It. It does um, so.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
mark sweet: It's stupid. Yeah.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Tina Marie: No, it's it's not. I get it. But you. You do also have people on your attorney teams that need call control training. One thing Lorenz is doing, though, is some role playing.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Tina Marie: And it's actually helped them. I don't know, though, like I'm only talking to Lorenz, and you have the all these other attorneys, and there's no way.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Dan Ryan: Outsource outsource. You just made 60 more grand. Outsource.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
mark sweet: Out outsource. What.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Tina Marie: It can't be.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, whatever it is, whatever needs to be done.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Tina Marie: Call control training is what needs to be done.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Dan Ryan: Work. Whatever your drop, right? So it's the whole principle of like strategic delegation. Right? It's like, okay, this is something.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Dan Ryan: I don't need it like not your zone of genius per se. You need to be involved, but you're like I should go.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Dan Ryan: Outsource, that. To someone that's like that's their goal. Goal is to get that done.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Tina Marie: Well, what needs to get done is these. There are, um, certain types of conversations.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Tina Marie: Hold on a sec. I dealt with this dork.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Tina Marie: And get me to school. That.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Tina Marie: Certain people have at least on Lorenz's team. The um.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Tina Marie: You know, there's like certain personalities that they struggle with. Handling well.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Tina Marie: And the calls go all over the place, either because they're. Oh, my! Gosh!

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Tina Marie: Being overpowered. Um being like.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Tina Marie: Not respected their authority. They're not happy with this thing, that thing, whatever, or they're just lonely. Either way, it's time that's getting eaten up, because.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Tina Marie: People, you guys can still hear me. Right?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Dan Ryan: Yep.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Cuts.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Tina Marie: Maneuver. In the call.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Tina Marie: To get progress, and so it goes in circles. Those hours add up. And.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Tina Marie: Um. It also depletes energy. Anytime people have to deal with. A call that is not going well, and then takes too long.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tina Marie: It spills into product. Activity in the rest of the day.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Tina Marie: So. By.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Tina Marie: Helping those skills. And I'll tell you that. It's a.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Tina Marie: Percentage of improvement. You can't completely change a person's ability. You can improve it, but they're still going to have.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Tina Marie: Some struggles. But in my experience is, if you have somebody who is trainable.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. There's 2 things that happen. 1st of all. The the time it takes to handle the calls does reduce.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Tina Marie: Um. And.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Tina Marie: The stress levels. Of the people who went through the call control call control training reduces as well.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Tina Marie: Because. Not only um did they figure out how to not spend so much time.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Tina Marie: With these people. They!

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tina Marie: That that stressed them out right, which is why the calls go all over the place. But.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Tina Marie: They don't feel so bad about it, because they were trained to do it. Somebody will have, you know, approved it. Listen to the calls and go. Yep.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Tina Marie: That's right. You handled that right. And so it creates that validation because. The the characteristic and the trait that shows up that makes those call issues even exist. In the 1st place.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tina Marie: Doesn't exist inside of a bubble inside of sweet law inside of the. Conversations they're having. It's an issue that they have with all people in their lives.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Tina Marie: So it's literally life changing for them. And it begins to have, like a lot of things. This cumulative effect.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Tina Marie: That makes your people stronger and more confident. So not everybody is going to need it and benefit from it. But the ones that do.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Tina Marie: It. It will be profound, so. It's worth not dragging your feet and going and finding the solution that can do that.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Tina Marie: Getting feedback from Chat Gpt is a start. But.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Tina Marie: Um hiring an expert who not only can. Analyze the call, but know what to say to this person, and.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Tina Marie: Um read how the the. Information is being received in real time, when they do.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Tina Marie: Give the coaching. You know you can't get that from AI.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Dan Ryan: Dare I ask this question. Because I already know the answer.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Dan Ryan: Is this call control happening in the context of everyone using the same script.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Tina Marie: Well, 1st of all, there's not really a script for.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000
mark sweet: Theoretically. No, we've been working on the script, remember, we went back and forth, and we got a script.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Right for intake, but but not for.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Tina Marie: Um all calls for the attorneys by Bell loving.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
mark sweet: No, not not for all the answers. No, we're just an intake.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Tina Marie: Right so. But I'm saying.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Dan Ryan: Who needs call control.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tina Marie: Unique call control training throughout. What?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Dan Ryan: Who needs it. The lawyers or the intake.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
mark sweet: Move.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Tina Marie: Ah! Both. Not not necessarily the lawyers, but their teams, because they're on calls with.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Tina Marie: With. They're on calls, with with insurance companies. With doctors, with people.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Tina Marie: And some of these calls can get long and tedious. And unnecessarily so.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Tina Marie: Detrimentally, so.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Dan Ryan: So then my. Right. So then my question would be.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Dan Ryan: In what categories does this occur. Is it with the doctors?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Tina Marie: Different ones, for different people.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Dan Ryan: No no no like. If.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Dan Ryan: It probably shows up in a certain avatar like it's predominantly in. Clients, or it's predominantly in.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Tina Marie: No, it's not predominant in clients. So what it is more predominant in is um.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Dan Ryan: Talk.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes, so I'll give you an example, and I don't remember if it's Jessica. But I think it's Jessica struggles with. People that um think that she's too young and and basically treat her like.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tina Marie: They just plow right over her. And men uh.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Tina Marie: Hispanic men. Um that she struggles with just, you know, not respecting her authority.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Tina Marie: And just. Basically kind of.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Tina Marie: And I don't have the example, so I have to give it to you from Lorenzo's perspective. So it's 3.rd

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Tina Marie: Right. But but yeah, there, there are certain avatars do. Are you going to go. Or just stand there all day.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Tina Marie: Sorry. Anyway.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Dan Ryan: Because my question would be if it's. Where is it happening? Right? So like, let's say it's happening.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Dan Ryan: In the the initial call, like it happens a bunch, because. You know, these Dick guys call, and then they're whatever.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Dan Ryan: If you're following a script. Right. And then I wonder how many, how much time is being wasted by, because it's all I heard.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Dan Ryan: I was like, oh, my God! You should not even be talking to this person! This call should already be over. Because it's literally going nowhere. This person cannot be a client.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Dan Ryan: Ever. But because there's no script they're entertaining phone calls that shouldn't go on. So I'm like.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Dan Ryan: If you're if they need call control and a call that should be over. That's a problem. But that problem is solved by a script. First.st

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Dan Ryan: Then call control right. But if. If you're trying to control a call that has no script in that scenario, it's sort of.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Dan Ryan: Not. Like you're still gonna be on the call. It should be.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Dan Ryan: End, the call. Sorry there's no injury. We can't help you.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Dan Ryan: Click.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I get what you're saying. But it's kind of not really realistic to try to script out every type of phone call that they have to have, and that they potentially have issues with.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Dan Ryan: I don't. Wanna. That's not what I want to do. I want to know where the control needs to happen. There's no way it's with.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Dan Ryan: All the doctors. Right? So it could be. The insurance companies.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Dan Ryan: But like, where is it? Really? It's like, Oh, I have.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tina Marie: It. It's not really like that. It's it's more um talking about certain specific types of dynamics, right? So if the call goes off, grid off off the rails. Here's how you get it back.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Tina Marie: It's more like that. It's not a.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Dan Ryan: I know but what. But what call.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Tina Marie: What?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Dan Ryan: But what call is it.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Um! This is not a helpful conversation.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Dan Ryan: They're like. Oh, you know what I mean.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Dan Ryan: It's very helpful, because.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tina Marie: We don't. We're not thinking about it the same way, because I'm trying to distill this from. Years of experience in a call center, managing hundreds of people and getting those types of results. And and so.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Tina Marie: Like the way that you're looking at it and approaching about it doesn't even make sense to me. It kind of does. But like. You're asked.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Tina Marie: To me. You're asking the wrong questions, and I don't. I don't know what to do with that.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Dan Ryan: Okay? So you put it in the context of your call center. Were they dealing with 5 different types of calls.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Tina Marie: No, that's the thing. It was much more streamlined there.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Dan Ryan: That's the thing. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Dan Ryan: These guys are dealing.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay. But it's still not an issue. All they need to learn how to do is get a call back on track, and there's a few types of things they can learn there's a skip. Okay, alright, let's.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Dan Ryan: They don't.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Tina Marie: Move on, then.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Dan Ryan: You know what I mean? Like if they if they're on a if they're on an intake, call that they shouldn't be on, why would they get it back on track? There is no track.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Tina Marie: Not really. There is a track. Get off the call. That's still a track. You don't just hang up on people, Dan.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Dan Ryan: The correct. No, there isn't.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Dan Ryan: Right. Right, but the track is the whether that calls on or off the track.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Tina Marie: You have to have. Picture.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Tina Marie: Off the.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Dan Ryan: Determined by the script.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Tina Marie: Whether the call.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Dan Ryan: Is on a track or off a track is determined by the script. The 1st thing you're trying to figure out is. Should this call continue.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Dan Ryan: On a track. No.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tina Marie: Are you gonna make the scripts.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Dan Ryan: I already did.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Tina Marie: For the attorneys and for everything else, because I'm trying to address all of that.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Dan Ryan: No, you said it was mostly with intake.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So my point is, we should hire experts in this because you're not that. And I'm not that.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Dan Ryan: With the teams.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Tina Marie: And we don't have access to the people. So, Mark, do you want to have this conversation and move it forward? Or should we just move on to something else?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
mark sweet: I need to find the right. Training group. And it's.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. Office.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
mark sweet: Difficult.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Tina Marie: Gosh! Right. So that's the same conversation we've been having for like 6, 7, 8, 9 months, whatever.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
mark sweet: But yeah. Correct.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tina Marie: So I'm just trying to see. Should I keep bringing it up, or should I let it go? I'm telling you it's costing you money. You will get back if you do it.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Tina Marie: And you get expert help. But.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Tina Marie: You're the one that has to find it and make it happen. So. I don't know like that's.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
mark sweet: The last one that I thought I found that was good was not good.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so what's next?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
mark sweet: Another, one.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Tina Marie: And what will you do about it? And when will you do it?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
mark sweet: Uh! I got a call on Thursday this week with another one.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
mark sweet: So. I'm hoping they're better, but.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
mark sweet: No, we'll see.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
mark sweet: I'm hoping better. I don't know what else to say. Like. They seem to bear. They've worked with law firms before.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
mark sweet: They do a lot more legal work. I'm hoping it's better they do some other stuff of like. Let us do your intake, and I'm like, no, I don't want you to do my intake, which always worries me.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Tina Marie: But.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
mark sweet: So a lot of these places like we can do it. We can do it. I'm like, that's not what I'm trying to do here.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Tina Marie: Right. Right.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
mark sweet: Um. So it's.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Dan Ryan: Right? Like, it's a means to an end. They're like, we really want to take over your intake. You're like, yeah, but that's not what I really want.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
mark sweet: Right. So that's unfortunately a lot of what I've been running into.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
mark sweet: So I'll get on it, and we'll start. And then it's like here. No, here we can solve it. Just have us do all of it, and it's like it's.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tina Marie: Right, no.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
mark sweet: No. So.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
mark sweet: I apologize that I probably haven't told you as much frustration as I've had in that matter. But.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
mark sweet: It's been a wall that I've run into at least 7 different times.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, that's.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tina Marie: Helpful. I'm just look. We have.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Tina Marie: Kind of a specific strategy that we're working on, which is. Get more out of what you have.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Tina Marie: So that we can improve the margins. Um improve what you're making.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Tina Marie: Right, even. Even if we. We've got all these different avenues, and we can't control any of them. But we can influence all of them.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Tina Marie: Leads coming in. Conversion, rate.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Tina Marie: Um price of what we're paying for the leads. Massaging all of that right, the vendors, and how well we perform with what comes in.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Tina Marie: And inside of that. We've got intake, but we've also got the attorney team.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Tina Marie: Not just. Um how we get a matter in, but once it's in.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Tina Marie: How fast do we process it and get paid? How much do we get paid? All of those things.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tina Marie: Have nuance and components inside of them. So to get the most out of the least. We have to find those leverage points.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: And work them. There aren't a lot of them.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Tina Marie: And. So we have to do what we can.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Tina Marie: With the ones that we do find. And identify.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Tina Marie: So that's why I'm like a dog with a bone here trying to. Figure out!

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Tina Marie: You know, how? How do we make this happen? Because I know, and I've seen it historically, that there's improvement. You could even ask Lorenz, with a little bit of coaching that he's tried to do.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Tina Marie: Um, what kind of an impact it makes. And it's measurable.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Tina Marie: So. Um.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Tina Marie: I realize it's not a fast thing getting. Expert consulting for anything or results.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: In your team, even just hiring people. None of this is easy. But that's why we have to have the conversation consistently.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Tina Marie: Because number one, it's too easy to forget. And 2. If there's no momentum, there's no momentum, there's no change. So.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Tina Marie: You know um, but. Having a clear conversation and you reporting back real detail.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Tina Marie: Not just. Yeah, I dropped the ball like that. Really.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Tina Marie: If if it's that you had conversations, and you got stonewalled or. They tried to pivot you somewhere else, and it was just kind of useless, like.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Tina Marie: That's real information that I understand. But just. That nothing happened when that's not exactly what it was is different. You know what I mean.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Tina Marie: So. Anyway.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Tina Marie: Alright. I'm back in front of the. Screen.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Tina Marie: I mean, forgive me. I just really want to see the growth. And.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Tina Marie: You. Tend to keep the same people. For the most part we've got some come and go, but.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Tina Marie: If we can improve. Their value.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Tina Marie: And skill, level and. What kind of results they can get in any given day.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Tina Marie: Knowing that there aren't going to be more hours in the week and more days. In the week.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Tina Marie: We have to get more out of what time is being spent. You know what I mean.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.000
mark sweet: Mhm.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Tina Marie: Let's see. We already talked about that.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Tina Marie: Working on that. It's not worth talking about. Colorado.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Tina Marie: How is that going.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
mark sweet: Colorado.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000
mark sweet: Um. We finally got the Um retainer agreement back. So we're just adding a couple of other things that we need to. It. So we have to.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
mark sweet: Go call some other firms to see what they send in their packages. But otherwise we're pretty much ready to go. So.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
mark sweet: My goal is to have it ready by the end of the week. Um. It should be here like we just need to get.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
mark sweet: Let's say, a couple other sheets of things like designations and and very state specific things. So we can do what we need to do.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:52.000
mark sweet: And then I kinda know a law firm in Colorado, so probably gonna go out and visit with him and have lunch with him uh, hopefully. In the next 2 weeks. And pick his brain a little bit and send him some of our lower end cases and.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
mark sweet: At least have someone. We can bounce ideas off of.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. One. Sec.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
mark sweet: But they should add another 10 to 20 cases a month.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Tina Marie: I mean, that would be great.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
mark sweet: Had to think. Because right now.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
mark sweet: We consistently. We need to be over a hundred. It looks like we should get there this month. But the last 2 months we haven't.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Dan Ryan: Otherwise.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
mark sweet: Otherwise I don't know how we get to 150. Consistently.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Dan Ryan: Oh! Like that.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Dan Ryan: But there's. You just don't like. It is what you're saying.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
mark sweet: Uh, that's I mean, that's warm.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Dan Ryan: Which book. But I'm like, is there a decremental.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Tina Marie: More bigger, faster.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
mark sweet: No, I mean part of this is right. If I'm. Giving the teams goals that they need to hit.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
mark sweet: They do need a raw material to be able to make it happen. And so if they're getting a hundred people a month.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000
mark sweet: They shouldn't have a problem hitting the goals that I'm giving them. But if they have less than that. It is going to be an issue for them to to try to hit, and that's not fair to them.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Dan Ryan: Is that because the goals were not. Set, fairly.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Dan Ryan: Like. Mathematically, speaking.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
mark sweet: Not because the number of cases that they're getting are a lot higher. Like the goal before, was.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Dan Ryan: No, no! What I'm saying is like it's is, though, are those goals based on. Lead, flow, basically.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Dan Ryan: And convert, like all that good shit.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
mark sweet: Yes. So it's based on our average attorney fee.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
mark sweet: And then we know it's gonna take an average of 9, 10 months to pay out. So even if tomorrow, we automatically increase to 150 cases a month.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
mark sweet: The goals aren't gonna change for a little while, because. Has to catch up right.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Dan Ryan: So they're not based on. Lead, flow.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
mark sweet: They are, and they aren't so.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, right? Right? No, it's not like.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
mark sweet: It it starts that way.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Dan Ryan: Intrins. Yeah, I got you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000
mark sweet: Sure. So again, if we're now consistent, let's say at a hundred 50 leads in.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
mark sweet: What is it? The end of this year, basically, or early next year? The goals are going to go up again because they have more than enough to hit that.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Dan Ryan: Well, then. For you, not for them.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Dan Ryan: Shouldn't it be that you're saying if I'm setting this goal for them, then my goal as lead? God. Right.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Dan Ryan: Is to. I need to make sure that these amount of leads are happening by X, so that when I tell them they need to do y in the future. It is possible, right? So you can almost.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Dan Ryan: Predict, like a work backwards to your, to an internal goal, or to like a you know, a. Executive goal, whatever the hell you want to call it, right, not a goal that you're broadcasting to them. You're like, I need to do this so that they can do that.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
mark sweet: No, that that's what we're doing. So as long as we're at.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Dan Ryan: I'm like, have you done that?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
mark sweet: 100. Yeah.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
mark sweet: That's because that's also where the goals come from when people were. It's like this is why.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:08.000
mark sweet: Our attorney fees over 15. Grand. But let's just take 15, grand as an easy number without drop, you know. Drops and sub outs fine. 15 grand times a hundred cases is 1.5 million. It's very easy math, right?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Mhm.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
mark sweet: So your goal is only 1.4. There's a hundred $1,000 of extra.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:25.000
mark sweet: Not to mention your number should be higher than that. So this is not a unreasonable goal. I'm not asking you to do 2.5 on what you have, which is just not realistic, right?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Dan Ryan: No, I get that I'm saying. Are you saying to Mark. Right.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Dan Ryan: Do you speak to yourself in the 3rd person?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
mark sweet: Who's that guy?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, do you say to Mark, Hey, Mark. We need to be consistently at.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Dan Ryan: 110 retainers by the end of July, and in order to do that. The total amount of leads, good leads.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Dan Ryan: Or whatever, not, not necessarily good leads, but you know. Needs to be at.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Dan Ryan: You know, if I need to be at Y by the end of July, then I need to be at X by the end of June. Like, if you map that out.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
mark sweet: Yes. But my problem is this.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
mark sweet: Each lead source is so massively different.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000
mark sweet: So it's I wish it was. I just know I need. You know, 10 leads to get one case right. That'd be awesome, except we're so far all over the place. For month to month.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Dan Ryan: Right. That's why you just did the deal with Walker. You're like, all right, but I can do this to move me towards that.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
mark sweet: Racks because it's been relatively consistent.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Okay.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Dan Ryan: I got it.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:32.000
mark sweet: And I wanna go to Arizona we've got, you know, Hank there or not. Hank. Uh, we got Lorenz there. John there and uh Liz there. So we have like physical boots on the ground. So I want to grow that.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Dan Ryan: Yep.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000
mark sweet: And then Mexico has been relatively cheap by, you know, getting case, and we're getting decent money out of them. So let's just keep that going.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Dan Ryan: Got it.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
mark sweet: And then to like what Tina's point was. I'm gonna keep trying to crank up. Quantify as much as I can.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
mark sweet: And I'm hoping at some point. Dan's gonna be able to generate, you know.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
mark sweet: More lead than all these people put together.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Dan Ryan: Something. Yeah. Totally.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Dan Ryan: I can tell you right now. The word reports. Plural, bad word.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Dan Ryan: Spend money on that. Because I've learned that.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Tina Marie: Oh, I was so confused for a minute. But I realized, you're like talking about, okay, yeah.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Dan Ryan: It's hilarious.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
mark sweet: And then. The next big goal is gonna be to launch a traditional campaign. But I'm a little.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
mark sweet: Cautious about it, since they went so badly with the radio campaign.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: Oh, what about that city lifestyle, big winner?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Dan Ryan: Over. The new brand.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, I think sucks. Um.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
mark sweet: The stock of favor, whatever.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
mark sweet: That Thompson rooters thing we need to make sure we're getting some value out of. But we'll see.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Tina Marie: Ah! I wanted to check, litify, and look at some things, but.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that's a dud, too. Right?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
mark sweet: Um, I mean, I would like to have them have their own landing page. So I can just show them how much they suck.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Dan Ryan: Sure.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
mark sweet: Can we do that?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, that's right, and they couldn't give us an example of a good one.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
mark sweet: Right. But I'm saying, if we have traffic delivered to a specific landing page for them.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, we have have a landing page. We can. Uh, we can repurpose one.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
mark sweet: Okay, let's do that.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Dan Ryan: I'll dig that up.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
mark sweet: Great.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Tina Marie: Repurpose! What.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Dan Ryan: There's a landing page that I made and optimized back with tier 11 that's on the site. And it it did work for them so, and it was optimized. Um.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Tina Marie: You went Boston for a second when you said on. Just tell me.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I noticed, um.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Dan Ryan: I was talking about a Boston based company. Obviously, that happens. Um.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Tina Marie: Uh.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Dan Ryan: But I'll find that I'll dig that up. That's on the site, and then we can just uh give it to. To.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Dan Ryan: Thompson, Reuters.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
mark sweet: Okay? Cool. Cause. Yeah, they're taking a good chunk of money.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
mark sweet: So I need to make sure I'm getting some kind of result from it, and if not, to be able to shove it in their face to make them give me results.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And then we have a landing page. Be like, Hey, we use this with another traffic source worked, and then we can tweak it if they need it.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
mark sweet: Okay.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Dan Ryan: And it's got all the. I think it's got all the stuff set. It's got like Vw. And all that stuff set up.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
mark sweet: And we can make sure it comes through as fl as the lead source. But that's about it.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Dan Ryan: We can do that.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
mark sweet: Okay. Good um cause. That'll help, I'm thinking, traditional.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
mark sweet: Maybe Arizona, I mean, it's a super competitive market, but. Tucson. I gotta feel it's not as expensive, and we do have Lawrence. There.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
mark sweet: Also, I just think it's like, make Lorenzo feel good tool if he sees his face on a billboard everywhere he goes.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Tina Marie: Oh no!

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Dan Ryan: Not a problem.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Tina Marie: Uh, he's definitely starting to feel more confident, though, and being less stressed about everything.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
mark sweet: He doesn't feel like he's gonna get fired.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Tina Marie: Now.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
mark sweet: That's good. That was still funny when that happened.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my gosh! We just talked about this last week, and just the fact that he could handle it, and I could see him not be like shrinking, literally. Viscerally just inside of himself. No, he he's actually.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Tina Marie: Like he sees his value, and he feels like his value is seen, and he is. Working consistently at improving it and increasing it, which seems to be.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Tina Marie: Showing up in the stats, so. Yeah, he.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Tina Marie: But I don't think he's ever felt confident before. So that is a massive win.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Tina Marie: I? Obviously you had a huge part in that, though. Cause um. But but I had to point it out to him like.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Tina Marie: I'm like. How many people do, you know, have just been fired, Bar Mark, and just like.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Tina Marie: When he'll talk about. Yeah. But Mark will yell about this and get mad about this. I'm like, Okay, well, what else does Mark do like. Well, if I need help at 10 o'clock at night, and I've got a question he's there, and he's being really helpful. I'm like, Yeah, does everybody do that, Lawrence? No. No. So anyway, it's kind of a whole big thing. But yeah, but but that's huge. When people stop just.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Tina Marie: Being afraid. So whatever else you're thinking about for. Growing there, growing him.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Tina Marie: I don't know, like I don't know how comfortable he'd be with that, but. Arizona is a.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. You don't have another attorney.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
mark sweet: I don't.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Tina Marie: But it.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
mark sweet: And I think it'll still be way cheaper than California.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Tina Marie: But that's what I was going to say. I feel like Arizona is a leverage point that we could be working a little bit more. Just that you do have that bottleneck of attorneys that can work on it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Tina Marie: Um, but.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Ah!

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Tina Marie: I mean, that's more to explore, because we've we've gotten through our list of tasks. So we could.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
mark sweet: But I wanna make sure that before we start doing advertising we at least get our trademark thing approved which will take time.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:03.000
mark sweet: Because I know as soon as we get it up, people are gonna SEO around it to try to steal the thunder from it. So I just wanna get ahead of it as much as I can, because it's. Something. Almost every law firm says.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:11.000
mark sweet: Um. And so it wouldn't be hard for them. Just do Ppc around it. And I again, I don't want to spend money to market something that's just gonna.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
mark sweet: Blow up in the face, and not make me any money.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Tina Marie: Right. Yeah, for sure.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so order of operations, we know we gotta get that done. Um alright.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
mark sweet: But I am excited. Dan did it awesome job on the color of it, like I think it's definitely eye appealing.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Dan Ryan: That would break.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um, Dan, you had sent something to the Jd funnels, guy for Tona. Do you have an update on that.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Dan Ryan: No, I never got. Any of that stuff.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Tina Marie: Wait, what.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Dan Ryan: They said they would build it, but.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Tina Marie: My notes.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Dan Ryan: I was supposed to get like the intake, something like, Show me what the data looks like. But.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Tina Marie: For mark.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Dan Ryan: Someone someone named Mark. Never did that.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.000
mark sweet: Hello!

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, that dude.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
mark sweet: Hold on! I wanna make sure to this one.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
mark sweet: All right.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Dan Ryan: Or it could have been sent to me. And I went to down my email black holes, which happens occasionally.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Dan Ryan: More than I'm willing to.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Tina Marie: Admit.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Dan Ryan: Take it. I hate it! I hate it!

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Dan Ryan: Someone did it the other day. They're like dude. I sent it to you. I'm like you didn't.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Tina Marie: It's in.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Dan Ryan: There's no, I have no.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
mark sweet: Blue.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Dan Ryan: Permute.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Tina Marie: You're Pull Beach.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
mark sweet: I'm not. Email about it.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Tina Marie: That's funny. Neither is Dan. Just kidding.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Tina Marie: How puppy! Hi! Puppy.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.000
mark sweet: Um. Yeah, I don't see anything from you, Dan. Do you mind resending whatever you need? And I'll make sure that you wanna works on it? Then.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, I didn't say it was strictly from this phone call.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
mark sweet: Do you know.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Tina Marie: Oh! So! Yeah.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
mark sweet: Oh, okay.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Tina Marie: Maybe look for something from me. But um name, date of birth, demographics. You said you'd send it over. And I generally ask if you need a reminder. So.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Dan Ryan: And then like. And just like any sort of like form they filled out whether it's paper or online, like. So we.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:03.000
mark sweet: Uh. They don't fill out crap uh! But what they do have.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Dan Ryan: Or which. He get asked for them after the fact, like.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000
mark sweet: I'm gonna share. Tina. Do you think I should share the lien case dashboard? We already did it. Dan is already on this.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yes.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Dan Ryan: I don't even know what you're talking about.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
mark sweet: It's called chunk lien cases.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Yeah.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Dan Ryan: Huh!

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
mark sweet: Richard, and@dandcompany.com.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Tina Marie: Do you want us. Screen share.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Tina Marie: I I can open it and screen, share.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Dan Ryan: What what's it called.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Tina Marie: Tona, lean cases.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Dan Ryan: Show about.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
mark sweet: Call, no.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Dan Ryan: Don't know. Oh, yeah, I mean, but what is this.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Tina Marie: Everything that you asked for, basically. That's what they get.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Dan Ryan: As it were.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
mark sweet: If you look at the sweet James or the other lean, those are the 2. Main.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
mark sweet: Things. So they get like name, date of loss, date of birth.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Tina Marie: Data, of loss.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
mark sweet: Like when the collision happened.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Okay.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Dan Ryan: Alright, so let me look at this, and then I might have.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
mark sweet: You're gonna have follow up questions for sure.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Dan Ryan: Questions, yes. But you feel like this, is it?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:23.000
mark sweet: This is the easy things for me to get. The other stuff might be within their tepra system that I quite frankly don't have access to, and don't. Know anywhere near enough about.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000
mark sweet: Um. So I. I can't give you good answers. I just have one.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Dan Ryan: Then Jonah can be like oh, and we also have this or that, or whatever.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Tina Marie: If you give me a list of what you need after you look at this, then I can make that part of something I do on my call with Shona. Or tona, and mark that, we're on the same page.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Dan Ryan: Isn't this like. This is like, is this.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Dan Ryan: Would this be like the attorney view for lack of a better. Way of saying this.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Tina Marie: No, this is what they do internally to manage their calls and cases.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, so this is like a doctor view. And there's Doctor both both. Sort of views are represented in this data set.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
mark sweet: The doctor view is like the doctor. You dashboard, which is a super high, level numbers that aren't.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
mark sweet: Insanely helpful.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Dan Ryan: So like. Why is there no email address. But why doesn't.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
mark sweet: Um.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Tina Marie: That's in Tebra.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
mark sweet: Didn't.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. So it just is.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
mark sweet: If you just scroll down, because, like at the beginning, it definitely was not anywhere near as good as it is now.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
mark sweet: You see that there's a lot more email addresses in it now.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Tina Marie: Like row 1 0, 5, and later.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Dan Ryan: Good. Yeah.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
mark sweet: It's just the beginning that was just trying to doing it on her own, and. It was.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
mark sweet: Bad.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Dan Ryan: Okay. And then she is manually entering this all in here.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
mark sweet: Uh, Maria is, yeah.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Dan Ryan: And where do they get it from? Email.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
mark sweet: Mhm. Generally cause. Like every law firm, emails differently to them.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
mark sweet: And it's not like a standardization. It's just. Can you see this patient, and then call and get the information from that patient.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Dan Ryan: And. So the only law firm here represented here is.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Dan Ryan: Sweet James.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
mark sweet: On that one. But if you go to the one that says other liens that's got the other law firms.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Dan Ryan: Law Firms. Ah, where?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
mark sweet: Just because this week James is their main client for lack of a better term.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Dan Ryan: Okay? So then, case manage. Name is the law firm name. Or partially so. We have.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
mark sweet: Uh, yeah. And again, we can have them put other things in there.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, we want like the law firm. I mean, I can sort of figure it out, but.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
mark sweet: Still, they can do it better.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, cause then it's like, if you could. Then you could start to say like, Show me the suite, I mean, maybe you can train the law firms. Maybe you can't, but you can start to see how their data is coming across. At least.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
mark sweet: Let's assume that we cannot train the law firms.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Dan Ryan: Alright. So then, this would be like the data picture. Let's say that.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
mark sweet: Cool. Yeah.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Dan Ryan: Then. What?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Dan Ryan: So then, once let's say this was in a Crm. Then Chona, or.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Dan Ryan: The doctor's office needs to be able to text them like them. What do they want to do after that?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
mark sweet: I think the Doctor office wants to be able to text them or money other appointments.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
mark sweet: And then making sure they send them their zoom link, or whatever link it is to have their appointment.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, these are all online.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
mark sweet: Um, not all of them, but the vast majority.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Dan Ryan: Okay.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Tina Marie: Unless there's a procedure for the most part right.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
mark sweet: Right procedure is different. The initials usually.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
mark sweet: Usually. Online, but.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:41.000
mark sweet: We can change priority tab to say online or in person. And we can always.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Dan Ryan: Is, the.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
mark sweet: Change some of the stuff around. If we need to.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Dan Ryan: Is there like um? Is like.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Dan Ryan: Getting. That is the goal to get that initial online thing done. And then that then they become like an a patient officially, is that like the 1st sort of gate that you want to get through.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:06.000
mark sweet: Yes, I think this is, and correct me if I'm wrong, Tina, this is their 1st game. This is where they put everything in. This is where they schedule the person.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
mark sweet: You can see, like someone's like, leave voicemail, or whatever else, or they missed the appointment.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000
mark sweet: So this is kind of the initial. And then from there. Then they're adding in the procedures or whatnot, you know. Um.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
mark sweet: Trying to find some way that they can track. What's happening.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Dan Ryan: So. If we were to look at this.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Dan Ryan: From like a pipeline perspective. It's. I mean, are these basically leads at this point, or like.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Dan Ryan: For lack of a better term. It's not like, oh, no, this is my patient. It's it's coming from the law firm. Are they all supposed to close or.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
mark sweet: They are all supposed to close.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Dan Ryan: They're like. Referrals that you have to. Then.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Dan Ryan: Officially convert into a patient. So they're not elite, all right. So there's 2 pipelines right there.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Tina Marie: Correct.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Dan Ryan: And then let's say they're a patient.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Tina Marie: When you say 2 pipelines, do you mean sweet James and other lanes like, what are you saying us to.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Dan Ryan: No, for like Jonah, it's like, Hey, so you would have. You probably wouldn't have like a. You wouldn't have.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Dan Ryan: Firm, specific pipelines you just have. Referred.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Dan Ryan: Right, and then the firm would be attached to the referred person. So. Comes in, and then the goal is the end of that. Pipeline is okay. The the schedule. They're scheduled.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Dan Ryan: And then the actual end of it would be. Okay, that it occurred.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Dan Ryan: The, the. Whatever the intake, I don't know what to call it.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Dan Ryan: Happened. Now they are something else.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Dan Ryan: Like whatever word they might use. So they're no longer referral. Now they're a patient, whatever. Um.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Dan Ryan: Then, once they're a patient. Is there yet another goal?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Dan Ryan: Right. It's so. One might be. Surgical one might not, whatever I got it.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Dan Ryan: So there's at least 2 pipelines. There could be 3. Alright!

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Dan Ryan: I can work with this.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: So does Mark need to send you anything or. Can you.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Dan Ryan: No, I just need to sort of. Look at it, and and then think through a little more and.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Dan Ryan: Um, I mean, ultimately, we would probably just build it in a. Like, who is this? This is Dr. What's his nuts?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
mark sweet: Dr. E.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Dan Ryan: To do.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Tina Marie: It's actually.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Dan Ryan: Your coach. Who's Dr. Reed.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Tina Marie: I'm just.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
mark sweet: You kind of like want those nuts a little better.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Dan Ryan: So we'd create a sub account. This is Chona and a doctor right?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:29.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Dan Ryan: What I'm looking at.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Dan Ryan: Alright!

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
mark sweet: We call it fast pain, doctor.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Dan Ryan: So we would create a sub. We'd create a doctor, E sub account. Just for this in leapf, lowy, and then.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Dan Ryan: Uh.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
mark sweet: This would be totally separate than my stuff.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, your, your own sub, account. Yeah.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Tina Marie: So Shona Shona's business is fast paying, Doc just. For help.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Tina Marie: Like that's her brand, not Dr. E. Right.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, and then uh. So Chona gets the emails from these law firms.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Dan Ryan: These. These initial contact, these initial referral emails.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Like, um. See if I can find.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Dan Ryan: And then is she. Using a a pain dot whatever that domain name.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:27.000
mark sweet: They'll be like. Good morning, my client, with like a consultation. Blah blah blah. Uh, here's a name date of birth phone number email like, that's generally what they get in some form or fashion. But it's not.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
mark sweet: Uh, consistent across every email.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, okay. All right.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Dan Ryan: I can work. Yeah, I'll have some questions. Let me just.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Dan Ryan: Absorb this. But I can send it to. I can send uh.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Dan Ryan: Some of this over to the Jd funnels, guys and be like, all right, here's sort of the initial. Data map.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Tina Marie: Do you need a reminder.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Dan Ryan: No.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
mark sweet: Do you need injections?

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Dan Ryan: Uh, it would depend on what it is.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Tina Marie: Uh-huh. What you got, Doc.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
mark sweet: Pay management. They got the intros.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Dan Ryan: No, I don't need cortis cortisol whatever. No.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Tina Marie: How are you doing after your wreck? By the way, like, are you like fully restored? Do you think.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah. Totally.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Tina Marie: Good. Alright. Well, you do have a call in 1 min.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Dan Ryan: I do?

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Dan Ryan: Alright cool. Alright, I can. Yeah.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Tina Marie: Good so, and they're usually pretty quick, right.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Dan Ryan: Cool, cool. Uh! Well, I just got a sort of.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Dan Ryan: I'm looking at some of this, and I'm like I'm not sure how to. Do that like.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Dan Ryan: The procedures thing. I gotta look at it. That might be a good use case for.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Dan Ryan: A custom bear like a custom. I can't think of the word. So there's some stuff, right? You know, high level or whatever it at its core. It's like a contact management thing.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Dan Ryan: Um. But then you have these cus the custom thing that I can't remember the name of, where it's a reusable component. I'm like, all right. That might be a use case for that, so that you're you're tapping into.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Dan Ryan: Procedures. A procedure can be applied to multiple contacts, because it's a certain thing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Dan Ryan: Just like multiple people could have a car. So you'd have a custom thing that does the car component. So I just gotta look at it from that perspective. There. The contact stuff is pretty clear.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Dan Ryan: A law firm. Maybe you could do like that, too. I I gotta. Look at that!

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Dan Ryan: But yeah.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Tina Marie: All right.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Dan Ryan: But this. If we were tracking this, we can put a large percentage increase on it all of a sudden boom.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Tina Marie: Uh, I am tracking it. As a matter of fact.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Dan Ryan: There you go. We're like 50%. Now.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Tina Marie: Alright, so. Today's 4, 21.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Tina Marie: I'll put my update in here. Oh, how about 50%? Damn.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Tina Marie: I don't know where you just pulling that number out of your butt, but.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Dan Ryan: Literally. That's exactly where I got it from.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Tina Marie: No. Dan has.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, 1! 0, 1! I gotta go.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay, bye. Take care.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Dan Ryan: Beautiful.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Tina Marie: Stuff. To Jd.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Tina Marie: Funnels. Guy.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Tina Marie: Do you have to go?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
mark sweet: I got 14 min.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tina Marie: Do you want to talk about your friend and Patrick, and all of that stuff.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
mark sweet: Uh yeah.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh!

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Tina Marie: I don't. I hate having conversations like that with just organizing everything. But anyway but it needs to be done.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
mark sweet: You.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tina Marie: Um. So.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tina Marie: It kind of depends on like. How you value or evaluate anything for the most part, like I.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Tina Marie: Focus. On!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Tina Marie: In. Obviously you don't. You're different than everybody. So my mark math is.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Tina Marie: Just. Pretty much like whatever you feel good with everybody else is pretty much hard and fast. This is. This would be the rate like.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Tina Marie: Starting last year with Fuji, now. Basically it's.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Tina Marie: 4,000 if they're paying, and it's 1 call an hour, and that's easy math for me. But this not so much so.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Tina Marie: For Patrick and Lorenz. It was. Combined 4,000 a month.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Tina Marie: So 2 each a month. But I still ended up.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Tina Marie: Showing up every week like working with just Loren. So time wise. There was no difference. But value wise. I wasn't doing anything with Patrick, since, like.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tina Marie: January. Basically, I think.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.000
mark sweet: Right.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Tina Marie: Um, so I don't know, you know, if you feel like. You didn't get what you did pay for, because you already paid for things.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Tina Marie: The invoice. Ah!

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Tina Marie: I don't remember when it was, but. Anyway, you're paid in advance. So there's that.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Tina Marie: Um. And then I know so so I don't really know how you want to do it like um.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Tina Marie: Hold on. I do need to check out when the invoices are, because that's relative. To the conversation to figure this out. One sec.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Tina Marie: It won't take long. Um. I feel like it was March. So.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, uh. The.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Tina Marie: End of March man. That wasn't very long ago. You'd think I'd know better. But I don't. Okay. So March paid through um. April, May, and then.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Tina Marie: It would come again in June. So.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Tina Marie: Um. If you did want, and I don't even know if your friend wants the gift right.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
mark sweet: I mean, who doesn't like gifts.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Tina Marie: Oh! I don't know um.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Tina Marie: So. What we.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Tina Marie: It depends on how you want to do it. So if I meet with her, it's a her right.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
mark sweet: It's him and her.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Tina Marie: Him and her. And we're meeting weekly, and it's just under what you already paid for.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Tina Marie: Lorenz and Patrick. Um. I'm having.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tina Marie: 2 calls a week instead for that same price. But. It's you. So.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Tina Marie: I would do that, and I would feel happy if you feel okay with um. That.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Tina Marie: Uh, that's not a full 90 days, though, so I don't know like what you would want to do. Moving forward.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Tina Marie: Um for. Where are we at? I mean, it's.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Tina Marie: Depends on how quick they start. But it's basically. Or you could just do 60 days if you wanted to give them that and see what they think.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Tina Marie: Um.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah, we'll do that. I think people are gonna get hooked after they do like 2 or 3. Like one. You're not hooked quite yet.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
mark sweet: I think 2 or 3. You're pretty well hooked.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Tina Marie: I'm just gonna take that as a compliment. Thank you.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
mark sweet: No, I mean it's the truth.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Tina Marie: Um. So we could do that, and.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Tina Marie: It would be amazing if that did turn into something that they wanted to do, because then I'm dropping down. $2,000 a month when it's already not enough for me, which is not your problem.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tina Marie: But that's just how.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
mark sweet: But the hope is, once they get started and they like it, and they're in, and then it goes.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Tina Marie: And I'm definitely gonna work work as hard as I can to make that happen.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Tina Marie: So, so, then. Regardless.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Tina Marie: If if you're happy with that sorry my blood sugar is just going bloop right now.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
mark sweet: Okay.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Tina Marie: Um. But.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Tina Marie: Then. The June invoice for Lorenz. We just.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Tina Marie: It would just be Lorenz and no Patrick, so. It'd be 6,000 for Lorenzo's 3 months.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Tina Marie: And in that case, are you okay with me? Just meeting with him every other week? Then.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Tina Marie: I think he's fine there, and. I've told him like I tell everybody else, if you mean anything.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Tina Marie: You know, we can talk. We can make an emergency call. We can talk through messages, or whatever.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Tina Marie: And he's maybe brought something up a couple times. Uh in between calls when something came up, but for the most part, for the most part nobody does that.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Tina Marie: Um, but it would be available. But he's really being pretty streamlined and.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Tina Marie: I would still ask him to do his journal weekly. So that I could still check in weekly, and just make sure.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Tina Marie: That he's not losing momentum. Um, because that's the only concern there usually is. Momentum lost when it's every other week. But.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Tina Marie: The reason I don't think it's an issue with Lorenz is because. Um.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Tina Marie: He's running his pod. My people are generally running entire companies. He does have an entire team. It's kind of the same, but it's not. He's not responsible for marketing.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
mark sweet: Yeah, he's running like a little team, but like uh, he's a franchise. He's handling a franchise.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Tina Marie: He's not. Yeah. So so there isn't as large of a scope of work.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Tina Marie: Like it is for all the rest of my people. So that 2 week Gap, you know, has always been detrimental. I don't think it will be for him, because the scope is smaller. So.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Tina Marie: To me that would solve the situation in terms of like where your money is going and the results that I'm working to get for you. And then also, if you wanted to.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Tina Marie: Be able to give this as an opportunity which I realize is a gift to me also. As a chance to try to get some new business.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
mark sweet: It's a gift for everyone.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Tina Marie: Huh!

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
mark sweet: It's a gift for everyone. I'm just trying to figure out how to best. Give it.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Tina Marie: They know Fuji, too. Right. Or no.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
mark sweet: Hmm, probably. I don't know if they work with him much, but.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
mark sweet: I mean, they know China.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Tina Marie: OX. Yeah, actually.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Tina Marie: When I said that I was like, Wait! No, it was Tona that brought it up so. I don't know. Maybe just saying, Hey, you know, we've worked with this person. Shona's perspective probably.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Tina Marie: I'm adding, like it's different. It's balanced.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.000
mark sweet: In all honesty. As long as I just say this is someone who's helped me pretty much. Every single person that you could think of would say, I want to try it.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Tina Marie: Well, um, you know.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Tina Marie: How many people you want to tell Mark.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
mark sweet: Each. Not that many law firms. Um.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, there's probably not that many great people cause. That's definitely a qualifier for me.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
mark sweet: Yeah. Also, I don't need them to succeed. So yeah.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I don't want to help your competitors.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So, yeah.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
mark sweet: Uh the doctors, obviously. And plus it's.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Well.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
mark sweet: Most of the attorneys are not great people, so.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's what I was saying. Like. Okay. Well, um.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Tina Marie: Whatever it ends up being. Let's just give them. You can tell them 2 months if you want to make it. 3 months. Whatever makes you happy I'm gonna be happy with, because you've been amazing to me. So.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Tina Marie: But I just wanted to make sure that we.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
mark sweet: You know this about me, like, I'm pretty. Yeah, if I want to relax like me and den are the same in this regard, like, whatever you want to do.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Tina Marie: I know, but number one there has to be a clear expectation, because otherwise, you know, it just needs to be. But also.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
mark sweet: The one thing I'm worried about that I don't know how much you can help me, but if anyone kinda can, it's probably you.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Tina Marie: Oops!

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000
mark sweet: Is trying to find a good. Traditional marketing company, whether that's in California or Arizona.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Tina Marie: Let me check my daughter when I pick up.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
mark sweet: Don't want to get burned like last time.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Tina Marie: So. If you can give me a few more details, I'd be happy to research this for you. I that's not something that.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Tina Marie: Any of my people ever do really um, for the most part, because when you get into marketing agencies, you're paying agency price and. The nature of the type of work I do, and the basically boutique businesses that I work with.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Tina Marie: That's not an applicable to them. But I am good at research, and you do have a ton to do so. I'd be happy to spend some of my time, and also feel like.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
mark sweet: Or even if both of us are looking, if we come to the same conclusion.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Tina Marie: I would understand. That's my point. Yes.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.000
mark sweet: Awesome.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Tina Marie: Yes, I would like to be part of helping you find that, because then I'd feel more confident about where you would be spending your time or your money. But um.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Tina Marie: If you if you could just like, and it could be an audio message, or whatever. And and this call is being recorded. So this helps now.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Tina Marie: Is, just give me a brief like. What are we looking for? What are we not looking for?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Tina Marie: Kind of parameters to start me off with.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Tina Marie: Um? Do you want me to email you that question.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
mark sweet: Um! You can.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Tina Marie: Or will you remember.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
mark sweet: I'll remember, because this is something super top of mind, because it's. I don't wanna say it's make or break. But it's obviously a really.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
mark sweet: Big big deal.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
mark sweet: If it works great, if it doesn't. Crap um.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
mark sweet: Hey? This is not a. It's not a fail fast or fail slow, because it's just. There's.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
mark sweet: It's gonna take a while.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Tina Marie: Are you telling me, like financially that. That sweet law is struggling, that bad.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
mark sweet: No, no, no, no! What I'm saying is with this stuff. It's going to take time to know if it actually like. Works or doesn't work.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
mark sweet: And I. In cognizant of that fact, but, like.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
mark sweet: Obviously I don't wanna put in $400,000, and it doesn't work.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Tina Marie: Well to that point, though. That's that's a great um. I don't know specire kind of thing where you know. Maybe we're looking at a company that knows analytics and tracking and values that because that's how good that they do. You know they're like, Hey, we can. We can track this. Here's what we put in place.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Tina Marie: It's harder to do on a traditional level. But. Anyway.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Tina Marie: There's that's a thought. So think of whatever you can to um. To get that going.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Tina Marie: Or to like, give me some information, and then I will start the research, and then it'll just be like a back and forth. Okay. I found this, and you'll be like. Yeah, this is totally not what I'm looking for because of blah blah. Then I'll understand the scope better, and so on until hopefully, we have a list of some people to think and try.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
mark sweet: Got it. Okay.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Tina Marie: Also. I know you have to go in 2 min. But uh Jonah told me she blocked Cheryl today.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
mark sweet: He's asking that, too, and I I don't know what happened. I'm sure it's nothing good uh Dr. East. Grandpa died. He had to fly like overnight to Florida.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Tina Marie: And I was like. Oh no!

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:23.000
mark sweet: Good that. And then I think this week there is supposed to be in Mexico on a trip, so Dr. E. Is full of it, so. Like full of it mean, like full of stuff. He's dealing with an emotional.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Tina Marie: Yes, yes, overloaded.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
mark sweet: So before Jonah. There was a hissy fit with him. Maybe.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
mark sweet: View. Take a take a breath.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Tina Marie: Well, that's part of the blocking um. So I because Dr. E. Told her. Let it go, and I told her like, if you could do that, you should do that. But if you can, then I told her last week. Maybe you do block her, but here's the thing.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
mark sweet: Beautiful.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Tina Marie: It's it could be temporary, and it could just be kind of a subtle note of cheryl. You've exceeded your boundaries. I'm not going to talk to you if you do this kind of thing. So, rather than having a fight or going to Dr. E. About it.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Tina Marie: She's just handling it for a little while. If Cheryl decides that she's going to be a bitch and go to Dr. E. When he's going through all of these things. That's on her.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Tina Marie: But anyway, I think temporarily, it might actually be the thing to do. But any thoughts you have are good. I know you gotta go.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:24.000
mark sweet: Yeah, uh, I got 1 min. I again, I think this is gonna be even more important to get her people on her payrolls. There's nothing that child can do to screw around with anything that she does. Everything else is separated out so.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Tina Marie: Yes. We need to build a moat asap in every possible way.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
mark sweet: Yeah, there's other components of that that we gotta deal with. But yes, generally speaking, okay.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
mark sweet: There you go! Bye.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay? Bye.
