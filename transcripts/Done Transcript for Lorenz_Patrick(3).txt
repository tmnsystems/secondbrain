00:00:01 - mark sweet
Hey.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you today?
00:00:05 - mark sweet
I'm just a little overwhelmed, but can't right?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Um, I am, I'm in pain. So I'm struggling mentally. if I stumble over stuff, bear with me. It's not for lack of preparation and effort. I'm just struggling. Um, so.
00:00:37 - mark sweet
For like 20 seconds, because I've been trying to skip a guy on the phone and.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally.
00:00:43 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry about it. Yeah. Okay. You
00:08:00 - mark sweet
You Okay, sorry about that.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
back. Hey, good. Oh, I was make sure I was unmuted. Okay. Uh, everything okay?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's a case that we do have to file or settle and it doesn't not make any sense to file on the it would not be the best interest the client but defendants. Maybe not telling the truth about how the vision happened and so I'm helping Tyler on the case and talking about. supervisor to try to figure out a way to get it done because it's dried on too well, so.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had to get my brain back because it was so quiet for so long and I was just like in his own and then you popped in and I was like, wait, what? Anyway, okay. Oh, all right, let's try it. I gotta, I really gotta focus. Um, so I'm just going back and forth between Patrick's and Lorenta's notes and kind of trying to figure out where to start because there's, there's multiple topic points and none of them are, well, it's all a, um, you know, a long runway, right? There's, there's, there's topics to be addressed now, but none of them get fixed like that and some of it's just information to use and to move forward, so. Again, I always have these like multiple thoughts and they're all related, but I can only say one thing at a time and sometimes I wish we could just have like telekinetic, telepathic, exchange. Huh?
00:10:13 - mark sweet
Let's save a lot of time and energy.
00:10:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, right? Oh my gosh. Okay. So anyway, um, let me, let me think about this. Yes. So there's a few different types of things. First of all, the overarching one is I don't know how much time you spend leading your team and training them versus telling them these are the goals, hit them, we're short of them. So could you draw that picture for me a little bit?
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Yeah. Um, so there's formal and informal. The informal is pretty. much daily where I'm spending a lot of time with the attorneys going through talking to them. Hey, there a case you're working on? What are you working on right now? And especially with like, say a Patrick or Lauren's or Hank, where they're relatively new. And so whether they actually need my help on a case or not, I don't really care for say, I want to go through and I want to see what their thought processes, right? There's plenty of times where they need help, but other than that, I want to see what their thought processes make sure it's the same as what our thought processes because it takes time to train. That would probably be the more informal part of it. Obviously, we have our own Slack channels and yeah, they know what their goals are, know how far they are, far they are, but also making sure that we're setting a standard and implementing changes and making sure that, you know, those changes actually stick because people tend to slide back, right? Especially when it's going work. So like the whole second voice thing, I'm now forcing them to put into the resolution tab, who did the second voice, if it's out of all two limits, rather than just having some reason not to do it.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Second voice?
00:12:12 - mark sweet
Yeah, so if they don't get the full amount, they have to have another attorney call to see if they can get more money.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it.
00:12:20 - mark sweet
It's not them. Because of my experience, a pretty good percentage of the time, they get more. And it may not be a lot. Sometimes it does, but it may not be lot, but it adds up over a lot. So like, you know, Lorenz helps. Patrick helped Lorenz on one. was like 500 bucks. Not a huge amount, but the fact that it happened is good. I did want to get an extra like five grand, so like it adds up again, spread over files. Right. It's not always 200 grand. and or something like with Tyler's, which is funny.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we tracking that, by the way?
00:13:04 - mark sweet
We are now, so you're gonna have to put it in. So, you know, even if it's an extra $1,000 a case on average, it's right over 100 files a month. That's another, you know, $100,000 a month, that's 33,000 or 40,000 of attorney's fees. That's significant.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure, that is a very leveraged activity. That's awesome. When did you start that? Last week, they knew to do that, but they weren't doing it, so now we are forcing them to do it. How long has it been known that you needed to do that? Oh, a very long time. Can you ballpark that?
00:13:47 - mark sweet
A year plus.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have that is watching to make sure? like you just probably answered it but I'm going to ask anyway that procedures and like standard operating procedures are being followed.
00:14:10 - mark sweet
And that's more merit than anything else but the attorneys sometimes do their own things and so anytime they settle the case they announce it so it's all like a slap channel so it's pretty obvious if it well they say whether it's all two of them or not so it's obvious if they didn't get the full amount so from there it's not going be very hard for me just to you know spot check or double check to make sure that there was a second voice.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just want to make sure I understand this correctly that should have been something Mary noticed and corrected.
00:14:44 - mark sweet
Mary tends not to get super involved with the attorneys.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not actually answering my question directly.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Um I don't know it's probably on me.
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It seems like from everything I know about you and what you value and what you want to do and not do, that oversight is not what you want to do most. So ideally, if we can wave a magic wand, would you not have somebody who was responsible for oversight and just making sure that the things that, so to me, the more powerful thing would be for you to determine the procedures that would generate the most revenue, protect the most revenue, prevent the most bleed, that type of thing, right, visualize, visionary, plan, all that. And somebody else monitor and direct, train, whatever, having received that instruction from you. Would that not be the most ideal thing if it were possible? If we could just have it?
00:15:59 - mark sweet
No, I tend to agree. with you. Honestly, I don't know if the best one to even figure out how or what that change is, right? I'm probably the one who notices something, but I may not have the best solution for it.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so one standard thing that you could do, if any time there is a specific thing that should happen on all cases or anything that could be just specified, right? So if we don't hit 40% on attorney fees, automatically invokes the role, second voice, that can be checked and unified, right? And as many cases as you have, I almost think that you could probably have your best case manager in the firm or even hire a case manager just for these types of things, and their entire job is to monitor all of the cases and make sure that everything is going according to sweet law procedures, because so they do have to understand how it works. They have to be good at what they do, and but they need to be the type of person that are just they like data, they like greeting, they like evaluating, they don't get bored with it, they pay attention to details and they can just report it to you. It wouldn't be their job to coach or counsel or to tell anything or to fix anything, although that could be a separate thing, but generally that type of personality doesn't go well with the coaching one. They're very different types, that's a very analytical personality, they just don't make the best coaches. The only reason I can do it It's because I'm weird hybrid right down the middle of all the analytical type empathetic sorts. Just right down the middle of all of them. Anyway, again, these are, these are, we're just trying to kind of formulate what's the ideal thing, not creating more bloat in the system, not creating more, what you call it, expense payroll or anything like that. But, um, how many cases, let's see, I don't know, that'd be, that'd probably be a full-time job in and of itself, but if we have to do some math, so what percentage of your cases, how quickly and can we go on to litify and do this just to go, because the math would tell us how, um, feasible. it would be just from where we're at and then it gives us the place to aim for where it might make more sense, if it ever makes sense. But it's definitely going to be worth our time to do this little basic math right now. But if we go look at total attorney fees and we would have to have this data. So does LIDIFY have like, could you get a report where you look at total fees collected and total settlement amounts so that you could easily calculate, did we get the 40% that's not gonna work because we've got minors, so we've got some contracts where they signed it better. Okay, well, so it's still like, it's just a matter of finding the right math to get close to what we're trying to figure out what we're trying to figure out. out is um how much roughly potentially it's not going to be exact because of things like that um also let me check mark we added i think is more what you're getting to yeah but we only just started that like a month or two ago we don't have enough data yet okay second voicing adding into it we don't have enough data yet we will but just not quite yet and i'm really interested to see what the average increase with the second voices right i so are you making sure that you're tracking enough statuses like that you have all of that categorized so that the report will be able to be pulled to see that easily uh i don't know
00:21:00 - mark sweet
I don't know. Right now I just want to get the data into the system first and then we can kind of figure it out from there. The reason I'm saying that is I don't know if it's on the separate field and then it's not on all of them so I feel like I'm making it more confusing than it needs to be.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the simplest way and I'll go back to what it started for us to get data in the first place because Lidify was so confusing would just be to create a spreadsheet that's that's it could be team-wide and suite-law-wide and that would probably best since they're all helping each other and it could be just second-boy spreadsheet and it is here's what we started with here's what second-boy Scott is and we're just keeping a running total until we can figure out how to use Lidify to get that report. So you've got the numbers we can be looking at it.
00:21:58 - mark sweet
Yeah we can just make it how much did you increase? something simple, and then there is a competition between the most economic.
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:22:07 - mark sweet
Yeah. Okay.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. And you have competitive people. So I think that that would work out really well, but also you get some real time numbers pretty quickly, where we don't really get quick. Financial type numbers quickly because of how long cases take to settle. But that one has a quick impact. Okay. So back to informal contact, you say that's daily spending time, talk with them, talking with them on what I'm working on. Is that a phone call to each of them individually? Is it emails? Is it slack? Describe what that looks like in a little more detail so I can envision it.
00:23:06 - mark sweet
So people in the office is usually personal face to face. Which is always my preference because you can.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on with the person?
00:23:19 - mark sweet
Otherwise it's slack or zoom. I won't call that but every now and then but it's more slack and zoom. And this is outside of obviously our weekly calls.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When we calls our team calls.
00:23:37 - mark sweet
There's. All legal team and all the terms. With the one exception of paying. Every Wednesday, nine a.m. I have a meeting with him because he's still right now. And since he's not here, I want to have something more formal. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how, how, what kind of, there's kind of two ways that I want to ask this question, and I'll ask them both and then you can answer, but what kind of leader slash coach slash mentor Do you see yourself as and how do you think your people see them? Specifically the legal team, not anybody else since we've lost. The one's response.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
I'm generally a compassionate helper. That's just an Instagram type. That's generally just what I am. Which is fine. So I'm more than sure they see me as someone who is helpful. Doesn't I? shipping and like I never make them feel bad for asking for help in any way, shape, or form. want them to be comfortable asking for help. They also will generally see someone who's incredibly driven, sometimes as a positive, sometimes less than negative for them. Beyond that, someone who gives their word, I think they're probably the main things.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to ask you if it would surprise you because it surprised me that the perception that I get is that you yell and are upset about not hitting the numbers a lot. I'm going give you more than that because there is more than that, but that was the first thing.
00:25:54 - mark sweet
Oh, I definitely get ticked off and they don't hit their numbers. There's no doubt about that one. They don't hit their balls or their expectations. Yelling, I don't think I've raised my voice, like, maybe once here.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is the perception that, like, I'm told I am a lot and I'm like, you realize that I have this volume when I'm happy and I have this volume when I'm, like, excited or whatever. Like, it's sometimes people perceive, raise the volume as yelling and when it's just the person has a wide range of dynamic and volume, which you do, you go from very, very soft, like, I can't hear you, to, you know, I wouldn't say booming or anything, you know, but there's definitely a wide range of dynamic where most people are not monotone, but they're definitely, their wavelength is more mellow. So What's interesting to me, because I think, highly of you, I think you are, I think everyone is really lucky to be able to work for you and with you, knowing I don't, I'm not your subordinate. So my experience is different. and I know enough, though, to know that they are, because I know how you care about people, I know, you know, who's been fired, who's not been fired, what, you know, what you've done to find a home for people and create safety and all of that. So I'm not biased, I'm informed. And, but there has been, you know, they're not negative or derogatory. So it comes differently between the two of them. One being afraid to lose a job, Lorenz, and I'm going to say this because I'm also going to show how when I've, when I've told them, I think that they might be perceiving. things through a lens of with well for Lorenz where he's worked before and Patrick is just you know I don't know I think that they're attaching to the the frustrated voice more than anything else and not taking everything else into account. So the conversation last week with what was it last week might have been last week but it's it's been a few times anyway so Lorenz sorry because all these conversations kind of kind of run together because there's bits and pieces of them. So the timing isn't so much relevant but I think we had a breakthrough with him or he realized because I because he he's like they don't say things directly I infer 100% so I'm gonna tell you that right but I'm good at that and so Oh, I asked him, I said, are you, are you afraid of getting fired? Are you afraid of losing your job? And he said, yeah, I mean, my numbers, he's like, I'm, he's like, I'm not, I'm, I'm so slow. I know I don't hit the, the fees like everybody else. And, um, cause I'd said something once about your value of him just being steady at least. And, you know, reliable. um, he just really brushed that off. He's like, no, like, I don't, he's like, he was very worried about losing his job. And I said, um, how many attorneys do you know who have been fired at sweet loss and cheap and there? And I think he said one, I'm trying to think who it was, but I know it wouldn't have been anything, anybody that was supposed to be there.
00:29:47 - mark sweet
it was a quick, I don't know if they went to R.E. Was here. I don't think he was. That's the only train that would even be remotely close to time wise. Yeah. Actually, Maria, we had her, but she was a lot better. She was only one of us for like a day. we were like she was a terrible thing.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and I said because I was struggling to remember who it was at the time but I'm like okay so then I used Cynthia as an example. I said Cynthia has moved around but Cynthia didn't get fired even though people have struggled with her. What does that tell you and he just kind of like oh you know and so then I asked him so I told him about the the surveys that we've done and the training that's come as a result of them and and also asked them you know do you feel like you have a hostile work environment other than the fact that you feel like because they're not meeting numbers you're afraid of losing your job have you seen any other evidence that you know that your job's in jeopardy or that you feel like you have an unreasonable employer or even somebody that doesn't care and he's like no no no like all of those things. Um, so sorry, my brain just went out the door for a second. Um, going to put a knife out on that. Please, please, please.
00:31:10 - mark sweet
Um, He's kind of a .
00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess for lack of better.
00:31:14 - mark sweet
Um, he's got the most. Staff of any group and his numbers are generally on the lower side. So, you know, should he be concerned? answer is kind of yes, because. If you're constantly on the lower ends. If you have the most help, you had a lot of cases still has a lot of cases. And you're not meeting where others bar and you're in a state where your minimum is higher and you're able to stack policies, and you're able to get more. You should be number one.
00:31:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So. And then this is where I need to be. clear to because on what your thoughts are. So you do tell me and obviously I can't, I can't, I don't tell him things and it's not appropriate to tell him. So I tell you everything, he gets a filtered version. So just to be very clear about that, obviously. But you have told me about your frustration with his pace and everything, but then you have also told me that he just he's kind of slow and steady. So I really want to be clear and understand your thoughts on him as clearly as I can so that I can be useful to you primarily to sweet law first. Lorenz is secondary, right? Helping Lorenz is the benefit to sweet law. That's my priority. So I really need to be very clear on where he stands, what like If you have a, because sometimes we do this and we don't necessarily say it explicitly out loud to anyone, but do you have almost like a timeline in your mind or numbers in your mind? Like if I don't see X by X, I got to let him go. Keep being in mind that we both know how hard it is to find new attorneys.
00:33:21 - mark sweet
And that's the issue, finding a new attorney, finding one that's so the reality is, over time, his assistance, people writing his demands is three or four case managers will probably go down. But there is someone, we say, what's someone who's steady, know, he tends not to piss off clients. one terrible review, but like just the nature of our business, right? it just is what it is. And so he's just slow, right? It just is, I don't think there's necessarily a way to change it. He is scared and look, he didn't have the best situation as previous job. He tried to do his own thing and it didn't work out and he almost lost, know, everything over that. But, you know, as marriage kids, everything else. And so, you know, that's why we do try to go out of our way to include him on things, which, you know, look, find the dude out here. It's not exactly cheap or easy, right? Right. Go out of our way to do these things so he does feel like he's part of what we're doing.
00:34:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:36 - mark sweet
But, you know, to be a little bit freaked out that you might lose your job is maybe not the worst thing in the world, either.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I understand that. And so, but there's, there is this strategic balance to have. And it is that, so you're familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? Mm hmm. And what do we know about being stuck at the bottom? you, you can't be the best version of yourself because basically you're focused on fear, you're focused on pain. So, and this is what I was explaining to Lorenz, I said, you're going to have to get over it. And he's like, you know, I'm a dad, I have four kids. And, you know, he got previous trauma. And I said, I get that. The problem is you spending so much time ruminating about how badly you're doing is keeping you from being whatever kind of powerhouse you could be on the cases that you have because your energy is not there. Your creativity is there, not there. Your best problem solving is not there. And we do video calls so I can see him just pondering on that and realizing, you know, that he's kind of keeping himself in the foot by focusing on how bad he's doing, not that he shouldn't be thinking about it, but rather. other than then poor me, poor me, poor me being driven by because Patrick sees his numbers and hates them and goes, but I'm going to kill it. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. going to do this. So same situation in terms of like not being where they want to be completely different response to it. And because we're having the conversations together, Lorenz inspired and afraid from it.
00:36:33 - mark sweet
I'll get to that.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But the difference is, and this is what I told him, I said, you know, I said, has anybody ever hired a coach for you to spend time with you and try to help you through issues? And I said, he said, no, it's okay. So that's something unique about Mark. And then he said something really nice, like you respect me and think good things about me. So that was cool. But he was like, That's different. Okay, so anyway, so what I'm trying to do is kind of get him to stop moving and spend more of his energy just shoulder to the wheel, get the work done kind of thing. Hold on, let me go back to his notes. Oh, so when we, so when I brought up the point that we've done surveys and from the surveys has come trending like Black Swan and like grief counseling, he said he didn't get the grief counseling training and he would really like that because he feels like he spends a lot of time with that and that it affects him to like some of the other people who mentioned it when we did that survey and that makes sense that that training would be beneficial to him. So I'm wondering if anybody who hasn't been through that, if you could get another one or just kind of ping everybody and say, hey, would you, would you like a referral?
00:38:00 - mark sweet
pressure course.
00:38:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:38:01 - mark sweet
can only do that for intake. We didn't do that for anyone else.
00:38:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:38:05 - mark sweet
So there's only like three people on the firm outside of intake that deal with death cases. And he's not the one of them.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why? Okay. All right. Well, that's a little enigma. Um, Um, um, he hasn't gone through it.
00:38:30 - mark sweet
They don't see what those.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just wonder why it was even something he would want. So now I'm confused more. Um, okay. Okay. So let me go back to, we're kind of probably going to spend most of the time on. Lauren's stuff today because he is the bigger thing. Oh, okay. So I was looking and let it fire. Okay, just because I was going back over the comment that the email we had about Patrick and when his incentive kicked in, so I was trying to look at the attorney fees report and there's a one that says attorney fees this month and it has the settlement verdict amount but the gross attorney fee and the net attorney fee column is empty. I'll share my screen and maybe you can help me see what I need to see to kind of track that. Where's my share screen home?
00:39:34 - mark sweet
Part of this too is that I would like to put it up as long as I can because it just literally means I'm paying out more.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm the one wanting to see better profit margins so I get that but I do also want to see so to that end the more that I understand about any of the attorneys and their processes and How sweet law operates the more insight I have about how we can do the parallel business that is optimized So for me, there are a few things going on my dogs going nuts right now. It's really hard to think All the barking yes So I've got, you know, overall maintain, not maintain, but optimize sweet law as it is kind of thing.
00:40:41 - mark sweet
I've got You may have to work with the detailed row tabulator and just get rid of that.
00:40:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look a little easier. Oh, okay, this one Okay, you may I just totally lost one turn up. So anyway, so I have multiple tracks I'm working on all the time. Number one, the overarching one is how does Mark make the most amount of money with the least amount of risk and the least amount of effort and the most amount of freedom? That is always my MO for anyone and everyone. Within that, there is sweet law as it is that I get to have my hands on and talk and work through you. There is the individual attorneys that I get to look at the reports, things like that, and then potentially seeing if there is another, so up until yesterday, yesterday, Monday. Yeah, anyway, Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Up until yesterday, I was thinking it was, you know, Modify sweet lot as it is into something else over time working into this more optimized thing but the thought yesterday and makes so much more sense to me is to have a micro version of the optimized, you know business and Try to grow it from a seedling first Minimum viable product and see what we can do but everything that I understand about the mechanics and the operations and the nuance of it and and where the revenue comes from and all of this The more that I can contribute something useful to that in the meantime though Sweet lot is not something that's just going to dissolve anytime soon And so optimizing what you have and knowing you care about actual people and their family so even if you could just be like I'm gonna walk all the way from it you would not because you wouldn't need everybody hanging like that. So it's a matter of trying to massage all those different you know parts of it and anyway so that's it's a lot to take into account so um understanding this okay so you see what this says it gives me this but not so if you're any two different reports because it's not to make sense otherwise.
00:43:35 - mark sweet
Okay um so I don't know what is for May 2024. Who asked what 2024? I don't know why I was saying May 2024. Okay anyway um get rid of the detail bros.
00:43:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and then open a new tab.
00:43:59 - mark sweet
And then in Okay, let's just do one at a time.
00:44:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go back to what you're Okay.
00:44:05 - mark sweet
This is a good way so you can see what's been settled this month.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:44:11 - mark sweet
So you can see the total settlements by attorney, right? I think that's helpful. Now I'll look in the report that is called average and just AVG fees by attorney.
00:44:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I that's popping up. This one?
00:44:34 - mark sweet
No, I'll hit all reports because you're just in the recent and just type AVG. Space fees.
00:44:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
I just made it for this month. Okay. This is how much they brought in
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so do you mind if we just go back month over month for the last three months real quick? Yeah. Okay, so I'm doing this right, right?
00:45:21 - mark sweet
here.
00:45:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this month, well I'm just gonna, ah, and I'm going to to do customize, just change that to seven, seven, likes. Good job, Patrick.
00:45:47 - mark sweet
No, the average fee, please don't look at that because it's just not correct.
00:45:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wasn't. Okay. Okay, oh yeah. That reminds me, um, so because I was asking if I asked the guys if they could see these reports, and what Lauren said was that you send out towards the end of the month, but not exactly end of the month so they don't have total numbers, basically a report like this, and then he tracks it, he has his own spreadsheet, and from that we actually showed him how to create averages so that he's got one column with everybody's average, including his average, and one of the things that I was showing him is like what you should be doing is not so sometimes we have bad months. I'm like you don't obviously you don't want to have a bad month, but if you can continually increase your average, then you know that you're moving the needle forward. So even if you have the bad month, but your average didn't go lower, then your overall trajectory is you're still improving. Well, if it went higher. So that was helpful to him because he didn't have that and he didn't know how to make that formula and he doesn't have this, which you said the average fees aren't even right. So anyway, so I'm trying to help him to understand the data also, but I was impressed that he was tracking it and trying to keep it, but he doesn't have accurate numbers. is there a report that could be made just for the attorneys to have access to be able to see how they stack against each other where they could go look at the revenue? Is that a bad or is there any version of the report that could be good for them to see?
00:47:45 - mark sweet
Yes, especially because they're all so competitive.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:58 - mark sweet
There is. just trying to find which one it is.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, it's all worth waiting for because that's what I'm here for, like, if we can get them to drive themselves, but be more clear on data also. And the fact that Lorenz wants to know rather than burying his head in the sand actually says something good, he's not just waiting for the ball to drop, he's like, what can I do better? So, to me, that's workable. It's not a fast workable situation, but it is workable. I'm going to look at other months where you look at that up, so, let's see, oops, go And I would love to see this as a plotted chart month over month, so I don't want to go do this manually, but also just like look at that steadily.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Okay, I got something that's more slash better. Yeah, I know.
00:50:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me know when you're Okay.
00:50:44 - mark sweet
What? Look, a VG attorney fee.
00:50:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Reports. Sorry. Oh, I didn't realize that reset there.
00:51:03 - mark sweet
By attorney two years in top. This is the last two years of data by attorney.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Okay.
00:51:17 - mark sweet
Relatively accurate.
00:51:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So average for a month.
00:51:24 - mark sweet
This is two years of data put together. Okay.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is their total over the two years. Is this average correct? Well, we could do that math easily, I guess, huh? Should be. Okay. Robert is the litigation attorney? He was. Yeah. Okay. It's not. Okay, that's a huge disparity, Tyler, holy heck.
00:52:23 - mark sweet
Um, refresh the report real quick. I just took out anything that was a zero dollar attorney being, because think it just goes from this off, because there's reasons for it that don't make sense.
00:52:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
makes sense. So, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't look different. Um, at all. That's, this is interesting to me. Well, that's only 17. So, that doesn't mean anything. Um, cases. So, she's done in, uh, But how many years is this is two years? The rounds was around for two years. Yeah. Yeah. like a full two years, right?
00:53:08 - mark sweet
Pretty close, I think.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me too. I feel like it was just over two years, because I feel like it was like February and Marchish or something. That could be wrong. Anyway, to have double the cases, but then for Tyler to have 120, 112, more cases than Lorenz, but his average be 2000 less.
00:53:44 - mark sweet
Yeah. Just refresh real quick. It's a small change, but it's great language blank or zero. So this is an up-to-date language.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm. Is it a five-point? OK. Oh, that was our six. I'll refresh the whole page. I have a Mac on the PC. Okay.
00:54:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, okay. That's a pretty accurate number.
00:54:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this went from one ninety eight to one ninety six. This was three ninety eight, I think, or three ninety two. So still the. mean, I know you can't replace him. And I know that he's a pain in the butt and this is how much he brought in. So, and he, whatever he cost you. It wasn't that.
00:54:52 - mark sweet
Yeah, but look at the average that was eleven thousand two thousand more. Times three hundred and ten. What would that number? I know I get that.
00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's that's the whole problem with this whole thing is the biggest thing is that you can't get to people.
00:55:13 - mark sweet
It's six hundred and twenty dollars of attorney's fees. That's literally money in my pocket, six hundred and twenty grand difference.
00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why we do numbers, right? So what would it cost you and this is the conversation that we've had before about how much you pay people? What would it cost you is to replace him? Could you hire somebody that you? Okay. So let's ask this. What do you pay Tyler? Including bonuses, huh?
00:55:47 - mark sweet
It gets worse than I'm. She's already been like two or a year.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And how much in the two years did you say? Was it like six hundred thousand? Yeah. So he, he cost you 500,000. I'm just trying to think, well, 200,000. If you paid somebody, yeah, my brain is slow, but if you paid somebody, let's say $350,000 a year, and they made you an extra, well, let's say that you, you hired another Samantha. Yeah, I mean, you'd still be winning.
00:56:31 - mark sweet
That's the problem. We can't find them. If I could, I will, in an instant, it's not a money issue. It's a person issue.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the reason I'm asking those, because it's been ages since we've had this conversation, but you use my memory is that you were adamant, like, I'm not to hire and pay X. But when we see this kind of math, then that changes everything. of course you have changed your perspective a lot based on the number. So there's that. Okay. So, anyway, I mean, that's really what so much of this comes down to is you can't just go hire people.
00:57:08 - mark sweet
Now, that being said, or building them like Patrick, it takes a year plus.
00:57:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. then here's another way to look at the math mark. Is there an investment that can be made to make a person like Lorenz better? Does he need, you know, so you're already doing this, right? And so one of the things that I'm really good at is a perspective shift of looking at the data and using it to your advantage, creating systems. like, he had conversations. What do you call them? Reviews, you know, anyway, with his people. And he said, yeah, we do this, you know, about monthly. I'm like, about monthly or monthly. He goes, well, I missed it last month. And then I missed it in February and one of our I'm like, okay, so what are the results of those conversations that you have, like, are you finding out, like, and I didn't want to leave the question. So basically, it was, you know, coaching and feedback and what he could do to improve them. but the result was that there was something important that came out of those conversations every single time I'm like, but you don't schedule them all they make sure that they happen every single month, and he dropped his head and he's like, no, I'm like, well, how can you expect consistent improvement if you don't have a system to ensure consistent improvement. That happens consistently. So it's a really basic thing. But I'm like, I buy next week the next time I talk to you, I want you to have scheduled that and he goes, well, sometimes, you know, people. people's schedules like they don't work and will schedule something and then it can't happen I'm Lorenz you could find another time and he's like because last week someone saw his own vacation I said so your solution is to wait a month and then not have it rather than just reschedule he's like no I'm like but that's that is what it was so I'm like if you are if you really want to be better and instead of feeling bad about your numbers and kind of feeling like a victim about your numbers then you've got to drive and and this is how you do it so anyway I can't see having such an issue like I can't move my zoom window and I can't see what I need to see in a thriving minute anyway so ah no not that yeah t-ness issues don't need to do that um oh so anyway so as I'm digging in with a little bit more so so now I have targets detail pros made that go away so I'm going rock my head around this a little bit more and do some math about what would the improvement be a value to you? So I've never had that before. So we've done this math when it comes to leads, vendor sources, like we look at how much does it cost us to acquire a retainer and what's the average attorney fee was. We had that math and so we've done it in terms of evaluating vendors and states but I haven't done that at the attorney level and so now I can do that working with Patrick and Lorenz and seeing what kind of improvement and optimization we can do that first of all pays the bill for what we're with me and then a second of all becomes profit above and beyond that so what I'm going to be looking for is are there other types of trainings. Can I get a breakdown of what everybody costs? Actually that would be super helpful. Can I get payroll for all of the PODs, individual people, so I can really understand because I'm getting data from the attorneys okay about what are the activities that they're doing so that I can kind of have a cost evaluation of each of the people and the roles and look for those levers a little bit more that way.
01:01:38 - mark sweet
Yeah I mean obviously the attorneys fluctuate month to month.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right right but but I can do some averages and calculations and still kind of have you know a ballpark which which is is helpful as There's one thing that's going to throw it off just as a head zone okay because they're attorneys I can pay them referral fees when they bring in a case. Uh-huh.
01:02:00 - mark sweet
Okay. Non-entertions.
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:02:03 - mark sweet
So, for example, Patrick had, like his uncle come in, and I overpay Patrick on his percentage, because I want to encourage him to do more and more of that. Mm-hmm.% of the attorney fee on it. So, it's a large hit, right? So, it throws off the payroll numbers in that regard. I'm happy to do it.
01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know this is a little extra work for you, but would you mind, since that can't be a ton of times, would you mind marking, like, what those amounts were when they happened so that I could take that into calculation?
01:02:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, we were starting to separate that out because we wanted to try to get a better idea of what was.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the thing. Whatever the micro version that we built, whatever the optimized version that we hopefully end up building and trying. What we're going to want to take is whatever the best practices are, and because I don't know what that looks like, I think that it's going to be very different. But once we figure that out, there are two, like I haven't even been able to comprehend this as an opportunity until yesterday, which is crazy because in three years of all this talking, like, anyway, but that's the whole thing about pacing and how new knowledge turns into new questions, turns into new awarenesses and new opportunities, and you just have to keep plugging along at a consistently, which we do, so anyway. But the way that we realize the impact of, first of all, a variety of vendors, which Dan pointed out yesterday has been a saving grace because it's eliminated, the dependencies on them. but also just optimizing or understanding that cost. If we can do the same thing and figure out what aspects of the business can you have steadily that fall within a set of parameters that are profitable but very low maintenance, and then more scalable because it doesn't have to be an attorney per se, maybe one attorney that is really, really good at just oversight and catching things or one really, really good attorney, one really, really good case manager and then a bunch of assistants or something. I don't know, but the more data we get about the values in, oh shoot. I'm to talk to them in 20 minutes. get my brain ready. I didn't even realize what time it is. Yeah, so anyway, the more we understand about the the different aspects of the values, the costs, but also what little things that we do that make a difference like second voice, like potentially intake script, potentially ranking lead as they come in, which may not be so much of a thing for the model right now, but could be in the future if we do, you know, optimized version, all of these little things that we've laid the groundwork to be able to understand and now are just understanding. Anyway, that'll be helpful. if I could get a report on everybody's payroll with the anything that's a outlier like Patrick's stuff referrals. Should I ask for that an email?
01:05:49 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's fine. I'm not going to the show on it.
01:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, and then week two weeks, three weeks, what do you think that would take?
01:05:58 - mark sweet
I know we'll come the project right now. Can you like at least two weeks because we are in the middle of one of those crops?
01:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. But there's a lot more other things. could we do this maybe every couple of weeks for a little while while I get some more traction on this and just kind of have a better understanding, a faster turnaround of talking to them and then talking to you on this on a more detailed level because there's so much to cover and for me to wrap my head around. And if it doesn't work in your schedule, then you can just say, hey, I can't do it this time. Okay. I'll send a calendar across and you just let me know if it works. Doesn't work. I'm going to go from there. Sounds good. And You see a cute little woman today. You could share that picture with me. I'm not talking about my mom yet. Huh?
01:07:10 - mark sweet
Did you feel the earthquake or did you feel the earthquake at all?
01:07:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
01:07:14 - mark sweet
He apparently didn't either. But we got shaped pretty many things.
01:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, what was it? How big? 4.4. Oh yeah, we wouldn't have a lot here, probably. That's the biggest one I was ever in was a, I don't know if it was 6.2 or 7.2, which that's a huge difference. was really big. I have to go up above. Anyway, we watched the street roll. It was interesting. All right. You, sir, take very good care of yourself and pet the flickers. All right. I will talk to you.
01:07:55 - mark sweet
Monday. Have fun.
01:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. Bye.
