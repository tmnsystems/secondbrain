00:00:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You There I am here. Hey, sorry. was just my friend. Just got a Yorkie. Oh She just sent me pictures as I had a caller. Sorry Well, you can see that picture.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god.
00:00:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's so cute Girl, Toby a boy boy idiot puppy. So I thought I'd bring some joy to your first beginning of the call.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you?
00:01:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, Happy New Year.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like been forever. I know it has.
00:01:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you have a good holiday? I did. I did. It was very relaxing. Um, it got to the point you're going laugh. I'm sure you've been there where I was like, okay, I've had enough of my mom.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need Maria time.
00:01:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, and you know, it's a drag. I was going to take her out Saturday to dinner and, uh, I guess she ate something bad in the morning because she never cancels because that's her highlight of the day, right?
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To go out.
00:01:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sundays usually she could, um, Paul and my sister-in-law take her for lunch and Saturdays, I usually do something with her and, um, or Amanda and I do something with her. Um, but yeah, she called and had a cancel because her stomach was upset because there's stomach bug going around So, yeah, yeah, but yeah, she's signed up now for, oh, I forgot what the class is called, anyway. It's not yoga, but it's something else every Tuesday. She does her art every Thursday afternoon, like she's a busy girl, like for 80, she's turning 89 in January, February 2nd, so, and, like.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably, why is she turning 89 because she's a busy girl and actually living her life.
00:02:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah, she is. I mean, she's not as independent as my dad was, so obviously little, little bit of that codependency she has on me and my brother, like my brother is in Charlotte, North Carolina, my sister's in Edmonton, I don't get to, they don't get to see my mom as often, but trust me, she's calling me almost every day, but it's okay. It's okay. So, how are you doing? How is your holidays and how's, what do you want to do, because I don't, you're okay. Okay. Okay.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do have a call. at noon um so like on the hour and i have backed about calm right now but um so the last conversation we had was let's just kind of reorient ourselves um that's what you were asking about and so why don't why don't we start there okay um what we could start with you just kind of like because i gave you an update on like what i was thinking and feeling and you know back and forth but today um like i know you still send out your emails i don't know if you were still making videos but um where are you feeling yourself right now and how's your client the one client that you had um for the five thousand dollars a month like are you still working with him right over oh yeah yeah um yeah uh he's doing good um he uh uh is wants to do a webinar this this month so kind of working on a
00:04:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
are funneled for him now, which makes sense to lead the low ticket buyers into there. I almost choked, though, when he showed me how much he's paying for his go high level account, he, you know, I came in with already a low ticket offer funnel there, and he's paying $197 a And I'm like, oh, like, because, you know, they had all the sales for 47, but I said, you know what, so switching, that's a bit of work involved. And you want to launch a new funnel this month, I'm not crazy about changing to a new go level account, or even a different, like, CCMIO for you, because the email sucked too. So I'm like, we need to get you on ConvertKit. So we're doing a tech stack kind of medium change, but his ads really sucked the last two weeks of December. I almost turned them all off because the CPMs are so high, because everybody and his brothers throwing their money at ad spend for their last 2024 ad budget happened. So I just told him the next month. Obviously, I'm not I'm working for you really last two weeks because we turned down all the ad spend everything. So let's me I'm gonna only charge it 500 for this month because You know, there's nothing I'm not doing is like work for you right now So and he really appreciated that because you kind of said you're the only one that's taken pretty share responsibility of of my stuff Because most ad consults have had the past just kept throwing money at it And I said well no like this you're paying three times more right now cost per thousand precious than much normal And until we get that normalized like I'd rather have you do like YouTube videos So I gave him three videos to do but he still hasn't done it because he also took like the two weeks off as well Which is fine. So he's great guy. I come a lot for extra cash. did take on another client Just landed this morning just 3,500 just to revise their webinar. So yeah, so nice. Yeah More than before Yeah, yeah, but not more work really No Revising a webinar file is kind of fun because it's like one done, right? It's like almost like selling a VIP day for 3,500 because really, you know, if my, I kind of, if my rate is open at all, as you think about it, seven solid hours of my time like spread out over two days, they're going to get a kick- thing. And then I do have a meeting on Wednesday with the founder of Miracle Needle. Yeah, we're going to Miracle Needle.
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The cognac noodle?
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, uh-huh.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have some on my kitchen.
00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he, Jonathan is his name. He wants to start Miracle University. Yeah, and like, so take his, like, he also has a Shopify Ecom store that's now about 80,000 buyers on it, and he sells on a recurring subscription. But he's also, I didn't know this as a founder, he's a dermatologist doctor, and he actually has helped people lower their blood sugar and other things.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he kind of wants to be cognac done.
00:07:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
as there you go. Yeah. So he wants to do like a blood sugar low ticket type offer and stuff. So I'll be talking him on Wednesday and see what that goes. So it's not kind of like I like the quick cash flow because I don't have that, right? Like, you know, so nice to have. Yeah, yeah. And then here's the other avenue that happened just on Sunday. I watch it Saturday, but Sundays, you know, you probably do the same thing.
00:07:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, don't really work much at all. Not at all. I don't work on Sundays.
00:07:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So Saturday, I talked to my friend, Art Carlos Navaros. He's the guy I was business partners with like 15 years ago. We started a couple of companies together. And he's the one that like got Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google to fund it and all that stuff. And now uses an emotional intelligence app in Phoenix and the hospital there. So he's been, we just been keeping friends because it was his birthday. He said, Hey, happy birthday. Like literally really top once a year now, you know, And he almost died, like about five years ago, had major heart issues. The doctor said, you need to stop working so hard and just relax or take a lot less stress jobs. So he doesn't start startup companies anymore because there's so much stress when you take money from a venture capitalist, right? And he moved to Mexico, he can speak fluent Spanish because he's born in Mexico, bring him young, well, there you go, you know this very well. They got brought him over to Salt Lake City. you know, he went and got a scholarship, bringing me young. And that's how he knows Eric Schmidt, because him and some other big high tech CEO, they all graduated together. So they're all good friends. Anyway, so his health is better now. He needed to live by the ocean to be by salt water, apparently. Yeah, because his blood, went to the best institutes in the world to try and figure out what's wrong from there. Like, there's something really weird about your blood, you need to reduce your stress and live by the ocean. and or else you're going to die in six months. That's what they basically told him. So he's done that. He's lost like 50 pounds. He's super healthy now. But why we've never really done business together in the last two years, he's been behind the scenes building infrastructure for cryptocurrency stuff. So not like starting this company to make millions, more, I'm getting paid decent money as a consultant, just helping these people do that. Because he's like really, really tech wizard guy. Anyway, I told him about all these no code apps on the weekend. I said, have you seen replete?
00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you seen this? you seen that? Oh, yeah.
00:09:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And he's like, oh my god. And then I told him about that one video I sent to him about that guy that started calories, calories app or whatever. take a picture of your phone and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that kid.
00:09:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm turning my light on real quick.
00:09:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll be right back. OK, yeah, it's dark. I'm listening now. No, no, no, Oh, so to make a long story short, he sends me a message two hours later, goes, I got a guy that will fund us 200k to start an app around it's disrupting the industry, our company way back in the day is called wild horse performance marketing back in the day, because we really believe and just left the Mustang right the wild horse right and just yeah, and but he's also a collector of cars and fixes cars like that's his hobby he likes to fix classic cars. So anyways, what his biggest pain is, eBay is still the only place to get really good parts for restoring cars, not that many places. So he's like, holy , what if I could take a picture of the put it by car, the part I'm looking for, and there's a change that automatically goes out with AI using that to all the resellers that have that. Basically replacing eBay for this in a totally new AI platform, iPhone, Android phone kind of way. So anyways, I don't know where it's going to go, but I don't know whether I'm even involved on it, but that shouldn't be that difficult to do with API integration. Well, exactly. Well, and again, he's like a super geek at this kind of stuff. So he kind of knows how to put it together. He's like wire framed it and everything. And, and so, uh, yeah, so I don't know if it's going to go anywhere, but, but one thing I will say, I'm just glad it inspired him again because he hasn't been inspired for years that I want to thank you because, you know, that fired my butt when I saw an eight year old kid, and I'm like, the hell here am I? know, because he's got all these patents under his name for all this tech. He, he was the chief technology officer for no bell networks.
00:11:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember no bell. I used to build networks in no bell.
00:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he told me that. Yeah, so his name is Carlos Tavaro. So I don't know know him or of him, because he's a Mormon, too. I thought maybe you might as well. But I don't know if you, anyway, but it may be because he's lived in the States. He's lived in South Korea for a while for a high tech company there. He said, Maria, that's the funniest place to be because you're in monastery. It's raising money. Like, that's where they got a lot of technology companies funded is in the monasteries there. Crazy. It is crazy. But anyway, so I guess that's just kind of cool. So yeah, to be honest, I've gone all over the map with this AI stuff. I don't know where it's going to land. That's when I'm going, OK, I still like the YouTube Fast Track, but I'm not loving the school group so much anymore. not really it's hard to get it collaborative people in it. And I'm like, gosh, it's only five bucks a month for God's sake. know, you know, because even last in the last two months, that's part of the problem, though. You know that, right? Well, that's what I'm about.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheat.
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, so I started to look at, so then I'm like, you know, if I've got someone that's willing to pay me more like 20K to do a little take a funnel like the Miracle Little Guy, I'm like, why am I dicking around with like, just all these little things, right? have just a couple of those for cash flow, but what do I really want to do? And it goes back to what you said, you know, the 50,000 month or past of like, like, it's is like, be a Maria Went kind of person, like, just have lots of product.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know you know her or follow her, but yeah, you tell me about her, but I, I am very resistant to patterning after anybody else, be, be Maria good at this.
00:13:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, that no, no, I don't mean pattern after, but I mean, her, she's got, I guess when I go back to when I was making a lot of money, and I was enjoying production of all the content and stuff. I was on momentum where I was creating a lot of low ticket products and about I'd never really had any high ticket product. Like I didn't have a 25K thing or whatever, right? was just, and the list and the momentum fed itself, you know, like people then would buy other pieces. So that's where I met by Maria Went because if you buy, like if you bought my micro-off or magic, they then need my Facebook ads course that I used to have, right? So that was before I knew Maria Went.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was like a few years ago. I think I see where you're going. If I also, wait, hold on, can you see my nails?
00:14:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God, I love it. I love it. Yay!
00:14:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My friend did it for me and she feels like she hasn't been herself for a few years. And I said, well, I can pay you for this or we can trade. And she says, but my time, she goes, I can't afford you. That's not a fair train. I'm like, it is. my friend. And, but I, by the end of the year, I said, you're going to feel like yourself again, at least much, much closer to yourself. And she's so creative and entrepreneurial and does all these things. She, she's LDS also. She's from Spain.
00:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
the baredi tikka na accent, okay? Oh, nice. She's gorgeous.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She she has a YouTube channel. She has a thinkific course. Like, I don't just meet, you know, sister at church that are staying home. I have stuff like this. So it's it's really cool. But um, anyway, so you seem to be kind of aligning with really similarly what I have been thinking. So I love and will keep my high end level clients that I spend very little time with, but get paid really well for for two reasons. Number one, it's very fulfilling for me. Two, it keeps my saw sharp. Three, I keep connected to a powerful network that can always get me business. But also, I become part of the powerful network that can help other people. So it's reciprocal and symbiotic. But I also so want to build many small little engines offers that on themselves but they don't need to be coaching they don't really need support it can either all be automated or outsourced i build it and they're just income generations but they're also audience builders because all of those customers are an audience that i can leverage if i needed a platform for anything so you know you already have existing products you get excited and creative and want to have little modes you can create another one and you can just plug it into your ecosystem you know like maria has that catalog kind of like having a catalog site but also it continues to establish yourself as a marketing expert which then you know somehow high-end people they're tentacles because one of the main Commonalities among really, really, really high earners is they are students, they are learners and they are always studying from all these from people. They buy their courses. And so that is how they identify geniuses that are unknown that are underground because they buy their stuff and they reach out. And that's how, you know, get some of these connections also. But so one of the thoughts that I had is one of the ways that we can work together is just show up and rip off of each other because this high level, like high level one on one kind of mastermind, because now we don't have to listen to everybody else's stuff.
00:17:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We also don't get the benefit of listening to other people's stuff.
00:17:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're both at a very unique point in our lives where it's just kind of like you're here taking care of your mom as long as your mom's here. That won't be forever, but it could be another 10 years. It could be another 15 years. Acknowledging is in the way she is. I'm here raising kiddos, you know, so I'm like kind of grounded in this area of um, I want to work and do things but also family is a huge priority, but also I have a decades of experience I'm not the average marketer by any means.
00:18:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Can I just make a quick bathroom make? I'm be right back so I have a lot of tea and waters Got you You You Okay, I'm back and now I can get more water.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You
00:20:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God, I am so relieved that you're saying this because I love the idea because like, oh my gosh.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There was more to it though. There was a little bit more. So the only other thing is that you're more likely for this to happen than me. It could happen, but because of your tech connections and world. It would be cool still if there's a high end partnership that we do that is still not a, you know, it's not coaching and whatever where maybe you're leading the marketing and I'm helping with the project management. So you're not overwhelmed by a tech genius who has all these ideas and going all over the place.
00:20:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you're not corralling them by yourself.
00:20:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can be focused on marketing. I can really focus on project management, but we can hire junior marketers, junior project managers, so that we're not taking a lot of time, but we're really. like kind of more like sea level operators with the person, and we don't have to be very expensive, but it definitely will be worthy of our fees.
00:21:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know what I mean?
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe we get, you know, two to four to six thousand dollars a month from somebody who's got an investment, but with that, we have the obligation of doing things within a timeline, which means we get the visionary to agree, like, look, you know, we're all, you have to, investors want to get paid, so you need to stay on track. If we agree to doing something, then we go MVP, we get the minimum viable product, we will agree on what the key concept is, we will agree on what the marketing strategy is, and we will agree on what the budget is for bringing it to fruition.
00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Here are your responsibilities, right?
00:21:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the, the, your, you're responsible for the tech, you're responsible for making sure that the project is physically built, you're responsible for making sure we've got a clear marketing message and we've done all the market research and we know that there's an audience and a buyer for this and then my job would be to make sure that everything that you two need gets created, plugged together on time, the accountability questions so that you don't have to rustle, you could just stay in your lane and do that.
00:22:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what would be a typical client then for that, just help me envision that?
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't have a typical client, anybody, well there has to be money and there has to be a concept that has a market for it that that can be sold.
00:22:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So like an app you're talking about or like it could be an app, it could be a product, it could be a physical product.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because it could be an app or a physical product that has complementary affiliate type products or so let's say, for example, Noodle Guy, right? He has a physical product, but he also can create educational products teaching people about how to manage glucose levels. There is a plethora of affiliate partners or other supplements that he could create to complement glucose management. The awareness is constantly changing day-by-day, the market is expanding day-by-day, this is the time for the innovator to come in and do something. So if we've got not just single product that is unique, his Miracle Noodle is unique, there's nothing like it in the stores. It's got five calories for a packet and there's nothing in it.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it fills you up and it regulates it's it's basically glucose regulating fiber but instead of a capsule you eat it so you also feel full but they were um he's only in one chain grocery chain in Canada so actually I went to it and they were sold out so I had to buy the computer competitor to it because I forgot what it was which I still like but I was amazed I sold out so I ordered someone Amazon the other day because I was like okay that's something I'm gonna get it yeah they haven't our natural groceries here I I found it but I haven't eaten it but I've had cognac noodles somewhere else um or the other thing could be art as the client potentially because if he gets the two k funding um he's he's gonna need a you know he's gonna need to put it together like so sorry um so yeah all of them come down to just making sure that the guardrails are where they need to be right so if the budget is small
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the time that they get is small, but we make it count and make it impactful. If they want more time and more support, it just has to fall within the realm of our effective hourly rates.
00:25:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. know. And we have to really see that it makes sense to put it in the market, right? To get ourselves in an uphill battle, we're like, how is this going to convert? Like, we can't see that. How are we going to come down to other people?
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah. And honestly, like, my thinking maybe is that you test with some clients. I mean, I'm just spitballing here with you. Like custom chat GBT's or workflows that they could easily make a lot less because like the other night, I was on the side of the site that I like, I can't believe he's offering this. I don't know if I sent you his stuff as well, but he, he, I just asked for a refund from AppSumo for Task Max. It was, which was like 350 dot box, but I'm like, okay, I just wasted more time and a vase time trying to figure it out, because I'm supposed to automate workflow and I wanted it to go and automate going into logging into the IQ, finding the outlier videos, tripping the title, and the description from the YouTube video like the transcription, and resetting a new hook based on my voice, right, for the video, not write a whole transcript for the video. I don't believe in that, but I think it could, but more like write the hook like the first three sentences and the title. And that would save me a lot because I did sell a couple at mid Christmas time, like just to, for 997 done for you, you get on a call for me for two hours and we're going to map out your next two months of content for your YouTube channel. You're going to walk away with the videos you're supposed to do like one a week, the YouTube title, the YouTube thumbnail, the keywords, takes keywords and everything. Automate all that because right now I haven't manual and I have a VA that knows my process now and does it and Paulie Engen was one of the customers and she loves it like she's like this is an amazing service. Yeah, yeah, hopefully So I mean I could have her as a testimony if I wanted to get that going But I was pissed off at the software that I bought that was supposed to be able to help you do it But then now I found this guy he's only charging 25 bucks a month at this school community But he actually creates all these AI agents or these workloads for you and you can probably license or commercialize it from me.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh wait, who is that?
00:27:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? I need that? Oh, yes Hello, it's like corpsman. Let me let me see if I can find his School community because I literally just joined it.
00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, it's going to school That is the kind of person I want to be paying.
00:27:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, because also I I bought Swell.ai like that about, you know, it doesn't cost much maybe 10 bucks a month or so But it's also not easy to figure out because that's supposed to get your YouTube URL and then automatically create like tweets for you, like 10 tweets from that YouTube video and post it for you, right? And I'm like, well, that's a service I'll do. And that's the Cody Shatter guy that I think is a cool guy. But anyway, but it's really, it's harder to figure out my VA can't figure it out. So I'm like, okay, then on this guy, AI for business, this is the link. It's only 25 bucks a month. His name is Corbin, young guy, Corbin Brown, Corbin Brown. And I don't know if he's answered my question yet. Jumped to last comment. Oh, he has answered my question. I said, I found you by YouTube and love your style. I'm here to learn more about AI making apps workflows from my business, clients currently act as fractional CMO for influencers, help them monetize. I just had to say some stuff, right? But I would love some automation workflow app related to some of my clients needs. Should I buy your AI tweet alerts? So he's made a thing. That's only like $5 for me to buy. And you put in the YouTube URL and it'll create the tweets for you. And he answers things. Right now, you're the item we found here in my classroom materials. So maybe I don't have to buy it because maybe it's here. And he's a video showcasing how to use it. So automates. So let's just go to the videos so can see it. Let's automate your content creation process. I'm going show you a simple Zapier Automation here.
00:29:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to take a new YouTube video and then automatically post I was not expecting that voice.
00:29:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no. So he's like just a lucky young guy all over the place.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got to be expecting a voice from Russia, you know, you see.
00:29:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's where most of these photos are like urnasium or something like that. Top Asian. Yeah. Yeah. And then if I go to, so then he's saying go here. It's just going be found here. Yeah. Yeah. So this is what, so I tweet somewhere in here. versus, uh, does that create a web prompt engineer?
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, um, let me, because I'm looking at the clock and I know I got to get ready for my call. Oh, so, um, I have been using the crop out of the AI. I wish I had more time for it. One of the things I do want to do though is spend my money to hire people to help and the thing. So I've got cloud pro and chat, TPT pro. I'm looking at co-pilot and, um, Gemini. So co-pilot's Microsoft and Gemini is Google. Um, made two bots myself on my local computer. So using Python, I figured out how to make my first Python app. So I have two Python apps now and they can connect with API. So I've connected with Slack and Trello and my bots are present in Slack and Trello and I can interact with them and talk to them and they do functions. So now I just need to. use that function. I've used make.com to create my own automation recipes. So I think I showed it to you once with Etsy. So what make.com was able to do, go to Etsy, and anytime there was a new product, it would search for the new product, it would pull the product image and the product description, and then it would connect to chat GPT and rewrite a personal description that was good for social media. then the Facebook and I posted it to Pinterest, and it posted it to Instagram. So these were all separate things. So I can make a lot of the automation and this, this is what I'm looking at. So like your YouTube automations might be something that we could build on a local machine or these bots. But I'm so distracted by this, I'm trying to look away from the screen because the scrolling, I can't.

Oh, oh, give you hair. Oh, sorry, because I was going to say like, yeah, so here's the, anyway, so that's what he's selling. $14 like AI tweet new podcast like these got another one AI tweet YouTube Transcroll slower here for second. Yeah, you know, that's the one that I was looking at and let me Scrilion so yeah, so it's like any recommends to use buffer because the API to Twitter or access better apparently but like this thing is only like Like fourteen dollars or you can get a commercial license for twenty seven dollars in an act of white label it.

Yeah Well What I would love to do is spend our time Kind of three levels, but this is a year like really have no new clients, but partnerships, right? So It may be still like a contractor type level, but it would be more like we For all intents and purposes our partnership with a creator you focus on marketing I focus on the cohesion of the whole project and driving it to finish ASAP at minimum viable product, keeping everybody on task, everybody focused, and making sure that we're running in front of problems before they happen. Like the smoothest execution anybody's had, that's where I shine. But falling within our realm of effective hourly rate with the goal of continuing to increase it, we're only working with dream clients, period. So if it's not a dream client, we don't take it, we don't have to. The rest of our time is spent using automations to build micro catalogs for like a, you know, a huge catalog of micro products, that type of thing, micro offers, that we just keep stacking and use as many automations as possible to not only manage but create them, create new products and new variations. So anyway, that's what I would love to see happen. I want to have maximum freedom of time. amount of time that I have to work so that I can spend it learning which creates knowledge that I use to leverage to get more money and less time. Money to do whatever I want to do including take care of the people that I want to take care of. Also hire the people that I want to hire to keep leveraging them and then high level activities and functions to keep the you know that companionship with high minds high level minds that just feeds my fire like us getting to talk and rip you know I get fired up because I'm like you know you you think at a higher level than most people do and you working and expanding and so anyway that's that's what I would like to see and do. So let's think about how that works like if you want to outline what you want to accomplish with YouTube. Let me tell you if I can find like or suggestions for how you execute that and implement it. We could do it as maybe like, if I build something out, maybe it's a 5% profit sharing or something, you just be like, here, Tina, I'll give you 5%. You help me with these things and I do it. Something like that, I have no idea.
00:35:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not attaching anything little. just, yeah, think it'd be a higher percentage for you than that. But yeah, yeah, because I mean, catch it. That was 25. It was also the year of just freaking AIFI opportunities and workflow opportunities.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we're going to need free time to learn these things. Yeah. And that will create leverage for us in our, you know, we have less energy, we're getting older and older. This is, to me, this is the time, this is the key time for leverage opportunity. But it's going to be boots on the ground. We are the boots on the ground learning AI from the inside out in real time so that we will be experts in our fields and understand how to leverage it, no matter who's talking to us, those people are going to have deep pockets and need somebody who's got integrity and knowledge and takes fiduciary responsibility, All of these things that are very unique and hard to find that we offer, paired with deep and wide understanding of how to leverage these tools.
00:36:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool, yay.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we're talking again on Thursday but I would really love to have more touches throughout the week just staying connected and but if you would get me that like what you want to build out, I think I could come up with some ideas and that also my biggest thing is I need practical application so anything I learn for somebody else, I'll be like oh
