00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, hey, long time no see I know it feels like I don't like it.
00:00:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's been a month or so. Yeah, I didn't know if we were meeting today or that was like a legit invite. I guess you get it set up now for monthly calls.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, we could do we could do every other week. Um, like I don't and just figure out what works for you. You've been very busy and very quiet with your head down working. So yeah, I don't know what to do. I don't know what you need, what you want right now.
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, it's just, uh, you're in a good flow. It seems like. Yeah, I mean, I'm just my day. I mean, it's summer. So yeah, so it's really about like maximizing the mornings and, um, I mean, I, I work. in the afternoon too, but like, it's just mornings just my jam. So like, it's actually, it's funny. was actually getting ready to write an update.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. I did, I thought the morning six, twenty six, twenty four. I was like, oh, I'm like, okay. And I left some comments too, but mostly just about what I want to talk about from the notes that you left last week. But so go ahead.
00:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, just, I guess just quickly, like, things are going well with Tim, Tim's the Jim Profit, Jim Solutions guy. I'm working on a new sales letter, well, promotion for probably middle of July, so I'm looking out for them.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And and your results paid for many months of working with you.
00:01:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that's pretty. Yeah, in our officially our. 90 days will end on July 17th, so probably after the 4th, I'll send him an email and just acknowledge like, hey, we're coming up at the end of our 90 days. Do you want to continue working together and review the results of the promo and then this new promo that I'm writing for them?
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would recommend saying, hey, you know, that that last promo basically paid for me for the next nine months, so what do you say? Keep working together and here's what we do and that there's no way, you know, that you're not going to keep making more money for what I'm doing, so I'm thinking it's a no brainer and and I'm telling you because I just did that with one of my attorneys. So last year, I talked to, so I have an attorney that has another office and he's got like, sits attorney.
00:03:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
journeys that work for him.
00:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last year, I talked to two of them. One of them was his top performer and one of them was his bottom performer. And the top performer was like, I don't need you, I'm good. Which was okay, because she's the top performer. the other one was like, yeah, I've got all these goals, I could do this, I could do that. And I gave them a couple of books. I, you know, after listening to him, I'm why don't you just work on this one thing? And he did, and he doubled his attorney fees. So he went from a million dollars to two million dollars attorney fees. And so this last week, I was talking to him, because he was talking about wanting to do some work. I'm like, well, I mean, the results paid for itself last year. You could be in pay me every month and you'd still be in profit from hiring. So that's a brainer.
00:03:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You guys. Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, just don't think about what the return is. And so just pointing it out in simple math, like right in front, like, you know, when we do the numbers exercise, the numbers just make it a no-brainer. like, oh, duh, I mean, already ROI form the initial investment plus eight more months, you know. So it's just, if you want the job, that's the no-brainer offer.
00:04:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll, yeah, I'm thinking after the fourth is when I'll put any mail together, but that's, you know, and I'll definitely point out, like, you know, we brought it, we did 45k to own our first promotion. And what are the profit sharing, like, profit partner kind of arrangement? Yeah, I mean, I think that that can be in the future. I mean, honestly, like, right now, I mean, I kind of, I kind of like getting the 5K every month and, and that, that feels like it's serving more what I need right at the moment.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just guaranteed it's there.
00:05:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah, but it's also giving me just like, I mean, the competences, I'll just say it. I feel like there's a better word, it's giving me Or it's holding my eyes to like, you know, I can, like, I can go and if this falls through with Tim, like, I'll, I'll go to somebody else and I can handle, you know, writing their copy of their emails. I think one of the things I've learned working with Tim is like, because. He's got a very specific strategy that he's wanted to do, that he is doing in a space with group, and we're following this client and community guys for Stapleton, and he's got a partner for his name, but you know, it's like I'm writing, I guess this is the first time that I'm really executing on what the actual work to be like a lightweight influencer of sorts, and I say lightweight because it's only like one post a day where I think of like a TikTok influencer or putting out a bunch of short form content, so it's a different type, but it's a different type of content, and it's, I was thinking about this, like I think It really is the first time that I've done this kind of thinking and work of like creating social media content, tying it to a promotion that I know is coming to three weeks from now and thinking about like seeding these little agreements in my posts. And that and that's that part is cool. But I where I'm going with that is like I kind of that like that's fun to think about for somebody else and do it for them. It is not the thing that I would want to do for me as a guest. So yeah, there are two things I want to talk to you about right there.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, you're doing one of my favorite strategies, one of my favorite levers, which is getting paid to learn and to sharpen yourself off. So this is a really, really viable skill, even if you don't want to do it. or so doing it for other people, it's important to know the logistics of how it works and why it works. I'm the same way I don't want to do any of the stuff for myself. What I can do for everybody else, I almost always cannot do for myself. I can do a little bit of it. But I think about doing it for myself and like new, not going to happen. Just I can, I won't. Part of that by the way is in alignment with 80 and negative dysfunction. And that can be a really normal thing for most entrepreneurs.
00:08:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It tends to be for like all of my clients.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can always treat everybody else differently. So there's that. But if you have enough clients of your own, we're not doing a lot of work, we can hire somebody that can do this for you. That will extract from you what they need to do. That's very good at doing this. But because you already have the skill and knowledge, when they're driving, you can go actually, why don't we tweet this and that? So it goes to the same kind of thing that you like to do when it comes to copy, which is copy cheating, not the junior copywriting, right, you don't want to start from scratch. So if you have enough funds where you can hire somebody for maybe $1,000 a month. And obviously, you'd need to be where you're really comfortable and you've got that. So the goal would be maybe another Tim or two, if it doesn't take a lot. Because that's an extra $10,000, which you could even use for a junior copywriter, you know, a little bit of it. So, so that you're not adding too much work. But that could be really leveraged. And so now you can hire somebody to work in your own business, who's very skilled, but you don't need a lot of time to build out a social media campaign. So it's not like they got to work 40, 20 hours, you know, maybe 10 hours.
00:09:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But it isn't about the hours, it's about the results.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if they're really good at what they do, you know, if you're just paying like, it's a flat rate, here's the job. Do you agree to accomplishing this job? for this amount of money and you know so it's you know per the project or whatever you can do that and there's a lot of people with that skill now you know now versus three years ago four years ago 10 years ago like it's so much different yeah um so but you being sharp on this and the extra money coming in um the tea money I feel like is for sure going to come in don't know what the titans numbers look like but you guys have been pretty steady you've learned about what the bootcamp does you're doing the podcast app you didn't leave any notes about that so I'd love to know about that but it feels like you're leveraging and you're building this um financial kind of moat and hedge that could support you having a small surgical strike team for yourself yeah um I have thought about just needing just getting one other person like a copywriter
00:11:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
down the road if because I'm thinking like I could do that I could get another time like I could manage that and I would bring on somebody to help with that and but I don't feel ready to take that step and go out and pursue that just yet but it's on my mind and I've got a few people in mind that I would reach out to that I feel like I could get a it wouldn't be hard to get a yes from them and they would well I guess I don't know if they would pay five grand but I was like that that's gonna be my my minimum that's gonna be my to do what I do and cuz like it Like I put my whole My brain into this and like I consume all their go through all their courses and you know the to just learn the product and I just feel like the level of service that I Bringing in the the copy that I fruit not just a copy of just like thinking through like I put the whole promotion or the bonuses and like all this Like the whole package like it's Yeah, I just realized like that that's what I am gonna do. That's what I'm gonna want to do because I feel like that's gonna Give us the best chance of succeeding and so for that You know, I'm grand Which I think is an insane deal and bargain Which is why I was talking about when I was talking about the profit sharing and I was talking about a flat rate of five grand plus
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know a percentage of like a very tiny percentage like maybe even one percent of the net profits from the promo.
00:13:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like not a business just from the promo like a performance bonus. Yeah, that could be a possibility. And they're great guys. It's 10 and I don't know if they're super great and laid back. And they're very hands off. know, this is awesome. They don't get in my way.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean you've earned that too with who you are. You have a reputation, you're in an environment where you are positioned as an authority and so but there are people you know that they do know how to do that research and spend that time studying everything I think a lot of the female copywriters are probably more in line to do that and not charge a whole lot but there's also a lot of copywriters who just aren't they're not marketers for themselves so they can sell everybody else's stuff but themselves so they don't charge the highest rates they don't ask super high fees and but they just want consistent work and they want to work with good people that don't abuse them these copywriters who get abused a lot like they're responsible for all the sales even if there's crappy product bad people who don't know how to manage their business give good information, um, they're lying about what they're trying to sell, like all kinds of things, right? But it's a copywriter's job to make everything work. That and the media buyers, like that's it, some of the most ridiculous kind of expectations that are put on those type of people. But for you, like, if you had, let's say, two more clients and then you wouldn't want to do them back to back go in for yourself and really know their stuff inside out. Um, you know, like, I don't like to stack on new clients all at once because I, I, I dream about everything. Like, that's how much it's in my head because I don't know things yet. And my brain can't stop thinking about it because I have all these questions until I have a really good view of things or a good enough view. literally can't rest mentally. because I'm still trying to work it out and process it. And so, you're going and you're learning all these things. And I know your brain is always going. You're always thinking about stuff. So you had to kind of keep that in mind. But if you set the intention of trying to find somebody that you can work with that chart is a lot less than you do, that can do some different stuff, like maybe you give them an assignment of going through all these sales pages, all these email sequences and coming back and giving me a report. What this is, give me a few samples. instead of digging into all the different sources, you can just look at this. Maybe it's a document with a snapshot of here's a here's a literal picture of some of the copy from the website, some of the copy from the thank you page, some of the copy from the email sub all in one thing. So that's saving you time from click, click, click, click, click, right? But also what you know is that they've actually been into it, they've actually looked at it, and they've given you a report back and said, okay, here's what I see, right, this is a weak spot that they have, right, they're really not highlighting their USP, they really don't have a good hook, but here's a hook I did find, here's, you know what I mean, there's a process, and if you're looking at doing this for another 10, 20 years, 30, whatever, like I would imagine that long, I would like to see you make enough money where you can just start investing at your money's working for you. But you're going to be doing this for a long time anyway, so you really should be sending an intention of, I've got a solid junior copywriter or two that I'm working with who are, you know, really happy to be working with me because I'm a good guy and I'm not going to get them bad clients, I'm going to give them, you know, as consistent work as possible, but they're still contractors, which means you're not their financial protector. looks like maybe is it a male or female is it there's a lot of childless women in the copy world I don't know you know but there are and they also do not charge the same kind of rates as their male counterparts they're very loyal they're incredibly smart and and they love working for really great people you're the type of person that would that they would love working with and working for so that's something that you can kind of just tuck in your cap and know um kind of set a magnet out you know looking for that because you've come across them throughout the talking you've mentioned this person that person whatever and I'm like that's very interesting to me because I've been noticing it more and more so anyway those are just some things to think about because you're right on that press this. It's going to be one day you're like, okay, it's time to pull the trigger. And that's very soon. Especially with the results you got with that promo.
00:20:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know, I know. well, I just turned out, yeah, yesterday, today's Wednesday, Monday, that there were three more new call appointments that came in last week for this week. they're using for the offer that I wrote. And they're using on their sales calls, the offer, the whole promo that I put together. Because before it was just here's an eight week course. We do weekly calls. And I turned it into this. Well, not an intern. Communicated what it actually was is not like I created something. It's just like they got so much more than just like an eight-week Course and yeah, but they would just we're doing a disservice and Leaving money on the table talking about it. Yeah, and now I'm working on this new promo, which is really cool It's all about how to turn switch your gym to is what's called a semi semi-private model and So it's like a hybrid of one-on-one and small group, but it's a four to six People in a class, but each one's got it their own individual customized workout and Like that's the model that Tim runs in his gym and they just you charge like a hundred bucks a week um for this kind of special specialized attention and community and You know at that at that rate like just to get to half a million in a year, you need less than 100 members doing a semi-private model and so it's, mean, can probably tell it's interesting to me because I'm into fitness, I don't really want to start a gym or anything, but it's interesting getting to know this market. And like just understand their financial issues and then now helping them make this switch to doing a semi-private model and seeing like how lucrative that can be for somebody who really is passionate about you coaching somebody and their fitness journey.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, go ahead, keep on.
00:23:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But like I was working on this promo today, I just went through all the training material, and that's the initial hook or headline that I'm working around. I'm going to write tomorrow morning around this idea, but it's something around how to build a $500,000 a year business with less than a hundred members, a $500,000 a year gym business with less than a hundred members. Something in that ballpark is where I'm thinking that that will be the hook, and then the sales letter describes how that happens.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you happen to know the attrition rate?
00:23:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not off the top of my head, but oh, for semi-private, it's not as high as tradition. like control access.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, so that's a hook right there. Yeah, that's a that's a massive hook right there because I would think it would be higher because of the amount of money. No, that means if I'm a business owner and I read that, I'm like, yeah, but like, how many people do I actually have to, how many times do I have to fill in that hundred, you know, like, and not everybody because I don't think everybody thinks about attrition, but I do. So, but anyway, but again, we'll have the numbers tell the story for you. Right, because it's a really powerful thing to say you only have to get 100 yeses, right, 100 people to say yes to this offer. don't need to get, you know, 500 or 1000 people like it's 100. And if the attrition rate, let's say it's 40%, you know, 140 people to say yes, that still sounds very doable. You break that up across, you know, the months or whatever, like just if you show them how easy it is, if you're providing this offer, this service, and also if you could show them, you know, where does it work? Does it only work in metro areas? Does it work in rural areas? Does it work in certain areas that have a medium income of X or whatever? Like if you were to do some data like that and do some case studies, put that on the website, which of course that takes time to build and to to see because it's a newer type of offer. But that's something that you can be working on with Tim and say, look, these are all the things that like basically build yourself a job for the next year. Like this is what we're building, this is what we're working on. We have to be getting these case studies. We're going to continue to get this data, but the data is going to continue to change as more people are doing it. going to get more information. But either way, like it's already paying for itself over and over again. And so get on board.
00:26:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Let's do this stuff.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, but you could also be in terms of like you always want to be giving back to people. You be changing the fitness industry where people actually might be showing up more consistently because they're actually getting one on one health customized health. It's semi-private. So, you know, they're not paying as much as they would. So it's a little like, but that's not the word restrictive. And, you know, it could be making something really great, more available to more people than it was, but also allowing the trainers and the gym members because they're working with more people consistently because you're helping them stay full, be able to sharpen their saws and get better at what they do. So, like, just a little criss over here with a copywriting $5,000 a month. But I was just like taking over making a huge difference in the world. to me, that's the kind of stuff I love about what I do in my business. And maybe nobody else is acknowledging the impact that you're making. But if you look at it, that's a huge impact.
00:27:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Totally. And I mean, really, the comparison, guess, the Apple, it'd be more Apple's to comparison my private to one-on-one personal training.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, as I was thinking about it. Definitely. But there are, like I knew once that like orange theory, their average, do you know orange theory? No. that would be considered a large group model so that you go from station to station. Okay. So everybody's doing the same workout. You can have up to 30 people. know.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like circuitry.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, but that's right now. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, so that'd be a large group model. And you can, you know, that you can make more than just doing like a general admission gym doing by having these larger groups. But like orange theory, they're, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? The people leave on average after three or four months, their memberships last so long. usually it's not that, not that long. Um, but what ends up happening with, uh, semi-private is there's a, there's there's a onboarding, like there's a way that Tim sells it because I've gone through his training and, um, he, he kicks off the semi-private by bringing, he has a, an event because of the state of the union. as Jim, and he just brings in members and holds this two-hour event, and he just lets know where the fitness industry is going, then he introduces, he's got this whole script of how you introduce semi-private and compare it to one-on-one, but it's not as expensive as one-on-one, and then he's got two different ways he does contracts with people when they come in, so it's like, he's got a really solid team. I forget where I was going with that, but I do want to talk a little bit about Titans, switching gears, like Brian, he's been laying a little low. We've got the Over-Deliver Bootcamp coming up next month, and I'm I had a call with him. Oh, it his past Monday we met and he's having a procedure done on his on his heart. He shared with me a small, like outpatient, he said, but he's been having not, he said, I'm not going into a fib, which he was doing that like all the time before his last surgery, but he would he call it. Not palpitations or rhythmia, maybe.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what it was, I think.
00:30:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
you know, he's, he's, and he was apologetic. He's like, I know, I've been, he owes me things and I figured something was going on because he's, he's usually faster to respond. you've watched him withdraw and then seen why he withdraws. Mm hmm. Um, and I brought up, I said, we haven't talked about this event in a while, and last time we spoke like we were doing it in January, and he was like, ah, don't know. He started doing this thing that he does. And, um, he, you know, he's using, this is going to sound more, I don't know, know, to come across this way, but he's using his health as an excuse to not really think about the, the event and, and plan that. So, whether that's, you can say it's legit, like, all right, if you need to do that, then that's totally fine. And I'll just, I'll just accept that, like, that's It's what he needs to do, because I'm not going to tell him, you know, uh, the alternative, I guess, but, but it just got me thinking because then he was like, you know, I don't know, like January of 2026, we could do this event, but I was just like, you know, it since Monday, I just, I've always, um, I've always just felt like I'm on this little bit of a roller coaster. With Brian in terms of like how he wants to show up, and, you know, get, and he even told me, he's like, you know, I'm like two or three times your age, and, and I'm like, you know, there's going to be probably in the near future where he just wants to not do this anymore.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that's where I'm pretty new. Like he's been sun setting for a while.
00:32:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off like I just, but that's, that is the thing. that we've been watching and there is, you know, there are kind of, at the very least right now, two things to look at. You have great respect and reverence for Brian and appreciation for him and overall this is his business. However, you have been deeply invested in it, you have nurtured it, you have been the primary reason for not only its growth, but its maintenance for probably the last four years or so. Whenever he had a stroke, I feel like it was around 2020, that wasn't it? It was around there, yeah. And you have not only been invigorating to his business, but you have been invigorating to his life. And it's not even about feeling entitled to any particular thing. even though you've earned stuff, it's that the writing is on the wall that Brian's pace is probably permanently changed. ability, like his fire is flickering. It's not extinguished. It bursts up a little bit. It goes down a little bit based on health, life circumstances, but it has definitely altered significantly, and I would be shocked if it's not permanently. I know he's a peptide, I do believe that there are miraculous things that can happen. I don't think Brian has the willpower and the drive inside of him to drive to it. He doesn't seem like a hardcore driven person anymore. Like I think that part has flickered out and been replaced by family and life, which is okay. But... I think that that was a priority shift that changed permanently. And if he truly does have everything that he needs set aside financially, that he doesn't have to make more money, then that has to come into it too. And you are just hitting your stride of like, I am a business man. I got skills, I can bring money, I can grow, and all of these other people, there's a market that is begging to be served, quality content, quality service. I'm here to do it, you know, and now you're being throttled. You've been throttled. You've been throttled since I met you with Brian not showing up. And this is with all due respect. It isn't about bad-mouthing him for it.
00:35:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, we've had this conversation many times. We don't really need to say it, but I do.
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's just a real- be difficult situation to be in. So back to, you know, what can you do? I think, at some point, like, I think you really have to keep leaning into building the thing that you build, and pacing stuff out, and letting go of like, don't even try to plan events with Brian, you know, I just, because it will, you deserve to not be frustrated, but also the power of that frustration can be so detrimental to your happiness, to your peace, to your productivity, and all of your happiness and peace impacts how you show up as a dad. And even if it's just a slight diminishing, it's going to be perpetual because this is the pattern that Brian has over and over again, commit to something, doesn't do it for really valid reasons in terms of like, you know, but it, but that, that is what it is. So I would be looking for, how do we nurture Titans, Accelerator, and as with as little dependence upon Brian as possible, what does that model look like, where it's at the very least maintaining its revenue for you and for him, very at the very least maintaining its value and reputation, which I think that you can do like you could probably do all the over delivered book camps by yourself and people still feel good because you're showing up in the Titans world so much and so many of them are so new that and you've been there since day one, that's potentially it. You know, something to think about along that path but really just how do you build it independent of Brian where he can be like, surprise, I'm here. Yeah, everybody. I did not be, but nothing that requires he has to show up. think there's still a lot of financial potential for you, where that's not stressful. Because the other option is, like, can I at leaving, giving an ultimatum of like, this is how it's going to be, or maybe just give me a higher percentage because this is a lot to deal with, and also give me more power over what happened without having to get your approval, because you're bottlenecking and I'm trying to build and grow. And I understand why you're doing it. You've got real needs, but so do I. Like, I'm in business and I might give half at least of my time to this. anyway, that's a lot to think about. It's a lot to process. But maybe that's just something that you can work through because you tend to really Defer to just supporting Brian and just being like it is what it is and not taking care of yourself the way that you ought to and advocating for yourself. And I think that you should advocate for yourself I think that you have more than earned it. And it isn't just advocating for yourself, but the business and the customers that you serve, they need stability and reliability also.
00:39:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, you know, we're doing rolling out two things inside of TXL that I think is going to help with retention. One is you know about the public podcast, the timeless marketing and that's more about bringing people in, but we were also putting all the calls from TXL into a private podcast. Podcast. that only members can access, and so that's going to make it easier for everybody to be able to access the call recordings right from their phone, like inside the Apple podcast app or Pocketcast or whatever podcast app they use. And the other one is we're starting accountability pods within the group that's led by the members. And so they'll have a set schedule that they meet on. You know, they'll be independent of our two to three calls a month. And so the hope there is that that's going to help foster the community and get people connected. You'll hold people accountable to reaching the goals that they have. Those two things are giving or rolling out the podcast I'll announce, probably before July 4th, pods, I put the initial plan together and sent to Brian and this one of the things he owes me, all in feedback on, but I've been thinking, like don't feel anger or fear, I feel little after that call with Brian, but I've just kind of been thinking like, all right, I want to keep TX all going and I want to keep growing, break through advertising. And in the long term, I still would like to, you know, be a part of break through advertising for forever. you know, whenever the point comes of like Brian passes away, you know, we'll have, whenever Jean's wife Barbara passes away is when we'll because her son will get it. Yeah. Yeah. At that point.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How old is she?
00:42:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, she's like 90 something. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's up there, but, um, yeah, and not rocking the boat, you know, when, when there's that kind of investment and, and I, it's not a just selfish, like I go, wait for him to die and I get this kind of thing.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that it's, I mean, all these relationships are nuanced, um, but that goes back to how do you nurture titans, independent. of Brian where he can just you know show up and less it when he wants to and can but that the stability of it is anchored on the things that you do steadily so that you know it's there you're taking care of he's taking care of and the market is taking care of like I think that you've gotten the ability to do that and I think that just not trying to have big events but I realize that there was a big part of it there's a lot of potential for it there's a lot of connection but but based off of every single year there's been something that has for the last four years at least that has really just been overwhelming for Brian and he's had to pull back for a while so and an event takes months and he he always, for the last few years, has seemed to be, and even before, you know, four years ago, in the beginning, you were like, he wants to get out of the masterminds, like the in-person stuff. So, he's been pulling steadily back out of showing up in person and overcommitting to things for years. That's just not, I can't see that changing. So, to even consider doing something like that and hoping it's going to be able to come to fruition, first of all, could be really detrimental to the brand because people get excited and they want to have it. And then, you know, can only get disappointed so many times before you like tease. Almost, you know, they're hardcore people. and it didn't hurt his brand. Well, you can't say that. But die-hard fans will stay die-hard fans.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? Yep.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not all you have in the market. And that's not the only people seeing the stuff that happens. It's also the new people coming in. And so just kind of taking that into account. I think that you can create the thing that just maintained a steady pace where you get to grow and serve the market and just kind of wait for the inevitable, even if it takes years, whether it's Jane's wife or Brian. But I think that compartmentalizing and just kind of putting titans into, putting TXL into like a portion of your day, portion of your week and really focusing on everything else that you're building would be really wise for you.
00:45:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, and the good thing about that is, you know, like, we do Do you have a small team that really runs?
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, and like the social media posts, the podcasting, the, you know, Jamie's handling all the tech stuff. Carlin and Margie are handling the renewals, TXL renewals. You got Jeremy and they're working with you too, right?
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that? You got Jeremy Weiss and that makes two.
00:46:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for the podcast. Yeah. And, you know, that's that's humming along and.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So big change from this time last year.
00:46:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's a big change and I feel like. There needs to be a way like to, I mean, I guess maybe it's just. I think that the area of improvement is running a regular promotion for TXL, which we just haven't been doing, and I was thinking about that because I was like, we're going to do this event coming up, and yeah, that is definitely on me getting these promotions running. I think part of it is like it's, it's not painful, but I can't think of the word, it's painful. it. That's That's That's That's That's That's And maybe that's not even what I'm trying to say. I think maybe it's like, we've been, I've put so much effort into putting the team together. I guess now is the point where I can look up and say, right, let's run some promotions. my mind just has not been on running promotions for TXL for whatever reason. And I think what I have in mind is like, we're gonna run these boot camps. Cause I know we're gonna do one next month, we'll do another one in the fall for breakthrough advertising. And that'll be how we bring them up.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the boot camps we know has a super high conversion rate, but they're also more work. It's a whole kind of thing, right, to build. But with the podcast now, you have Evergreen stuff, which is what we're talking about. And I don't know what you have going on, but. Um, there are like, I can think of Jeff Roning as an example with, um, whatever his webinar platform as I can't remember what it is. But, and there's some other people where they, um, are constantly promoting it and then send you to a page and it's like, it's closed. Um, but we'll open eventually, put us in your information and get on a waiting list. And so it feels like there's this scarcity. But really like magically 48, 24 hours later, you get a thing, hey, a spot opened up. Um, so there's that type of thing or there's just, you could just have an evergreen offer. And the scarcity is you don't have any more time to waste doing stupid stuff in your business. You don't have any more time to waste, not having a community support you. You don't have any more time to waste doing less than you could be doing. So, you know, instead of being just signing about it or super highly marked. reading about it, whatever, you just be like, this is the thing, you know, this is an exclusive group. We show up steadily. This is not like, if you're looking for XYZ, you know, high peace, slimy, marketing, get rich quick, selling lotto tickets, selling diet pills, meaning promised results that don't actually work and your odds of winning are next to nothing. Don't come in here, we don't want you. But if you want timeless skills, proven tactics, and you're willing to shock, do the work, wear your people, and you should come in here. And it's, you know, at the end of every episode or in the middle or front, middle end of the episodes, whatever. And then you just promote the podcast all over the place. Instead of promoting accelerator, let the podcast show the intelligence and the smarts and all the other things. and say also do you want to actually talk to us in person here so how many podcasters do you get to talk to in person how many people that you listen to as a mentor do you actually get to work with like this is your chance so it could be a very simple marketing campaign that is actually directed at guests right because they see you out there marketing which means they're going to be promoted higher quality guests better content better service to your people better reasons for them to go I got to get in there yep you know just looking we've got we've got a couple of like ad bumps in the podcast the one at the end we'll take listen to a basically
00:52:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
TXL Quiz, and then that puts them into our, if they're a new subscriber, they get welcome sequence and then promotions for TXL and boot camps. But let's see, that puts this quiz, 37, well 37 finished, but only 17 subscribed at the end, 51 started, 37 finished, 17 subscribers, so far.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people have seen it?
00:52:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
51.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good conversion rate. How many people heard the offer to take the quiz?
00:53:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't know because that comes at the end of the episode. don't know.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get listening analytics?
00:53:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know.
00:53:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any way to get that?
00:53:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I can email Jeremy with that.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this podcast in and out. But the conversion rate of how many people actually went there versus how many took it. And then how many subscribed?
00:53:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's. In in like now we're doing and this is just not even a month old now every Wednesday Brian is mailing the list Sending people directly to the to an episode And I that you know that's all the may see and Apple in the Philippines I don't know if I told you I heard this girl named Apple It was a referral from Macy and she she's done pretty well. I trained I Created a right like Brian GPT. Oh, yeah, and She's been using that and then she sends her drafts to Brian Brian edits and and then they they take it I don't touch it at all It's great I love that Yeah, I'll imagine Yeah, yeah So, yeah, I think with Titans, I don't want to get, I guess, my mind, the question is like, all right, know that this runway will end at some point, but like, there's no reason that we can't just keep this community going for as long as Brian, because I think he kind doing these big events, it's like, you know, just doing a better job of maybe running some ads for the podcast, getting people engaging that way, bringing them in, and just doing it simple, and then adding these stick strategies that improve retention is maybe have a bigger... impact overall. But I, you know, talk about protecting my energy. It was something we've talked about a lot like, I'm feeling internally like how much do I want to put into growing titans beyond what it is already versus, you know, that I'm, I see the difference working with Tim and Tim is very like, he's in it, you know, he's driven and it's, it's just a different feeling being part of something like that. Yeah. And they're, they're just constant activity.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very energizing.
00:56:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only protecting your energy, but feeding your
00:57:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
energy. Yeah, because he's like, you know, we got a, we got a row in the same direction, because we got goals, he's got this event. And it's like, so I, I, that's crossed my mind of like, all right, how do I, you know, manage this tightens, like, what is that going to be? you could just give it a certain amount of time, and you can set your big rocks and goals and say, okay, here are these things that have to converge.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Number one, this is how much time and energy I'm willing to give it period and the story. In that time and energy, these are the most important things that have to get done. When the time is up, times up, I've gotten the most thing that can done, it'll be what it'll be. And sink or swim, whatever. If you, if it ends up that you'll Like it needs more and there's money for you, the higher more, but you don't want to give it more. Great. If it's giving a good return and now you want to give it more, give it more. If it's not working, then maybe it's time to have a new conversation and not worry about what you've lost and consider all the things that has fed you, trained you, molded you, shaped you, be grateful for that. thank you everyone because sometimes that needs to happen. There are seasons and sometimes the seasons end.
00:58:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's interesting they're just looking, yeah, this is 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, it's going to look because we, the other thing that has been interesting to watch is you were selling brick-thru advertising mastery on Amazon. And last week, or last month, we almost came close to being completely out of inventory. We sent 20 books at the end of and we were down to one book at the end of May. So I got 30 more. Let's see how many books we have left. So I sent them 30, and some 30 at the end of May. Alright, so we got 23. So we sold 7. But what I was getting at, so this year, I don't know, you gotta go. Let see how many books we sold total because the whole reason we did Amazon was to see if people would buy it and then opt in. So this year total we've generated 23 leads from Amazon whether these are not leads or buyers, but we sold to find this right report here. Let me see how many books we sold. Oh, here we go, me see. Here we go, go, we we we we we go, here we go, here we go, we go, here Uh, the seller central is, um, sales dashboard.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
01:02:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're not here today. I'll do that.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's here today. Yeah, that's the same thing as you're today.
01:02:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I guess I was thinking it would take me back 12 months.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see.
01:02:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. So let's see what we saw. 50, 50 units. And then all right. we're got about half, half of those buyers who opted in. Okay. Um, so what was that last year this time? We weren't on Amazon this time last year.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. And we've got ads running on Amazon and those are, let's see.
01:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you able to, like, do you tag those opt-ins and can you tell if any of them have purchased Titans Accelerator?
01:03:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, we tag them. Oh, God. It started. Keep is forcing two-factor authentication.
01:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Starting today.
01:03:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I hate it.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Do you want to do any of these tags instead of all? No? Oh, never mind.
01:04:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Got you got you got you Yeah, I just want to see Anybody to oh no, that's when oh, okay, Tom pools with a real person so one That's that pays out, you know, yeah, that's not Uh Unprofitable And the ads we'll see here the ads have done well to you on Amazon. Oh, here we go We're just doing like yeah 12 bucks a Measurement before Oh This looks 14 sales, this is over this is this year Yeah, all right guys, this is this year So we spent 1400 and we sold 2100 Yeah, so I mean Amazon's been doing well, you're just like, okay, yeah, I mean, what, that's six, seven hundred dollars, it's how much effort does do you put into it, nothing, it's just kind of set it and forget it. Oh, nothing. Yeah, that's good. I I ship, I get a book shipped to them.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people is that? How many customers? Oh, you said it was like 50.
01:06:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this year is like 50, 51. And I found a, well, didn't find it, but the guy who helped me set up the Amazon seller central here, he, I put him on a project to help me find a cheaper printer. For BAM, get down one. in China. I'm meeting with them maybe tonight. But I've already got a copy of the book that they printed for me so I could see their quality and it's really good. I sent it to Brian. He likes it. Of course, he's not sure about printing in China. But it's shipped here. It's less than 10 bucks a book.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.
01:07:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And looking into it. Yeah. I mean, unless I see a major red flag, I want to do it because like that's huge savings. Instant, you know, uh, and I'm.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So glad you started the doc because I feel like we'll get better traction this month, just being able to have some back and forth. But I would really, really like you to consider. And I'm sorry, my daughter came in to see how long and then she let the dog in and he wants to. I don't know how long it's been since you've paid attention to your time and done any time tracking, but it might be good to do a little inventory on where time is going. And especially for summer and maybe just every summer kind of do that although it's going to change with the kids but with that being a teacher, you know it's kind of a good idea to have an idea of how does your schedule change during the summer. And so go ahead and just kind of do a time inventory tracking little bit just it's going to be roughly don't have to do it perfect but just really just pay attention to your time. Where it's going, especially with having the different things going on with tea And that potentially creeping up a little bit, but probably having a good return Seeing what you might want to change in your devotion to it You might want to increase it if it gets out on clickbank and it's doing well I know they're the marketing guys, but you know get your brain on it and going you know what I know some stuff to you Let me put some of this on it put some gasoline on it cuz it's actually really doing good Um stuff you're doing with him potentially getting one more new client to get that extra $5,000 a month buffer But then also making sure you've got time to think about Potentially having conversations with junior copywriters, whatever. So really looking at it and kind of Choosing a pace for the summer choosing the the main goals for the summer what you'd like to accomplish and also in Goals for the family like family trips whatever stuff you guys want to do and just really kind of you know how we've done our time blocking like out in advance. I would love you to kind of try to like if you just spent a few days this week through next week looking at what would I like to get done throughout the summer put them in this spreadsheet with the weeks out right and put the big rocks in there right we're vacation all week not barely touching anything or boot camp whatever like really get the chunks down all through the rest of the summer and then show that to me so that I can look at it with you and just go okay here's some new thoughts about how to part of it will be about how do we how do we give Titans a container that you feel good about but also that you're like okay inside of this can't container I'm going to maximize everything and you get the best but when that containers full, then I get to go play in my other playgrounds, which I'm really enjoying, and you know, so that you don't feel this burden or any building resentment as a result of it, because that does happen. And if you put it into a specifically chosen container, that should reduce the ability and the likelihood of having resentment build up about it, because you've put it where you want it to be and what you're okay with.
01:11:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Make sense? Yep.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So just because like we're already getting into July, and you know, that time goes really fast, especially with the kids, and I'm just getting older and faster and faster and faster, I would recommend scheduling out, you know, super rough draft, not major detail. The rest of your summer light that soon, and
01:12:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and share it with me. OK, I'm in and knowing that. Sheet for myself. We packed a lot into in the May and June or the verification and.
