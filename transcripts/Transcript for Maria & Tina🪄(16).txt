Oh, yeah, I'm Zoom now.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hi.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there. That's funny. On Boxer. dog is barking her face off.
00:00:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No worries.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, man. It's, but I'm not like burnt out or I'm like, I'm frustrated that I'm not keeping on top of everything, but only slightly because you know how much I put on my plate and I'm here to juggle it. So it's basically like drop the ball, pick it back up.
00:00:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Oh, God, that's funny.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love though that you are like coming back to remember who you are and your power. And like, how did Joe, like, obviously you were putting things out and she was following you and I know that the bigger answer is divinity, just like God knows, God knows, he's like, okay, you're ready to step into everything. So is this person, you guys are perfect, I'm gonna put you together.
00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she, I thought that about that this morning, how did she find me, right? Because, because when she first got on the call, I asked, hey, know, so what cause you have to call now? she said, well, originally she found me through, I'm part of Laurel Portay, $7 month marketing Facebook group. She teaches how to do face $5 ad, ad Facebook ads and video funnels. And so I was reporting some wins in there and stuff, because you know, the whole thing, right? When you're in other people's paid memberships and you start sharing success stories, people start paying attention. to you. So she reached out to me a few months back to actually have me run her ads for her because she was having issues with marketing agencies, which by the way is a red flag though. She said she's been through six marketing agencies. I get to recording. Anyway, so anyway, she then was interested to speak to me that her mom had a stroke. Her mom's okay now in recuperating, but her mom had a stroke. So I guess in the meantime, they found those two other when she got on the call yesterday to me, she says, in the meantime, the last three months, there were two ladies that actually went through our program breastfeeding and loves our program, and they're actually Facebook ad marketers living in Australia. So honestly, that is a better fit for her anyway, because I don't want to be full implementation anymore, right? That's what got really trouble. So I think it's great that she has that. So but she changed her scope during the call for yesterday, just so you know, because of the beginning.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll tell you what my red flags were.
00:03:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
after we talk, but yeah. So because at the beginning, when she said, so I feel I think I have the marketing agency and the Facebook ads issues down now, because she said she's always having issues with her Facebook ad account every time they try to scale more than $3,000 a day. By the way, anybody would. So since she's not, that's not abnormal, especially now getting an election year, there's no way I want to be hired by her to prove myself for the next two months. That you're asking for failure that way. But she did say, I always like to have a backup in mind, just in case, but where I think you can help me is I have a Facebook group, like our funnel is an e-book and then drive into the Facebook group and then we sell our course, right? stuff, but maybe it's the niche. I said, you know what, you might be right, it might be the niche, if someone's pregnant or trying to breastfeed after they've had the baby, they probably don't have time to spend in a Facebook group. She said we just I don't feel we've monetized it that well, you know, and so and she might be true We won't know till we do an audit, but in my mind, I'm thinking sell yoga for pregnant pregnant mothers Like there's so many other side things to sell them And then she was like then we also have a reseller program like we train them and certify them in our breastfeeding methodology We have 100 people train and I failed on training them how to get clients So I need someone to put together like almost a franchise in a box or like a marketing Material for them so they could be more successful and then everyone grows that way So that's how the call initially went that I was going to help with The reseller marketing materials for that now I gonna maybe do a quote for that and then second the I said well, I think you're leaving a lot of money on the table by not having a life cycle Of things to sell them because you know, there's I didn't say though You know good for pregnant one, but I said even after they've had their baby and they're one hundred, two or three years old, like, there's so many other things you could sell to them like about parenting and stuff. Like I just see so much your potential for your list. She did then talk about the Hillary swank stuff. And then she got really excited about that. And she said, yeah, we want to raise $5 million for this and want to share and stuff. And she did say she would pay a retainer, pay money upfront first, and then also share in the back end. So there was never a thing about work for free at first. But I'm okay to audit her stuff and everything because then everything was so big. I said, well, I think the offer with me and Tina is going to be perfect for you because we first will sit down for two hours to analyze everything to help with the growth plan. But then I'm like, well, let me get you on. And then you loved it too. Like you loved what she's all about. it was more than she really switched to the $5 million right away. That's where she made the switch and not talk about at all. And when she says she's got her marketing agency already. In place, she does it. They're just the Facebook ads agency.
00:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So unless she thinks marketing is just Facebook ads, you know? So here's two main things that I heard. And I'm OK with getting big on energy, but you should know I don't get sold easily. Even if it sounds like I'm getting sold. I'm also not excited about big names or anything like that. I don't fangirl. I don't I don't hear a worship or anything like that. I do check off of people's energy, but it's in check. So I asked her about her profit margins and $2.6 million and they only kept $600,000. I don't know if that's how much she made, but I would either way. That's terrible, terrible, terrible, managed. And the other thing was I have to think about this for a minute because I just had it in my mind and then I forgot. That was, oh yeah, and she said something about, because I don't, she, and it was while, you know, all the cross chatter was happening, and we're talking about, you know, her, when she switched to wanting to focus on that, because she's like, because I don't really have money to be paying for that right now, but simultaneously saying, I'm happy to pay. there are incongruencies that have to be defined, which is why I'm like, okay, so what I think that you and I should do is go through that, I'm going to come up with a pitch that 100% is we're getting paid for our time, and that time is going to be minimal, she can use her team to implement it, and she can take it or leave it, we don't need her, there will be more other people, it's the other way around, people need us way more, but what it gives us an exercise of being able to go through and break down everything together. and come up with plans and also to make sure that we keep each other in check remembering who we are at what we do. And we go into a business with a certain set of parameters with a person. The classic visionary is all over the board. They're very bad at managing their business, but they're not all so bad. Right. So the other thing is we have to, when we create a plan, there has to be a test period and there has to be, okay, do you do what you say you will do? And do you do what we say you need to do? If those are not true, we immediately cease working business together and we let them know that that's what happened. This is a trial period. We're trying you on. You're welcome to try us on, but just be clear. This is not a favor situation. You're not bringing something to us that we can't go get for ourselves just because we're open right now doesn't mean that it's because because we can't get this. You're not the first person to offer something like this. Like I told her, if Amanda said it, I flat out would have said no from the beginning. I'm only willing to explore it because I want to see what there is. But her language and behavior was just as all over the place and they drink their own kool-aid like all the guys have.
00:09:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So those were those were my red flags. Yeah, well, I loved how you did say, hey, look, we have things to pay for. have other people to pay for. have our lives. So we can't just do charity work.
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You didn't say those exact words, but you made it loud and clear that we have to get compensated some way somehow.
00:09:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep.
00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we didn't plan that conversation. And I was just like, okay, I'm going to be me and we're going to find out if this is okay or not. But It wasn't a way to really tactically ask you and make sure it was okay, but that's that's how I show up. I'm just It's the way that we have been it's like everything's out on the table. Um, let's be clear with the positioning from the beginning We don't do charity work. This is not a favor to us You don't get our time and what time you do get is going to be minimal and you're going to pay very well for it that part I didn't say but Yeah, but that's that's that's how it's going to be and because maria We barely just set out and like a clarity sign and signal to god to the universe Yeah, what's already starting to happen. So all we have to do is remember that there are finite yeses You can only say yes to so many things and if you are busy with what you said yes to And the greatest yes of all comes along the thing that you really want to do and you're too full to say yes to it then you have to say no. So give out the nose plantively and the yeses very reservedly.
00:11:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and that's sort of why I haven't just slapped up an offer that is a insanely good deal at the 2k dump or your lower ticket because I know then like that'll fill any growth.
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so glad that like you know because I when I was watching I was just the the last the first few months you know after um Dan had said something about you and I was watching I'm like uh I don't think that she is like leveraging herself at all and I yeah but but I see but I see you like I know what you're capable of I could tell because of what you were saying yeah you as some people can fake that but not really um not the way that you did it and not kind of responses that you got and so I knew I knew that you could get really powerful results but I also could see Your model was not leveraged. And so anyway, I'm just really glad that you're not doing that right now. Cause you, we can get you something quick and powerful.
00:12:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And so that's why, like right now I'm going to go, I'm going to see this there. I'm going to way back machine. a while ago, I looked at it, one of my original websites from 2010, like literally there's stuff on there. I'm sure that I can repurpose into rigodalas.com thing, right? So, cause it's just, it's needed, you know, um, there's, yeah. Cause yeah, at the bottom, I have these logos, like price, what else? Cooper is Deloitte fusion.io computer sciences core, Lockheed Martin, you know, cable, transit system, like all these companies that I used to work with back in the day, you know, so I need people to, whoops, what's that? Oh, that's my site. me close that the way back machine. Like I shut the way back machine down, but anyways, so, yeah. So, so my long story short, I think it was good though, because at least it's worth it. a little bit that that's happening because she makes over two million and she reached out.
00:13:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, yeah, so where do we go from here? You were saying write out that pedigree post and then post it like tomorrow because today I'm going to post the success story I had with Joann, like I had a $500 call with her a couple of weeks, so I'm not going to say she paid $500. But she made like 4,000 in like three, four days, like from just the stuff I told her to do in the next seven days.
00:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. What'd you tell her to do?
00:13:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, she had a list of 700 people, low ticket buyers, and she was just saying I'm not really making enough money to survive long-term. I, you know, like she's making like me for $7,000 a month. I said, okay, well, you're missing an assumption. Something to listen to that's more scalable. You have all these low ticket, you know, social media templates you give to. your wellness coaches. That's her target market. Lovely gal. And I said, so here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do a seven day launch starting today. You're gonna three days of emails that are pre teaser emails. She's never really emailed her list. So I fixed her email deliverability on the call. I had her share screen and we got into her email and I created a bunch of text to put at the bottom of each email because that gets you through. She's going to the Google promo folder and now she's created like the mini launch like three days of teasers. I told her the first day is going to be, you know, a subject line test and just telling something big is coming, you know, and ask them, ask them a question ham testing out whether I should offer this. of you have asked me to teach you more about how I balance it all, being a mom and also being a wellness coach. If I get enough yeses, then I'll create the course on it. And then of course you've got yeses. And then the next day I said, okay, next day, gonna be a story post, you know, just story about you because you're not nurturing your list. Then the third day is going to be, oh my God, I got so many yeses that we're launching. going to be tomorrow and it's going to be a beta opportunity. It's going to be 997 when it launches the public. But because I'll be creating the course with you based on what your needs are and because you told me it's going to be this is this, it's going to be for only $297. Stay tuned for it to launch tomorrow at $12. Then there are five days of sales emails and I went with her. This is all during the call. This all happened. I went with her on to JatchyBT, can't let's write the sales page right now. You just modify it, make it better. But here it is and so she basically did that. And the best thing is she now has an asset that she can make money. I'm coining the term kind of everlasting earnings lately. I'm using, I'm not coining is not the right word, but I'm using, I like that term. So I said, hey, she's got everlasting earnings now because now she's created an asset that she got paid to create and once it's done, she can sell this every single month and scale it and increase it to $997 and she'll, and I told her this is your million dollar funnel. Keep selling your your low ticket stuffs working and very few people get that right So the fact that you're you know, but getting buyers to for your little, you know, whatever 17 or $27 Social media templates for wellness coaches keep that going and then keep selling this upsell and there you have it And if you want you can get into a high ticket coaching one-on-one with people if they want something for 10k But so that's what I did for him. She's praising me through the rooftop She's bragging about me in Allen's group because she's an Allen's 500 a month thing And she says Maria whatever you want me to tell people just once you make a post all I will go in and say anything All the you want just and I'll do a video for you or you can interview me on a video So I'm interviewing her next Monday or Tuesday.
00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's said she's available. So yeah, I Love that. just highlighted it.
00:16:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you have All of that written down because you basically made a playbook Um, you know what I don't have all that written down about the playbook, but I do you have a social post down and I can share that with you right now?
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me get to googly googly drive. What we need to do is really organize and spend some time doing it and then make some assignments and some due dates with each other about certain things that we need to create. Let me let me go into Trello. We're going to start right now.
00:17:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I have just so you know you have a call in 20 minutes right? Yeah and just so you know one other quick thing. I actually have the sales copy because I wrote it to my asset. I created for Karina you know what's going to be really good to sell in this funnel 5k and 7 days information product. And what it was is just the plan. was the I told her create this Google sheet of all the steps that you do that that can help someone who truly does your methodology, make 5k and 7 days, write them all down in here so that they have a plan that they know what to do daily for the next 7 days. And I made the sales copy for the actual page. So honestly, it wouldn't take much for me to recreate that for myself, but obviously for coaches, right? if that is helpful to tell you.
00:18:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm distracted creating like I was trying to create a place to organize the data and then like the last couple sentences I spaced out while I was thinking about it.
00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm so sorry. Oh, sorry, no worries. if you've clicked that Google Doc, that's the social post I was going to make and I might modify it a little bit, but Joanne's already reviewed it. She's fine with me posting it and she's actually saying she actually made more, she made 5k, not so this actually would change to 5k. So what I'm saying is because I created for Karina, I said, we need to add this in the funnel to increase the average order value for her e-com funnel. I said, we're going to create a 5k and 7 days product. So what I said is that I actually have pretty decent sales coffee for, but obviously not for e-com but for coaches, like just basically what I'm excited about. I'm actually doing for me what I did for other clients that they're now making money for that they should be paying me half of.
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just got an idea. I have zero filters. don't know where it came from. Oh, okay, sorry. Say stuff like that. And sometimes I feel something. So I feel like it's inspired, but a lot of times that means there might be modification needed anyway. I just talk to the preamble. But I was like, what if we do through the end of the year sprint, roughly 90 days sprint? it is, but it's more towards those mid level, like low level, mid level. And it's six 97 and it's 697 paid up front or 997 and whatever the whole whatever 1000. So 700 or 1000. I don't care what I am pricing a user or not. And they can have three payments if they want to do it that way. Because I think what we really need to do is while we're creating our own structure, we also need to be making money. I'm building people who can testify for us. They are amazing. They know what they're doing. it will also give us some give back stuff. I think it's a super easy offer. don't think it takes a high level person to be able to pay that amount. And so what would be the outcome? The outcome is that you should have a very clear offer. You should have a very clear marketing strategy. You should know what your numbers are. We will sit there. I'll I'll spend the time. We'll take the time with. Whoever, if we sell 100 people or if we sell 200 people, which is shooting crazy high for that amount of money, that would be, if we did 100 people, it would be $697,000. So we don't need that many people, 50 people would be amazing. And 50 people, the two of us could serve really well. Even in a group setting, it can be weekly calls, but basically homework assignments, and we will personally, you and I, pour over them, will be busy for the next 90 days. But we can still choose our time, especially if we're not making it phone call dependent. But it's more like, get us your data dependent, we can require that they send us an audio or video that gives us all the information so that in addition to the text information they give us, we can also kind of pick up on their energy and their confidence because it's hard to get that. We for sure should have like one or two calls a week. And, but the goal is you come out of it with, like I said, a solid offer, a solid marketing plan based off of your existing traffic and assets plus amplified like an amplified accelerator plan as to like how, how you could grow that. And then the goal would be for them that they get their money back, you know, within the 90 days after the first 90 days, but obviously we can't guarantee that, but we want to tell them that's the target. But, but the other thing is that we're helping them try to create an evergreen offer that should be paying them that amount and more month after month after month times times 10, whatever. But if we did that, then we wouldn't have to worry too much about the big fish that really we have to. The thing about the big clients is that it's very taxing mentally because you have to perform quickly fast. We could still offer the upgraded power plan, maybe, and we could possibly tweak it if somebody's like, we want one on one time, and we want the Vauxure access. I don't think the 697 people get Vauxure access, and you could talk about, and both of us could talk about some of the things that we've covered in just being able to have voice chat with people. Like, for example, I've had my $2,000, $4,000 a month client miss a call, know, one week, and they never, first of all, tried to get their money back. They never forced, like, we have to get another call because I just send them quick messages and they're like, I don't feel like I lost anything because of how great the talking is.
00:23:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you took it at 697 one time payment or 697 a month?
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one time. Like, I said no brainer deal, but seriously, you do the math on that?
00:23:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of consistency and made revenue who just is in same kind of person really there in the launch cycle, but they don't have to have net the same threshold for earnings. So maybe they've never even broken, you know, $2,000 a month. And for sure they can't go broke doing this, but $697 unless you're absolutely destitute shouldn't break you.
00:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what they're going to get is we will guarantee that we will personally look at all of their information and personally give them a plan, even if it's we deliver it through email, like it's not going to be given to anybody else, not delegated to anybody else. And they will get 30 year veterans on their business. You can't get that for that price anywhere else.
00:25:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, so I'm just typing in that. So similar to the offer we made but just less handholding.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah but it's really not less time like it's it's going to be more time for us but it's spread across a lot more people but what comes out of it though is way more testimonials that we can use for more marketing plus we will get to refine our plan. We could turn that into a do it yourself kind of program for like $9.97 for people once we've done it over and over again and then we could just literally we could just do that for a year but what will happen is bigger people will come and say how do I get you in my business. I won't be like well let's see if you're qualified.
00:26:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah there's um I was looking at um this company here let me see if I found her on. I think she was a colleague of your client, she shoot. Come on, come on, come on, darn it. Let me go to Instagram, see if is still up. I was looking up, Dan Meredith was one of his co-workers or something.
00:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leanne?
00:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Her brand is Strategy Co. Strategy Co. Dan Meredith is doing some events with her, and I looked at this page. Oh, that's kind of not, oh no, that's not it.
00:27:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was that the one with the IDFS or something?
00:27:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I just like her page identified three areas you could be in. Dan Meredith. That's him, right? So I was looking up because, know, you I know of him, but I haven't really followed him and and stuff. So I thought that's cool here. How he talks about what he's done and all that stuff, right? And then I went down.
00:28:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He thanked me in this first book.
00:28:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, nice. Maybe it was this peak fest. A friend, no, Francesca here. Ah, now maybe I can't find it, but, uh, ideas, Lisa John.
00:28:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
sends us like a family gets basket too.
00:28:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, this is that strategical. So then I went to their site. Right. Um, because really, I just liked how we teach business strategies simply. kind of thought, this was kind of nice. she's got the Academy for online businesses and then she even got it CBD certified. So I actually looked at what that is and the get your digital e-learning CBD certified so they can get credits for it. Then they got the Growth Academy and then they have the Agency, Access to Online Business Experts offering a done freezer.
00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she's got three levels here.
00:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I really like that because I thought, know, I don't like the color so much, the lime green, but it is what it is. But anyway, but I just thought that was kind of cool. And you they have a free challenge, get it started. So anyways, I just thought it was kind of interesting because what you're talking about, the 697 offer is probably more to, yeah, just like little beginners, right? Let's see what she's got here launching 2021 launching today. Is that all? This is not only one week, one week. Ultra Build, Scissors Events, Gamification, Uber, Offer Page, Cardboard, Mark.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I think she's describing what it was like to launch 2021. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to elevate your launches? not become a certified launch? Okay, so now she's offering, uh, to certify people as a launch manager, that's, I used to do a social media certification course ages ago, that's easy money.
00:30:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought about and wanting to do, um, uh, operation certification, but my way, like streamlines and, um, yeah, I don't know all of this kind of bigger than, than I really want to do. I, I don't know, I think a good portion of my life is going to just be spent serving and ministering. I'm basically getting to the point where my money makes my money, like, yeah, in business, so that it does that and then go wherever God calls me. Like there's a reason he has me getting a psychology degree. Um, I, there's, there's so many things that are happening and I don't know what they are. So like I don't have a 10, 15, 20 year vision of being, doing this type of stuff in business. I know it will always be that the, the business. and leadership specifically in business is a huge part of what I'm doing, but for right now, this is a for right now kind of thing.
00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't. Yeah. And I think that's part of why I hesitate to go and create content and create a particular brand and whatnot is because God is still shaping me and I don't even know what it's for. But I know where I can serve now and I know what my responsibilities are now and they require money and I know that I can serve that really well. So like behind the scenes has always worked really well for me because I can just serve and not worry and overthink that and get people amazing results. I prefer that to be for people who already get amazing results and know what their mission is and their mission is pretty much their life. my lifelong mission, Maria, is just it's to teach people about God who he is, his love, make sure that they know who they are. are and make sure that they live and fulfill their greatest potential in this earth and during this and that's not really business but it businesses the vehicle yeah anyway um yeah so okay but we still have a clock right now where you got to get something out that's making some money so now um there is always the first things first and I don't know what what point money starts to be stressful and how much you need to make like this week or next week or three weeks from now but I would like to know that and know that we're on track with making that for you but in that also I think that one of the most powerful things you can do is the history it's really a chunk like paragraph of each thing but with some bullet points and this is what it was like before I got there, this is what it became, this is how much money it made. And this is how it's continued after I left my influence, that type of thing.

Yeah. So yeah, so yeah, let me work on that. Like if I post this thing today that I sent you the Google link for from Joanne, and then tomorrow I'll do, yeah, I think that's a great idea to do the pedigree post, and I'll send you a link over to it before I post it and all that jazz. I think a fast path to cash though right now though, is for me to put up a $500, 100, one hour with me book a call, like I already have it with Calendy and PayPal, that they go there, it's five in a bucks, and I call it the seven day cash injection sprint. And if I post that in nothing held back, Alan's group, because I have so much edification, like Alan even edified me two days ago on one of his posts in the group. I'm pretty sure people will grab that up, and that 500 can be the foot in the door to bring in. into you know other things.

There you go.
00:34:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be amazing. I just want to know that like you've got you've got some things. I just I just want you I just want to make sure I don't know if you're stressed out because you don't really talk about it but like I know what the ticking clock feels like and I'm just really cognizant of that.
00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no I'm not really I'll be stressed out in month if nothing comes in right like I'm not here's the thing I know I'm building something bigger because I'm saying no to quick cash that is not right because the path I've been on the last two years is saying yes to cash that I thought was good but clearly it's not like every asset I'm learning every asset that I've built for Karina has is now useless to me whereas it should have been amazing. million dollar asset and it will be for her now. Like she's got all like we're not talking to one sales page or one funnel. Like I've built at least three low ticket funnels with the sales pages with everything, even the VSL script for her what to say that are converting, right? She just overspent her money so she can't spend money on Facebook ads, but they were unicorn funnels like like self liquidating funnels that anyone would kill to have. So I know that now everything I told her to do or even product boss for that matter and stuff now just needs to be for me for my business, right? That's why it's like, oh yeah, why don't I have a 5k and 7 days product? Why don't I have a from a hot mess to million dollar success, you know, master class that I sell for 27 because that was a downsell I told Krina to create. all these things I feel good now that I'm doing, but that's why I'm not launching a 2k done for you, loading a funnel. a $500 one hour thing. But I'm purposely saying no to stuff like that lady yesterday while we were talking on the call, not not the Australian lady. But remember you and I were earlier on the call and that one lady, her name was Amanda Hines, how she wanted to get the offer. But she thought we were implementing the actual working thing. Yeah, yeah. Like for $6,000, are you kidding me? We're gonna actually like, so it's like, I'm sick of the bottom beaters. And you know, and if I have to, I'll get a loan to withstand the next, you know, month so that what I do launch, you know, is more about me because, or if I ever were to do a deal like that with Krena again, or you and I together, deal like that with a person like Krena, guess where the funnels are going and our accounts. if they think the partnership along working, then okay, great. These are our assets, our funnels. We'll just keep running as well. We'll find some other person to TGCOM, you know, like, I mean, I mean, I'm not a boutique person, but I've had better success in her and more testimonials than her with my income accelerator course that I launched four years ago. And I just taught pure branding and maybe some drop shipping, but it was really more building brand and slapping your label on it from some stuff that you create from American or Chinese people and storing it here and selling it. So, you know, I've attempted to do that sometimes too, but, you know, I don't know if that's in my, like God, in my spirit to do because I think deep down, I firmly believe it's harder for someone who's new and start to make money online to start with an e-com store. think deep down, even though there's a lot of money in it and teaching it, I think deep down, they can make more money as a VA if someone's, you know, yeah, or sell a service or create an e-book as well. I think the hybrid, ultimate hybrid business model for people who are New or even people who have money who are retiring and need site house of money is a hybrid where they consult or do a service. And then they also have a digital product. They're creating that the money from the cash flow of the consulting and service is financing the more almost passive income of the low ticket or mid ticket products like Graham Cochrane. He just runs a YouTube channel to a $500 course how to create a digital course and he's created a multi million dollar business.

He's storyteller one.
00:38:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I don't think he's a storyteller.
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that name from something.
00:38:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He just published a book recently, think his first book and he's the real boy. I actually bought his course. It's decent like, you know, Graham as a podcast as well. That's funny. He's he's publishing himself as an author now, right?
00:38:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He just became an offer maybe a year ago with that book, but he's been around forever.
00:38:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's got 66,000 followers on YouTube here.
00:38:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could do a podcast because we can talk and then I don't have to be on video.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You have to go.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should be tomorrow. I've got, I've got, I'm going to send you an email or a box or something. Um, now that I know you have a little tiny bit of breathing room, like you don't have to make it tomorrow. Yeah. you go, I love you.
00:39:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're amazing. And I'm gonna rock.
00:39:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See ya. Bye-bye.
