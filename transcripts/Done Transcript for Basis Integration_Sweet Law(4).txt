Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?

And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll keep following up with you then. And everybody go, have a good day and talk to you next week.
