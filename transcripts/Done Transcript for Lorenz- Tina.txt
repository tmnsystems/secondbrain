00:00:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, can't hear you.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There. Got it?
00:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you now. How are you doing?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm good.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. I was looking at your stats today, looking pretty good for August. Not bad, huh? Yeah. How do you feel about that?
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's pretty good. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think it would be hard to take all the credit. did, you know, work my team like a slave driver, but I'm pretty hard, but yeah, it feels pretty good.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do how do they feel about it? They get bonuses too, right?
00:00:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
reward them? Oh, yeah. They're pretty happy. You know, they're, they're. They're complaining that they're taxed on those bonuses. I was like, yeah, you get taxed on the bonus or I get taxed for all the bonuses.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can say, oh, I could just keep the bonus.
00:01:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, that's how I would do that. My kids, my team, whatever. Oh, did you just say you don't want the money? I think that's what I heard.
00:01:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you rather not have it?
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, 100%. That's how I'd respond. I'm like, OK, can keep it.
00:01:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh, man. I can't even sell the net attitude. I mean, I can. The tax is stuck, but still. Like, you can do not still make more money.
00:01:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't They're pretty happy about it overall. They're just, you know. Because in the past, I had their bonuses. I had just like Apple cash them their bonuses. And now I do it in the show. And so they're like, what the heck, you know, and I'm like, well, yeah, but yeah, no, it doesn't make sense for me to pay all of your guys's taxes on these bonuses.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it does not 100%. I'm glad that you're not doing that anymore. But a great job managing the team and you were feeling pretty down in the dumps in July though.
00:02:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That was a rough month. July was a rough month. Very low settlements. I mean, yeah, our next got saved by a couple of big ones, but I think we ended up with like 12 settlements altogether for the month. So that was rough. My, you know, I wish my moods didn't depend on my performance. They do a certain degree.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still, well, the great thing about this is that you get a compounding effect of. all the things that you've been doing. And part of August had to be part of the fruit of July. So July was rough, but that was also part of the fruit of June as well. So we're coming in and now you've been not just working on yourself but working on your team and not just driving but supporting, organizing, prioritizing, and as you make it a practice to do those things, your level of awareness increases, their levels of awareness increases and that reward provided you really want to encourage them to look at the math correctly. So, okay, yes, you had to pay more on taxes. Just to be clear, would you rather not have more bonuses, like, you find a way to have the conversation because of what you want is that they're you're familiar with Pavlov's dogs, your friend's response. Okay. If the response that they allow themselves to have is I get a bonus taxes, that is a Pavlovian response that will continue to happen. So what you need to do is help them shift the response so that every time it's they do the math, okay, well whatever that bonus was so give me somebody's bonus as an example.
00:04:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So I think altogether Jessica made $400 in bonuses this month.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay and roughly how much do bonuses get taxed differently?
00:04:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. think Michelle just taxed it onto their paychecks.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah so you know let's say 20% tax, right? So was that $80? So She still got $320 that she didn't have before.
00:05:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, so what you really want to do is yeah, but after taxes, you still have bam. You know what I mean? Every person. So have that map ready for you in your mind for every single person when you pay stuff and they go say, yeah, but the taxes and you go, yeah, but you keep X every single time because you want the incentive to maintain its incentive power. It's the whole reason there. It's not just a bonus structure. It's an incentive.
00:05:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And I guess like, that's like, that's kind of what I want to keep going. Like I don't want this month to be this last month to be like, Hey, we hit goal. Great. know, now it's back to business as usual.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, business is usual.
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not in a standard, you know, like I want this to be the minimum required and. And I, you know, like, I feel like up till now it's been the plucky little Arizona team, know, just trying to, to be all grown up, like the other, the other teams. But now I feel like we're, we're hitting our full stride and I want to take advantage of that.
00:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me screen share some with you here. Because yes, um, so where am I at? Hold on. I don't want last night days. I want last month. So we just go ahead and look at that and enjoy how great that was. at that average fee by team. That 11,000 was really high because I've looked at all the numbers and that's not typical of any time period. Right. Um, and then gross attorney fees by team, you and Samantha were pretty much hadn't had last month. Yeah. Um, this is something that we need to work on big time and that's the thing I want you to use on your team to keep them focused on the fact that we didn't really knock it out of the park you know long term like that that was really a small moment it was great but this start to average 62 days longer than the other longest person so Samantha has the next longest time at 281 days this is definitely where the team pulls away and there's a very clear discrepancy right yeah yeah this is a number i'm very well aware of that i you know it's not something that i'm particularly happy about well i'm not finished let me let me go through here because it's improving okay So this, that's something to pay attention to. So watch this spot right here. So we're looking at, this is just for August, which obviously we know is, it's not a real good view, right? So, but 343 days now, if we go this quarter, watch that number change. 300, actually, we're going the wrong way. Let me do this, let me do this, let me do this. Last two years, let's try to want to do this. Okay, average days to close this one, this report didn't even exist. So 370 days, okay? I don't know if you remember where we were at last month, but it was 343. So we'll watch this change, last two years, we're going to go last year, not a whole lot of change, right? But a little bit, not a whole lot of change, but then we're going to go last. Let's see, last quarter. We're watching that drop. Now last quarter was actually better than we were last month, but the quarter is a much better gauge. And then we're gonna go this quarter. Come on, you can do it eventually. All right, let me refresh and see what happens. This quarter. Okay, 318 this quarter. So don't worry about the month because the quarter's a much better. So I'm just gonna do this one more time for you, okay? 318 and we're gonna go two years ago and look at where we're at now. 370 to 318. That's almost two months.
00:10:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
right? It's headed the right direction.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is heading the right direction. That is important Lawrence. A two month difference is significant. Now, now, so we're going to last quarter. You're also closing the gap. So there's roughly not quite too, like a month and a half difference in speed between UN Samantha. Patrick's still an anomaly right now because of the cases that he gets or not, the typical cases, some of them are Mark's stuff. And Tyler is not the veteran to really match for anyone. His drive is very different. So this is something to also celebrate, but to keep driving, we really want to bridge this gap because that obviously makes an impact on how soon Sweet Lock gets the funds.
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right. I'm also interested to know because I know that with higher limits, it does take longer to get to those limits. And I'm wondering how next year we'll look for the other teams when their limits go up to $30,000. Whereas right now, the policy limits are $15,000. So they, you know, Cairo and MRI, usually you can get that with just, you know, a good Cairo and some MRIs, and they'd be a recommendation from a pain doc.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I'm wondering if their time is going to go up or if it's going to stay relatively the same. So is, um, gosh, that was my, I didn't want to highlight this one. I mean, um, Think about this for a minute. I won't. Where. That's me. You should already get there. I want my A. I know. There we go. Okay. So. And then we go back to let it. What are the different and policy limits for Arizona versus California?
00:12:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
California right now. They're at $15,000 for a minimum policy. Arizona's at $25,000 for a minimum policy. So it's a $10,000 difference, which we don't get to with just Cairo and MRIs. We have to, you know, usually we can pop those policies if we have above $15,000 worth of treatment. Unless there's a. you know, an anomaly like a broken bone or something like that, then we can demand right away and all that policy without too much trouble, which I imagine is the case for all the teams.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you know about Washington and New Mexico limits?
00:13:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So I know Washington and New Mexico are 25,000 just like Arizona.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know. I'd have to look into, I'd have to drill down to see.
00:13:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So it'd be interesting to see the distributions between the cases, but that being said, I'm driving hard to reduce that number.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you are. And so the whole point of that was just a reminder, first of all, that we're doing that.
00:13:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we're on the same page. And also to show you that it is working.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you're doing is working, obviously. So what we want to do, and I'm going to move this away now because we've seen that, need to go look at my notes. Where's that from last week? So is to really focus on how do we maintain momentum without burning people out? How do we tap into intrinsic motivators for your team, which means you have to first identify them. And with your monthly conversations, that's the best time to do that. You know, understanding how big of a difference is $320 a month for somebody. Does it make enough of a difference for them to work hard? How much harder did they have to work? Do they have to put in more hours or did they just have to think a little bit better and get off of autopilot, which is what a lot of people do. They come in, they do the thing because they're supposed to come in and do the thing, right? Versus coming in and doing the thing the best way they can, because it's going to have the best results. So like you are motivated to compete, you're motivated for job security, you're motivated to not have to suffer so much by doing the job poorly or not optimally so that it causes more stress and more frustration, you understand that how you work has an impact on how you feel. Right, so if you have a constant uphill battle and you feel reactive, I'll give you a case in point, and which was a catalyst for me at like 21 working in a call center. answer the phones on average, right? Not every call will get answered in that amount of time. But on average, this is your number. This is how long you can put people on hold. This is how often you can put them on hold. This is how often they're allowed to call you without resolution. So basically, the resolution had to be within the first call. A certain percentage of the calls had to be resolved within the first call. like 90% something like that. So in 1997, the reports were gathered by Lucid Technologies. It was the phones. So the phones had different modes in them for answer the phone, for what was called ACW, after call waiting, where an agent would type their notes. There was a hold button, there was a transfer button. All of these things were able to be tracked at that time and generate a report that was like a DOS report. So if I say DOS, like Unix is actually really what it was. So I don't know how Intel, but they're so much smarter than that call center was, down there data, but they knew where we were all the time. Now, the people that worked at the call center and were operators of any sort, including most of the managers were entry-level people who got trained on the job, okay. Now, I live in an area where we rank in the top five in the nation for domestic violence, drug use, for unemployment. It's really terrible. It's a tiny little town. It's not a great people. So the workforce is not very good either. So there's a lot of really low-quality stuff, not great training. But I have a little bit of a not-average brain, and I really don't like being threatened. I've dealt with threats my whole life, and my response is I will flip it everything around. I will make it it mine and I will fix it because I'm not going down without a And if I'm going down, I'm going down swaying and harm. So we have getting threatened every other week. We're not meeting metrics. We're not meeting the metrics. Somebody's going to get fired. If I'm getting yelled at, you're getting yelled at blah, blah, blah, And I was 21. I'm like, man, I grew up with this in my house. I'm not having this in adulthood. I'm not having it as a job. It was stressful. People were constantly stressed, smoking left and right, anxiety. That was the whole dynamic in the whole place. And simultaneously, we get to deal with like technology. And I loved all of that. But then there was this stress. one day I saw one of my co-workers, the co-managers, I got promoted into management within six months of being hired there when I was 19. So I moved up really quickly. But again, there wasn't really hardly any training, kind of sink or swim, figure it out. And he was running some reports and he was putting it into a spreadsheet. And I didn't know spread cheats at the time. So I asked him a bunch of questions and I saw him use a formula and I'd never seen a formula. And so I doing what I do ask them questions, well, could I do this and this and this and this and where do I get this information? What I figured out was, if I pulled five different phone reports, I could figure out all of the different metrics that we needed, because none of them told us how we were performing according to the contractual metrics. There was not a single report that did that is ridiculous. So, but across five different reports, I was able to get the information and then I had to go and create a formula in a separate tab that drew from each one of these sheets in the workbook. And so, So, so basically one report gave me ACW time, one report gave me call time, one report gave me the whole time, write all of these different things. So then, and then one report told me all the different calls across all the time. So I had to go create a formula that told me what the averages were across that. It took me a while to build that, but from that, from that point on, it only took me 15 minutes to get our data. So what I did was, I just started getting my data every week, which meant I knew exactly where we stood every week, which means I didn't need somebody to come tell me my team was out of metrics, which by the way, they almost never were, because I was already running that proactively. The entire corporation didn't have a system like that.
00:21:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They adopted my spreadsheet worldwide and other call centers.
00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was 21, like it didn't and the business I'm doing that. How profoundly badly things get managed and people aren't looking at the things that matter most and they're reacting. They're not getting the information that tells them where they are and showing them where they've been so that they can see their trajectory and also so that they can see if I do this, for example, if I have monthly meetings with my team and I find out what's bothering them and I find out what they need and I give them what they need and I set some specific goals. Whoa, look at that trajectory line. You know what I mean? So I promise you that what you're doing, most people aren't doing. What that gives to your people, although it may be added stress to some degree, is a level of comfort as a result of the level of clarity. Everybody on my team always knew exactly. actually where they stood because they had their stats. They knew that they were safe. They were doing good. And when they weren't doing well, I trained them. I showed them how to do better. They never had to worry about their jobs. And I never had to worry about my job ever again. The only people I ever fired were people who didn't show up to work. Except for one next point, she her name was Cynthia. She just didn't have the mental capacity to do the work. She just could not. She was as sweet as I hated having to let her go, but I had to let her go. But everyone else was trainable, provided they had the information, and they cared enough to show up to work. Nobody had to be perfect. They just had to be steady enough to do a good job. And with the right information, they were able to do that. So my point is, is that by showing your people, your team, and giving them in criminal mental steps forward and finding out what motivates them so you know is an extra $320 like what does that mean to you does it cover your power bill and your phone bill like does it cover your car payment like really make it relatable to something like now you've got that money to go do this thing like is that too really awesome date nights is the concert like make it something other than a dollar amount that you know that they're interested in then um ask them well did you really have to work that much harder was did you put more hours in or did you just you know be more conscious and do the job and then a month or two later ask them like was it actually harder to do better or did you just change things a little bit and it and it really got you that result because some of it can just be like we make a mental correlation that says better performance is harder to work and takes more time and energy. One reality is sometimes it's just better systems and being more intentional on while we're at work, being more intentional on a call, controlling the call flow, keeping in mind that the end result that they really want is not to chit chat with us but it's to get their money and to get taken care of. So the truth is Lorenz, most people never have those kind of conversations with themselves or anybody else and they especially don't have those conversations in correlation with the data that shows them where they're at and where they're going. So clearly now, I can't say that there's totally a possibility that August was a fluke, but... I really don't think it was. I don't think it was. I think it was more than anything a direct result of your management. We will be able to see that if the trend continues to be that the stats are improving, not necessarily that they were the same amount of fees, know, attorney fees or average attorney fees as they were in August. the average time to close the case should continue to shrink even if it's by a couple days every month because that's a long runway to need to shrink. And if the average attorney fees don't go lower or there's not something where you can say explicitly, this was something completely outside of our control. So what I would love for you to do, let's see, meeting structure goals. So what I would love for you to do and kind of it takes notes where I can send this to you. But I would like, and I want to talk about Yuri, you've got Yuri to help you now, right, too?
00:27:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yuri?
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
am I wrong about that?
00:27:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know who that is.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a new law clerk. I was thinking he was going to help in Arizona. Oh, maybe it's for Hank. I don't know. There's a new law clerk that's coming for a little while.
00:27:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Like a law student? Huh? Is he like a law student or something?
00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't ask enough questions about it and I should have, but we were talking about a whole lot of other things and it was kind of an afterthought that Mark told me in passing. But I was thinking he was on your team, so I have to find out maybe, maybe not. But anyway, so... But let's see, I gotta go to my document here real quick. All right, so Jonathan, Jessica, Vuri and Mike. Do you feel like you know enough about each of those to know where extra money would meet them happy? Something they value?
00:28:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think John we're pretty close, you know, he's got a baby coming. Jessica has her wedding coming up.
00:28:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:28:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Mike, he's a young man on the prowl. He's always looking for, you know, extra money to go on his vacation, go on trips and things like that. And Vuri is a single mom, so that's easy.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All that extra school supplies and band trips, choir trips, whatever her kids might be involved in, uniforms, things like that. So what I don't know is the earning potential for your team in correlation to the cases. don't know. I would like to understand so like, what was the difference between July and August in terms of incentive pay for your team, each of them?
00:29:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Could you tell me that you have it in a spreadsheet or anything? Well, in July, they didn't make anything because we didn't really make anything. Right, okay.
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when was the last time that there was bonus pay?
00:29:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Before that, June.
00:29:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what was it?
00:29:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
you remember?
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't. Do you track this in a spreadsheet?
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The You know, because it's directly related to the money that we bring in and fees.
00:30:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really like you to do that because, for example, at the end of the year, you can say, hey, you got this in bonuses. job. Like, if you hadn't done all this work, it wouldn't have been worth this to you. Or, hey, these are the bonuses that we didn't get. You could have had X, that type of thing. So, here's a big assignment. I really like you retroactively to go back really through all of 2023 up till now and track bonuses for anybody that's still on your team that was on your team at the time, if that makes sense. So, let's do it with their name in one column, and then the month starting with January 2023 to February 2023 and so on, and whatever bonus pay that they would have received, and let's start with that and kind of look at it, just, when we see the bigger numbers, like, did $3,000 last year not make a difference to you, Jessica, or whatever, you know, if she did get it, or would it have not if, you know, if we got that? And here's all we have to do. This, this is a great tactic, but it works on us too. It's not really manipulation, but it's perspective. All we have to do to get that is X. We know we can do it.
00:31:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Why? Yeah, no, I can tell there's a different attitude. You know, the second half of July, second half of August, there's different attitude regarding the meetings or regular meetings, like, does not care for meetings, does not like them at all. Things generally, things are a waste of time. But he had to admit that ever since we started doing the meetings, we started getting more value out of those cases. mean, even along a lot quicker, too. So it was refreshing to see him on board with it.
00:32:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's another way you only have to, right? now what was Mike's incentive pay?
00:32:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last month, it was about $400, dude, but he made a couple of case that he saved as a Spanish case, that was about to sub the sound, he saved it. So Mark gave him an extra couple hundred bucks there, then they have the firm incentive paid to the $500,,000.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when Mark or Mike complains about the meetings, okay, so how many, how much time I am how many hours do you think he spends in meetings each month each month. Yeah.
00:33:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So all of my meetings are always under an hour, it's never a meeting is more than an hour and usually that's about 40 minutes. So let's see. So we have them every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Monday meetings are shorter though. So that's one, two, six, eight, 20 minutes for those Monday meetings, divided by 60, probably seven hours meetings.
00:34:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright. Roughly an hour and a half week.
00:34:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:34:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, I look at it. Really, he doesn't have to do anything else other than just improve based off of what you've learned in the meetings, right? Mm hmm.
00:34:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So. His main complaint is that, well, we do these meetings, but afterwards, you know, we've got a long list of tasks that we have to do. And I'm yeah, that's. That's the point of the meeting. So we figure out what we need to do for each.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Very fine. Yeah. um, if you write the direct correlation to we need and what happens on the meetings, we have, we get stats. We get reports. like, here's where we're at. We get assignments. Here's what we can do to improve where we're at. And then you get a reward. Here's the money on top of your actual payment and wage that you get because you have a job. So this is just extra for doing the job you're supposed to be doing anyway. Yeah. That's kind of a fair trade, Mike. And like, say something a little bit playful. Like, I was like, yeah, me like, you know, whatever. And like, I mean, I mean, because otherwise, it's almost like you think like, people should pay you to do the job the way you want to and not the way it should be done.
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But you're not saying that, right, Mike? no, that's silly. Come on. I'm not saying this is just showing up money, right?

Yeah. nobody, nobody, I mean, no law firm is going to hire you just to come in and collect. to pay track and not care about it. This is a competitive industry. Why did you get into it? Now he's not an attorney, but he's still in a law firm. It is a competitive industry period on the story. Like if you wanted to have a job where you didn't have to think or whatever, like, good luck. Anyway, I don't mean we're going to get that, but you're not going to earn very much money doing it. And you're for sure not going to get incentive pay and things like that. But you know, it is what it is. And the other thing is, sometimes it's just the maybe there's a specific thing that's happening in the meeting that he doesn't like. And one of the questions could be, I mean, like, do you want to get better at your job? Like serious question, because some people don't care. And I'm like, right, right, right. So like, like, like, you don't like the meetings, but I'm pretty sure you're the guys. it wants to compete and like wants to be better. So really, the meetings are like our superpower. Like this is this is what we're doing. is where we're downloading the information. This is where we're getting the playbook. This is where we're figuring out how we're going to surpass the other team. get on board man.
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Get on board.
00:37:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, everybody's different. The language is different. Their needs are different. Their drivers are different. job is to figure your people out. Figure out what drives them and be able to make a correlation between what the company needs and what they want. Because there is definitely correlation because more money does, know, money doesn't buy happiness. No, but being broke really is hard to be happy and you can't pay the bills, know. also the thing that you want to point out to them constantly is that technically and hopefully you're working smarter not harder not longer. I want you to go check the the law reports and check who worked when but if you made that difference without increasing hours worked you need to point that out to them. If you increase hours worked then we need to do the math to compare because July was not good enough was it were people not showing up or were they there but in presence only and not actually mentally. And that's life in that human beings and it can't always be helped. However if we continue to optimize our systems then even when people are not well we could potentially still get bonus pay because of the rest of the team you know working the best that they can. So you know off our one one for all kind of thing, like we each have our different roles, we each have our different drivers and your job is to know what those drivers are and to keep reminding them and to keep giving them the perspective to keep giving them the support and keep reminding them why sweet laws goals should matter to them. And that the dollar amount isn't the real value. Money is money. It doesn't do anything until you trade that money for something that really means something to you. You know, an amazing trip for Mike with the friends with the girls, whatever for very an amazing weekend weekend getaway. Getting some new gaming system for her kids or, you know, letting them be able to go on to some school trip. Whatever it is just getting door dash once a week so she doesn't. have to cook that type of thing like really figure out talk to them and try to obviously you know you can't cross certain conversational lines but you can listen you can just have conversations and really notice like what do they enjoy like you can be like so would you spend your bonus on like or i spent it whatever like because you can't probably i don't know like you would got to really be careful how to ask questions but um things like that so if you can figure out and then watch their faces and listen to their voices when they get animated when they light up whatever they're talking about is really important to them so if you can draw a correlation to let's say it's the incentive pay but also it's the incentive pay and you don't have to worry about your job very has job security issues you have job security issues not everybody does some people just they have this thing And now I'm where they're just like, yeah, whatever, easy, come easy, go. I'm not that person. Well, I wasn't. I am now, but I wasn't. So it's always a different driver for people. You have to know what it is. So if you can tell somebody, look, nobody is going to let go of somebody that's performing like this. Look how good you keep doing. And if you can show them their improvement, like I showed you yours, I don't know how you would measure that. So I definitely want to be able to dive into that with you. And we're not going have enough time to do it today. But I would love for you to think about how do you measure their performance? And do you have a system for tracking and measuring their performance individually? Could say how Viri was better in August over July? Would you have any way of
00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
of quantifying that and well probably not I mean right now it's self-report I asked them to to keep track of their goals over the month and then to kind of report back on our next one on one but for me to verify and to track those numbers I can probably come up with something nothing else I can probably track it manually just from the the traffic on slack I would love for you to figure out a system for that if you can if it's really big then bring it to me let's figure out how we can make it worthwhile but every time I've asked somebody to create a tedious report
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The data that came from it was worth the effort. There's always an aha moment. I just did this. I have this one client, he's new, he for sure, so he has multiple businesses. He's a doctor, thought that one business was his bread and butter, made him the most money. Does not like doing the reports and gathering the data and organizing it, but no shock because nobody does, nobody does, but has a very kind of dismissive attitude about it. I'm like, you just pay me big, big, big dollars to do this. So you probably want to do it. And then we did it and it took five minutes. All he didn't even do it himself. I extracted the data and plugged it into his spreadsheet and you want to know what I found out that the business he's been working on growing but thinks is, you know, 33% more profitable than the one he thought was his main breadwinner. Had no idea. The one average. changes him about $2,000 an hour. The other one $3,600 an hour. He had no idea and didn't want to do the work to figure it out and the work took five minutes.
00:44:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What was that difference?
00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a doctor, so he's got different types of ways that he provides service and he thought this type of service was the most profitable when really it was this one and he had no clue because he didn't check his numbers because it was a pain in the butt and there wasn't a database and nobody told him how to do it. Nobody made him do it. It wasn't necessary to do the job, but nobody works with me to just do the job. We work together to do the job optimally and optimize isn't just the most out of the least for the business's sake. It's the most out of the least for the person's sake, meaning the most results out of the least effort and stress and overwhelm. anxiety for the people who are doing the job, and everybody wants that. But most people don't think it's possible. It is 100% possible to be so much better at the job that you do now by a few little tweaks of fortifying systems, scripts, documented processes, and SOPs. There including just leadership, talking to your people, knowing what they need, knowing what drives them, and showing them how they can get what they want, and it's completely within their power, and also showing them how they can avoid the consequences they don't want, like losing a job, and how it's completely in their power. So, if you will figure out how you can track their performance and results. Now, this is not about micromanagement, but it is about the micro data. Okay, you're not going to go tell them. I notice you did you got to fix this little thing better. You're just going to show them the stats like I showed you. I'm not telling you on any kind of minute level how you can improve your your average resolution time. I haven't got a clue. You do that. I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to tell you this is the thing. This is the impact it makes. And here are some of the things you can do to improve your team within that figure out how improving your team gets that step improved. Right. So you're going to do the same thing and say these are your goals. These are where you hit your goals. That means something's measurable. Something is measurable. Right. I'm trying to remember because I have your list on.
00:46:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I can come up with ways. It's just they're not going to be automatize, it's going to be like just manual tracking a lot.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you figure out what it is, you could probably narrow that, that, you know, manual work down. So it's fairly quick, but probably imagine about 30 minutes a week on reporting. Once the hardest part is figuring out what needs to be reported and where do you get the data? So in the beginning, it's going to seem like this is a pain in the button, it takes a really long time. But once you figure out where all of the data lives, and you create a home for it, is a spreadsheet with the relative data, potentially with some formulas that make a correlation to percentages, things like that, then it becomes easier and you get there faster and faster. And at some point, it might be something that you can outsource, but you probably don't want to. This is really important. This for you Lorenz, I'm going to tell you why it should motivate you. The clearer you are on their stats, the clearer you are on what you need to coach them for and how you need to support them. And when you're clearer on that, you get to your goals faster. Your incentive pay is improved. Your job security is improved. This thing that I'm telling you that has to be done manually, that's its power. So I'll go back to the doctor client. He was spending the majority of his time in the business he thought made the most money. What do you think happens if he goes from spending, what if he took five hours a week from the one he thought gave him the most money and that was at $2,000 an hour and gave five hours a week to the one him $2,000 an hour? That's more than $5,000 extra per month. It's almost, well, because it was $3,600. So it was, whatever, we'll say it's around $8,000 more, a month, week, a week times four, so 32. $32,000 more to shift five hours a week from one business to the other, now that he knows the numbers that he should have known and didn't want to get. That's how important this information is and who runs people don't do this. Look how much you grew your team, their improved their performance with the few things that you've already done. We talked for an hour a week, three times a week, that's it, we've had effectively about six calls. Look at your stats. You did it. at that. We had some conversations about what you might do, but in that six hours, I, you know, all I did was help you think thoughts. You did all the work and they did all the work. But that's the power of leverage. Six hours of this time together was that insightful, and then you went and took that and put it into a system, into a process, which went into their operations, which got you shocking results. I looked at it. was like, am I looking at this wrong? the data wrong? It was like, that's amazing. It was profound. Now, I don't know if you can maintain that because there are so many things that go into what cases you get, you know, all of these different things. But for sure, a significant portion of that results was driven by you.
00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I think that's what these calls do. They help me focus narrow down what will produce them the most results instead of like being overwhelmed by all the tasks that I need to resolve and more proactive about the driving factors that I'm actually going to impact the results most.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what prioritizing does and leveraging, you're doing all of that. So keeping all of that in mind, however difficult it is to figure out how to track the data, do your best to figure out how to track performance of each of your individual teams and yourself because you want to know what you're doing and the impact that it's having. So the things that have the biggest impact you want to give more of your doing all all time to. Same reason, right? Five hours from this business to this business was worth $80,000 a month for him. Over the year, that's $800,000 plus $2,160,000. $8,160,000. Crazy. I got to go do the math for him. Just let him know he paid for all his coaching that day. I got to go tell him that. Thank you. You're welcome.
00:52:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Big count.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I need to do my own app and be like, round. Did you say?
00:52:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, my success is, is your success too.
00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
suppose that's. I'll take that. I like to share. It's, it's my joy though because, I mean, when I know something that can help people, I want to give it to them. You're the same way. I know you are. If you knew something that could help somebody, help them be happier, help them be less stressed, help them take better care of their family. 100% you're going to give it to them. Just because you're also getting paid and you're also getting blessed when they do the thing because you told them doesn't, doesn't remove the fact that you would have done it for free if you'd have known.
00:53:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I care deeply about my team. I care about their welfare, I care. I'm invested in their long-term success.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now I dream about my clients literally. I say prayers about them. And if I see people on the streets and they're talking about their business, I cannot keep my mouth shut and I give free advice. if people reach out and they're like, hey, can I talk to you? I can't afford you. Let's go. Let's just. So I get you. I know that. So remember that the things that you're asking them to do is for everybody's reward and benefit. And then you want their buy-in. You want that. You want to know and you want them to say it that that's what they want also. You don't want them to just say, okay, they'll do it. You want them to do it because they know the value of it. That's the buy-in. Because then they're going to continue to talk themselves into it. Otherwise, you have an uphill battle constantly. You have to keep reminding them. You have to keep dangling a carrot. You want it to be their reason for doing the thing. But in order for that to happen, you have to know what drives them and help them see that correlation. So that doesn't happen immediately. Sometimes it can. Sometimes you can get lucky and just have the right conversation. Sometimes you can be inspired. I'm always praying before calls. like, please help me to know what to say, how to guide things. I think a lot of times there's inspiration that comes out of nowhere. I'm like, I had this thought. like, where'd that come from? um, I think you're It's a simple thing. We're talking about the same things every time. Data, people, stats, goals, then the why behind it, how we can think things a little bit differently. There is nothing magical about what we're doing. There's nothing shiny, new, high-tech. You got to go scrape data and stick it into a spreadsheet. How long have we been using spreadsheets? It's archaic. But it's almost magical because then you go look at those numbers and you're like, yeah.
00:55:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is where I got to work. The resolution time is where I got to focus at my energy zone.
00:55:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in case I didn't ask it clearly, I do want you look at hours worked in July for everybody compared to August. Because if, and I know, people were out sick, but what we want to try to figure out is what is our capacity with the amount of time that we have. We want to be able to increase our capacity without increasing time because we work better and smarter, which means they can increase their revenue, right, their incentive pay, without adding more stress and adding more labor and work, just improving our processes. We don't want to be slave drivers and with crackers. We don't want to do that. We want to be optimizers. And I want you to use that language with them. I want it to become part of your culture is we work optimized so we can enjoy life. We want to get paid well. You want to go enjoy our life outside of sweet love, but also when you're optimized, you are serving your people, your clients that call you that are going through difficult times in their life, you're serving them as efficiently as they can be served, you're getting them in and out faster so they can get back to their lives and get back to some sense of normalcy after whatever they went through. So it's win-win-win all the way around and because of that, it's worth the effort. Now if somebody on your team doesn't care about other people, that's not going to work for them but I don't imagine you have that.
00:57:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now they're all the people. I'm blessed to have them.
00:57:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah so show them how their effort doesn't just bless them but show them how it blesses everybody else first of all because of what's a team so we're not hitting the bonuses without everybody doing their part. So you doing your part makes us extra sure that Barry gets her bonus and Jessica gets her bonus and so-and-so right so you're putting that community value there. But also Hey, guys, when we get these things going and we move quickly, our clients are getting their cases resolved quicker, when we're getting that higher attorney fees or we're hitting the policy limits, we know that they've gotten all the care that they could possibly get and they have the best chance of surviving or just thriving after, you know, the traumatic incident that they went through, we're improving quality of lives. That's part of our job and the way that we support each other, we're improving each other's quality of lives, we're making working together more enjoyable and rewarding and the work that we do more enjoyable and more rewardingly. Where is the reason to not do this? But people don't think like that generally unless there's a catalyst for the thought. And that's where you come in all the time. Remind them who we are, why we're here. Let's go.
00:59:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What we're doing?
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm looking forward to September stats. Well, what's team learning to be like, that's my boy right there.
00:59:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I'm not as loud as the other attorneys, but I'm intensely competitive. I like numbers matter to me. I I've been competitive ever since I was, and that's the reason I went to law schools because I'm super competitive. so I enjoy getting big numbers.
00:59:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenzo's going to come in with a sneak attack.
00:59:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're like, oh, you thought I was the underdog. I don't talk trash.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't, you know, get to the games and , but I. I love trash talking, Lorenz.
00:59:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Even when I'm losing, I don't care.
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's just fun for me.
01:00:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I wouldn't never guess that about me, right?
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Should have been a lawyer.
01:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the one profession I wanted to be and the only reason I didn't pursue it was because I wanted to be mom more and there was no way I couldn't have those two things competing because I would want it to be the best at both. And I want to be those very compatible goals.
01:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. That's a hard, that's a hard choice.
01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm working on finally finishing my psychology degree. And I think I want to work towards a PhD no matter how long it takes me. So I think that I can help more people that way with just with their mindset, know, and help them find the logic and the reasons and let them do their magic and be supported.
01:01:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I did my bachelor's in and said to go to law school because the PhD were out to seem too overwhelming to me.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm all down when my kids are almost grown so I'm like you know what are you gonna do with your life I'm just gonna learn.
01:01:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're the better person for it that's for sure.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then it's just helpful it's fascinating if I had all the time in the world for sure the three PhDs I would get would be neuroscience psychology and quantum physics because I am and then all the languages and then all the arts and then all the dances and then all the instruments. Let me live forever. Right well do you have any questions anything that we didn't talk about that you need to bring them up?
01:01:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
don't think so. The thing that sets my goals for the month pretty clearly will be be working on those reports and figuring out I'd have to best correlate the firm's goals with their needs or vice versa.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So let me check. So next week is we meet together and then the week after that is, is you get your off week. So yeah, let me know what kind of reports you're able to come up with next week. So remember time reports, let's compare July to August so that we can get some kind of corollary data in terms of getting a shell to pull that up for me. Perfect. And then how do we track individual performance and just get the raw data and then what you can do, if it was tedious, show me your process when we meet and obviously if there's a way that I can help you kind of improve it. But yeah, it's a work in progress, but I think it's worth the effort.
01:02:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And I think you're seeing that. I like it. Yay.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're awesome. It's so good talking to you. I'll talk to you next week.
