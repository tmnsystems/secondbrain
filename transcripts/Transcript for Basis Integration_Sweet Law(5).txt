00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you. How are you doing?
00:00:07 - mark sweet
I'm definitely tired.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I imagine you are.
00:00:14 - mark sweet
It's okay. I'm still here.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. I got a replant of my daughter. All right. And Dan should be back. Just got off our call, but we had to switch lines. I went to grab a drink. I want my puppy baby to come here. Oh my gosh. I wish she was here this week, because this week husband hell. But God is good. Very, very, very good. Puppies. Puppies little. Oh my gosh. I ordered him this like black and gray plaid collar that's going to have his name etched in it with a matching leash and I'm getting him a custom sweater. the little h embroidered on it and yes and that mom like he's already got so many toys and a bed and blankets and yeah i'm not i don't spoil at all no um i'm doing amazing chona been doing amazing to be on top of her step mark be positive tip oh my gosh she's in co-office upstairs when she is a welcome series she has gotten on top of all of her charting and started early you better focus on the things that's going good and not the things that you're um what you better you better all right hi welcome back here buddy
00:03:00 - mark sweet
Uh, they just canceled it, by the way.
00:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, god, I know. These guys all look canceled.
00:03:05 - mark sweet
Um, yeah, they're just canceled soon. I've been worried because more of the doctors that I'm pretty friendly with, she's in San Francisco and she looks fast freaking out. One of the second floor. This has been a payer, rapper, and trimsic. Can't go anywhere.
00:03:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sounds about right. The government's going to kill us, yep.
00:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people don't even pay attention to the historical data where these things happened and they freaked everybody out and then nothing happened.
00:03:32 - mark sweet
Yeah, let's say up. That's fine. This is what the government does to us. They're studying on this. more that they just throw these things at you, then you can get away a lot more.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's okay. Dude, that has been my exact experience with DHS this week. like, you guys do absolutely nothing, but cause, fear, and anxiety. I'm like, you know what? You don't get to do that this week. So, off, of these. But this is not fair. You know, like, I literally have a re- Flexitive response. It's involuntary. It would also be voluntary, but it's involuntary. And Mark does it on purpose. It's like a like a Pavlovian bell or something. Just but I'm talking mid-sentence.
00:04:16 - mark sweet
Ring the bell please. Yeah, I'm really good at shiny ball.
00:04:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. know. I know. Um, all right.
00:04:25 - mark sweet
So let's like part of the ag conference, any would have been less throw in part of the other by the conference.
00:04:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's all crap. Not all crap.
00:04:38 - mark sweet
It can't all crap. Like commanding is screwed. Like we are just building our own demands.
00:04:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's that's our truth.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably be that last night, but she's like, that's what you came back with. Okay. I want to know.
00:04:53 - mark sweet
Michael is the AI innovation officer with Microsoft. He was the one doing all the stuff. So, he's directly working on OpenAI. And, um, you said you're squared.
00:05:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, Mark, yes, what, what, just, okay, so things for us that are helpful. Thank you. That's, that's what I would like.
00:05:22 - mark sweet
There's a lot of stuff in general, but we may need to pay more attention to being SEO optimization.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that, I think we always know that, don't we?
00:05:35 - mark sweet
No, no, no, we're focusing mostly on Google. Everyone focuses on Google because they are the big monkey. So, unsurprisingly, chat GPT, whenever you're trying to have it search for something, it uses Bing as a search engine.
00:05:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It just started doing that. Like yesterday.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh.
00:05:55 - mark sweet
Little funny. And being our one in one. And I asked the question everyone was me like, I was dumb. I'm like, well, that was news to me, but, okay, anyway, no one else we can know that we're going put two and two together in that regard.
00:06:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I didn't know that's what it was using, but literally yesterday, I installed the Chrome add on, which is hilarious. So you're saying so what we have here is the Chrome add on allows it to search Bing. Ouch. That's Chrome. Sorry, Google. Interesting.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild. That's funny. That's almost like, hi, just came in your house to like take over.
00:06:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. It's like when they put out the browser to begin with and start stealing all of Microsoft .
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's like, it's payback time. Right. Turnabout's fair play.
00:06:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Apparently.
00:06:47 - mark sweet
But the other part of this is Microsoft is investing a lot of money into this. It also costs them $100 million every time they do an update to the knowledge base, just in case you're curious down.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
your lord yeah their biggest concern is energy energy consumption well but the real the real problem is the it doesn't make any money right so it's like all this money's being plowed into it but no one's really figured out the revenue part it's like how are you gonna make this money back that you're sinking into all these AI things it's like it's almost they're all just like it's gonna happen I'm like is it I mean yeah it's it's cool but you know what would be cool if you made money with it too and didn't quit it's gonna both be cool did you get recordings and transcripts they would not let us interesting because a lot there's a couple like slides but that's about it
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have like a page like pages of notes or anything?
00:08:03 - mark sweet
Yes, sort of.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really like to see what you came away with. Personally, it's not available later.
00:08:12 - mark sweet
Because I will, I mean, there were so much room of consciousness because, yeah, but that's not a word to you to right now.
00:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just want to see what's useful thread to pull potentially for us.
00:08:36 - mark sweet
I mean, some of cool things is literally how it does it, like how chat GPT kind of works.
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the great thing about that is, and especially like for my type of brain is I'm good at forecasting, predicting kind of where it might be going, and which just helps me figure out what do I want to focus on now.
00:09:00 - mark sweet
and but also it helps me what do I not want to focus on because there's all kinds of shiny objects and you can't be great at studying all of them so I just want to see if there's anything that helps go okay really pay attention to here because this is the most leveraged right that's always what I'm looking for way to be using this this is also potentially negative against us leverage that could be happening so how do we protect against it um a lot of things about agents of course and what that's going to do it's going to be um but I did not realize how much Bing could potentially impact our future and if we have something of an advantage because no one I know is doing much anything with Bing and if we can figure out how to optimize for Bing people are more and more using chat GPT as just a search engine.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that big. And if you think about who's in charge of that and that, you know, I don't know, it's probably time to make some plays. So, yeah. Okay.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
So that was some of the bigger takeaways. There's some interesting things on why certain prompts work better and those are kind of in my notes.
00:10:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:10:19 - mark sweet
But basically, when you speak more nicely to chat gb and get better matter because it means your interaction, which is funny.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I didn't hear that part.
00:10:33 - mark sweet
That's interesting. Yeah. that was pretty interesting.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:45 - mark sweet
So, but some prompt engineering stuff that's cool, but for us, some of the biggest takeaways are renewed focus on Bing that we really haven't done it all. And I have no idea how to do that. So, Dan, I need your help there.
00:11:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what Garrett's for.
00:11:02 - mark sweet
Okay. Well, let's hurt the hell out of this.
00:11:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I'll hit hurt up.
00:11:08 - mark sweet
Yes, it's good to crap out of it. Then, how do you spell Gert?
00:11:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
With G-E-R-T here.
00:11:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Just like I thought, I was just making sure. Sometimes if there are different ethnicities, gets something weird to have.
00:11:28 - mark sweet
Then, just get ready for robot co-workers. It comes next to you at lunch and plugs itself in.
00:11:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not at my office.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. know.
00:11:42 - mark sweet
beer next to you.
00:11:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But people have It could serve beer. That might work.
00:11:46 - mark sweet
People have this huge fear of becoming, so it's interesting. My co-pilot stuff is cool, but, yeah. Okay. That's all my co-pilot stuff. Doctor of Business were good, just reiterated what's going on and where my case is basically.
00:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did that one more time?
00:12:09 - mark sweet
Where are my non-attached cases for the Missouri people? I'm spending a lot of money on Missouri-generating cases and I'm not getting anything back from you guys where that was kind of the reason to do it.
00:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guys?
00:12:25 - mark sweet
Missouri doctors, I'm representing cases.
00:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I missed a thing.
00:12:31 - mark sweet
I heard most of it, but that was the thing that I missed.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so was that conversation an in-person?
00:12:38 - mark sweet
How did that? That was state number two.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, and what was the outcome of that?
00:12:44 - mark sweet
They understand they're going to work on it. I don't think they thought it was as big of an issue as it was.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're not tracking their results for you in that relationship.
00:12:59 - mark sweet
no idea how to and do it generally, and they don't have any great plans of how to generate more unrepresented cases, because right now, they're just trying to figure out a way more people to send them cases. There's a reason we're more successful in some of these smaller states.
00:13:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so okay, there's a day. How many days are there?
00:13:29 - mark sweet
So there were six doctors there, two which were together, one of them is sort of in the same group, like it's a mini-choy network, I guess is the best way to say it. There's only about three attorneys that are part of it, and they're by far the largest volume, and we're not high-volume in St. I mean as you can tell.
00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and is anyone in that group organizationally minded somebody that you could like tap say could could you help me work on this structure and organization no don't backwards they much might hire a marketing girl who seems scared of her own shadow and just walks into offices trying to make things happen but like after what what is your plan to like help generate you know more clients around represent cases I don't know how the different offices do it you're the marketing person so what if you created a system that is just simple and then you basically pass it over to them and say this is what you need to do every week this is what you update it will be shared with us and then that way we're all on the same page who on your team or who in your group do you want to have be responsible for this my The biggest thing I've learned as a kind of system to overcoming obstacles where people are complacent or they just don't know what to do. It's generally a combination of both or they have too many things on their plate and it's not that priority either way is to reduce the friction to a yes as much as possible use the friction to getting what I want. So I will create and simplify and make all you have to do is plug and play. Sit down and do this tiny little thing and then the thing that I want I get and here's all of the benefits to you for having done your tiny little thing. So I would literally build the system whether it's a spreadsheet, whether it's something that we did in high level, whatever, and just say all you have to do is have your person update this spreadsheet, update this record in high level or do whatever right. Tiny little action you can do. once a week to update it, you can do it every day as things happen, either way, I will be able to go run a report and know how things are doing. I will let you know. I will send the report to you so that we can both make sure that we're having a profitable relationship.
00:16:22 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you don't have anything like that that exists now, right? Because you don't really need to. know we could do this in high level. HubSpot has it. It's something Fuji is kind of working on and doing. So either we could have a conversation with Dan and work on building something that way. You can talk to Fuji. See what he's doing. It's really simple because now I'm trying to think about how do I make it frictionless for you and not make it a big thing. But that would be those are two paths. I see to getting this done quickly. Anything stand out to you that are preference? How interested are you in doing it?
00:17:15 - mark sweet
I need to think about it. Just a little bit. don't have a great answer at the moment. want to think about that a little more because there's there are sensitive components of all this.
00:17:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:26 - mark sweet
And would you do for himself first trying to do it for others? Where it's different and trying to get people to provide us some of the information that we're going to need to be able to execute?
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all I wanted you was to be able to look at a foundation for an idea, like a visual concept and go, okay, well, I need this. I don't need that. I don't need this. But what I do need is this, this, and this. And it just makes it really easy to go from there. Did you see something visually already? If that makes sense.
00:17:57 - mark sweet
Got it. Okay.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, unless you could, I don't know, I mean, and we could even we could work on it together could be something that we do either way, you have to own it until you have somebody unless you have somebody who's good at just creating organizational things and you basically say, this is the framework. So they don't have to own it and continue to have access to this information. They just create it and they can transfer ownership to you. Like you use Microsoft Suite, right?
00:18:41 - mark sweet
Right. Okay.
00:18:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So either way, they get transfer ownership to you. So just because somebody builds it for you, it doesn't mean that they get involved and they know everything. But you just say, this is this is what I need to try. This is the data. These are the columns, things like that, whatever gets started and then. Okay, so let me show this with you. I already showed it with you. So I want you to bookmark. I have something that I sent and shared with you that I showed you to, called Suite Law, Task Items, and Focus Points. And it's still getting organized, but this is so you can remember these are the things that we're working on. Ultimately, I'm going to have some priority levels in here. And we can have some due dates and whatnot, but this will be in there. So if you're like, I feel like working on what can I build to get more leads steadily, then you go look at the things that's related to what needs and whatnot. Alright, so your trips, what else did you do?
00:21:00 - mark sweet
I took a red-eye, which I still am convinced I can sleep on an airplane, even though I can't, so I'm getting to learn that, but it's not a good idea.
00:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can sleep on an airplane.
00:21:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or you need to get yourself a wheat gum base.
00:21:13 - mark sweet
It doesn't matter. can take zenix, I can take muscle relaxers, whatever. does not matter, still cannot sleep.
00:21:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it just become a sitting or it's because it's an airplane?
00:21:23 - mark sweet
I don't.
00:21:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. In five, hold seven out nine. Do it until you start forgetting to count. Or what happens with me is I forget to exhale. And then I just stop doing it because I'm like, I can't, my mind's not working anymore, like I can't do this. And then two minutes later, like I'm out cold.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In five, hold seven out nine.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:22:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so, or just number red eyes.
00:22:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or that.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Arizona case volume. Well, okay. I didn't want to hear about that. It's not that I didn't want to hear about it, but what I was looking for is what came as a result of any of the other meetings that you had.
00:22:24 - mark sweet
What the different vendors?
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:22:28 - mark sweet
Or this last trip.
00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything since the last time we spoke that you've been because you've been.
00:22:34 - mark sweet
We go post going to. I have very low expectations at this point. Like they're just bad.
00:22:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. vendors.
00:22:49 - mark sweet
Like it's just, it's. Not great. The magneto people kind of fell off the face of the earth.
00:22:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not surprising. Yeah.
00:23:04 - mark sweet
One thing that we've been talking to Tom about is doing TV ads. They do a lot with like a commercial at night and they work for every reason.
00:23:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Infomercials or commercials would you say? They're doing like infomercial type commercials like 30-minute long segments. Right. And is that on cable or is that on streaming services or like, I would imagine.
00:23:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's to sell the specifics.
00:23:47 - mark sweet
think it's going to be like they pick up remnants and it's on cable channels and hospitals and everything else. And the monthly cost is not ridiculous. There's a. I'll still obviously like film all the videos and everything also cost probably about 11 or 12 grand just to like get it ready.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
25 you said.
00:24:14 - mark sweet
11,000 just to do all the like filming.
00:24:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I see ads on cool room and I'm like, I wonder who me commercials work because there's a lot of TV you can buy time that's geotargeted. Yeah, and then I was just I just looked it up like it was probably around six million subscribers in California.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how many of them are live and how many watch live TV because I feel like infomercials like you're not going to just go click on an infomercial and watch it. It has to be showing up on what you're already
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
watching. But yeah, on Hulu, 90% of subscribers are on ads. Yeah, 10% are ad free. And they are way more ads. The other day, was like, oh my god, I'm back to regular television. Except they, no one must buy their ads. variety of ads is non-existent. It's the same like three freaking ads over and over and over again.
00:25:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might depend on what you're watching though.
00:25:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It could, which would be interesting. I know I think they have a self-serve ad platform now. I had to apply for it at one point. I denied. That was probably like two years ago. I've never, and I've never seen the lawyer out there.
00:25:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you thinking about doing that?
00:25:52 - mark sweet
Like, do they have any stuff for you? The SaaS they shared with other firms around the country that are getting cases on less than it. $20,000 budget. So it seems to work, but again, I just don't like trust anyone.
00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:26:12 - mark sweet
Tom, I've known these guys at least like I've known Tom a long time. I've known Mike for seven or eight years. And I mean, if you've got a company that does marketing in the legal field and you haven't changed your name and you've been around for seven or eight years, you're probably some other total of this camera. Yeah. you know, it's kind of worth a shot. was thinking of starting in Arizona and have Hank and Aaron's on TV because the issue is when you advertise on TV, there will be clients who want to meet the lore they saw on TV.
00:26:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:45 - mark sweet
And since we have physical in front of a bookcase, this is very distressing.
00:27:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or in the garage, don't forget the garage.
00:27:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hi, I'm Mark sweet. Like, oh, yeah, the garage would be good, too.
00:27:09 - mark sweet
It doesn't matter what you put up half the time. It's just how often it's there.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you're catching the person on the right moment, that is exactly right. That is exactly right.
00:27:19 - mark sweet
Like it's just sliming these freaking people.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep, that's right. So, but also then the message you want to be concise and repetitive as well, even in your segment. The whole point is you want them to remember you so that when they need you, they, you're what pops in their head. So, and so just kind of like, oh, I know who to call this guy. A lot. Go just watching something a couple of days ago about the number one car salesman in the world. And he said most car sales people Well, their focus is, how do I get somebody to walk out of here with a car today? And his focus is, how do I get people to walk out of here knowing that the next time they're going to buy a car, they're coming to me? Doesn't matter if they buy a car today or next year or three years from now, when they're buying a car, they know they're buying for me. All they have to do is figure out what car they want, but they know they're coming to me. So along that same lines, right? Just who you are, what do you do, why would they want you? And if they don't need you now, maybe they're thinking about somebody else who will need you, but you're selling you and not the urgency of you got to come contact us right now, which is part of the situation, because it's the case degrades. But maybe that's why they want to contact you is because you've told them everything that they need to know and that most people, know, or not most people, what many people can't get any settlement and can't get any help because they don't know these things and no. He's telling them, and we'll make sure you know everything you need to know, like that you've got to get, you know, seen by a doctor within a month or two weeks or something like that, whatever that is. Anyway, but I mean, it feels like considering all the other expenses that we paid, that's not excessive in terms of like trying a vendor.
00:29:20 - mark sweet
It's not, um, it's, it's not, but.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you going to try it?
00:29:25 - mark sweet
We are just trying to find dates because they were trying to get us to do the ninth and like, that's just not going to work. Um, so filming will be probably sometime in January.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:29:36 - mark sweet
But you're just unfortunately that that's going to take a little more time. But so far as the best I've found, unfortunately, uh, we're going to switch potentially the Walker model. Um, next year where we're just paying like a flat per. Lead fee instead of it being different, like cost by different states, that way they can. of the money around how they need to move it around to get us more volume.
00:30:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, what do you think about the movie? What does that even mean?
00:30:11 - mark sweet
Well, you're around. So their issue, well, Walker's issue is they have people who come in for like a month or two and then like bounce out, right?
00:30:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that's probably, oh, yeah. And they try to, they try to give them the good crack.
00:30:21 - mark sweet
Right. And so the issue is Arizona, like there's a lot of California firms going there, something will happen in Washington to some level. So instead of it, where Washington costs us 1250 leads, New Mexico's 900 lead, it's just going to be a flat 111050 lead. And we have to buy a minimum number of leads like per month. I think it's about 150, which is in line with what we're spending with them per month anyway, but should make things a little easier for both sides. My concern, of course, is that the quality doesn't say the same. right. Let's go back.
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Other than that?
00:31:01 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do they say?
00:31:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's the only issue.
00:31:04 - mark sweet
Well, the whole thing is we can always go back to what it just was. So if their quality doesn't stay where it needs to be, I'm just going to go back to where it is. Right. Now, instead of looking like it's four or five different contracts, it's one larger contract that's going to have a couple more eyes on it.
00:31:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it.
00:31:19 - mark sweet
That's good.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes.
00:31:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's basically just the math, right? mean, you could figure out. You'd have to like court, you'd have to like take all the data and put like view all the old data like this is new deal. Like, okay, if I was paying 1150 for all these leads before, this is what would have happened. Or I mean, you don't have to do that. Then you just go forward and do it for a month to be like, okay.
00:31:54 - mark sweet
I looked at what we were paying on average when I looked at how much it was for a month.
00:31:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:31:59 - mark sweet
It's right there. It seems to be maybe $20 a lead, so it's not a ton. I mean, I swear to get it.
00:32:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, their idea is like, OK, we can get $200 more in New Mexico than we can try to get more in New Mexico than in Washington. So, yeah, in theory, mean, but ultimately, comes down to the map. Someone literally sent me a shirt.
00:32:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A what?
00:32:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a shirt that says, I was like, what? Or like, did you get something from me? like, I don't know. And then it showed up yesterday. all the shirts said, well, it says is, who makes this shirt? I don't know. That wasn't a very data-driven view. was like, oh, like, saw this shirt. I just thought of you. I was like, oh, it's pretty accurate. He has never going to fit.
00:32:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But thanks.
00:32:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Abel and will enjoy it. I hate to break into people. like, I'm not an off-the-rack t-shirt wearer.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Unfortunately, the ice is an issue. Okay, so this conversation went with Well, but it started with where you've been traveling, who you've been meeting with, and how what are those outcomes, so anything else to report?
00:33:34 - mark sweet
I mean, you saw the end of the month numbers, so that was good. The intent team was happy to see them sign in case at 10 o'clock at night to try to help get their goals, so that's good.
00:33:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, good job.
00:33:49 - mark sweet
And yeah, I think that's about all you got in that regard. I mean, we passed our bedtime to try. Yeah, that's really going to be the big thing. It's bending to more states and saying at low volume just doesn't seem the easiest way to do this going frankly.
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't ever want to hear the word easy because that's just not what business is. Now, if you want to talk about leverage, if it's not the most leverage to do it, it's not the most strategic, you know, okay, don't say easy. I don't care about easy. Because that has been what you said to me about. It's not easy to get data.
00:34:29 - mark sweet
It's a pain in the . Oh, about it. It's, yeah, difficult. It's more difficult than just trying to get more cases. You would think that open up new states just to try to get the same 10, 15 cases in one.
00:34:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but you have to go back to it's a strategy of diversification and diversification is business one on one for a reason. And we. Experience what happens the the state I've been flow the cases I've been flow the Bender specific three more blue steels Yeah Monkeys or three more whatever And what are you doing to get them?
00:35:17 - mark sweet
Keep trying new ones. We're running out of almost The value that the bet gave me that report That was my next That next We're down to like goblin shark and like spider crab at this point If I have to have like star nose mole, we have an issue Okay, anyway, so have you talked to Mary? Yeah, he does no freaking clue why he's like this is weird like here's just more data Here's more data here's more data, but he doesn't have a good reason of why like the lead volume was 40 damn but what?
00:36:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
data. Let's stop there.
00:36:03 - mark sweet
What data is he send to you?
00:36:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
impressions, clicks, uselessness? Sure. Yeah. The typical agency , get him send the report I asked for. That's that's where the if he doesn't know this, which he clearly doesn't, which most people don't, that's where it lives. That's going to tell you what's up. That's going to, if he's tracking this up, it'll tell you where leads actually came from. I am not holding out hope that he's actually doing that correctly. But it'll, it'll point in the right direction, because what happens is Google, out of the blue, actually just dealt with this yesterday, so that I got the dude in Norcat, I'm not Norcat, the dude here in San Diego that I generate the steel building leads for. I literally don't touch his account, right? Like I did some mods to it three months ago. And, and then he hit me up and was like, dude, it's. of working like great. I never log in like it. If it's working, I'm just gonna leave it. He hits me like a week ago. He's like, I don't know what you've been doing, but it's crushing him like I'm done anything. It's set up and it just runs. But for for funsies, I logged in there yesterday and I looked at a couple things and I was like, hmm, that like the numbers are good and they're with they're totally hitting his targets. I'm like, I don't know. And then I reel into that report and what's Google started doing? I don't know when they started doing it. I bother figuring it out. They started helping Mark. They like to help and saying, oh, you're starting your targeting steel buildings. That sounds like a shop. We're going to put all these other words in here that are shops. like, yeah, I don't want a shop. This has nothing to do with shops. Oh, targeting steel buildings. We're going to throw in, I you not like six other words that they are trying to say are like building that we're not like building. But no, I'm not selling huts. And we're talking six bucks a click across 50, 60 versions of words with the hut in it. Like you mother eppers, that's what they do. So, and if you're spending even more money, they're gonna help even more. They're gonna give you all the help, Mark. I know. Oh, PSI ran one keyword based off of the data that I saw. And the keywords that came in, I spent like two grand and I turned it off. I was like, this isn't gonna work. I can see why Mark's spending 30 grand. So, let's say they're targeting, and I'm sure they're doing it wrong. Everybody does. They're targeting something like, or I'll tell you, I'll go along and be gonna run out. But the way that Google was helping, like you've got to be shitting me. One of the biggest words they kept adding was today. So, it was our accident reports today. Our accident reports reports Phoenix today. Those are clearly people looking for car exit reports. It's not someone looking to get a car exit report. It's someone that wants to see it. It's some tricking rubber necker that wants to see the accidents that happened. But the variations on today plus geo plus names of highways, it's out of control. And what you want to do is go in and identify those patterns of like, that's bad intent. Today's bad intent. Therefore, I'm going to negative phrase match the word today. And then what that does is it tells Google do not ever use the word today. Because I know it's not good. They're doing like that. They're poisoning the well with their help. And when they do, then getting the money, getting what they want. Not what you want. But if you go run that search query report for the year, if the data's in there, you'll see the patterns where I'm
00:40:00 - mark sweet
Oh, well, again, trying to get data out, trying to get them to share this data is it's your money. I know.
00:40:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no, I'm going to fire your wife. Give you the report. Done.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh, that's the most ghetto you've ever been or like, Jesus Christ.
00:40:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You've literally spent like close to a million dollars with this dude. Give me the effing report period end of story, like who's in charge? Right? like, is he nuts? Who's credit card? Is it who's account? Is it? It's your account? Technically, it's your credit card. Also, do you want to keep getting paid? Because I'm not going to keep paying on a pain you $10,000 retainer. And he's not going to be able to turn it around because he does if he doesn't know the problem that he doesn't have to fix it. Fire, Mary. done sorry it has to be done.
00:41:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is not doing that but like I've been talking to Elon and Vivek Mary's got to go.
00:41:10 - mark sweet
Yes, we're dosing it up over here.
00:41:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Taking a page from Doge. But whatever or they can show you I don't know why the guy won't do it like what are you protecting your shitting needs now? Great.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark?
00:41:38 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a response to that? I mean, I'm in the semi-decere's terms. Are you asking him or telling him?
00:41:51 - mark sweet
I am asking not telling him yet because I think if we have one more bad month that's definitely game over. Well, then I've got a really good reason for it.
00:42:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you have a really good reason for it.
00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much money have you spent?
00:42:08 - mark sweet
You understand how these people are. And if it's not from me, you can go to another firm and get it.
00:42:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we can. If you can't get results.
00:42:17 - mark sweet
Oh, like they know the difference.
00:42:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is true.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is true.
00:42:22 - mark sweet
So let's just take a quick second to get where I understand what you all are saying. I don't disagree with you all, but we've got lawyer.
00:42:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Were you were you tripped down south?
00:42:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What the hell just happened?
00:42:38 - mark sweet
I am tired. So when I'm tired, I either. It was eerily accurate.
00:42:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Have you ever lived down south?
00:42:44 - mark sweet
I've never lived down south.
00:42:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's wow. I mean, that was a very odd point for you.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Only the use of the words, not the tone at all.
00:42:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I thought the accent was pretty good.
00:42:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but you're not from the top and I am.
00:42:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I lived there. I lived there for years. If you ain't from it, I'm not from it, but he lived it. I did get it.
00:43:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is not saying. It is not also, there's a whole lot of variation.
00:43:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So oh, God, yeah, totally. The further something you get, the worse it gets.
00:43:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was deep in the Mississippi. Anyway, OK, yes. So you're going to have a diplomatic conversation with Valiant for now and try to let this we're going to let this month go sideways because it's clearly going sideways, which works and we're just started.
00:43:38 - mark sweet
But yes, I mean, it didn't start bad. We're at 13 and it's we should be 15, but it is one.
00:43:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Correct.
00:43:52 - mark sweet
Feeling source really going right now in this walker in terms of volume. Yeah, so not hugely shocking or surprising at the moment. In terms of the retainers out. It's monkey walker news monkey walker walker monkey walker.
00:44:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay.
00:44:22 - mark sweet
So the monkeys doing its regular ish thing. Yeah, we're arguing with Felipe because I keep playing more and more money from me and the results are not where I would like them to be. Because it's been now 65,000 a month. Now it's like 110,000 a month for the results, which the numbers are not making as much sense as they did before. And they're saying, Oh, this is just the industry now.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We check my email from Stacey because I am still waiting for an update on Josh's report. So I sent that to her and replied. and Dan said he sent these to you, but he sent the names of the dashboards. are as follows. I mean, but these are not new. this is not an update. I'm very confused by the information I'm getting in this. Did Josh update things that we know of or do I just, we're just responsible to go look and see if it is what we wanted to be now, I guess.
00:45:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Stacy was like, it seemed like you didn't even think the dashboards existed. I'm like, they're there. Like, I don't know what's right or wrong with them, but only one that he's been working on is matter. But the leads ones been there for weeks.
00:45:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the one that tells us how much we pay for retainers.
00:46:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
matters.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's what that is.
00:46:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's three dashboards, one does leads, one does matters, and then one does one I think is something else that I forget, it's something I think it has more to do with what you do with these attorneys. The only one that he's been working on is the matters one. And then where we left off was when we had that meeting with him, he needed the ad cost data from Mark. That was what was holding that one up. In my mind, I'm like, we need to finish one of these. So I thought it would be that one, but I don't know if he got the ad cost data. And if he didn't, then he can't finish it. And then if we want to say, okay, well, we're gonna switch to this one and finish this one. That's fine. But we, I don't think you've given any feedback on the leads one at all. I'm like, I don't know.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like do we want? I didn't know we had one. Like that. That's the thing. The communication has been wonky.
00:47:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I mean, I said it to you weeks ago and I literally said I need you guys to give me feedback on this.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like a long time. I did that. I sent that.
00:47:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not on the leads one.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm pretty sure I've been good, but I will check. So.
00:47:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But so regardless where we left out was with the matters one and I don't know if Mark sent in the data, but it's like that's right. That's where it was at.
00:47:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, did you?
00:47:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, there we go.
00:47:46 - mark sweet
Are you going to the reason that didn't send all the data is because we're fast to just change up Walker.
00:47:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So before he goes and builds all these things depending on where the that is going to mess it up. That would be pointless.
00:47:56 - mark sweet
You want to just waste time.
00:47:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it would work. Yeah, it's not going to be applicable.
00:48:02 - mark sweet
Right, so before we wasted a bunch of time.
00:48:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you're going to have to see. I mean, that Walker Walker is becoming per lead, which they weren't.
00:48:15 - mark sweet
No, they're still per lead right now. It was just state is a different price.
00:48:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we still need.
00:48:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We still need historical data.
00:48:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There is there's no going backwards for a bunch of this stuff.
00:48:34 - mark sweet
Yeah, we don't look backwards.
00:48:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We only move forward. I mean, you'd have to go manually enter all the. Old data because the nuts in there.
00:48:42 - mark sweet
You go for.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. how is this dashboard going to tell me. What we pay for seniors.
00:48:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It can only tell you that from whenever that data gets. it's So like if all the historical data got entered, it would do it.
00:49:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it doesn't. There's no widget widget in here that would even tell us that.
00:49:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Because there's no there's no data to pull it. There's no cost data to put into a widget. Yeah. So like he, yeah, I mean, that's worth that.
00:49:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. Mark, this is a conversation we've been having like four months and we it's been a long, long time since we've updated it. But we talk about costs for tanners, but we don't have any real numbers for what it's actually costing unless you're doing some like dirty math in the background. But I can't even wrap my head around what things are costing because I'm not seeing anything.
00:49:54 - mark sweet
Okay, then I'm going to add to my list the stuff to work on.
00:49:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Thank you.
00:50:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then the other bit is Mark rightly picked the most complicated contract, which is Walker, but now it's changing still. What he would have built would have worked. Now it's a different build.
00:50:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I would be glad for even the dirty math that you may or may not have been doing because and even if we took an entire call to do it. But we've done that before and it wasn't simple, we do need to know what we have been spending historically at least for the year per retainer across the states, across the leads. That is a huge deal. We have sat there and manually figured this out before and it was worth it, but it has been a long time and things have changed a lot and we need current information badly.
00:50:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like Josh said on the call, right? It's like, once he sets this stuff up, it needs, there's only one way it gets it manual. That's it. Like the cost data, he'll have it mapped out. And then it will be like filling the blanks, like, okay, enter the monkey data like this, enter the data like that. And then, so, like, we could obviously not have this bear, right? But it's like, so once he can build it, like he was gonna build it for Walker and be like, is this what you want, right? But we can't do this what he wants and then the data. But let's say he did, then it would be, okay, now I'm gonna apply that in lot. Well, there's two or three types of deals, whatever. So he basically needs to like see each type, like, okay, this type, okay, enter the cost data, is this what you want? Well, he'll know what it should look like based on the first one. So then it would be, okay, at the end of every month, somebody insights we love has to go and update all this cost data. If, if we want to then go backwards from there, you can, because it would be the same, well, he'd have to build this alternative walker version too, the one that we're now moving away from, but which he could, you just need to have it explained, then he'd need to enter that costator, so that might have to be like walker old or whatever. But someone would have to go back populate all that cost data to whatever period, the beginning of the year, even for the backlink, I don't know. But that's the only way cost data gets in, it's kind of, there's no automation available.
00:52:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, priority wise, this should be pretty urgent, because we need to, we need to figure out what our plan is, but also it should have an impact on the kind of contracts that you create with people, because we know what the actual map is. And right now, we are so far from knowing what it really is that, you know, we don't really have a lot to be working with. That's factual. It's just, it's, it's, it's old, outdated information and data. Just piling on all the work that you have to do marked up off. I think, I think you, I think we should just go and you should take a nap. You had a lot going on.
00:53:39 - mark sweet
No, that's fine. What a reason I have like crazy pain behind my knee and I'm going to get it checked out because it's not going away.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Oh, well, that's not fun. Okay. Well, so another news meeting with. um the guys on Tuesday I was and I let them know very disappointed that nobody had bother updating our report in two weeks and like I realize it's a holiday and they're like well I was still working I'm like yeah but I'm paid to come here and meet and there is nothing to talk about if you aren't doing the things I've asked you to do and have a report ready so um first of all make sure that every time we're on a meeting the day before or not the day of you go through and you've you've pondered on the things that I that I have a whole list of things and bring something to the table ready to talk because they're both kind of quiet and so I usually do the majority of the talking unless I ask a specific question but I'm like you need to be um leading a little bit more and and at least just coming prepared so we got that and then we were looking at updated um stats and Lorenz Stuff just kind of tanked, but he said it was mostly because of a few cases that had been in trust had just finally closed resolved Whatever the one is the one that they're finally finished and so it But that was I was only looking at it. No, actually I like that it for the whole year so anyway, I just reminded them and drove it home that You You have to be on top of the things that matter most all the time So and one of them is which by the way You had told me by the end of the month on november that you would Do some research on call control companies Was that I sent email because I found two that were good One I sent it on I don't see it at all No, I did not get that. Oh, no. I have AI conference today, month to date today. Yesterday, tracking second voice. The last one was November 30th, November numbers. I have not seen anything about that. Let search call control. And I'm searching, so it should show anything that's you and it's spam. I do not have anything about that. Can you just re send it?
00:56:41 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:56:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:56:45 - mark sweet
And I ran into was a lot of people were like, oh, just outsourced to us instead.
00:56:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, I'm trying to do. Nope. No, because we have some very specific things that that is what's been happening. So as they're, you know, Oh, paying more attention to their people. They're looking at the specific types of places, types of conversations that the calls go off the rails.
00:57:12 - mark sweet
I just recently see you should see it shortly.
00:57:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting new mail. Why is it not coming? Oh, there we go. Call control training companies reviewed. Oh, good job. All right, that's going to take me a little bit of time to go through, so I will do that. Make sure we mine myself. Okay, well, that's all we have for right now unless you guys have anything.
00:57:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do not get the reporter. for the month is over, I think, at the report.
00:58:02 - mark sweet
Uh, it's not too good, please. I'm big.
00:58:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. We got to get from mom 10. So we're, yeah, wants to start cleaning up all the death blogs too, but I don't want them.
00:58:13 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:58:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any you won't forget, Commander?
00:58:16 - mark sweet
Maybe more.
00:58:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I won't. I'm in Slack with them. That's the beauty of working with Kurt.
00:58:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have her own little Slucky Slack.
00:58:22 - mark sweet
Yeah. heard the hell out of it.
00:58:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Come on.
00:58:25 - mark sweet
The death blog submissions are definitely up.
00:58:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:58:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:32 - mark sweet
You're all converting, but just the fact that submissions are going up is good.
00:58:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. you quantify that?
00:58:41 - mark sweet
Yeah. me one second. I promise sometimes they put it as website when they're doing initial intake, which is. You know, mean, but that's okay. So it annoys us too.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we fix that?
00:59:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:59:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No because they're well they're manually entering it so.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can we need to coach them.
00:59:12 - mark sweet
So we got 21 submissions from news last month, which is good. 16 in October. Sorry, 17 October. 11 in September.
00:59:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, his stuff started to work and then we're so they're there. Oh, it's four more articles, I think, but they said they sent two yesterday, but then we can put up the new homepage, which is going to move the link juice around. Then we got all the categories that Eric's doing like 2000 of the code. going to recategorize every post that we, every news that we can. And then we're going to start cleaning them up. So that should be done by the end of the month. And then I don't know what the cleanup plan is, but he's going to tell us.
01:00:18 - mark sweet
Right. So we're on the right track and that regard, which is good because that's sort of quite frankly, highest chance of getting a whale.
01:00:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly right. So outlier.
01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
01:00:33 - mark sweet
So we need to double down on that. Whatever we can do to keep pushing that forward.
01:00:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be that it'll be that technical stuff.
01:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also make sure that intake is tracking it properly.
01:00:46 - mark sweet
So we're really aware of the results. Anything that's website or news is almost interchangeable, because it's going to be the same things that we're working on. The website's not people just. randomly finding us and building our name in all reality.
01:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right.
01:01:06 - mark sweet
Because it was a client referral or return client, like they tell us how they found us. So even if it may come through initially, as well as we're changing it, because I want to know what client's enemy clients, right? So we can make sure we nurture those people.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Already then. Well, is there anything else?
01:01:24 - mark sweet
Nope.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go take care of yourself.
01:01:27 - mark sweet
Puppies.
01:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Puppies. Puppies. I love puppies. That's not fair.
01:01:32 - mark sweet
There's on the airplanes. There's dogs on the airplanes all the time now.
01:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:01:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. All the time.
01:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how mine have come to me. And yeah, just traveling though. So that's another reason I was like, you know what? I can have one just for me and he'll be tiny and easy to travel with me in a little bougie doggy purse.
01:01:52 - mark sweet
There you go. I'm that girl. don't care. Every airport has a dog or a rest relief area now. It's insane.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did not know that. love that.
01:02:03 - mark sweet
Yeah, everyone I've been decided.
01:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's weird.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's good. Doggies are good, better than most people. Then I said that. Bye. Bye. Bye.
