Hi!
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, how are you?
00:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm Jim Good. thought I'd take it from my phone in the other room as I'm putting a keypad on my back and then I'll go to my computer when we're ready. it was bad about two weeks ago but the lady who did the massage in my back yesterday said yeah I should continue heating it. Everyone's well so yeah. What did you do? I think was about two weeks ago. I just tweaked it. I just moved the wrong way. You know when your muscles are tight and it's ready to pull if you don't take care of it and so I just tweaked it and I think it's actually when I was getting into the shower because we have a bathtub shower and bathtub is pretty high because we got the bathroom renovated a year ago because we wanted a deeper tub but I guess I just tweaked it because the bathtub's higher and I was gonna get in and you know it is what happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do that just standing up. That's funny. He's a Dana Carvey skit and he talks about getting older and this was like almost 20 years ago. Oh yeah. And he was like going to answer the phone. He's like oh my elbow, my elbow, he's like he sprained his ankle, elbow just answering the phone. And I laughed until I did it.
00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I was like oh you actually did that.
00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Something like that.
00:01:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God.
00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
funny. It was, it was ridiculous. I don't remember. Oh, I woke up and it felt like I'd sprained my wrist just sleeping, but it was like that for two days.
00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God. I was like, how do you spray your wrist sleeping?
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And my sister's like, it's because you sleep with T-rex arms because you're autistic and I'm like, it might be.
00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh my God. That's funny.
00:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, let me open the right tabs. Let's see. Tell me about your host monitor YouTube stuff, huh?
00:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's going really good So does it hurt?
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh No, not at all the first couple days it really annoyed me because I'm very sensitive and I noticed everything and Yeah, but no, I don't feel it at all now and it updates every 15 minutes.
00:02:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's pretty awesome. Oh Oh, it's cool and my numbers have been great.
00:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
haven't gone above one thirty five But that doesn't mean it's because I'm not diabetic it means because I'm massively controlled in my diet and it's annoying But that's what it is.
00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So give me example when you said a hundred grams. I think a carbs a day net carbs net carbs So what's your what do we typically we got yesterday?
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did you eat all the ways protein first and then veggies? So that because I I read that it helps to keep your glucose from spiking
00:03:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in the first place the order of how you eat things. Like boiled eggs or something in the morning or?
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boiled eggs, just regular eggs, steak. always have stuff prepped.
00:03:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got to something like that or fish or whatever I had. I had steak yesterday for breakfast and lunch.
00:03:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's easy and also steak because it's loaded with B vitamins so it's good energy first thing in the morning. And then I have these there's a brand called Simple Mills and they make clean snacks and they have these it's made with almond flour and their chocolate chip bars but the neck carbs is like I don't know what it is it's not very high but it doesn't spike sugar especially if I have the protein first. So I've got good energy and it's easy because I don't spend lot of time cooking.
00:03:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got things I want to do.
00:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a time that I used to cook a lot and now That's like, I've got so many things I want to accomplish on a lot, plus it also makes dishes and it takes even more time.
00:04:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. like, I'll make an instant pop full of stew and just tomato juice and steak and zucchini and black beans.
00:04:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but I've been figuring out diet and macros for my body for a long time already. So like, this wasn't new. I knew this was probably coming. Oh, my back just popped. So, you know, it's, and also I had gestational diabetes with each of my girls.
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So you're saying right there.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I haven't had a soda and what year is it? Two years.
00:04:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Really? It's bubbly. know, the carbonation, like, it drops toxins in your fat cells. That's one thing. I was, I told him,
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Father because one day I was drinking a coke and I was looking at the black sludge going into my body and going I would never have a soda ever again in my life if you wouldn't let me get diabetes and I have diabetes and I'm okay and me and that just reminded me I have to have a conversation with him yeah but anyway uh and Wednesdays I have uh missionary training and so usually it's done a few minutes before 11 but sometimes it goes right up to 11 so today it went right up there okay lores lores anyway so you want to talk about your youtube stuff yes
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's do it.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's what you've been all about for like the last couple of weeks, so...
00:06:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's so insane, um, like, I'm just still shocked at the growth the channel's doing, and I'm just like, yeah, um, let's teach it. Hey, Merlin, okay, buddy, come on, come on, he's wondering if he's okay for him to come out.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's scared of flies.
00:06:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So cute. think he saw a fly. So he went downstairs and hid in the basement. It's okay, buddy. It's just scared again. Doodles. They're scared of everything. But anyway, um, the concept is, because you know I rock at low ticket funnels, that teaching people how to do YouTube is such a high, huge, total addressable market, right? And I really think it can be the vehicle to get to 50k months, 50% profit margin, just that alone with that digital offer. the first step is just like this masterclass I'm doing on social Saturday mainly just to kind of start getting some content out and everything. always like to be paid to create. So, you know, just get some sales at $97 and I purposely chose on 7 and I could have done 27, got more people in it, but I wanted to keep it a small cohort so that basically forces me because this is the type of way I work. it gives me that deadline. like, , I got to get this done now, you know, people pay me for it. It's not just, I'm going to do it. And then with their feedback, of course, I'm sure I'll get testimonials from them, then we'll use that for the sales page and their feedback and this could then become like $1,000 course or $2.47 course that sold as OTO1 upsell1 from a $7 ticket, you know, and that works really well, like I know some people running funnels like that that are doing really well, or just sell it from YouTube to sign up to the on-demand Evergreen, you know, VSL webinar, you know, enter your email. And then the next page is a little blurb about the YouTube course, then you sell it for $197 or And that as well is super scalable, right? and you know, I don't know if there's a high ticket into that after, because I'm not crazy about a high ticket, even though everyone says sell five 10k high tickets. So I like our idea, just having like a few clients that are paying like 5,000 a month or something, and then try to get everything almost passive. And that was motivated by it, to be honest, when my friend Cara showed me that productivity products, where they're making $100,000 a month from their 247 core. So I think they have two options, 247 or 397 or something. she said, man, just an on-demand webinar, you know? didn't ask her what their ad spend is. So I'll ask Cara the next time, because she's good friends with them, but she said they just dialed in that particular webinar training, similar to how publishing.com. I'm probably giving you over context, over information, but She said similar to, you know, the guys at publishing.com, they're making tons of money conversions on their webinar, on demand webinar, they have their webinar really dialed in. So Carol said they just, they sort of just modeled off of the format and training how publishing.com is webinar kind of flows and to their then offer, you know, totally different offer, but just kind of modeled off of that. And yeah, optimize it, tweaked it.
00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, Do you have a name for it?
00:09:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I was calling it YouTube Fast Track System, but I just want to call it YouTube Launchpad. Something like that, you know, I'm open to other names, but it could be the successful, like.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, to me, the name should be really as clear as it can be about what the result is. And so, we have to go broad to go narrow first, but you're using it, first of all, strategically in your content creation to get targeted low-cost leads, free leads, targeted leads, and sales. I would like to see the name have something related to sales related to the strategy. Even though it may be longer, you've been around long enough to know about low-hanging food and SEO if you really want to. And I would imagine you're using this strategy with YouTube is that you're probably using low-hanging fruit. He works a little bit plus the algorithm because it can watch the video and see how good your content is, so that's a little bit different. But for people's brains, if they're choosing what videos to look at when they're looking up how to make money from YouTube, you don't want people that want to create a channel for monetization. specifically because that content might be different, maybe you do, but I would think that you want to attract the people who want to use it to get traffic to a sales offer.
00:11:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, mostly for coaches, digital, course creators, and even high ticket people, or even agencies that need to book calls. But yeah, I think the low hanging fruit could be just like, it's for people who are pissed off at Facebook ads, like that's kind of why I went to YouTube, right? I got pissed off at Facebook ads because of the election right now. Facebook ads are more expensive. You cannot have a low ticket funnel that's going to be profitable. You have to have a back-end system to make it profitable, which is still good. Don't get me wrong. But you can self-liquidate your ads, but I was used to actually making more money than your ads on your low ticket funnels. But with the election right now. yeah, my community and school, people are buying into it. Like I'm getting two average two sales a day, joining my community, is five bucks a month or 25 bucks for the year. have some digital products that are coming in. So yeah, I think the low hanging fruit is the combination YouTube and digital offers. And maybe you get the coaches in the high ticket thing. yeah, and I agree with you. I know one of my friends, he had something called the consulting marketing toolkit and it's like, no, it should be the highly paid consulting, mulch marketing toolkit, because it adds something to it.
00:12:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, how do you add this to it? What if it's like YouTube, YouTube profits for offer owners? That's really specific. And it's really only technical word is the filler word of four. Yeah. YouTube profits for offer owners.
00:12:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So offer owner is a very specific thing. Yeah, I love that, actually. And it brings into my communities of being announced tennis group because his main thing is teaching people. It would have their own offer, right?
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it brings in my micro for magic. Well, and it is, so coaches and consultants, I can't go into Facebook without getting a firm request for somebody who's like, coaches and consultants, get new leads, sales, blah, blah, blah, So like everybody's targeting a diet, but our owners, you know something about marketing when you see that phrase and it means something to you.
00:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. I think that makes so much sense because the other thing, angle I was going like on the sales page. What you mind?
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm really dizzy watching you.
00:13:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. I will go to my laptop any minute now. Sorry, I Yeah, cause I was thinking also like, you know, you could pass track to your first thousand dollars online, but I like.
00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a big U.S. because it could be.
00:13:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I like YouTube profits for offer owners and I'm going to. it up and go to my desktop. So you don't get dizzy. I'm going to put my video off and I'm going to walk and mosey on over to my laptop. Hey, I might even know where I got my massage, the lady changed offices, buildings, and they have like little cute little offices for rent for 400 bucks a month. I might. Yeah, I might get one, at least one. Because what I think is cool about that is focus time. It's like I can drop Merlin off a doggy daycare, then I go, okay, I'm going to get like four hours consistent time. My mornings are the best, right? So I'm going to get four hours because it's been done. Then when I come home, whatever I want to work from home, I have more, you know, flexible schedule. But anyways, I'm just a total side note while I was going home. I'm going to invite you to this board, going to make a board just for YouTube profits for our owners and I'm going to be showing up on the other one
