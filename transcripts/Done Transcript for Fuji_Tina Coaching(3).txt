00:00:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Good morning.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:07 - Michael Fujinaka
How are you? It really well.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's your sleep?
00:00:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I'm just putting that up here. Could have been better in the last couple of days, but. Yeah. Well, can I show you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
please. All right.
00:00:23 - Michael Fujinaka
You look exactly like your picture.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's good. I guess. No, I'm not. I haven't probably haven't done video. I feel really loud today. I don't know. It's just equity in my room. Oh, that's good. Actually, also, I was just thinking I would really like this to be a. Could you send these to me Sunday night so that Monday I have them? Because that's going to be an accountability test. Yeah. So you get one time to fail and then we install consequences. I understood.
00:01:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Are you able to see my screen right now?
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes I am. So I'm looking at the dates on the ora ringer at the top. I see. Yeah, and you sent those to me. So deep sleep. I'd be very interested to see, I know you broke your Apple Watch, but if you end up replacing it, I'd be very interested to compare the data. None of them are perfectly reliable. I feel like if you really want to dial into this and I'm a data person, so figuring out the way that you like to see the data, the way that it makes the most sense to you. don't like this layout. I'll Also, so the SleepWatch app that I use for Apple calls it restful sleep versus, well, so that light sleep, deep sleep is a little bit different. But I'd be interested to see how it compares. like I use sleep cycle and sleep watched. And then there's also Apple Health data and they all report differently even though they're using the same mechanism to record data to report the data differently. So there are algorithms for how they calculate the data is obviously different. So I like to look at the multiple data points and say, okay, which one makes the most sense in the correlation to how I feel and what my experience is that day. I still tend to look at all of them anyway, because I'm not and I think that you'd be okay with this too. Like my fiance, he can't look at this stuff because he'll get anxiety over it and he'll just obsess about it. And there are people who just like, they look at that and they forgot about it. I don't. I look at it and go it's information and it's probably not fully accurate and how I feel is probably a better indicator. But anyway, if you're really going to dial this in, I would recommend whatever data points you're willing to acquire apps, Apple Watch versus ordering that type of thing. And then let's have about a month, but also hear about the whole new thing into the mix with the baby. That'll be interesting to watch what happened. how is Esther, by the way, that I meant to be like, that's the first thing I want to know.
00:03:55 - Michael Fujinaka
What's she doing? She unfortunately got COVID two days on Friday. So I was. I had not had to. We shifted what we were doing so I watched Emi the last couple of days and then Emi got COVID yesterday. So we actually might tomorrow. They're actually telling us not to come to the hospital tomorrow. we might actually just push the due date back to 40 weeks instead of 39.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So it's Her mom's here now helping us. She also has COVID now.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm kind of holed up in this room today where I'll be working. How does your family do with it? Like it's not the same for everyone. For me, it was devastating, but for other people, we haven't touched them.
00:04:43 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, yeah. mean, it's, it's kind of business as usual. It's COVID. just not that it's not that potent for us right now.
00:04:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was last time.
00:04:52 - Michael Fujinaka
So yeah, like my wife and her mom, they all cook. I mean, Emi is running around and laughing, even though she's not. So yeah, it's business as usual, except I just need more careful. At first, I wasn't careful because I was like, well, I'm not going to get it anyways. But I'm not going to have got it yet. So now we're like, well, we don't want to start your timer right now. Like if I get it, then I get it for 10 days, I think that. So now we're like, okay, well, maybe I should be careful now too. So we'll see, I still might get it.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to test this morning, actually. Yeah, business as usual sort of. Well, that's good. It was I have, as I've been hospitalized, I told you, I think hospitalized with it four times for seven to 10 days, and my oxygen was max levels and I have narrow airways, my right lungs almost like so COVID was a big deal for me. And then it totally messed up my digestive system. But it's so interesting how it's different for everyone. But anyway, learned a lot of healing over that too. Okay, so sleep stuff. Oh, We're not sharing screen anymore. I'm like, what happened? I can't see it anymore. It's good. So Sunday nights just email me send those images and your journal, I would really like to see. So I'm just doing it in like a written format. Well, you can take a picture of it if you want to, or you can use an app like whatever works. But for if we're going to even talk about this, then I want to really talk about it because otherwise it makes no sense. And so food, exercise, sunshine, sleep, mood, and anything that you might have done differently in the day that would impact that you noticed. And how you feel about the sleep, your energy that day. Let's do scale of one to 10 on productivity mood. Um, me highlight this too. So I give it note. Productivity, mood, energy, and kind of notice when you start to fade out a little bit throughout the day, let's check that. And if we watched that for a few weeks, again, wild card with the baby, like this is a whole different thing. But you still should learn some of the patterns of your body and what things make the biggest impact and what things, you know, really aren't. And then, then you'll have, you'll be aware of your own levers. So if, for example, some days, there's a lot that I need to get done. my, and I'm sleepy, I'm not well functioning, and it might be eight o'clock at night, and I might use caffeine, because I'm in the middle of deep brainwork. my cognitive function will improve with that. But my sleep will be so sacrificed. But if if the priority for that day, and I have the lead way the next day to be able to take a nap or something like that, in order to, because also I'm a finisher, so I need to complete something. Otherwise, I won't go to sleep, that those loops will be open to my brain, and I won't be able to rest and relax anyway. So since I know my sleep is already going to be disrupted, I'm just going to power through. But the next day, I will get almost nothing done brain level wise. I may be able to get some things done physically. So then I'll do some housework. That might be when I spend a little bit more time just sitting outside relaxing, because I'm soaking in the sunshine, because that's still productive. My body needs it. It's good for my hormones, all of those types of things. So every day isn't the same. But every day is planned and leveraged according to what I know about how my body operates. My brain operates. according to the things that I want to accomplish at that
00:09:00 - Michael Fujinaka
makes sense. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Like on July, what was it that night that I got 17 minutes of deep sleep? I guess it was July to 3rd when I woke up. Yeah, I got it was awful that day. I was like in a haze in a days and you know, there's a couple of times in the night, Emmy woke up twice screaming in the night. So I got up at I think one and then I got up again at 4.30. And yeah, it just destroyed me on Wednesday. And then Wednesday night, tried to get to sleep. But you know, I could see that I got it. I started my sleep routine at 9.30. I remember you said your sleep routine takes about an hour. Yeah, it does take me about an hour to wind down. I take a shower, put on my lotion or whatever, brush my teeth, write my journal. And by the time I actually lay down, it's about, yeah, it is about 10.30.
00:09:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's about 90 minutes, actually. 60 to 90 minutes. 60 if I'm exhausted. 90 at the least, otherwise, sometimes it's two hours, but if we're talking about the whole sleep hygiene thing, the like washing base, brushing teeth, I pray and kind of meditate, saying good night to the girls, closing up the house, like to me that's a whole part of the winding down. And then I'm so, but that's not part of the 90 minutes. Once I get in bed, that's the 60 to 90 minutes. So like the brushing the teeth, all that stuff, I'm talking about just being in bed. That's usually the 60 to 90 minutes, 90 on a bad day, 60 on a good day. And there I'm listening to something or reading or I have a mindless kind of game that I play because it's like I still have energy in my body, so I'm not ready to just and but because it's mindless, I don't have to, I'm not using my my brain to solve things. Um, yeah, anyway, so So that whole thing and I discovered that just going through lots of different things. can't read books if I read a book I want to know what's next. I have to finish it. I have to complete it. I can't put things down. I can I don't like to It's not relaxing to me. So I can't do that, but I can listen to scriptures because I've read them so many times. already know how they end anyway, but it's also It's the narrator. There's all these different things that I've learned About how my brain responds interacts engages or doesn't can't listen to music cuz wants to follow the pattern All of these things and I'm paying attention to everything that comes into it. So anyway, just learning that type of stuff And and that's why I really want you to notice like in the journal the next day. So what was your routine life? What? that you do before you went to bed. But what you'll find is that it's really difficult to, you can't create the same thing every single day, especially as a parent. And so knowing what the levers are and mostly just getting up in the day, recognizing how you feel, taking into account the things that you have to do that day. But I also like to take stock of what has to happen throughout the week. What we can talk about time blocking as soon as we start to get into this business stuff, which I'd like to talk about today. But it's kind of evaluating the, I'll call them big rocks. I don't know if you've ever heard of Stephen Covey. Stephen Covey, a Franklin Covey who does the organizers and the day planners and things like that.
00:12:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I think I have, yeah. Evan habits of highly affected people.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, I know that. Yeah. So he has done this great presentation, and you might have seen it because lots of people. We'll have done it, but it's you have a jar and next to the jar are sand and rocks, pebbles and bigger rocks and water. And he says, can you fit all of this into the jar? And people try to do it and it doesn't work, it won't all fit. But then he starts with a fresh jar and he puts in the big rocks first and then he puts in the smaller rocks and then he puts in the sand and then he puts in the water and everything fits in the jar. And so he said the only way that you can get everything in is by starting with the big rocks first. So that's where terminology and a lot of business stuff has come up with big rocks and it's what matters most is what you start with because even at the end of the day, let's say some of the stuff doesn't get into the jar, you got what matters most. So you kind of decide through a series of priorities, principles, values, and whatnot. of evaluating what it is that you're doing. So what are the big rocks for each business? What are the big rocks for you as a person? What are the big rocks for you as a father? And we do have some homework to come back to you with the family values.
00:14:15 - Michael Fujinaka
Hopefully you did that. I did not.
00:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, where's my notebook? Boogie. Didn't get his homework done. What kind of consequences should we have for not doing homework that you're paying for to get these results?
00:14:33 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know. What you suggest?
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's painful? And what can I hold you to? That's the thing. I have to be able to hold you to it.
00:14:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I know. have no idea. I have been doing the cool showers in the morning. That's very painful.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but that's not thing like if you're already choosing to do it It's the accountability part you need work with and so the the Consequence has to be something Inforceable ish like that the one client. He's like the only way I'm gonna do it is if you charge me money He's like a Jewish. I hate paying money Okay, so But he was the only one that was really bad at accountability. I don't really have to do it for other people But this is your thing so we've got to come up with an accountability structure for not doing that and Especially because that is a foundational element of the work that we're gonna do I need to know what the containers are Or your time and for your values throughout the week so that we can create the system But if you haven't defined it and you haven't taken the time to do that then we don't have the foundational pieces are worth it makes a lot of sense but I did tell you that last week and you still didn't do it you're right you're right all right yeah let's let's do something about that yeah that's painful to you that's what it's funny losing money is painful let's do it how painful you got you have to decide I have to decide no idea it has to be painful to you but well I know my massage is cost $90 actually yeah $90 so I think if I lose $90 I could get another nice massage that's good because now it's not you know it's not excessive but it's you can relate that to something else yeah but we're gonna do that for everything that you don't do every time you don't do it I'm gonna send you an invoice at the end of it and expect you to pay it and just, but don't do that anymore. I mean, I'll take your money if you want me to, but I'd rather you do the work because then you get the results.
00:17:12 - Michael Fujinaka
I would too, got it, I agree.
00:17:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so you owe me family homework. I'm gonna go ahead and send you an email after this as a reminder. So family goals, time. What does the day look like? And the week in terms of like, what should your weekend look like? How available are you? That type of thing. I'll go ahead and write it out a little more clearly. And I imagine Esther's gonna get you out of this by probably answering most of it for you, but that's okay, that's delegation as long as the job gets done and you agree with it. It has to be that you agree with it with then you're not, there's going to be resistance, right? So we're not going to lie to ourselves and say, yeah, this is it. And we're not going to play games and we're not going to say anything that's not true. Got it. Okay. So that and food, time, energy, mood, journal, every Sunday by 9 p.m. because I don't want you up at 8 p.m. Let's say that. I don't want you up later because of it to cram it and get it done. So it's not in my inbox by 8 p.m. on Sunday, you're late. So because I don't, I don't want you staying up late to do it to avoid consequences. Everything about what we do together is going to be engineered. to improve and help you stay within the things that you've you said are important to you.
00:19:06 - Michael Fujinaka
So I did read the book or I'm listening to the book switch and that concept is in that book where it says you have to shape the path and make it easy for the elephant to go down the path. So yeah, if I didn't even pay attention to that part, I didn't realize that was in the book. Yeah, interesting, like this is a path, right? It's like you're making me do it at 8 p.m. so that I'm not tempted to stay up late to finish my homework, which I know I'll do. And so that will force me to start the homework earlier to get it done by hate.
00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I want you to pay attention to too, in terms of like people that you work with and whatever, this is our third conversation. I already knew I had to do that with you.
00:19:55 - Michael Fujinaka
Because I'm paying attention to you.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it. So that's important. If you're going to work with that is helping you with anything. They got to be paying attention to you. Last week you were saying it was new somebody listening to you and and working on like what matters to you and what's So I want you to continue to see the evidence of what that is rather than you just telling you, hey, Fuji, we're going to talk about you and it's going to be about you, but really it's not about you.
00:20:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So I didn't see my notes on this and I thought you were going to forget about the family goals. So yeah, no, it's good.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not here to forget. I'm not paid to forget. I'm here to get results and I'm competitive. So I plan on doing a good job for you. That's what I do. I love it. Okay, so actually, where's my notes?
00:21:00 - Michael Fujinaka
Can I think of how the rock and the sand and the pebble thing fits what it said in switch was that you know that someone had like a bunch of loans that to pay off and it was interesting switch was advocating that you start with the small goals that you could beat out quickly. But I guess in that is just one example that maybe like to fit it in the same scheme as you know if you have a big rock that you need to fit in you still need to figure out how to like you know like you can't just tackle the big rock I mean you can but go after the big rock in a way that gives you small victories so that that kind of makes sense to me is that you know getting early small victories will get the buy-in to keep going.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and this is why I talk about levers and leverage because what works for you one day may not work for you another day because of your energy so going back. to the finite willpower also and the fact that you've got to battle your brain for some things. So let's say you've got a big rock but you can't get yourself to do it. So one of the things I do and I'm working on creating a course for it because I want to teach this to more people but I only have I take very few one-on-one clients but it's a time evaluator and of all the things that I've had people do and we will do this it has been the most kind of eye-opening pivotal exercise that we have and it's a simple spreadsheet and we track everything that you do for a couple weeks. Really it works ideally if we do it for a few weeks because there's so much variety in the tasks generally for especially for CEOs entrepreneurs because we're all over the place. So what we do is track everything that's being done throughout your day, period, personal, whatever, obviously within reason, we don't need our personal personal personal stuff. But then you, you categorize things according to profitability, to skill level, like is it something you're really good at? Something you really bad out, bad out, where's the spectrum? Energizing versus draining, necessary versus, so how much time do we spend doing things that are neither profitable nor necessary? We find those things that go, do you, out of your 24 hours in a day, effectively maybe 13, 14 hours a day, is that really where you want to spend it? And, right, but also, as you start to look at it, what has been, Just really kind of eye-opening for people is how little time they spend on the most profitable activities Um, and then the other thing is finding out what are the things that are necessary? Are semi-profitable, but they're foundational Meaning that they have to happen in order for the profitable activities to happen and that could be bookkeeping things like that So in those things that are draining um not First position profitable, but secondary profitable or necessary in some way um There's two things that we'll do so when possible we delegate And so hire an expert always an expert because if it's not an autonomous expert In that seat taking care of that thing for you you still have to put mental energy on it Managing them. Did you do it right? Whatever so we don't be cheap when it comes to delegation We get leaders as much as as possible, balancing out how much it costs, obviously, but trying to, I'm always managing energy most with zero energy. I could have all the money in the world. If I don't have any energy, what am I going to do with it? I can't enjoy it. I can't leverage it. I can't figure out how to manage it because I'm too tired. So we always manage energy first, which is why I love that sleep was your primary goal and focus that you wanted it to work on. So anyway, but if there are things that are profitable and necessary and you currently don't have anybody that you could delegate it to, but it's either you're not great at it or it's draining. So the stuff that has to get done that sucks. We'll just call it that way, right? So energy silences. I call them energy silences when you sandwich something that you, that is energizing and good and it doesn't have to be business it doesn't have to be a rock it could be breakfast it could be a walk it could be cuddles it could be anything that puts energy into you then you do the thing that sucks and you've already planned what you're doing afterwards and you've planned a cut-off time so the cut-off time could be either a very specific time or a easily predictable ending point meaning like in an hour roughly i should be done with this particular part of it right so let's say you are like me and you need to close the loop you're not going to cut off when there's a few more minutes left of it you're going to you just want to complete it so if you can tell that there is a you know an ending point choose that and then when you're done you're done and you immediately go to the good energy thing but mentally you already know you're looking forward to that you already know there's something good that's coming right after this you and it resets your energy, resets your mood and that actually so of the energy sandwiches you you want these especially when this thing sucks but is really necessary you really want these to be potent whatever they are and almost always I want the ending part of the sandwich to be a physical activity because the stress that goes into your body when you're doing that difficult thing you want to release that you want to literally work it out of you so walk, gym, exercise, something but you want to be moving as much as possible so I'll show you what that looks like and we will do that but not right now let's see okay let me go oh I did that's what I was pulling up all right you ready to start talking about the business stuff
00:28:01 - Michael Fujinaka
I'm already, uh, I'm already behind on the sleep and everything. just, uh, pack it on and just nervous about what we're going to do. Let's do it.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. We're digging in. Yeah. Um, okay. So I'm looking at, I'm ranking things based on the hours that you said that you work eight to 11 days per month, Q and E. Yeah. And how many hours in those eight to 11 days per month? Uh, a week. I mean, a day roughly.
00:28:41 - Michael Fujinaka
pretty much in general, we try to craft those days to fill up clients. So I usually depart at about 730, like I'm leaving the house at 730. I drive maybe an hour. Try taking Uber now because I'm And then I, yeah, it's pretty much all day that I'm working. May I show you a calendar?
00:29:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anything you want to share, the more information I have, the better.
00:29:17 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay. So, let's see if I can pull this up here. Screen number one. So this is how, let me July, July and August are messed up because of the baby, but essentially if you could see right here where it says the 22nd of July. It's my next big day of work.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:53 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. That's the one where we're meeting at five. Yeah. So I start. So my office this time is in daily city. So I have 10. and offices around northern California that I drive to this one's in daily city about 30 minutes. So I'll probably leave in the uber. I have to get there 30 minutes before my start time so I have to get there at 7.45 so on this day I'm going to leave it 7.15 from my uber. And then you see I have appointments every 45 minutes 8.15, 9.9.45, 10.30, 11.15. I think I said go a few lunch here so 12, 12.30, 1.15 and then I finished it too roughly for that day. And then the next the following day I started 9 in San Leandro which is also about this one's about 45 minutes away. I at 9. have to get 30.30 so I leave at about 7.45 and uber and I have appointments every 45 minutes until 5 o'clock taking uber home takes an hour to get home from San Leandro at night time so I'll get home about 6 that day. You get the idea, sort of. Yeah, then on Wednesday, it's the same thing, but my office is in San Jose, which is about 30 minutes away. this one finishes at 2 PM, and then 25th, I don't have any work. The next week I work on Wednesday and Thursday, the following week in August, I work on the 6th and the 7th, following week after that on the 13th, following week after that, I work three days. So that's kind of my schedule. It's all over the place, but eight to 11 days a month, generally.
00:31:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how do you feel on those days?
00:31:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I love it. really good at it. I'm really good at this kind of work, and so I do enjoy going. It's like my time to do something I'm really good at. And I know what to do, right? It's easy now. It's easy. I'm good at it. I think that's why I like it, right? I know I could do it and it makes me a lot of money. Every appointment that you see is essentially $2,000 with profit for me. So it's easy to get myself out of bed to do, you know, five, six, sometimes 10 visits a day.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is, I was, I was nervous about that, but I love that you love it. You know that there's not a lot of people that really love what they do. I love it. I love things. You said it.
00:32:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I like it a lot because I'm just good at it and it's easy now. know what's coming. It's fun to kind of like figure out how to make it work for these medical cases. And yeah, it pays me a lot of money. It's like it hits all the boxes. So I don't know if like I love it. I would. Choose to do this, but it's if I have to work. It's definitely work. I love or I like a lot You wouldn't choose that. No, I mean, I'd rather sit on the beach thing go surfing like I did on Wednesday You know, they're like boogie boarding on the beach. That's what I do. I'd spearfish for food, you know But but if I had to do something that made money or like I had to do some that work This is like the biggest bang for my calorie like It's just I got it.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay Good. It's all and it's not When you see like well, you generally won't see my face probably I try to do it from time to time to connect, you know and But but when you hear it and you hear me cuz because you'll be able to recognize what I'm like wait, what? I want to understand if there's a Conflicting kind of state payments or values like, all right, because if you say you love it, but you wouldn't choose to do it, then, but you, you in the realm of I've got to work, I've got to earn money. If I have to, then this really, and the fact that you said, so being really good at it, it being highly profitable. And then also, when you said you like to figure out how to make it work for people, so puzzles, you know, they kind of light up an intelligent mind and that it's kind of some gamification for you to be able to participate and engage in. And to me, that speaks to the longevity of it, being able to, as long as there is, because I don't know, especially because you enjoy the, I don't know, spearfishing is like relaxing, but that's also
00:35:00 - Michael Fujinaka
a game to like. Oh, I just do that out there. don't know. I would go surfing every day or jujitsu every day.
00:35:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
jujitsu too is a wrestle though. So that that um and jujitsu is like you're engaging every muscle in your body. So that's my love.
00:35:20 - Michael Fujinaka
That is my love. If I had to say something I would do every day at 12 which my colleagues do sometimes that is what I would do every day. jujitsu for an hour.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you do it?
00:35:35 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, once a week on Sunday afternoon. So they have a free it's called open mat. It's for people like me that don't pay membership. It's called open mat. So anyone that is busy can't go can go from 10 to 12 a.m. on Sundays. I missed it this week because everyone had COVID yesterday. But yeah, usually I could do that and then I've been trying to make an effort to go Fridays from noon to one. another open mat for people that are busy, but they have a class every day at 12 to 1 and I've been I've been thinking about like figuring out if I could make that work from my schedule to go like you know Monday through Thursday or something or even just Monday Wednesday Friday. But yeah, that'd be great. But all right, you know, you know, schedule is just so so varied when I have to do the Q and E days that it's just sometimes just I haven't wanted to get a membership because yeah, I don't know.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there only one dojo in your area?
00:36:36 - Michael Fujinaka
No, there's there's a couple.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is where principles and priorities values come into play and where sometimes we make decisions based on values that aren't actually the ones that we really have in that service best. but they're the ones that are most apparent. So not spending money you're not using. Whereas the other way to look at it would be investing in access, maximum level access. So if I was making a million dollars or whatever, like let's just say I'm making so much money that I never have to worry about it, everything's paid and my wealth is growing. Okay. True. And I'm not in a situation where I have zero time in order to do that. I have wiggle in everything. I do.
00:37:41 - Michael Fujinaka
Right?
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And I know that joy is an energy maximizer and I know that physical fitness is a life, money, joy, and longevity maximizer. Agree. Okay. I'm going to give myself and use my resources to have as much access to pause. I'm going to be a member of every JoJo.
00:38:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I see. Yeah, I was wait. Yeah, I just can't. It's hard to like wrap my head around spending 180. The membership of this gym, I love the gym because I know all the people, but it's like, it's $180 a month. And it's, they don't have any packages. It's just like you either use it or you lose it. So like every time I can't go because they have evening classes too from six to eight, but I've said like, that's family time for me. So I'm like, oh, but if I can only go eight possible Monday through Fridays a month.
00:38:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you pay $120 to go play for an hour at the place that you love the most?
00:38:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know if I'd be $120 an hour.
00:38:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the place that you love the most to play on the best playground. Or do the thing that you love 100 you pay $90 per massage.
00:39:04 - Michael Fujinaka
I love massage. Yeah, I love you just do That could be $90. I got a package.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:39:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I love to just do I also don't like paying it because in the classes, I don't like how they're run How do you do fighting for 12 like I just this like they spent half their time doing like cardio Which is like jumping jacks and I'm like, okay for 30 minutes I can do at home the last 15 minutes is they teach a move and then the last 15 minutes is what I love is the rolling Like, you know getting actually like wrestle with you. Yeah, so it's only like 15 minutes of that whole hour of these spend So that's another reason like I can't wrap my head around spending 100 whatever $180 for that 15 minutes of that kind of play.
00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would I pay for it for two hours? Yeah, an hour, yeah Well, so but here's the thing if you're going twice a week Yeah, that's 30 minutes. True times 4.5 in the month, right? So that's two and a half hours. You just said, if I got two hours, I'd pay $180.
00:40:07 - Michael Fujinaka
Well, okay, that's interesting.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's less than a dollar a minute, by the way.
00:40:16 - Michael Fujinaka
You're right. My wife says it's, I told her this too, and she's like, just sign up. What are you waiting for? I'm like, oh, gosh, this is so frustrating. don't wrestle the entire class.
00:40:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to rush. But what if, what if you became an investor and instead of paying for a class, you say, I'll give you $1,000 a month, but I would like you to create this one class. And it's just rolling. It's just my favorite thing. And I'll come to it and they put your little card out there.
00:40:44 - Michael Fujinaka
Interesting.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, this is the thing when you have resources and you look for levers everywhere. if one doesn't exist, you make one. That's one of the great gifts about money. Like, you, you're like, I want to make sure I can give my family and do all of these things. But it's also power and you can do good things with it. So now they're getting extra money from you. But what are the odds that you're the only one that wants that?
00:41:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that's true.
00:41:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're just managing the way that they choose to. Maybe the way that they think is right. But maybe they don't know on a business level. They're missing out because other people feel the way you do.
00:41:24 - Michael Fujinaka
I love that. That's actually really creative. One of the coaches there is willing to stay a little longer because I'm drilled with them. There's two things I like is drilling, which is practicing the moves. my whole Jiu Jitsu game, I'm really good at probably maybe 10 things. Out of all the different thousands of moves, I'm good at 10 of them. And I drill them more than anyone else. I practice practice practice. And that's what I like. So my idea would be I'd do 30 minutes of that. maybe I work on an 11th move, for instance, and I just do that for 30 minutes, and in the last 30 minutes, we fight, or we wrestle. So yeah, that's a really good idea. Maybe I could propose that to the schools, like, hey, I will fund an extra 30 minutes at the end of class, that way I get 15 minutes in the class that is the wrestling, and then 30 minutes of my, you know, the drilling. And then I'll pay for that coach to stay there. You know, that's actually really creating there. I know they get paid 25 an hour.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not, it's actually cheaper than the members. Yes, yes, but also think about this long term. You're very young. You know you're gonna continue to make more money. You're going to need to have investments to protect your money, or the government's just gonna take a huge chunk of it. What if you bought your own dojo, and you hired your own sentes, and you get to make the rules? there's so many different ways. maybe it's not the now thing, but if you loved Jujitsu that much, you could create programs. youth programs, other training programs, and again it doesn't have to be an altruistic thing, it could be just an investment in your network. The more people that you know and that know you and see you as just a community leader, whatever, the more business you get, and I don't know if what you do makes that relative or not, but there's all kinds of angles to always consider, but at the end of the how I'm going to get what I want. I'm going to use every resource available to get what I want, because when I'm happiest, the people that I take care of are best served. I think everybody's like that. All of us have gifts to give, and even if we take any kind of altruism out of it, we're just happier and better and more productive when we get the things that we want. Jujut. too is like tell me something that there's that's bad about it. There's nothing bad about it. There might be some risk of injury involved, but there's risk in life. You could choke on a fly breathing in like anything could happen, you know what I mean? So, but if that's, man, all right, we're gonna spend the rest of the time going over this, but actually this is useful though because I did get to your schedule and so this is important.
00:44:28 - Michael Fujinaka
was realize the times of my life when I there was a time of my life for about two years where I would go to that the 12 one o'clock class probably probably three times a week and I know that when I do jujitsu like on Sundays usually or some of the Fridays I mean I I'm just everything's better right my mood's better and I'm not as snappy I I yeah because you got that cortisol out yeah yeah I'm willing to. Yeah, I'm willing to work and You probably sleep better. Oh, yeah, I definitely sleep better. think so. I know I know more you did too Yeah, and it is crazy that I don't use the resources to to get access I've never thought about thinking of it like that But yeah, if I pay or use my resources for access Yeah, I just I hate I hate the value of it Even if I'm paying for it, want there to be good value in it But yeah, there might be creative ways I could work with that.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is you just flipped the value You were looking at what you weren't getting instead of what you were getting and you weren't looking at How you multiply what you get so you just said that when you do it you're in better mood You're more energized you sleep better. All of those are already values that you stated. Those are currencies so If you're looking at the only currency exchange as I give money I get 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, right? Then that's an upside-down equation. Well, we all have to learn how to evaluate more powerfully. That's where the leverage is. So, but if the currency exchange is, you're giving $180 and 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, plus hours of happiness, plus an entire night's better sleep, plus all the activity that comes as a result of the better sleep, a better mood, AKA, happier Esther, happier Emmy, happier new baby.
00:46:43 - Michael Fujinaka
That currency is, your ROI is pretty solid there, Fuji. Okay, for 180 bucks, yeah.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:51 - Michael Fujinaka
I actually went through the trouble of asking the coach if I could buy a package, you know, like a package deal where I put, you know, $100 and I get a package. you know five lessons or something and they were like now we don't we don't have that it's 180 dollars or nothing so I I did try little things to weasel but yeah I think if I shifted what I'm getting the ROI like as an investment oh this is great thanks Tia this is great welcome I'm here I'm here to help um and I this is why I end up keeping people for years and I like to do it because I'm going to look for ways to be helpful to you and if I feel like I'm slowing down and not being so helpful I'm gonna go be like okay what does Fujini now go work on it I feel really I feel really good like hopeful right now I think yeah I am gonna make an effort to to get back into this because it is something I whenever I talk to people it's something that I love is jujitsu and wrestling and yeah girls too to put them in there oh yeah yeah that's yeah Emmy I've I've been taking every Monday Wednesday ice. I actually shifted, if you notice my schedule, I actually shifted my Monday and Wednesdays. The reason I finished at two is because I can come home, takes an hour to get home. At three o'clock I pick up Emmy and then I get her to Jiu Jitsu by 3.30, class starts at four. So I'm making an effort to essentially coach Monday and Wednesday toddler class Jiu Jitsu for.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, I love that.
00:48:27 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I don't get to do it, right? I'm just there moving the little three-year-olds around. But yeah, as long as I'm able to do that with my schedule, actually, we revamped my whole schedule to make it so that Monday and Wednesdays I'm pretty much free every week from three to four.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and this comes back to the family values and container, because you just said as long as I'm able to. With your situation and the leveraged activities that you have, there's no reason you shouldn't ever be able to if you. prioritize that. You have the ability to keep everything in proper containers so that you're maximizing your revenue without spilling into the family value container. And that's why we need to set them. So when you give me that, that time with Emmy and Jiu Jitsu needs to be there. I need you to think about everything that is important in your schedule that you have probably just done not unconsciously but without making a conscious correlation to a value. Like this is what I do, not this is what I do because this is critical and important to me and I want to make sure to protect this. Because I think that there are things that you do that with but you just haven't consciously said. and stated this is the value and the reason why I'm doing this and and that okay so it's 11 days let's see and that was QME July medical so what is the thing that you do with Mark?
00:50:21 - Michael Fujinaka
That's July medical it was what I started with mark was a different business that I had a really poor business relationship and I exited that in 2022 so July medical is something I started in 2023 and it's the same business that I used to do except now it's 100% telehealth. Okay I see so when Mark's clients get into car collisions usually their doctors you know about this but you know their insurance their own doctors won't see them because car collisions are like another litigation. There's legal, so their doctors don't see them so my clinic or clinics like mine will step into seed patients on a contingency or lean and that means I don't get paid for a year two to three years but I see them for free on a contingency and now my clinic july is 100% virtual and so that's what I work with mark on.
00:51:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay um do you only do that with mark like is he your only person that you do that with?
00:51:31 - Michael Fujinaka
No I probably have about six to ten law firms that utilize my clinic and each of those law firms will send me roughly I don't know 10 to 20 clients a month and my expected return on each of those clients is about three to four hundred dollars each client but I but I have to wait right the payout is right right never or two to three years in advance so yeah mark was saying his average settlement is like 18 months yep
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but you don't get any other clients other than what attorneys send you in that business, is that correct? I don't allow it.
00:52:10 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't let people come to my clinic unless they're represented by an attorney because they just, they're going to fail. Like if you fight against the insurance company without an attorney, most people fail and I get zero.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And that's one full day per week.
00:52:33 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I mean, I think I have to spend about eight hours, maybe doing it. And that's the stuff that we talked about earlier in this called the bookkeeping, you know, making, watching over my staff checking notes. Every single note that comes through. So we're doing about like 15 visits a day. I look through every one of those notes every day to make sure my nurses that work for me are writing good notes. So I think all in all, it probably is about eight hours a week, roughly.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not all in one day, just kind of spread out, or how does that work?
00:53:09 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, every night, I take about 30 minutes to go through all the nurses' notes. you use just about 10 to 15 notes. And so I read through them all, make sure they're accurate, and then I approve them to be sent to the lawyers. So that takes about maybe 30 minutes. then the other, maybe I'll take like a block because I really don't like to do it. So every Friday or Saturday, I'll do it. I take about an hour, two hours to look through my books. I look through, I make sure that the staff is getting paid, kind of more like the administrative stuff. I will answer any hateful, even I hateful, but like emails that people are, like patients are unhappy about what something we wrote. So I kind of leave all that to the end of the week, and then I do it in a block of time. It's about two hours, an hour, two hours.
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you ever resist that task or does it bother you or you just do it?
00:54:10 - Michael Fujinaka
The 30 minutes every evening, I do it because it's, I mean, I know how much I'm going to make. Each visits 300 bucks and 10 visits, that's about $3,000 to $5,000, So I don't mind doing that at all. thing I resist is probably going through the problems, the problem emails that I have. And I have a manager that actually screens it. So that's been helping a lot the last couple of months. It's just things that need my attention, just very weird things that come up. one of them needed, couldn't do an MRI because they had a gunshot to their shoulder. So I needed to change the note to make it a CT, a CAT scan or an x-ray instead of a magnetic, you know, MRI. it's like little things like that that come up that my manager can't fix.
00:54:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I have to take care of every week. So, um, one thing to potentially consider is maybe that's an activity that you can move in or schedule to be something that you do right before Jiu Jitsu or something physical where you can go release that stress very quickly, or somehow consider the energy sandwich and but create a physical release for after that. So, obviously, not late at night, also that's probably not conducive to your sleep.
00:55:33 - Michael Fujinaka
That's a good point.
00:55:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I usually do it in the evening. Yeah. um, I don't allow stressful conversations whenever possible. Sometimes things have to be had past like dinner time. We'll discuss it tomorrow. Oh, interesting. will discuss it tomorrow because because number one, the open moves in my brain. So, likelihood that we're going to solve that tonight. Yeah. With the amount of time left in the day with the fact that everybody's winding down, whatever, probably not very good, but it is going to live in my brain. And I'm going to try to solve it where I can't actually be working on it because it requires somebody else to participate in a conversation in a process whatever, right, because they're the one that brought the problem. So, but if I say we will discuss it tomorrow, I didn't ask any questions, I didn't engage in it, so I'm able to compartmentalize most things. Some things are, all right, we're dealing with this now. This needs to be resolved right now. You'll know what those types of things are.
00:56:35 - Michael Fujinaka
They're not very common, but some of those things come up.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Especially as daughters, you're going to get those. But whenever possible, I would just say that problem will wait until tomorrow when I'm in that kind of zone. So, in the morning, I don't want to engage with anybody. don't do client work. I don't answer emails. I don't respond to anything that could be, um, conflicting or contentious and they're not the same conflicting could just be I don't even know I have to make a decision and I have to evaluate things so it's complex I'll say complex nothing complex in the morning because now I'm in problem solving mode. But in the morning I want to be in creative mode. So, because I want to use my best mathematical skills for creation and building and leveraging rather than problem solving because solving a problem honestly I could do that stuff in my sleep. But being creative is not a space that I'm in all the time. My brain is good enough I can solve most problems most of the time. Creating is different. building my business, creating new solutions, creating new organizations, hiring things like that so so my morning time is for. reading, meditating, just being slow and quiet sometimes just hair and makeup is a therapy thing for me. I'm just quiet. I'm not listening to anything. I'm just pondering and thinking while I'm doing it. And this has been really helpful for Mark too. He's doing meditative stuff now, but he used to talk Dolce. But in the morning, what he used to do is reach for his mom and immediately stress cortisol problem solving. His creativity, his problem solving in a creative way has massively changed since his morning routine has changed. Speaking of which, have to go meet with him in one minute. So we'll go through more of this schedule. But the goal is every week that you've got something that you feel like you can work on. something that you're pondering, something you're enacting, so we've got the gist of it. will send you a follow-up email within the next few hours. I'll say by end of day today, just because Mondays are kind of crazy and I gotta make sure where's my phone, set my alarm, set an alarm for 3 p.m. Call it get-go-g notes. And now you're official. Yeah, so good job. You'll be getting an invoice too for being 8 if you do it again. We'll give you, I don't want to give you a free pass. I'm gonna give you a free pass, but don't do this again. Get your homework done because, you know, massage or like, just imagine you won't pay $180 for just when you like it. You're definitely gonna hate that whole $90 for not getting your homework done. So I'm gonna give you one pass, one. All right. good talking to um you know if you guys do end up having the baby if everything i would love to hear about it we'll do be healthy be well and we'll talk to you soon
