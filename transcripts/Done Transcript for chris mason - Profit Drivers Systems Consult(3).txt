00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, I'm late. I had a call just went long, but it was people I haven't talked to for years, and I was like, I gotta go. gotta go. it was so good. They're old clients and they were they are marketing agency and their primary clients were yoga studios and then COVID happened. So that just changed their lives and they couldn't afford to work with me anymore. And so she's just like, for months, she's like, I gotta talk to Tina, gotta talk to Tina. And so and I finally got them back, but it's a moment and pop is a husband and wife team. I watched their kids grow up. anyway, you know how I feel about you guys.
00:00:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, totally.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my people. So that was fun. But I'm sorry I'm late.
00:00:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
don't mean to be disrespectful of your time. Oh, that's no problem.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How am I in good to get to reconnect? How have you been? you seem like you're doing great?
00:01:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm doing well. You know, just things are going well with Tim who's the the gym owner guy. I've got my first promotion that I'll put together for him. It's going to start next week. And so I'm just crossing all the eyes, that kind stuff and and we'll see how this this goes primarily going out to his Facebook group and then his email list or a segment of his email list about you know 2,500 people and I ran his email this is interesting because like he gets really good open rates like we'll get 48 50 percent people open. But the the are like 0.3 0.4 percent. to and it's like that on every email that that I send every email that he sends even he was giving away thing I was like he was he ran this big giveaway of this it's called an in body scanner that a lot of gyms use so that people can like figure out their body fat percentage and muscle percentage up in skeletal density all this stuff and he did a deal with in body to give one away for free Wow. And send it out to his list and you know point three point four percent fifty percent opened nobody's clicking and so like I've so anyway I've just never run into that so I think there's probably Either he's got some spam accounts in there that may be opened and I don't know what the deal is, but he's working with Adrian Savage on email and deliverability and segmenting getting like the most engaged, 30-day engaged list and that kind of stuff. like he's working with good people on the email front, it's just a bizarre thing. So what I'm doing on this is I'm sending really like one or two line emails and getting people to reply if they're interested in getting the details.
00:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start?
00:04:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right, it will start next week.
00:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I haven't haven't tried it yet. So have you checked his cinder score? Is no, I haven't checked his cinder score.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. What's his emailing domain?
00:04:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, it is. P.F., marketing solutions.com.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And make me log in on to like create an account. Let's go. When get emails, do they go to your inbox?
00:05:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And did it happen immediately?
00:05:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's good. And but also like, um, let's check this. Oh, let me call it one second way. And take this underscore.
00:05:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, hmm. Oh, wow. Awesome. Very high. Mailing from infusion soft. Yeah. Or score 98. There's only one that's 91. all the rest of them are 98. So like, is there a disconnect maybe? And who he's getting on his email list versus what's being emailed out?
00:06:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, he's right now the ads that are running to get people both into the group and into the Facebook group and on the email list. I wrote it while I wrote the ad. It's about it's for, like, it's specifically for gym owners. So it's got all the right targeting as far as the language that attracts people in. that ad is performing well. People are coming to the group, and then they have to answer, I think, two or questions about their gen to get in the group and all that. He's using, what's it called, it's that there's a service that connects your Facebook group questions and infusion soft, so people are opting in to the list when they join the group. Along with all their info, so I don't think it's attracting non-Gem owners, it could be the wrong type of gem owner, which admittedly I don't know what that is, like, what, how to. to find what the wrong gym owner is for him, but I have thought, like on the other side of his promotion for him, of doing, you know, running an ad that's a little, that would maybe pull in some somebody who runs a gym who's maybe little more advanced, like by, because he's got all these different tracking sheets that he uses internally at his gym in Arizona, and I thought maybe we could, you know, give away something that, something like, you know, your marketing math sheet is what he calls it, it's one of the things that he has in his program, maybe if we were to give something like that away, to test that that may speak to somebody who's at a maybe a little further along in their gym where somebody knew they don't I mean they probably have that problem but they're just trying to get you know business through the door. So I don't know I mean he's got a this the girl Amanda who is there like his CMO essentially and Adobson Amanda Dake yeah yeah D-A-K-E and she's great like I have a call with her every week and you know she's she I mean I think she's doing a a fine job advising him and I think she knows him from I don't know if they worked together or what, but she knows Tim from years ago through something else. don't know. haven't asked, but yeah, it's just an interesting thing with his email list, so that's something to work on, and he's got this, but I'm writing so much for him. I he's getting, like, I wrote this new letter for his program that we're using next week, but I mean, I'm excited. It's so much better than the letter he was using, and, I mean, we'll see, you never know, but I think the letter I wrote for him is just really good. the customers will determine if it's a right fit. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have you been working for him? what is he paying you?
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I started like in the middle of April, April 17th. Bill and five grand a month. It's for 30 days. I said a minimum of 90 days and then we'll reconnect and basically see if we want to keep working together, which I think if the promotion goes well, like if it gets, I mean, because he's selling this thing for $7,500. And it's, you know, book a call, that kind of thing. He's got his partner, Randy, handling the sales. It's really about a number of calls booked and people who get closed, and he really wants to follow this, I don't know if you're familiar with the clients and community guys, he wants to follow their model, so he bought their program and gets coaching for them. So I went through that they're training, and so we're running this promo following their guidelines because they lay it out, and it's fine, it makes a lot of sense, but it's basically in a similar to what Travis does with the tapping, so it's basically like all the posts are designed to get people to raise their hand. And he's got this appointment setter that follows up with them through DM to give them the details. I've written like three different scripts for her like DM scripts because they didn't them. But this will be the first time that we're selling, actually selling something. Everything else has just been so far like give value, give value. Which again is what the clients and community guys teach. So I don't know if let's say this promotion doesn't go well. I think we get five or six people to buy. It'll be considered a success and it'll probably want to keep working together. If it's not a success, I think he'll still want to keep working together. he may come back asking for a lower price and which I may be open to, but I would have to reduce the scope of what I'm doing for him now. Because I'm basically doing all of his copywriting. I mean, 95% of it. And all the Facebook posts, it's a couple emails a week. week I did an email every day to promote his event in the fall called the gross summit. And I ran a promotion for that. don't think anybody bought, I think it's a little early to be selling an event in September. But we didn't run a promotion in the group, it was just as email-less and we weren't talking about that. But I didn't want to run the promotion in the group because we got this bigger promotion coming up. that would have, even though the price point for the event is a lot lower, it's like $2.97 to attend. And I thought selling that in the group and then two weeks later selling this bigger ticket item, the sequencing just didn't make sense to do that. And we can run a... Pre-summit promotion later and summer closer to the date of the event. But I'm writing a couple of direct mail letters form as well. And I wasn't going to rewrite his sales letter for this program because I saw it and I was like, that's not a bad sales letter. But then I went through his program. And like I watched every single video at double speed and it's like, oh my gosh, there's so much more in here that is not even talked about. And so, so then I was like, all right, well, need a new letter. Sorry about that. And. Yes, I don't know what I guess I'll see one. He just paid his second bill, so his third one will be June 17th, so we'll do a check-in middle of July to see if he wants to keep working together, and I think he will. I mean, he's been really happy with what I write. He knows that the email list is doing what it's doing. But yeah, so that's the stuff that's going on with Tim. I paid off one of my credit card balances. I was a smaller one. was like $2,800, but I paid it off. That felt good, and then I'll pay off a second one in July, because I'm just setting money aside. That one will be like a little over six grand that I pay off. And, yeah, so just climbing out of the hole, things with Brian are going to well, we're going to do over-deliver boot camp in July and I am, you know, I'm really largely out of the the tech stuff, which is great. And we're kind of in a lull where you were at this time last year. What's that?
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a that's a big like where you're at right now in terms of the tech stuff, I think is like, I'm so different from where you were this time last year.
00:18:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great because like, you know, we've I got social media posts now running for. for Brian, that I have somebody else writing, she's from the Philippines, and she's doing a great job. then we've got this, we're taking all the, well, TXL calls, we're Jeremy Wise is turning them into podcasts. so now we're sending out weekly emails every Wednesday for just promoting a specific episode. that's largely hands-off for me because the the same writer doing social media is writing the emails for the podcast and Brian's editing them. And, well, she's writing them, but I built a write like Brian GPT. love it.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, have you been playing with four Oh, yes. Yeah. Crazy.
00:20:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Huh. I've just been talking to it. Yeah.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the ability to train it, how fast it gets like the copy that is spent after I had a few just like it gave me just so lame. And then I talked to it three more times. And then when it's been out, I was like, ah, that's unbelievable what it got to anyway. Okay. So you are Brian GPT.
00:20:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, Brian GPT. And it gets us about 80% there, which I was telling Brian is like, I think that's a huge help. Because he's a little down on it at first. But that's just, know, he's he's always down on things at first. And so I'm just like, you know, this is doing some heavy lifting and like you can just edit it. so now he's all on board. He likes it. And he gave some feedback, and we put that into the GPT as well, and once I explain that to him, it's like whatever you don't like, just tell me, and I'll go back and I'll add that as training to the GPT. But yeah, coming off the last break through advertising bootcamp, we're in a bit of a lull in Titan's world, just in terms of promotions, the next one coming up is over-deliver bootcamp in July. So, starting to plan and think that out. And yeah, I'm not working on anything really big for Brian right now, right? The second, and then the tea business is about to... to launch, so we've got John wrote the really great sales letter that's going to go in as an upsell behind his offer. I always keep forgetting the name of his offer for some reason. It's people signing up for an exercise nutrition program, and he has like 5,000 buyers coming through that every month through ClickBank. So we're going to put this tea offer as the upsell to that flow. And he's already spoken with one other big a click bank marketer who she she has something in the health and wellness. It's not fitness, but she's got something he was telling me and health and wellness and he was telling her about the the tea and she she wants to put the the upsell on her flow as well after we get it up and get some numbers. And then apparently John's got another click bank offer that that is like second second tier in the sense of like volume it's got it it's still got thousands of buyers but I don't think it's like 5,000 buyers maybe a couple thousand a month. And total coming through that offer and it's in the health and health and wellness space. And he wants to, once we get this up on the first upsell, he wants to put it in to that flow. But we've got the letter, and then I've got the inventory and where we just got, I had my designer put labels, design different labels for the packaging. So we're looking at those now. I wrote a conversion letter that will ride with when Pete, so our downsell is if somebody isn't with the 30-day supply of the tea, then we'll downsell them to a sample, like a free plus shipping offer. And so I wrote the letter and the order form that will ride with that sample. And then I'll also have a letter that goes to anybody who signs up. for the membership or just the third-day supply, but it would all be kind of built off of this letter that I wrote for the sample. And what I did for that was I took the letter that Lee and I wrote and I put it into chat GPT and I had it and then I told it a little bit about what we were doing and he and he and chat GPT um uh rewrote it and it's it's great. Like it did a really great job. I you know I got a few tweaks to it but yeah it's fantastic. And so I'm really excited to be re-re-launching this tea business and...
00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How amazing that you even feel that way about it though. just have to think about that. It's it's crazy. No, I'm serious. I have you.
00:26:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
to think about that. I know.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should just the the choices that you've made, Chris. I you can't see the whole you in here.
00:26:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm smiling. Yeah.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the choices that you've made, the liberation, the lack of desperation, like you're just in charge of everything. You're not controlled by anyone. You're not a victim of anyone. You don't have to tolerate anyone. You are positioned as peer or all of that was created deliberately. have gone through a process of systematically shifting the dynamics in everything. And you didn't have to get rid of and start over anything to like everything to make that happen. So Bogdan, gone, who her gone. But you didn't have to get rid not how normal people operate. This is not the average general life. This is not average by any means. Most people will never get to this level of power in their life where they can dictate the dynamic, but you're dictating benevolently. It isn't with a desire to oppress. It's with a desire to be free.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and not to use your freedom and power over somebody else.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You seek to bless. And so everything is motivated in a benevolent way, which is to me divine and God like, obviously we're not perfect and we can't be like him, but we can do our best. these relationships that you have, these people that you're working with, this work that you're doing and this piece that you have within that allows you to show up as a dad the way that you get to and as a husband the way that you get to. All of this was done because you wrestled yourself first. You wrestled your fears. You wrestled your insecurities. wrestled your choices and your decisions. And then you also wrestled the opponents, like Bogdan likely. It doesn't mean that they like, like, would be was an adversary. But an adversary to your freedom and your peace. He was his choices were however you want to call it, right?
00:29:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yes.
00:29:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that you are now at a point where you're just like, I can't really get rid of tea fast enough. And I'm like, but it's an asset. What can we do? Well, you know, maybe don't get rid of it yet. And then you ponder it a little bit and you're like, well, I could cut it down to this and it just kind of run itself. And then it expanded again. So it you reduced and then you marinated a little bit and just kind of let it maintain and then conserved energy like a battery filling back up like a solar battery. And now look at what's about to happen. all of that is you and you almost didn't have this partnership because they wanted to. Um, dictate a level that you're like, no, that's not going to happen. But instead of just renovating it and having your energy, you just be like, no, or rather than capitulating, because you're like, I, I'm not going to do this.
00:30:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't want to do marketing. Right.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, no, this is how it's going to be. Take it or read it and you meant it and that energy comes through. It comes through people know when somebody means it.
00:30:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so I'm just like, look at the boy.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just it's killing it because all of this has now compounding power. Yeah, massive compounding power, because you have alignment with these powerful relationships who are, you know, paying you $5,000 a month, Brian didn't pay you that well, Brian still doesn't really pay you that well in terms of. just showing up to do a job, right? for everything that you've brought to him, he doesn't pay you that well. In my opinion, it doesn't, like, I think everyone else is showing you more respect. And, you know, your relationship started with Brian is different. It's not really an apples to apples kind of thing. And it is about picking on Brian at all. My point is the elevated relationships that are coming that will get to compound in the way that they bring a financial return to you. But that also brings an energetic return to you and gives you more resources with which you can build and create. And that's pretty powerful. While at the same time that's happening, you've gotten tedious stuff off your plates and have an operating at a higher level, plus technology just zoomed and just went nuts for our chat dbt4o. Just imagine what's going to be available in six months from now. But nothing to be afraid of. Nobody's going to replace anybody and anything. Well, some people will go to a place, but for anybody that works strategically and understands leverage and levers, these are just levers, massive, powerful levers. And if you rather than come from place it and just go cruise control, right?
00:32:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Because that's where you die.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just go, okay, how can I leverage what's new? How can I leverage what's new? And just kind of put it into your foundational and fundamental system and process. It's going to be amazing. Like the conversation we're going to have from a year from now. Crazy, crazy, in a good way. Yeah.
00:32:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, you know, it's like I was thinking this week, I don't know if it was this morning or yesterday morning, but it's like, I'm really excited about this tea project. And I started, started dreaming a little bit, just thinking, like, man, what if this like, what if this works? And I usually, I, uh, I try, like, whenever I do that, like the voice in my head will kick in and be like, don't get too excited, like just don't get too excited. And, um, and I do that kind of just self protection, you know, I'm like, if it doesn't work, like I don't costs. Yeah. And Brian's that way. I've gotten a lot of that from him, as well. And, but at the same time, like, I was like, it's really cool. If this, if this worked, and there's, there's a model out there with this guy, Charles Livingston, who started Life Boost Coffee. And he's, he's now, he just launched a, uh, a line of teas. And so was like, and John is, he's good buddies with Charles and actually had a call with him a couple months ago saying I'm starting a tea business and Charles gave him some advice about what they learned when they were growing life-boost coffee and so I feel like we're following this like there's space in the market for this and we just got to, I don't know, I saw it work in to Lee's audience and we just got to figure out the right way to talk about it and I think we've got a good initial first step to put out there and I love that we're starting with doing upsells, going right after people, right after they buy in a sort of related... angle, I guess, and AI has been tremendously helpful on the research side of things. I started using this perplexity.ai because it gives you sites sources and links to But I just go in there and be like, give me some studies on how Joglin helps with weight loss.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know you can go do that with chat GPT-40 and get a great answer. Oh, really?
00:35:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, yeah.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll try that. I'm pretty much canceling everything now.
00:35:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. yeah, it's like, this is amazing. Isn't so much faster and so yeah, I'm really excited. I had about tea and I think like, man, wouldn't it be cool if, because like doing this stuff with, you know, consulting with Tim, like it's, it's fine, like I'm learning. It's good to practice that muscle. I'm writing a lot of copy and it's for a different audience. And I'm getting paid well, which I can just, you know, me a big shovel or a decent shovel to pay down my debt and all that good stuff. But, you know, it's, it's still like being dependent on somebody else and, I mean, some make sense same with, with Brian, but the one thing with, with Brian is that I am really looking forward to having this event that we're going to do in January. Like, I think that's going to bring in a lot of new memory. first accelerator. so I am pumped for that. And by that time, you know, the T will be out there and have that run in and be really cool.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it could be really cool. it. When's the last time you will actually hold on to something that you're I did it. Oh, when did you update it?
00:37:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Last week.
00:37:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're looking at the wrong one. Oh, yeah, we had a 2024 and I don't know where it is. Let's see. There it is. All right, let's see. So aside, good. And then where is your, let's see. I'm gonna put your for like paying off your deck kind of thing in this schedule.
00:38:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, so that I've got all the cards there and then below I've got them all listed out.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But have you, because they look mostly empty for like, I see city for me, but what you should do is put the projected what you want to drop on those for those months coming up.
00:38:29 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, well, I guess that line 18 set aside that 3k, it's for B of A. Okay. So I mean, I guess.
00:38:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there anything else that needs to get paid on those months?
00:38:51 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes, I'm glad you said that because I was just thinking about this. Just the, so I need the. update the business expense number because that needs to include, I have one card that's paying business expenses that comes out every month and then, so that would be off the top before taxes. So I think that 1800 would go to, I just paid it, was 1100, and that's the minimum payment on the, it's the biz, biz affire.
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's what I think you should do, and I think you should do it with whatever's rough idea in your head right now. But do you want to drop on any of these accounts for these next few months? So you have a more accurate idea of what there really is to work with. Because it helps with the surprises or the disappointment of a letdown kind of at the end. We're like, that's not as good as that looks right there. Or it could be like, oh, actually, well, I've got this to work with. So here's what I want to do now. And maybe it's paying down more. Maybe it's investing in something, whatever. So when you end, and it helps you get to those targets that you want to get with your finances faster when you put all of that in there. I'll have this, but I'll have my investment account. I'll have everything, all in a snapshot. So I look at the end of month projection knowing. like, this is the money that's growing, this is the money that's like investments growing, and then the revenue from business, and then here's the personal expenses and the businesses. I put everything together so I have an overall snapshot of what all the finances are. Since I don't, I like, I have a company, but I don't have a company, you know what I mean? I have that structure, so eventually, you know, like I have hired three people, I'm probably gonna hire a couple more for my own business, so this year I'm definitely gonna have to structure differently and have separate, completely separate finances, I haven't been doing that up until now, so it's really been super helpful for me to have everything on one page to have an idea, especially when I was first trying, when I was trying to get out of debt, that was huge for me to be able to see everything in a single line and be really confident about how much I had. how much I would have like what what work was coming doing obviously you don't know for sure but I've always had a pretty consistent revenue amount so um doing that just the piece of mind that comes from with the clarity but the energy from like yes I'm here and so if I go sell another thing it's extra money to go do this with or that with or whatever you know is that all I'm just one sheet or do you have multiple sheets so I have a I have a tab it's called monthly expenses and so that's everything that comes out and I have it color coded for business or personal just so I know and so what I do is I copy and paste that every month to my monthly budget and so like as each week I update it I'm like okay all of those charges have come out here's what's left that's an alignment with what it predicted I would have by the end of the the month, I just keep tabs on that and make sure that, you know, I'm just looking at it once a week and making sure everything comes out. So, and then on that tab that has a summary of all the things, that's where I make edits. But my main tab, my summary tab, like you have right here, what I do is I have that monthly stuff, so in the beginning of the month, I copy and paste the whole month playlist, right? So it has my variable and my fixed expenses, fixed expenses are, well, they're on the top, but then I end up sorting it by the date that they get drafted, just so that I have it in a linear kind of, what's the word, timeline, chronological order. But then they're also color coded too, and at the bottom it adds it all up as a summary of these are the things that are going to get drafted out. And that gets taken away from the monthly total of what I know is going to come in business. revenue-wise. My investment accounts don't get included in that.
00:44:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They're there so I can see it, but they don't get into my cash accounts.
00:44:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They just stay there. They don't get touched. Then at the top, I have a column for all of my different bank accounts, savings, checking, different banks. I do put the investment accounts in there, so I have a total, but it's not the total that everything gets subtracted from, if that makes sense. It gets its own total of all my assets, and then there's the this is the monthly budget total that everything can be debited from, and so that's the thing that changes every month. So I do have everything in there on a single page. The income prediction is its own tab, so I have an expense tab and an income tab. And I have an income for every year, and I just create because I don't have a ton of people or ton of offers, right? But either way, it wouldn't be too much different than this. It'd be a little bit longer. It's really long, but so every time there's the monthly, I used to have the group stuff and I used to have different products, which is about to return. So I would put the totals based on either the client or the product total and report those weekly or as whenever I did the update. So for clients, it's once a month. If it's going to be a product, I'll probably do it once a month total with that. Again, that's how I used to do it. And then so I got the monthly total, but it's going top to bottom and it's a really long. I don't know how many rows it is. And at the bottom, and I just do it for the whole year and one in one. tab and then it totals it at the bottom and so I've got an income tab, I've got an expense tab and the front tab, this one is my summary tab where I just copy and paste the expenses. The income is just a formula that adds up everything from my income tab so that it's calculating in real time what is coming in and what's going out is it's always right on alignment with what I have, it's always within my budget. If something changes and a new expense is coming, I just go insert a cell into the summary tab and it does that so yeah it's I could give you and I feel like I template for let's see what you know. what that looks like if you wanted to do it so that you could just kind of track. So like it's it's all the different types of expenses, school expenses, kid expenses, soccer stuff, whatever, all the personal stuff, and then all of the business stuff. So I have a really accurate idea of what's coming out every month. And I always have more money than I thought I did because I try to put in that buffer, especially for groceries, clothes, you know, things like that. Right. Yeah, but that way there was just no negative surprises. It was always a good surprise. Like, oh, I have got more money than I thought it did. And then it gets to a point where you don't necessarily have to check it every week, but it's still a good practice to do because you want to make sure that there's something didn't pop up that you weren't paying attention to.
00:47:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that'd be great. I think you you probably shared either that or maybe earlier version of that. with me in the past, let's see maybe, but but yeah, I'd love to see it and see if I could because I'm going in here and updating this and it's been helpful. So yeah, if there was way to to make it even more detailed, they'll begin.
00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. I've got it open. I have a template, but I would change it a little bit to be more like the format that I have. It's similar. Okay. Yeah.
00:48:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, I mean, you could zero everything out and send me what you use if you.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's basically like that, but I might be able to make it just more like for for what you have. So then it's more plug and play for you. Okay. So let's see, let's look at this. I mean, because let's see, so June doesn't have a lot of wiggle around. You're at the end of May is that like what you have in profits after everything, including paying things down.
00:49:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, no, I've got more than that. I put 11 grand for lights on cost because we're doing a trip. Guys up to New York. So, but I know right now I've got um, let's see, let me just pay, let me do it. Yeah, I checked in there, I had 29 grand in my account, it's the end of the month, then I just took out five on a, on my southwest car, because that was the, because I have expenses that are tight expenses on that. And so that's part of what Brian pays me, I just pay that towards, so, okay, so we're down to like 22, probably about 20 grand sitting in there now, not 12, and I'm not going to be taking out 8 grand between now and the end of the month. So I think instead of that 12 that's going to carry over, it's going to be more like. It'll end up being more like 17.
00:51:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you've got the live payout for TxL, and then that'll happen again in October?
00:51:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:51:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You had a happening in October.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you haven't mentioned profit partners at all? Yes. you working on it?
00:51:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, I'm not. It just kind of went to the back burner for me after doing that. But after doing the cohort, I didn't really like, I mean, I would do the cohort differently. So that's not like a reason to not do it, but, and I stopped, have an email my list in a while, somebody asked me about that, they're like, I haven't heard from you, and I wrote back, was like, I don't. I don't know, I don't know what I'm leading people toward, because the things that I'm excited about are, you know, the things I'm working on, and the, the, the business and things like that. And it's like, I, I don't know, like, I, I just kind of lost. energy around building my list, mailing my list, lost the energy around profit partners. And I think when I because I started, I mean, started working on the T back early and beginning of the year. And if I were to hold up, you know, option one of having like owning a business, it's generating revenue that's, you know, product based like the T versus doing something that's more personality based like profit partner. I'm I'm going to go for the product base one.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what if what you do is make it less hands-on? Like it doesn't have to be a bootcamp and instead it's just a series of videos and it's mostly self-paced and it's lower cost but it's just an engine that runs and maybe once a quarter you do a live call, live training and it's kind of a big deal, you know, like really get like some speakers on there, maybe it's like a four-hour kind of event but it can be in alignment with other things that you're doing, other people that you're working with so it's not a separate thing that takes separate energy. It's a it's a duplicated repurposed type of activity right because you're already talking to these people, they're already in your share and you can be like, hey, let's talk about the stuff that we're doing and let's show people how they can do it. And, you know, like, there's probably an angle because there's value in it. And I think you liked talking about it. I just think you, and this is the thing I found in my own self, a start, stop, start, stop. And I do it with a lot of different things, fitness regimens, different types of habits and activities, because I know that I'm pulled to it and I'm called to it. But when I start to do it, the path isn't super clear. And so I think sometimes God just shows me things so that I'm ready, so that when the time is right, I'll know it and recognize it because I've been thinking about it. And my subconscious has been able to work on it. And he's been attracting other people into my sphere and attracting me into theirs. like, there's all these things that go into it. And so maybe, so in the beginning, the burden was kind of I had have to have a product to make my own money so I'm not reliant just on TxL. Well now you've got T and now you have a consulting job that you're kind of doing and liking and you can do another one or two and easily make another $10,000 where with Trad GBT you wouldn't be spending a ton of time because you know how to train it really really fast on their stuff. So everything has changed but this is still something that you probably want to be able to give back. You have always been drawn to helping other people be successful in their own businesses being free, being liberated from not being taken advantage of by people that they're working for that they're making rich and they're not getting paid anything. So maybe it's a change of schedule and burden and the way that you package everything and how you offer it and you just pivot kind of an adjust the way that you're delivering it the way that you're selling it and even your price point like if you don't need it to work you don't need it to be a certain price point and so you know what I mean like maybe that's something to consider so that now it's not a well I have to do this and I feel resentment because of it and it's a I get to do this I'm going to do it my way just like every other deal that you've done right yeah with John and his son John right the tea guy yeah John John John you've you've adjusted the partnership with Brian every conversation that you're having you're like okay well here's what I'm willing to do it's on the table, take it or leave it. And you can do the same thing with profit partners, but if you're feeling like, okay, they can't pay that much because they really don't have good arrangements yet. They don't have good partnerships yet. not, really they have a lot of mindset issues probably like you did about how they even positioned themselves. So this is a very long runway.
00:58:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's the biggest problem with this.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not really a problem, but it is in terms of conversion. Is there is a long runway of overcoming mental hurdles of, I can't do this. I don't know how to package it. I don't know how to whatever. And so you could come up with a 90 day email sequence with chat GPT. So like you could go take all of your recordings, all of your transcripts. then, so this is what I've done. And I love the memory because I could start a whole new chat and it still remembers everything I've told it and other things. So, give it all of that content and say, this is my philosophy. This is my goal. This is what I want to teach people. Here's the problem that I know is that, you know, for example, it took me years to get to the point where I can confidently just say, look, this is what I'm going to do, take it or leave it. But on top of that, you also sharpened your saw. You also got to the point where you're like, I'm very good at what I do. You you can write copy, amazing copy. don't have to write, wait for Brian, Brian's barely going to touch and tweak anything you write anymore. So it wasn't just, you know, your mindset, it was also your skill set. Yeah. So you tell chat TPT, like, these are the issues that people are going to have and you think about all the issues they're going to have. And maybe, you know, at two o'clock in the morning, you're up, you're going to the bathroom, think of like, whatever. Don't let me forget it. Let's add this to the material. Let's add this to to the philosophy and make sure that we leave it into the content and I've been talking to it like that and it will weave it into the content and say oh this will fit perfect in this chapter and we'll add this lead magnet we could do this and I'm like oh yeah let's go yeah so you know you could say I need a 90 day or maybe it's a 120 day and then you recycle it right thing that just hit all of these bullet points consistently and tells them this is what you need to know and let's make it anecdotal which is not really great at coming up with anecdotes without training and even with training it's not very great at anecdotes I don't think not the way that I would write not the way that you would write but it can it definitely can be trained better and I'm we're getting there anyway but but then you can just redo it every 90 to 120 days and you know in four months maybe you get the next level and say, hey, do you feel like you're ready for the next step? And let them either unsubscribe, stay in and they recycle through the next thing, the same thing over and over again. Or at some point, they raise their hand and say, I'm interested in more. And it's either buy this thing, or now you're self selected to more. So I'm going to give you the next level of mindset. And eventually, they're either going to unsubscribe or buy. Because the what you should be doing for a list hygiene is getting rid of people who never open your emails, right? So that's what I would do. And it's very low level. And the training could all be video plus you want to have a but if they do, and you get an extra two, three, four, $5,000 a month, talk. talking about profit partners one on one, which is, to me, the thing that would energize you, and also potentially bring you your own profit partner, because who knows who they're connected to? Um, you know, maybe that's another way that you could do it where it's not draining anymore. And with the automations of chat TPT, may I not allow work?
01:02:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm open to something like that. It's, um, yeah, I'm open to something like that. But it, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like, like, not, I'm not drawn to put energy into it, like right at this juncture.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, anybody anything around profit partners?
01:02:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do I know?
01:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, then we'll just let it sit, you don't You don't have to do anything, but if you if you get inclined and you think about it And then you can just start building a framework and chat GPT I haven't even run into limitations since 4o came out.
01:03:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Mm-hmm.
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not running out of topians Didn't tell me I couldn't upload X amount of things I've had to continue like a couple times, but that's it because it just goes so long. It's so amazing. Yeah I'm just like that's a huge upgrade. Yeah, amazing for $20 a month.
01:03:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like that's crazy.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know So it looks like okay, I What are you and Seth and Brian working on anything?
01:03:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not yet It's balls in my court to outline The RFM what Seth and I talked about doing was taking people through I guess his email process to the outcome will be to have a, to show them how to find the best people on their list and then we're going to give them an offer to run to their list. So, what were a, a structure of an offer that they would plug in, basically, and we would sell TXL this way because we would say, basically we've, we've shown you how to find the very best people on your list. Now we're giving you, we're just saying, run this, run this offer, run this offer structure, making money, and use that money to join TxL. like pay for TxL before you join type of thing.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so it's just in my court to finish outlining that, show it to Brian, or I want to show it to Seth first, but that's where it sits. And then Seth told me, I guess you were on the call, actually now that I think about it with this as a hypnosis.
01:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, it's kind of self hypnosis therapy, and it combines other existing therapies, like CBT cognitive therapy. Yeah, so he's working on an offer for them right now.
01:05:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We had a sales call with them Friday.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. And they kind of balked at the price a little bit for a dent for you. But it was a big price. And I told Seth that he should do But because he's making big impact in big companies, and every time it's blowing them away and he's charging peanuts basically for something that's gonna add a whole lot to their bottom line. And he's at the point where he needs to build a team and make some investments so that I've got something to work with for him. But also it's pretty powerful. And I wanna see it in more people's businesses that actually have transformational offerings. So like the way that you teach people you personally, but also in TXL, how to be better leaders, be better persuaders, move people from where they are to where they have already said they wanna go through copy, through persuasion, through buying this thing, which is a transformational thing. TXL is a transformational thing. You come in and you improve your skills, which relates to, you know, correlates to and translates to better revenue. But also more confidence. And more confidence brings more energy. Just it feels better. You know, you're happier when you're more confident. If you're self-doubting, you're unhappy. That's just how it is. So with the way that he writes things, compared with the automations that take that psychology and that writing on a schedule with behavioral-based responses, it's like consulting and coaching somebody in person on a day to day. It feels very different.
01:07:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
feels so much more personal.
01:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's architecture and it's engineering. this is not how anything is really running right now. And, but if a person wants to be leading and wants to be really supportive, and they don't want to show up every day to do it because we also have our own lives, this is the solution. And I want to see it in businesses because if you put all those things together, that means you've got more people with more skills and more confidence going out and doing their things. You know what they don't have? They don't have the fear that the government's going to take over them or whatever person. They're less afraid. They're more powerful than more independent. That goes with so many of the other values that we have is wanting to be a free people, self-sustaining, independent, whatever. Free parents, happier parents, stronger, more confident parents that can go home and teach our kids how to do all of these things. So it um but nobody else is doing it so I'm definitely like whatever you can do to get that in there and start seeing it happen I think that you have the ability to go take the same kind of concept and put it into other things like once you see how it works you'll I know you have this skill technically and copy and persuasion rise to go and do something like this in other things ethically obviously not stealing the formula but it's the type of thing that it's going to get out there you know and you use it and repurpose it but there's abundance Seth will get what he needs and wants plenty um but once you see it I think it can really change the way that you operate and really leverage things for you because you'll look at that and go this is this is what I do you with profit partnering this is how I walk somebody through an experience and I don't have to be there for them but they they're like I'm in love with Chris because he has taught me everything He's my coach. He's my mentor. He's my teacher. He changed my life. And you're like, yeah, wrote those emails once.
01:10:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, you're not going to see really how it all works until you, you watch it. He built inside of something. So if you get the framework, this is leverage that you will benefit over and over again. That the Titans can as well, but that you and Brian will, you know, share the cost or however that works. Yeah. It'll be something you can even potentially do with teeth and that the transformation is a person who doesn't know a lot about how the nervous system works, right? The digestive system or whatever. And so you walk them through these things and like if they raise their hand and say, look, I want to be the healthiest person. And I can't, well, if you're gonna do that, you can't just take supplements. You have to understand how these things work. So let's walk you through an experience where you learn all of these things, and then you make some decisions, well guess what those decisions are? Buying your products, but it's buying your products because you've done the research and you know that if they've got these things going on, this is the ideal thing for them. So it's persuasion, I wouldn't call it manipulation because the manipulation is getting somebody to do something that they would not do that is against their values. But they got twisted into doing something against their values, tricked basically. To me, you know, that's what it is. Persuading somebody to do something they wanna do and just continuing to encourage them and given the information that they need to do that, you know, that's ethical and good. I think that that's what this is for. So anyway, this is my pitch and plug for, get that. Don't overwork yourself, know, if you're busy and now is not a good time. That's one thing But I see powerful leverage in you seeing what he's done. I mean, he has not been great about Explaining how powerful it is and being clear about it But he's like in the same way that when you went through BAM Your copy just just Yeah, he has been having that transformation as we've been working because we've been working together It's been 13 months now and he could not tell me anything clearly and now he can put it in just a few words and a few paragraphs Which it used to take him hours, and I still didn't know everything I needed to know. Yeah, so Once now that he's getting clear, it's it's gonna be coming out and it's it's hopefully gonna get some traction because this is This is the thing many of us have been needing who don't want to be tied to the job, tied to the community, tied to social media, tied to email, tied to customer support, but also know that a person needs to be reminded, needs to be held accountable, needs to be given bite-sized pieces all the way through. Nobody wanted to write all those email sequences. So this aligning with where we're at with chat TPT. Forget about it. I'm telling you, God is like, babies, I know you're tired, I got this for you.
01:13:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's on my list. I make just slow process on it, so it's not an empty document somewhere. just require some thinking. Simple. I mean, I guess it is a simple topic, but.
01:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could I return to you.
01:14:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what I know. What else? What questions do you have? Let it ask you questions because that's what you and I do. I ask you questions and you answer it. And you're like, well, that actually brings up a good idea. Let me think about this. And then it evolves.
01:14:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Right.
01:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't let that ABT replace me because I'm better, but you know, but you can do it. It can it can probe and do something. And matter of fact, the way that my copy evolved was that and it was crazy because. So I went through and I was making a lead magnet for. Principles and priorities. And I had just told it the importance of. That the reason it's, it's the first. concept in the first pillar that I teach is because values, principles and values, they inform priority and priority informs what gets done and what gets measured. And that obviously is going to inform what we actually have and so then it goes through and it goes the secret way to like how I'm going to go read it. I'm just going to do this normal wrap up. Someone is just crazy. Tick tock marketing strategies is where we ended up writing this I think. I gave it bunch of notes after that. going Oh, you know what actually I sent it to some of that. But it was, yeah, no, I really, I do really want to tell you this show this. I had to scroll up past the billions of conversations that we have. Okay, it was after our ball of reality. never mind. I'm just priority. So no one cares. That's how I can find it because I told it no one cares. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. Okay, so it wrote this. It said title, the surprising key to unlocking your business potential, how core values transform your priorities. And I was like, nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's not good at all. What people care about is actually getting traction and momentum in their business and they feel stuck. I'm pretty sure you have enough understanding about human emotion to be able to write better than this. What questions do you need to ask yourself? People are writing to make sure that you are writing something that will evoke powerful emotion So it asked the questions six of them. What are the primary pain points of my audience? Then it asked another question, and then what emotions are tied to the pain point? What transformation are they seeking? What's the immediate benefit they will gain from my solution? How can I create urgency in the sense of importance? What proof of credibility can I provide and then? The new copy it did not ask you questions. It did not answer it It answered itself and then wrote the copy without any further interaction for me The new title unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack Introduction feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks announcing progress. You're not alone Most business owners struggle with the same issues feeling like they're spinning their rails without getting any traction The good news is there's a simple yet powerful solution that can change everything in just minutes So I have taught it that stuff but it doesn't matter because in the past I taught it so many things and it won't pull from it and it won't take the psychology that I had taught it and it didn't put it into copy like it just it took so much training and this I like what I just told you like nobody cares blah blah whatever I would go 20 rounds and still not get anything great but what it did right there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve word headline unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack um I will read the rest of that next is feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks oh mama keep reading you know what I mean mm-hmm so um but where it started where is it started like unlocking your priorities give her a brat there else I'm out there
01:19:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
that's awesome.
01:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, simple turning and oh, so the conversation, that's all I was saying, like to your outline for RFM.
01:19:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is how I talked to it. And, know, I don't it doesn't care about its feelings, but I want to do it was important. It wasn't being rude. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's the truth. And so I said, that's not a good headline at all. What people care about it. And then what questions do you need to ask yourself to make sure that you evoke powerful emotion? Because I told it, people purchase and make decisions based off of emotion. So if you give it the principles that you know that copy has to have and say, remember this, always remember this. Never forget this. That type of thing.
01:19:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It will start remembering.
01:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you can say, okay, based on what you already know, what questions do you have that you need to know before knowing that this is something you need? Or what questions do you think my buyer has that they need to have a clear answer to before they purchase? And then it will give you some questions, you're like, oh yeah, you're right. So I need to go put this in there. I'm telling you, it will walk you through the whole process and the way that we have done in some sessions, in copywriting sessions, you'll get there, but you can stop and start whenever you want to. And you can say, I forgot what we were working on, remind me, and it will tell you the last conversation you had anywhere in any of the conversations.
01:20:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Wow, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm definitely going to do that for the SARS-Fins thing. That's great.
01:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I suppose you probably had enough of talking to me after I let you go.
01:20:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's good to catch up. Um, yeah, I mean, maybe we could, uh, connect like this or like once a month or something.

Yeah, I would love that, but I would, it would really be great to me to just at least be able to touch faces at least every couple of weeks. would rather just kind of weakly like, Hey, this is what's good. Like, tell me the wins or if something is stressing you out, I really would like to know about that. Like I'm so if we did the, like this is the offer I'm wanting to test and try and I think won't be hard, especially because people like you tend to just not say anything. So it's really not taking my time when I would give it, um, but especially if something stressing you out, just get it out and just be like this. And then maybe I can ask you questions, maybe I can give you encouragement, just be here. Sometimes it's just nice to have somebody that knows your business and knows you.

But also if you have a win, it's something that will feed into whatever else we're doing because that win is definitely going to have relationship to other work that you're doing. So if you would just take a second, a few minutes, whatever, to pop in each week, if I'm like, how's it going? Tell Tina, what's up? Boy, I've been investing you for six and a half years also.
