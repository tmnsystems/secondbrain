00:00:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hello.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good, Good.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you day?
00:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, my Friday was.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Would you have gone on Friday?
00:00:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I went to, you know, my lunch times, you gypsy class. Yeah. And then I, uh, how do you get to see that? When I cut my eye open.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, hatch. Oh, my gosh. That's a lot.
00:00:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. So I went to the ER. Oh, I was that jujitsu. I somehow, someone scratched the top of my eyelid. And so the skin right above the eyebrow or the eyelash muscle tore off. And that's, that's what got me. So anyway, went to the ER, then they glued it back together. I have like that super blue Derma Bonda in my eyelid.
00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I don't know if it's your internet or my internet. It's fine. Okay.
00:01:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It froze right on your eye. was like.
00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Perfect.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. Yeah. Um, okay. Homework assignments. Oh, did you send me anything?
00:01:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I don't think I was, uh, I have my hub spot. I'll share with you that I made a hub spot. Very excited.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:01:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I did the first, uh, the ones on that list. Um, yeah. So I signed up for a free version of HubSpot and then I finally just, I mean, I think I was having like decision paralysis. because my wife uses Salesforce CRM and then other people use air tables CRM and there's the SANA and HubSpot so finally I chose one I just chose HubSpot signed up and then yeah I just started building this contact list and I had a really good pretty good rate. Pretty much everyone I called or most of people I called would answer and then I would take their message I would like record their call secretly on my iPhone and then transcribe what was said, feed it into chat GPT and then they'd summarize it into a note format like this.
00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then yeah now I know kind of like my next steps and what I have to do to message them. That's awesome let's see good and new, well that can be my priority. Let's see, call contact case managers, that's what you did right?
00:03:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How many need to do.
00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So in the create new spreadsheet for a law from referral data, is that what HubSpot's taking care of or?
00:03:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I was going based on that. It was the, where was that? It was the one that my. It was the sheet that my manager set up.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see.
00:03:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's called Conteositas.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that one.
00:03:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I got it. Yeah. Okay. There was a couple of these that I didn't call like when and I think it was rocky because they actually were referred by funding company. So I don't want to like backstab person that referred to me. So I stuck with the other ones.
00:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How I don't understand that relationship, I think. So can you elaborate a little bit more?
00:04:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, it's like how like reaching out to them would be backstabbing. It's like this company like Global. So these guys, I sign a contract with them to get paid up front much lower than I usually get. So like these guys I signed up for like $250 a visit. And in return, they just refer cases straight to me. And then once I do the once I do the console, give them the note, they just give me $250. dollars at the front. I don't have to wait a year for 18 months. Downside is I make probably like, well, you know, I make like $200 less than I should, but I don't have to wait.
00:05:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, when they send me a case, I know the lawyer, right? Like, I know the case manager, because I could see who sent it to them. So, I just, to be playing nice in the sandbox, I don't, I don't try to jump over them and call their case manager and steal that relationship.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's got to.
00:05:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because otherwise, they'll stop sending me cases.
00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, got it.
00:05:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, but I do, like, I noticed that Global has sent me, like, one of cases in the past, like, from one law firm. If I noticed that, like, hey, they've only sent me one in, like, the last four or five months, I have gone back and messaged that law firm. was like, hey, like, six months ago, I did a case for you.
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guys how do you know but when when they're actively sending me cases I don't I try not to go after those guys how many cases have they sent you in the last year they send me I don't know in the last year but they send me about 10 or less that tone is called sprinkles I know I use a lot that's your alarm clock I said time to go on with Tina that that I think that's the same one we have yeah that's how I got it I choose I choose ones that aren't so distressing some of the alerts are very make you hear them I'm like leap out of my skin and I'm ready to go to battle fight or play I don't have fight flight or freeze I just have fight yeah that's it I only have one flavor it's funny radar radar does that to me radar makes me go like ah really Oh, like, oh, the radar sound. Yes. Or is it radio? It's called radio.
00:07:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know.
00:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:07:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's aggressive.
00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is the one that I use when I need to not ignore an alarm. So I know if I've assigned something to that, I don't get to dismiss it or anything or snooze or whatever. OK. So I'm going to look at it on my screen. So what I would like is, whoa, there to go. Let's see. I'm going to insert column left, date, contacted, so that we know when you followed up with them. And this will be, we're assuming that this means when you've reached out for more cases. That way, you can track just easily, like, if it's been a little while, go ahead and reach out to the rest of them. And the other thing that What did we decide on a frequency of contact?
00:08:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, for like ones that have only gave me one or two cases in general.
00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think we should come up with that so that you just don't sit there and think, well, should I, should I, we just made a decision and is it within those parameters or is it not? it's not, then I reach out.
00:08:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Maybe I could put something like, like HubSpot or write in like HubSpot or something like that, because I think I could put a column in HubSpot where it says date last contacted.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can we look at that together again?
00:08:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I don't know to share a screen.
00:08:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You pick, I don't know how to do what I've just been doing.
00:08:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how to, um, I've been asking chat GPT how to like set it up.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's probably not a chat. question. Awesome.
00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love do I create a field in a contact that is last state contact. Okay, customize. Gear icon. Okay. Data management. Up here. Properties. Oh, contact properties. And put create property in the top right. Oh, here it is, late, last object, awesome, so how do I add it, and then, okay, okay, how do I, what do I do now?
00:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought I heard a dog, but I don't see her in her bed, just because she's over there.
00:10:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Is that it? Okay.
00:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, let's try to do this number. So now, there should be a, oh, okay, how do I find where I just did, 2D.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe ask it how you can set it up so that in your, like, main view, it shows up that way. So, like, if you were to look up like this, right, how would you view it here? Or is there a view where you can just look at everybody and see that? Custom data thing that you just added.
00:11:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, yeah, yes, okay. So, may now you should click on contacts, open list of contacts. Let's try that. OK. Hot-contact.
00:12:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Advanced filter, maybe. Or all of you.
00:12:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, click. Do you see where action is? Oh, action. and click Edit Columns, and it properties. OK.
00:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go back, because I have to click on all field types, all fields.
00:12:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What you saw?
00:12:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It says all field types.
00:12:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK, is that to do this. That, and then I have to click Add.
00:12:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You see what it says, Add?
00:12:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then scroll down, maybe. Click Save to apply the changes. Oh, scroll down. I don't It says Find the Save button. I don't see a save. It says Save View.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you want this view, OK. Yes, so go back for a second.
00:13:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:13:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were says all views and you can do add view.
00:13:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What's that?
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:13:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Did you click on add view? Yeah, I could add view.
00:13:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, add view here. Mm-hmm.
00:13:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I wonder if that's these though.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last activity is right there. Date. Oh.
00:13:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Where is it?
00:13:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
see.
00:13:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Edit column.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's it. column.
00:13:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right there on the right. Right. Okay. Add the last state contacted property.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right there.
00:13:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Last. Contact it. Okay. There it is. Okay. Now that's there. Nice. Okay. Last contacted.
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:14:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Cool. Now how do I choose? How do I edit that field when I'm in here? Oh, maybe just automatically does it. Okay. Cool. All right. It'll just automatically. Okay.
00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
when I log in email or something, it'll save the day in the last contact. So you're contacting them through HubSpot?
00:14:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
haven't linked it yet. So then how is it updating it?
00:14:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because every time I call them, I take a transcript of what we talked about and then I put it right here. Inactivity?
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. log it as an activity.
00:14:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I put log, I put note, add in a note for a log call. Okay. And then I log my email that I have emailed them. Okay. So you're logging in?
00:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I was like, how is it knowing?
00:15:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, I got it. Yeah, it's very manual.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I could do better like with automation, but for now, I was like, with Mark and with Dan, we're working on building an automation for something that would work for this.
00:15:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I was like, he's flashing up every time I click log email to like, you know, if you give us your Gmail account, we could log it for you. But I just, I haven't wanted to use that yet. Yeah. I want to learn how this goes in manually and then, I don't know, let's see. Yeah. This, this, this will help. Now I can figure out like, okay, I contacted them five days ago.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So then, do you have all of your lists in here, including the ones that you haven't contacted?
00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
These are like the ones that
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay so then the assignment for this week is to make sure you get everybody in there and then I think so frequency that that's the thing right what's what's the target is because there's there's two I don't know kind of deciding factors which is one when was the last time they sent you a case and two was the last time you followed up with that right right so how long after receiving a case do you want to begin your initial follow up and how long after your last follow up do you want to call and reach out again.
00:16:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. So let's say it takes us. Let's say they send me a case. And then let's say it takes, you know, four days to see the patient days, two days to send the notes, that's seven days. So I would say, guaranteed, if we say like 10 days, guaranteed I've seen their patient and sent them the notes. So they should have everything after 10 days. So you know, around the two week mark is when I could be like, hey, you sending me some if they haven't already? Like, hey, how did that go last week or a couple weeks ago?
00:17:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you send me a little bit? Yeah. So in HubSpot, can you make that a canned message? And could you make some versions of it? Like maybe chat to you, give me five versions of this same email, which it can do and will do. So it's not verbatim. And that way you can go with HubSpot and go follow up since last case one, follow up since last case two, and then kind of cycle through them. So they're not getting the same exact email over and over again. And you can semi automate it.
00:18:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So like, okay, so on HubSpot or somehow I need to know if one of these people sent me a case.
00:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, there is a Gmail plugin called Yesware. I don't know if this will fit in and maybe this is, we need to go like with go high level or something. But Yesware can, Yesware is a whole suite that plugs into Gmail and you can, it has can messages and follow up sequences, it can also check and it's been years since I've used it. So I imagine it's a lot smarter now where I don't know how you could trigger that. Have you received a case yet? Maybe that just has to be manual and maybe you can have your manners or do that and you know that that be a simple thing so that there's actually be human eyes on it, being sure that it's happening, and then everything else be automated, which I do like making sure that there's some kind of human audit happening at some point evaluating the activity.
00:19:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. Okay. HubSpot, yeah, I can invite my manager, Paul, and he can share the same contact with me. So one, one kind of just very basic workaround we could do is I could just have him watch if anything comes from these companies, these clients. Yep. then what we could do.
00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There could be an automation though. So if anything, let's say you have their Gmail account or any G or, I mean, email account. Yeah, I have all their email, right. So you can create even, even just Google has this ability, some sort of automation that says, if you get this email, then do this. So, like, Zapier, if this, then that, there are different automations that can trigger and say, okay, go update this database to say, and Zapier might be the better one to do, but if this, then that might also put it in HubSpot and update it with the last case received on this date.
00:20:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. So, I think before I do that, an automation, I'll just have my manager do it by hand since there's not that many. Yeah. And essentially, so we're going to need to add some sort of like a log.
00:20:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I would ask chat to PT because there are a few different automations. I would tell it, the overall goal that you want in the most simplified form, right? Because we don't want a convoluted process, and we wanted to stay as simple as possible, and say, this is the existing system and things that happen. know, we do this, we receive this. This is how we need the data to be processed. This is where we're currently holding and managing our data within our existing system and tech stack. What would be the simplest way to integrate? What would be the simplest solution that we could integrate that would add this feature of being able to receive x, update y, append data. You can draw it in a spreadsheet like Zapier could do multiple. That would be several different zaps, right? But it'd be this step, this step, this step in one recipe, zap typing, or make dot com. But ask it of if this does not, zapier, make dot com or potentially any other solution that we haven't considered, which one would be able to complete all of these steps under one roof. And is known to be successful in these particular applications. Okay, and then when they tell you one and you pick one, give me the recipe. Chat TPT is like the Scottie Pippin of our business here. It's given all the assists. You're probably too young for that version of the bowls though. If you probably, I don't even know. I'm a basketball nerd.
00:22:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm shot in for bowls.
00:22:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just can't even talk. Don't worry, don't mind me. Did you guys move?
00:22:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
21st. That's what they're doing outside is they're putting everything into boxes, pre-boxing everything for the movers.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll put that on my calendar.
00:22:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Fuji is moving today. Oh, let's see if I can find mine. And
00:24:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even need that one anymore. Can you charge me? You
00:25:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right, let's see what Google Chat GVT comes up with. Okay, so it says, I asked it for three different processes, one at least one using HubSpot that I get integrated into my current system. So, first one it says, create a HubSpot account, which I did import your entire Google Master Sheet into HubSpot within and use the custom fields. as the contacts. For each referral, log it as a deal or create a custom property in the contacts to record and track the date of referral. So I have to map the file I do. I have a little of a column called date of referral. So I'd have to just like tell HubSpot, this is the column that signifies I got a deal and they want to call it a deal. And then it says set up a workflow and HubSpot trigger. If a contact has not sent to referral for more than a specified number of weeks, ask HubSpot to automatically send a personalized email to that case manager to stay top of mind, reminding them about your services. Cold call logging. Use HubSpot's activity tracking feature to log cold calls. Create a custom field or tag contacts who are cold called. That's not very specific. Use a HubSpot workflow to track whether any of these referrals resulted in receiving a referral. furl or a deal, and then track results with a report. Upsells reporting allows you to generate reports showing the case managers and law firms that have referred the most cases, as well as how many referrals came after a cold call. All this data you have in your spreadsheet. Then they gave me a sample for using Zape here. So, this one is saying, again, you should use Zape here to integrate Google Sheets with a Gmail process. For instance, Zap number one, every time a new referral is logged into Google Sheet, set a follow-up date automatically, for instance, 30 days following. If no referral is logged from that particular case manager's email or law firm within three weeks, then the email will get sent. No, can you tell me what a zap is? Is that like just like I pay like 10 cents a zap?
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what it is? Something like that. So let me go log in.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Every time it does something.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Welcome back to you. Oh, I am so blurry. You're blurry. Sorry. Okay. So I almost never use this, but I have clients that use it lot, but I do have. Oh, go away. What just happened? Which one am I sharing? I'm not sharing that. Okay. What did I do with this? Oh, okay. So. Let's see. Untitled zap. this is, this actually wasn't one that I'm using, but I wanted to see if I could do it. So from. on ads. So I would select the event and then I got a move zoom on my way so I can see these things. Trigger event would be new lead which you would get from Facebook ads that would tell you you have a new lead and oops I don't want to do all that. And then so you would like sign into Facebook create the account you would connect the ads right here right so this would integrate the two things together and then lead connector is go high level. Are you familiar with go high level or with high level? Okay so um Mark can tell you more I can tell you a ton about it but if you also wanted to talk to him about it because we you can create custom apps and it does a lot of follow-up sequences a lot of automations with texting but data logging and creating automation workflows and it's a kind of an If then, if this then that logic as well, like there's literally an app called if this then that I have TT Like Zapier and it's been around a very long time and matter of fact, just let me just give you a little Tech like lesson today so Zapier if this then that this is business automation and what I would ask you to do Although I I'm sure Zapier for the most part has more recipes and then there's also make calm which is less expensive than both of them but newer and Sometimes this has integrations that Zapier doesn't and Price for action Make calm is currently cheaper But if you want to go just down a little bit of a rabbit hole and understand some of the Automations that are available to you Combine with chat tbt if you just are like I wonder if I could do this, ask chat GPT and then ask it to tell you how you would do it with make, how you would do it if this is not, and how you would do it with Zapier to get like a master-class kind of version of using automations but super super fast. would be the fastest way to do it. So Zapier, and I have, so I have a make recipe that I used because I was playing with Etsy stores and so I want to teach people that aren't good at business in my family how to have business and Etsy is a little like it's not going to make the kind of money I make but it can help them replace their income. So they're called scenarios here and this one so if I create a product in the Etsy store, the Etsy store has an RSS feed and so any time I create a product or a money. team creates it. They create a product. It goes into the RSS feed here and so then this make is watching for it and it runs every 30 minutes and then it grabs some data from it and it parses it. I had to look up this code to figure out how to do this. I didn't know how to do this. And then when it parses it, it so parsing separating, right? It gets a specific kind of data and I told it what I did, what data I wanted to get. So I could grab it here. The data I wanted it to get was the title and then it would feed that title to the Etsy part, right? Oh, so listing ID ID, that's what it was. And so from the listing ID, then it would go and say, okay, with this listing ID, I also need the images. And then it would go to chat GBT and it would, this is the instruction I gave it. You're my social media expert. I need you to write a description for this, this and then it would route it to Instagram and Facebook and it would go make a post for me. And so I haven't done anything for a long time. But if I go to Instagram, say, I'm on the app, I'm on a custom gift. You've got to find it. Well, I am not searching to optimize for that, huh? So, oh, let's see. I'll do that. Pretty sure. Maybe not. I do want to show you. Let me see Facebook. See if I can find it. Nope. Oh, well. Anyway, I can show you later, but it actually it's worth the effort. Let me, I have it here on my phone. I'll just switch real quick so I can show you a nice custom guess where I don't.
00:35:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I wonder if, you know, all these involved kind of these if than that. I think what I'll do then before I like try to automate is, I'm going to actually try to do it manually and see if I could do the same thing over and over. And then if I can do just the same workflow over and over, then I can automate that.
00:35:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think first I'll try to figure out how to do it by hand.
00:35:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then once I can get it by hand, then next week or something, I can, I can try to use one of these automations.
00:35:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, here it is. So all of this was created with, and that has, was enough brain mamas of the world. I would never write this stuff, but chat GPT did, but it's still something. Anyway, but everything in. including the link and the image was done through automations. As soon as the product was created in the store.
00:36:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Wow.
00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't. So I also used to have a go to Pinterest and Pinterest got me tons of traffic, which was crazy. Like, I didn't know anything about it. So, um, let's see. think I did a version. I'll show you one more zap. Oh, I use zap four. Um, this. So I'm working on creating a Tina GPT, right? So what it does is it takes my transcripts. Um, and from all of my calls and then I go, I have to add a new step in here because I was having this manually done. But, but what it does is it dumps all of my transcripts into one single Google Doc. And then I have chat GPT go and remove every speaker accepts me. So it's only my. information. And then additionally, I haven't removed any conversation I have that's personal that isn't business related, which I did test multiple times, but it's really good at that. I'd rather take out too much information than leave in personal stuff. But nobody has access to that GPT. The whole purpose of that GPT is for me to say, I remember I was talking about this one time, tell me what I said verbatim, or tell me how many times I've discussed this particular thing and what is the overall synapse, or write me a two paragraph blurb, right, about this particular thing I've talked about several times, it's really getting good. So anyway, but it just automatically pulls stuff from bathemin dumps it into a single dock, because when you do a custom GPT, you can only upload 10 documents to train it. So I didn't want to go have to combine, you know, hundreds of calls into it's already done automatically, it's been doing it since May. So that's the power of these automations and How much is it? How much is it? No, I knew you were going to ask me. have no idea. I just know that I don't see a bill that makes me freak out.
00:38:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I just pay it. Oh, is this a free plan?
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it?
00:38:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I'm left says free.
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. Yeah, two of 100 tasks.
00:38:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you manage plan and see how much it is to upgrade?
00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I can't even see that because it says edit. Change plan. Or upgrade plan. don't know.
00:38:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So you get a hundred tasks a month. Zaps. Okay. then they want you to go up to. 750 tasks from one. Oh, yeah. Okay. So this is fine.
00:38:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Unlimited premium app. So that's all the different apps that you think you could possibly connect with also.
00:38:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. All right. So maybe what I okay. Maybe what I need to do then is I need to like just get. a system for like a process down, and then I can come back and be like, okay, let's use a period automate.
00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You might actually reverse engineer. I love reverse engineering. So you, it might actually help you come up with an idea when you go, okay, so what would you like to automate? And you can see the little AI thing here, right? Hi.
00:39:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have a list. I have, I have a Google sheet with a referral date, and I want an email reminder three weeks later or something. All right, that works too. Yeah, that's it, yeah.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see what it gives us for suggestion, because you are using Gmail, right?
00:40:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:40:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're using the magic of AI to create jobs up.
00:40:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, actually, this reminds me that Esther and I had a talk because I was trying to, a couple of years ago, I was trying to do the same thing when I was visiting doctors to send to my physical clinic, and Esther was making the point that literally HubSpot and Salesforce, they were built to keep track of meetings like this. She's like, they literally recreated so that people doing sales could track their contact and tell you, like, when did you last contact, and when did you say to them, when did you email. so she's like you got it she was like get out of the mindset where one can do everything for you she's like you're at some point you're gonna have to use a CRM because that's the best thing for what you're doing yeah so there was an issue on our end okay so this literally sounds like one of those exact cases where we went over this like two three years ago with her and she's like you need to stop trying to make google sheets or everything like except that you're gonna have to use something else built on top of that so okay you guys are very smart and god gave her to you for a reason so you're proud to listen that's weird you're doing this i was like i was like man this sounds really familiar oh my god okay this is my experience i don't remember what it was but there was something i had been teaching my daughter since she could speak and she came home from it was kindergarten or or first grade i don't remember but i think it was kindergarten and she come home and she
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He said, Mom, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she was blown away by this thing. And it had been something that I had been telling her forever. And I was like, I'm invisible.
00:42:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think it.
00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that just happened on repeat with my kids constantly. OK, so let's see. We might need to simplify this. You were doing simple. I always like to test. I have a hair stuck on my face somewhere. Anyway, I always like to test the logic and what things are able to do. OK, let's see. When Google Sheet is updated, append new data. No, because when we receive an email, like that's how we want to do it. Oh, is that how you get your cases is email? Yeah, we see update Google Doc and HubSpot. If that doesn't work, then we'll just go ahead and try to click on, um, oh, uh, Z or what do you call it?
00:43:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, Oh, here it is. So the first thing I asked is that if I import Google sheet, what will happen? it's like, well, you can import your sheet and then you can make contacts, non repeated contacts out of every, you know, email address and case manager found on it. However, HubSpot will not continuously sync. They said that that process needs to be used through Zapier or you.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you would start by just go ahead and import in your spreadsheet. You could do that now where we're looking. Well, I'll look this up if you wanted to. I mean, this is a good use of time updating your system. Because that was something, as soon as you showed me your Google stuff, was like, we're going to have to get you, yes. OK, step one, new inbound email by Zapier, upload document, Google Docs, create updated, contact HubSpot. We're going to change this Google Google Sheet. Yes. OK. Oh, that was my bad, right there. Sheet. I'll take Google Sheet. Do we need the Google Sheet updated?
00:44:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Or just? Yes. So I'm using Chat TPT, but they're saying that in Zapier, I need to choose a trigger which is
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
they recommend is new spreadsheet row or that's because you did it wrong updated spreadsheet row updated spreadsheet row is possible but that's not really so this is why I say reverse engineer because the end goal is how you when you do it that's that's the easiest way to simplify it so the bottom line is you need a central location to track all of your attorneys and to have all the information that you need about it and the purpose about a spreadsheet would be to do some data and reporting where we can track how many cases we received but you probably could do that in HubSpot or also Zapier which is like a maybe I count if from Zapier like how many emails how many referrals did we get that you tracked in HubSpot you know that kind of thing so let's take that that kind of data calculations out of the picture for a minute and really what we want to know is what is the simplest system because the simpler it is, the less likely there is for error, and the more likely that if there's an error, one, we can track it, two, can fix it. Okay, so we want that as simple as possible, and that's why. So what we really want is a place that we house all of our attorneys that could be referring to us, and we want to know when the last time they sent us a referral is, and if it falls outside of this particular scope since the last one, we want to send them a follow-up message. So this recipe would be really, we don't even need the Google sheet at this point, really what you want is a zap that goes from email to HubSpot, that's it. And then potentially from HubSpot to Gmail, if you're going to send the email from your Gmail and not from HubSpot.
00:47:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, I almost think like one little, one second between that would be also just, I want to contact, create a contact card for each case manager and tie, and tie that with if either the contact or the law firm has sent me a case in the last whatever, say one month or three weeks. So it's almost like what I want is I want the sheet. So when we put up, when we enter like a new row or we update a row, and we put in a, I have a column that says date referred. So if we see a date referred, that's the date, the law firm in with that attorney or case manager, if they haven't sent us a case before.
00:48:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, hold on a second.
00:48:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's where.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You
00:50:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I asked it pretty much the same way except only to create a contact. So they said that Zapier can check if a case manager's email already exists as a contact in HubSpot. If it already exists, it will add a note in that contacts contact card mentioned in the new referral date.
00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see what this says. I don't want update my memory. Okay. Did it give you a recipe like this? Yup.
00:50:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then it says step by step. Use Google Sheets as the trigger, new, and select the trigger event.
00:50:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't see what the trigger event was for yours.
00:51:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
be new content in that spot.
00:51:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't think either one of those right. Can we have the new trigger be an email in Gmail received? I guess maybe we have you could have two different recipes and it could jump against each other so that we're not duplicating things but because some of them will already exist in HubSpot but if a new one is there then it needs to be checking Gmail so really if we're going highest level it should be checking Gmail and but one of like I think that there would have to be a manual process of this is a referral and so like if it's a new existing one. Like like a sorting, that's all I managed to do is literally all day. Yeah. So like do you add a filter to it like you know the Gmail filters like added to a folder like how how do you mark it? Yeah, that's why we have Jamelius it's a whole marking system within on top of Gmail so my manager if it's a new referral says this is a new referral and he marks it as literally says new referral and then that goes to one of my two callers who are just calling people all day and then they call that person and try to get them a day how do you spell it g g melius how do you spell it g g e m e l i u s oh not do you work with i need sorry yes blah blah blah blah I meant to say does a peer work with g melius um Let's go check the Zapier real quick. I don't specifically work with Jim Elias. does or doesn't.
00:53:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It said it didn't.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:53:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's better to have Zapier itself.
00:53:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it seems like you're mentioning tool. Jim Elias needs share of a label. Send us a request to get it added to the app directory. Request to add. Okay. Okay. Anyway, and then let's see if make.com. Tools to see if it finds anything. But it's okay. So regardless if we don't take out the existing function, your person will still do what they do. So then the Zap would be. No, it doesn't have anything. The Zap would be once we, as soon as we mark something as new referral, then, okay, let's see. We currently use currently sort all new all incoming. And we'll continue to do this once the new referral comes in, it is marked as new referral. So, the Zap would need to start by watching what you can.
00:55:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's an interesting way I could do it, too, because yeah, so we we could, I could do it that way from Gmail as well. So I could do it either I pull the contact and the referral through an email, or I could pull the contact through the sheet. So yeah, that is another way we can do it.
00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and what you could do is have it go straight from Gmail and also update the sheets and HubSpot.
00:55:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, there's So many likes, well.
00:56:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can just check this weekly, like, is it working? Did everything go, you know, and do an audit just since this would be a critical system? You know, you wanna make sure somebody's making sure it's working.
00:56:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The tricky part of that is that the schedulers, I actually have one person that does this, is they take the email and put in the person's name, date of loss, law firm name, and they enter it into that spreadsheet by hand. So there's no eff ups. Like, it drives me bonkers when that sheet is messed up. So like, I probably wouldn't trust anything to pull data from an email.
00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, that makes sense to me. And I agree with not automating something so critical. You could have that automated, but have your person know, like, your job is to scrutinize and make sure that this is all correct. It should still save time. In the meantime, what you're doing is improving your knowledge awareness and use of automation without becoming dependent upon it. so when it evolves to the point where it's so good, you don't have to watch it, you'll know, and then you can take the next step.
00:57:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I didn't even think about you could do it from Gmail. That's that's really interesting. I think I'll probably do the first one just from the spreadsheet, a new referral date triggers a zap to pull that to search that case manager's email in HubSpot, see if they have if there's an existing case manager contact by that name. Oh , you know, the other thing is, is that the people that the people that email me, the referrals, not the case manager, it's a case manager secretary, at these law firms, a case manager's directing traffic, and their secretary sends me a So I actually don't want to talk to the secretary, it's actually I want to to the case manager. So, would have to, I mean I guess some mistakes will happen, but essentially I need to, I need, and sometimes it's half and half who sends it to me.
00:58:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's a couple things that you can do. One thing is just have a person manually assign secretaries to case managers. So then you have logic, right? If it's from this person, it's again if this doesn't that right? If it comes from this person, this person, this person, it actually belongs to this case manager. Therefore respond to this case manager if we haven't received a case in 15 days, whatever. Oh, that's one reason. other one way. The other thing is similar would be like, could you create a higher article structure within HubSpot?
00:58:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because you can create.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah. where there is you have an org chart basically for each company so if you know a secretary belongs to a case manager which belongs to a company put that in there and use that logic. It's basically the same thing only if there's way to do it.
00:59:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's called association so you can for instance add a secretary as an association to the higher level case manager as long as the case manager already as a contact card you can click associate the secretary with that case manager.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean at the end of the day there's going to be some things that are human touch and that's always a big thing to make sure because it serves an audit and so what you train your team is while you're going and making these adjustments you're looking with eagle eyes to make sure everything looks the way that it should while you're there if you notice anything odd report it. Or ask just ask me or ask Paul yeah yeah. Leadaway, have a conversation with somebody other than yourself to make sure that we're inspecting this.
01:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and it is really, I'm not going to say it is, it's a little bit lazy, the data in MasterSheets is clean, but it's a little bit lazy, like that little step right there. I could make my team be like, who is the case manager and who is their secretary and put case manager and column one, secretary and column two, don't mess it up, you know.
01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so 100% you should do that. And the other thing is, we're now prepping data for, if HubSpot probably is a sufficient CRM, but let's say you didn't want to go to high level or Salesforce or anything else, you now have attached data in recognizable format, so columns, right, or specific things that could then be migrated to another CRM because it's It's in a table format or could be exported as CSV or whatever, so that is really useful because if you ever get too scalable or for any reason you want to sell it, anything else like that, the integrity and how pristine your data is, how accurate. First of all, we already know how good that is for calculations and just deciding how to operate, but also moving, adjusting, potentially selling, transferring, whatever. All of this is really, really valuable.
01:01:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you work on that, so your assignment for next week and the homework for next week is to have that process complete. There's no reason that I can think of unless you've got a really busy schedule. This shouldn't take you more than an hour or two.
01:01:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. My homework then in summary, I'm going to create, I want to at least by next week have one auto automation that helps me. make contact, a contact card in my CRM for case managers that refer to me and track when they last referred. think that's as simple as I can state what I want that automation to be.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's create contact, yep, I want to add something to that I want you to today, give your assignment to your team to track whatever we know about secretaries and case managers and make those associations in the spreadsheet so that you have it for next week. So they get a whole week to work on it and you get it next week and we can deal with that. The other thing is, it's okay if this happens next and it's not due on Monday, but have chat give you a few variations of the follow-up sequence that you can use and implement. But I think, and I want you to measure this out for yourself in terms of the kind of pace and the progress and the growth that you want. Is that a sufficient amount of homework, because we do ask?
01:03:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to do that, and then I want to keep, you know, pushing the referrals farther. So, regardless of how I do it, I still want to make another at least 10 call, remember we said hours, so two hours of calls, one hour, one day, one hour next, so I want to at least call the other phone for at least two more hours, trying to get new leads, and then I want to work on this automation as my other piece of homework to get the back end strong enough to support what I'm doing.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You also did still have some other things like contacts, it says CME, I'm not sure if that was right, or it's for CUMI, I don't know.
01:03:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so my first one guys. I was trying to find more business, yeah, someone told me no, but I have another like 10 to go, so we'll see.
01:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, um, and contact Renbaum Recooting.
01:04:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That was it. He shot me down here.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I want to get that updated you part of your homework is reporting.
01:04:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you don't report, your homework is not complete. Okay.
01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:04:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so respond to the homework email with an update to each one, our phone call or it's not complete.
01:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
right, that's that's good. So we've got the task. I will go ahead and email it to you for accountability and then, but read it today and make sure that it's accurate and that you agree to that, which creates that. That binding, but yeah, this is good. And it's still fun.
01:04:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're still liking it. Yeah, I mean, even just doing that. Puffs five and then putting it in with that manual GPT step. That was fun.
01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and if you explore a little bit with Zapier and just what I think it'll get your brain percolating a little bit more on what's possible and then make sure you go back and tell Esther she was right. We'll do. All right, because you have a great day. Wait, okay, so next week when just. Oh, yeah, let's double check and make sure moving next week. And I did remove it. We moved you to Wednesday. Did we? Yeah, it's all the clock.
01:05:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Did you accept it? Oh, yeah. Okay.
01:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, good luck next week and with all the moving and everything and with the babies.
01:05:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I babysit for you if I could.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Thanks. Yeah. Bye.
