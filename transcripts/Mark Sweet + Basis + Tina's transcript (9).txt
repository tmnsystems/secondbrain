00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000

Tina Marie: We have a.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Pain Management: I'm Yeah. It's getting busier.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Tina Marie: Tell me about it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Pain Management: I have to um record my zoom. Lean patients today because I'm in the hospital rounding.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Pain Management: So I just. Record the I need to use this AI thing that you're using.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tina Marie: It's it's called the Zoom AI companion. Do you have the paid zoom account, or free.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Pain Management: I had to pay one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it's just called AI companion and um.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Pain Management: Thank you.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Tina Marie: It should be pretty easy to set up, but if you wanted to sit and like, walk through it, or maybe I can make a a loom video for you and show you how to enable it. I can help with that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Pain Management: Oh, that would be really great cause right now what I'm doing. Well, right now, what I'm doing is I type while I talk to them.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Pain Management: And um. And if I'm in the hospital like today.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Pain Management: I just record it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Pain Management: Um, then go back to it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tina Marie: Let me set a reminder for myself, and I'll just make you a loom video to show you how to do it that way. We don't have to try to coordinate schedules. And you'll have it asap.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Pain Management: Okay, thank you. And then um.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Pain Management: A couple. I don't know if we we wanna wait with Mark. Just wanna give you the update.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Tina Marie: I think he's here.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Pain Management: Oh, you there han.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Tina Marie: Um. I think you said, yeah, Mark, but it was like, super cut off.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Pain Management: Yeah.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
iPhone: Yes, I'm here.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Pain Management: Okay.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay, let's have the update.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Pain Management: Okay. Oh, my gosh, what what happened? Huh? I feel like it's. We reach 1 13. I think you can see that, too.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Pain Management: It's the 1st time we reach past a hundred.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Pain Management: Or a hundred. We. This is the 1st time we reach a hundred. You will pass it. And.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tina Marie: Congratulations.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Pain Management: Um. Thank you. It was. It's getting. I can feel it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Pain Management: Like I can't. I know this might sound.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Pain Management: I can't. I feel like I can't procrastinate. I can't anymore.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Pain Management: I just cannot, so that, like last night I was doing it. I was. Kinda tired, and we're we um. We roll over on this new practice on Tebra.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Pain Management: So we're on a different login. I mean, it's the same login, but it's just different practice. So. So it's gonna be an adjustment.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Pain Management: Because I cannot see my. Which is good. It's separated. But it's gonna be an adjustment. There's a lot of issues already that we're thinking, for example.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Pain Management: If we schedule a patient, a leading patients for Dr. E. For procedure. The staff.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Pain Management: We'll have to go back and forth to look at this procedure. So it's a lot of hassle. So what Dr. E. And I decide to do is. If there is a procedure, patient.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Pain Management: Maria will have to do 2 charts. So it's like a little bit of double work, because the system doesn't integrate the 2 practice. It's totally separate.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Pain Management: So, which is fine.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Pain Management: But all the documentation will be done on the new practice. And.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Pain Management: We set up, we finalize the date, for like a formal. Meet and greet with this sweet James staff.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Pain Management: And we decided to do it on the 4 30 April 30.th And apparently it's gonna be 60 people there. So Dr. E. And I.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Tina Marie: Wow!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Pain Management: I told him. We have to bring. This neurosurgeon that we work with Dr. Farron and another orthopedic doctor.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Pain Management: So that way we look stronger. And so, because of that, we have time. I know you work on the flyers, but I think what I'm saying is like we have time to really.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Pain Management: Perfected.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Tina Marie: Oh, good!

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Pain Management: And have the cause. It's a month. Well.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Pain Management: It's about, and then the business cards and everything. We're gonna have a lunch catered there. Um again right now. Their biggest client.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Pain Management: And. So we really want to cater that the other day I was able to talk to 2 attorneys.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Pain Management: Based on, you know. Dr. E's like he texted me talk to them. So I did. Connect with them, and.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Pain Management: Maria and I are feeling it.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Tina Marie: Hmm.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Pain Management: Um! It's. Like from today. Yesterday we have 15. Come in.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Pain Management: Um. So we are definitely feeling it because I need her.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Pain Management: Can you? Sorry? Did you hear my GPS? Sorry about that?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Oh, no, I didn't hear your GPS at all.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Pain Management: Um. Um so.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Pain Management: Right. What am I saying? I forgot. Oh, like, for example, I need her to call the patient like Pre. It basically prepped.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Pain Management: Like ask the question. So she's the nurse. She can ask those questions like.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Pain Management: Getting the pre pre-medical history basically. Getting medical history, and then where the pains are, and everything.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Pain Management: So that way. By the time I talk to the patient I'll do mostly the assessment and the plan. And reading the Mris.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Pain Management: But while he do that. She, while she's doing that the phones are ringing.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Pain Management: So we're not gonna be, we're not able to answer the phone calls. It happened multiple times.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Pain Management: Um, and she did tell me at 1 point he's like I got overwhelmed. Like, eh? And and then for Maria to say that Maria is a strong nurse like she. This is a person that we who dealt with psychiatric patients in the hospital.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Tina Marie: Oh! Yeah.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Pain Management: So we both both of us work in the site, but more her, because she's the one. Who gets history like what she's doing now.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Pain Management: But for her to get overwhelmed because she doesn't get frazzled in that environment. But for her to tell me if you get overwhelmed it might be overwhelming. Because, you know, she, I'm helping her as much as I can like like.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Pain Management: Yesterday we have 11 patients. She was not able to help me get the Pre. OP. Like, pre medical history, like, I did everything because she's answering emails. Phone calls. Um. It's getting busier.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Pain Management: But I'm on top with my notes.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So whoa? Sorry?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Pain Management: Oh, my God, I'm so happy about it like today. Around in the hospital I get a little bit longer. But I'm charting so what I what I do now is I.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Pain Management: Hand the note for the next day.
