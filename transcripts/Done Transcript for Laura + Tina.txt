00:00:01 - Laura L
Hi Tina.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, how are you?
00:00:05 - Laura L
Doing well yourself.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good kind of all over the place, but not in pain this time.
00:00:11 - Laura L
So that's good.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You feeling better?
00:00:15 - Laura L
Yeah, feeling better now.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. It's been a couple of weeks since we've spoken.
00:00:23 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go to, no, that's the wrong one. Oh. So something that happened since the last time we spoke is that active campaign, which was what I was going to use for a CRM, like tripled their prices and have made some changes and somebody created a high level snapshot for communities that looks a lot like school. so I think that. But I think I'm not positive. may say we think Epic. I'm in the middle of conversations with clients here.
00:01:16 - Laura L
I'm sorry, looks like you're cutting out. You're back. You're cutting out.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm cutting out.
00:01:35 - Laura L
Yeah, you're back now. Oh, I did say the last.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All I said was no. I was responding to somebody. My client is trying to talk me into not thinking about the membership. site before I actually have stuff to put into it. I'm like, that's not how my brain works. I understand that logically, that's what makes sense and that's how it should be. But I want to eat home to put stuff into me, like, but you're not selling the home, you're selling the furniture, I'm like, it doesn't matter. We're not going to argue my brain is my brain is my brain is my brain. So anyway, but it's the nickname invites to use GHL rather than thinking of fake. Yes, I I'm super distracted because all these things are happening. I hate frogs. He said eat the frog. I said I hate frogs.
00:03:05 - Laura L
Do you know that book eat the frogs? No.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Anyway, so let me show you. I don't know. Oh, so yeah, let me just show your screen. My stuff. Still trying to talk me into being smart. I'm not going to do it. I don't be smart. be Tina. Okay, let's see. He's the one that showed me the snapshot. Where did I just go? Which I sleep for right here. Oh, not that company. just company it on me. Now my staff, I don't play you all right? Laurel?
00:04:08 - Laura L
Yeah. What was that? I suppose to help you with the email.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:23 - Laura L
Two, five, eight.
00:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Gmail?
00:04:27 - Laura L
Yes, correct.
00:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And settings. I want to give you a pause when you can figure that out. User permissions. I'm going to pretty much everything. we'll just give you everything for now. That way. Hopefully you, it doesn't trigger. Um, like you can, you don't need two factor authentication. for me like you don't have to yeah get a quote from me yep so let me so I don't have to go on I suppose my video that'll that'll help let me stop video there that'll hopefully will help the bandwidth can you hear me okay yeah I can hear you okay okay um yeah so um but the the thing the reason I like high level though is also because of all the texting follow up that you can do and we're really pretty much sure in this but I just started started working with another lady and we're really gonna collaborate and help each other get some stuff done so I'm excited about that I really don't have Much to report at this moment other than I wanted to tell you that I one way or another will also use high level We might use it with think epic, but I think ultimately we'll end up having a membership site here I don't have the snapshot that I want to use yet, and so I don't know but what I did see I was looking at the Let me go to Tina Maria the aisle to check out.
00:06:28 - Laura L
I wanted to try a different check out.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I don't remember where we got the Elementor checkouts. Oh, no, was funnel kit checkouts Templates Oh And I can't remember which one it was it was like simple or something
00:07:00 - Laura L
I think there's a word wordpress with a final flow. I mean, final kit you could choose from the template with the check out. Um, down in the final kit. Yeah.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All the same stuff, huh? Um, oh, minimalist. I think that was it. Let me look at this for a minute, preview. There was, oh, no, it might have been shop. Oh, this. Okay. Right. I wanted to, um, I like this because it looks kind of like Shopify using colors, but I don't know how hard it is to get Apple Pay in here also, but just being able to make this really simple where they can do and express check out. Like anything that we can do to minimize friction is good. I would need a shipping address so we could just be building a dress if we need it. And this has an order bump. So I like this one. Let me go to see the other one. Probably navigated incorrectly, but. It's. Someone called I want to see what this one does. Oh, yeah, that looks like it too. looks like Shopify. know she's. just take out shipping easily.
00:09:03 - Laura L
Check us as one, two, I think with a minimalist, we could have the option to take out bump order.
00:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I probably will have an order bump. They are very effective. Let me see. Yeah, all of these are two. Oh wait, I'm not specifically in check out what I want to be. I want to have the fastest way for them to pay and be done and I would like multiple steps because let's go with minimal and see what happens if we do three steps. We could, if we turned it to a physical product, which you can't do here, I mean a digital product, then there is no shipping. And so this would go away and it would go proceed to next step, which means we've captured some information. Let's see if we do it. One one step, no shipping, came in the information, place one now, and we can have that word above. Yeah, I would hold on to me. What's the difference between that one and this one?
00:10:35 - Laura L
Oh, yeah, the shipping address. It's on the step one.
00:10:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, if I did three steps. yeah. It's still on step one. Okay. Okay, so I do. Okay, let's see if I did this one step, now that's on there too, but it doesn't matter, so let me look at this one more time. This has an order bump, I don't know if the other one has an order bump and I'm going to do this. Check that page, one click up cell, your order is complete, here is a special offer. Okay, I like that, I didn't look at I'm here, one click up cell, that's pretty good. Let me look at that one click, up page, one click of cell. Let's show which one I like better, honestly. I think that this one would probably convert better. I'd like to see it on mobile. One more time. What I like about this is that it shows the steps.
00:13:35 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I like that there's more opportunity to sell them. More spaces for testimonials without a lot of extra work because it's already there. So I want to use the minimalist one. Okay. And four. So. what you could do is we could set up a product and the product will be, let me put it in chat. Oh no it should be, hold on, yeah what do you call it? Trello. I already have it, shouldn't have it open for us but I think we already have the these things.
00:14:28 - Laura L
I mean the product that you created for supposedly in, thank you fit, the 97.
00:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay yeah. No so what I want is a, I think we'll sell it for like seven dollars, the profit time energy maximizer so that this. So create products in funnel kit, which is profit and energy for short. Okay, it's $7 one time they will need. Let's make this a simple community in high level and see how that works. So it will be a little contained. videos, PDFs, basically, and I want to be able to have a follow-up sequence. This is for me kind of a new. I'm working on, I got to finish the script and the videos and my goal is to do that this weekend because I don't have my youngest over this weekend. We've just been so busy with Summer now, so this is like my first actual weekend without any, well, I have one daughter at home, she's almost never home, so that's fine. So follow-up So basically, like, name the sequence creates first email and it's welcome. Thank you. Thank you, here's your access and magic room. That's probably as far as my brain can go for thinking about it. Um, like what's to create at right now. But I think that that gives us a good jumping off start because, um, yeah.
00:17:26 - Laura L
Yeah, you can always add in there. If there's something comes and we'll come up, then we could always use Trello and add some paths in there.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And it's going to become kind of quick because the lady that I'm working with, she's been doing this for 20 years as well. it's just like divine that we found each other, found each other through our client. And we're both kind of like at these crossroads, but it's going to go so much faster because we are doing similar things. But we serve different audiences. And so. That will be great, but also part of what I've been doing, first of all, is figuring out the stack which we've mostly done though it's changing, and the other thing I really needed to do was figure out how I wanted to create and edit videos because I hate being on video, I feel insecure, I don't like that, but also I want the videos to go on multiple platforms and I want them to be able to look good on multiple devices and so just trying to figure out what tools help to edit the videos the quickest and help make them responsive and so that took some research so I've got all of that figured out and then I needed to have my graphics guy lined up and I had that lined up, I've got you lined up so like all my ducks have been put in a row over the summer and now I'm like ready to assemble everything on an assembly line. This is the first time I have been at this point, so remember I was saying like at the end of the summer like I'm probably going to go pretty quick. This is where it should be starting. can't imagine it going slow. is high priority, I've got all the support in place. anything else would be just excuses, and I should not do that.
00:19:14 - Laura L
Yeah, for video, I actually done videos for other clients, but it's in Canva. video page, and I mean promoting also in social media.
00:19:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to use CapCut and probably use it in combination with Descripts. I'm not sure I have to look and see AI tools, long videos to short. So the combination stack, I think I'll use and I'll put this in Trello too.
00:20:05 - Laura L
Okay.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My heck, I can't. I'm looking for this is it. Okay. So to do in progress and I'm going to, I want to create, um, a board. we're going to call this tech stock. Maybe I can't create it. Private board. Upgrade to use. Yeah, going to full. Anyway, so I'll just do this, um, video editing, um, I'll finish with cap cut. Um, and it might start here. not sure I have to make my first one, but cap cut does. Skin smoothing. So all. these high definition cameras like you know how if you take a regular picture I don't know you're very young so you might not know but regular cameras don't like highlight every single thing that's wrong on your face but high definition cameras do and so for me like that filters the just basic ones not like the crazy ones they just make you look like normal because the high definition things just pull out like every freckle every line whatever I get embarrassed I don't want that so I want just a little bit of like this moving so I don't just feel so insecure because I I feel insecure so I have to deal with that um has spinning and just lighting effects let me show you the features of it um you just you just have a lot of like really easy um no It's going to be one or the other. No, I don't want to create an account. Is it login? Yeah. It might have been T-memory systems. Yeah. It's a password. I'm saying, forgot password, reset password. OK. Kind of an email address. OK, I didn't get an account. I guess I thought I did. Anyway, leave this page. Solutions. That's video editor for Video background remover stabilization transcript. Text-to-speech AI voice generator voice changer auto captions add textivity of the effects and filters sound effects it has I don't You can add music really easily to this and then there's the script and Why I might use the script probably first Let me just grips. I just want to find it. No Is it has a I that will Features And just click on features and see everything. No So it does clip creation really good it does I contact it does green screen that removes the background If you wanted to do that for like putting branding in the back a lot of improvements here. The AI contact, so like if you're reading a script and you're not looking at the camera but looking at the camera actually has higher conversion rates, it will fix this. So for sure it's going to be these two because the scripts doesn't do skin smoothing and I look at this camera and I just look at it and I want to crawl under a rock and never put a video out ever. I want to teach people and I know that it's vain but I just feel lovely and I just have it to you. yeah, so these two things and then what was the other one I was thinking of? So there's opus clip and the script does this but I don't, I think opus might do it better. script says they do it better but if you give them a video they will just turn it into very short little reels on all kinds of different forms. And the AI will tell you, this is what this clip is about, and it will score it on an engagement level, like how engaging the content is. So they all do different things really well, and I think that I would probably use them together, and I definitely am going to want to outsource this. So if you have interest in video editing and want more work, that's potentially something that you could do. But yeah, and it will just be something else that you get to learn and know when it may not be skill that you have. If you have interest, if you don't, I can do it. I have another guy that could probably do it and has interest in it too. But anyway, so these words were my trouble again. lost it. I'm always losing trouble. Where's Trello? Do not see it. It's this one.
00:25:55 - Laura L
That does not look like Trello to me. Yeah.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The script, because AI contact, primarily, and I think it was the script that did the formatting automatic multi-cam, I don't think that was it, maybe it was CapCut, AI Tools, Products, electronics distribution, computer experience, video transitions, custom stickers, like that, video to short video, AI Relights, just had it, okay, it was one of these two, anyway that automatically changed, actually I think it was CapCut because I only Um, let's see. cat automatically adjust size of video reframing anyway it made the video super responsive depending on the device and was able to do that everywhere that you posted the video so like you know how Loom has your picture in picture and it's a little circle yeah so it did that and it might have been in the script but then the circle would get bigger or move left or right depending on what I will show you how you can create a website using 3d going objects with I was having to write and in this video we'll talk about how you can change the aspect ratio and you'll see if you can go to the website. Now, somebody had an ad and they showed it on the script in 15 minutes, that would be good. It was an upgrade to one of them and I bought it and I can't remember which one did it. I don't know why they do such a good job marketing it and then you'll be quiet. They don't tell you where to find it easily. But anyway, it was the response of this marketing business market creator. Yeah, so I'll just put this in here. One of these makes super responsive videos. I just the picture in picture and talking head size and placement so like it wouldn't move. Imagine the talking hand is over here on the left but then you go like portrait view for a phone it would move it to the top or to the bottom and then put the video that like the screen sharing part on top or on bottom. So the edge list. Yeah so like Loom won't probably let me use it now because of the camera but yeah so imagine let me change my sharing to my whole screen. Okay so you see this little thing right here. Yeah okay so imagine this is Loom and this is this zoom is my training video okay. Now imagine we're going to portrait size and phone it can make it go like this. Oops. And automatically adjust it and you can change what to do based on the screen size When you set the video, so like it's all coded in there like it's crazy. Yeah We're going go ahead dynamic placement Yes, I mean We're we're used to responsive like Reformating things but generally you don't get to change how the layout appears a whole lot You can and some of them you can drag them drop in and choose, you know, what goes where on the mobile version But you can only do that for one mobile version not for multiple formats and layouts And only for web content not for the talking head in a video So that was a pretty big deal and then Office Multiple video clips single video, multiple views, if there are split screen and multiple speakers, so it can identify papers and then create captions in those clips and AI ranking of the engagement level of content. So if you want to spend any time just looking at those and seeing if that's anything you have interested in or just want to learn for yourself, you can go in there and see what they do, but so that's the growth, that's the evolution this week is there's been shifts, so high level I really didn't want to build there because it's kind of like Frankenstein code, like it's made up of a bunch of different things. But the thing that I realized is that because so many different programmers are building for it, there's so many more options, and there's going to keep being new options like this snapshot that looks just like school, which let me show you. Gotta find the, um, and I'm trying to find messages. Yes. Let me show you this. We started recording to show people what it means to start a business. Is the wrong YouTube account, so it's not my YouTube, right? want to enter your nurtures? Okay, so first of all, they've got all this nurture sequence. Yeah, and. Structured so you can get an idea of the basis. So right here, you've got the discussion tab. This is where all the community posts. They also have leaderboards, though, like school, and you can change the levels. Um, they just have some really cool stuff. And I don't really care about school a lot, but it's familiar to people and some like it. School charges $100 per community, but they have this, like, it's a really good follow up nurture sequence and just just some automations that are built into it. But this is $1,000. So, um, I haven't bought it yet and I'm just like looking at the options. But because I'm realizing people are building stuff like this where I can just buy it and install it into high level and do it like a one time cost, where as like, if I work with, like, think if it or anything else, basically I'm limited to whatever upgrades they deem worthy, whereas in high level, any brilliant person could go create something and sell it and I can get it, you know, yeah, right, right, so and I can customize things. So I think that it just provides me more opportunity and also like I get excited about the tech stuff and that kind of energizes me and is fun. So I do want to work with it and build it in it and yeah, anyway, so identify the video tech stack decided I'm going to use high level and working with somebody else who's going to help make all of this go faster and that's pretty much it for right now.
00:34:41 - Laura L
Yeah, and I also asked for the link of that YouTube video so I could also like on.
00:34:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to drop it in zoom for you right now?
00:34:52 - Laura L
Oh yeah, sure, I could quickly grab it.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you can't copy and paste it there. Oh, I can put it also in here, video editing. Let's see, not this one.
00:35:09 - Laura L
Yeah, I got it.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Uh, yeah. Really cool things people are doing. So, um, there's not really a specific assignment other than what we have here. This creates the one thing. Oh, yeah, I create this. Um, you have any questions about this?
00:35:54 - Laura L
Um, how much? I said that. Okay, got it. And I think we have to, um, sort of. out the domain again, because it's not our I mean, oh, yeah, um, we might have to redo. Yeah, in the record.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do want to go with my old domain, which is my freedom systems, and that would not be a subdomain. But what we do need to know and what I do need you to get from Presidium is how do we configure subdomains with namecheap. Okay, don't know if that's a task. So we'll do this. Ask Presidium for how to create subdomains using as registrar. Also make sure all SSLs are set up and working.
00:37:16 - Laura L
Okay.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it for this Okay. All right. Well, then we will meet next week and just feel free to send me any questions or updates that you might have.
00:37:37 - Laura L
Okay. Sure. We'll do. I'll send you a message in Slack. would be a great.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:43 - Laura L
would be great.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if it's related to the project, like one of these tasks, put a comment in here and I don't know. Can I do? Can we tag? Yeah, we can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would actually be better because then it's. in there and with the conversation stays with the task. like breaking on the task and go like, what does she say?
00:38:06 - Laura L
Then it's right there. Yeah, we can always go back.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:38:11 - Laura L
Okay, yes, that was great.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I'll get an email notification and also I have the trouble app. So I should get a push notification as well.
00:38:20 - Laura L
Okay, that sounds great.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. I'm excited. got so much work to do, but I'm super excited.
00:38:27 - Laura L
Okay, me too.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay! Okay, I'm so glad you're feeling better. And I look forward to talking to you next week.
00:38:33 - Laura L
Okay, well, sure do.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, Nina. Thank you.
