Dan Ryan: Hello!

3
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.990
Tina Marie: And we'll turn that volume up.

4
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.289
Tina Marie: Where's my audio? There it is. How are you today?

5
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.970
Dan Ryan: Oh, it's cleaners day getting ready.

6
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.050
Dan Ryan: getting ready for the cleaners. Very important.

7
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
Tina Marie: Es muy importante.

8
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.130
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

9
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.450
Tina Marie: Oh, hold on a second!

10
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.489
Tina Marie: I don't even know what day that is. What's today is it

11
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.959
Tina Marie: may first, st it's May Day. I remember I used to go so excited about that when I was a kid.

12
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.139
Dan Ryan: The hell I didn't know it was May first.st

13
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.750
Tina Marie: Isn't it crazy?

14
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.169
Dan Ryan: Now I do.

15
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.880
Tina Marie: May 1, st 2025, Bruh.

16
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.570
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's a little bit.

17
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.829
Dan Ryan: It's a little cuckoo cuckoo with the cocoa puffs.

18
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.220
Tina Marie: Yeah. Coca pus. No.

19
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.420
Tina Marie: I've been ruined because I look at that. And I go. That's just garbage. But that's nostalgic garbage. Okay.

20
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.069
Dan Ryan: You know what you like. You don't even go in the cereal aisle anymore where we're a kid, that's you. That's the only aisle that's the 1st aisle you went to. It's like, all right.

21
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.420
Tina Marie: Literally breakfast, lunch and dinner.

22
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.340
Dan Ryan: The colored boxes that are targeted right at us. I don't know why I'm going down this aisle so much.

23
00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:35.859
Tina Marie: Cereals and sandwiches were cereal sandwich chips and pop, and that was like the whole diet right there. I wonder why we have all these health issues

24
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.009
Tina Marie: can't figure it out, Dan.

25
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.825
Tina Marie: Right?

26
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.150
Tina Marie: Okay, hold on. Where's my, where's my data window? I had it open.

27
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.449
Tina Marie: Did I close it? No, there it is.

28
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.939
Tina Marie: Did Mario go to you? Said she went to recording with you again last week? Right? Yeah. She's working for.

29
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.120
Dan Ryan: Yesterday. She's I think I think Wednesdays are gonna be her thing until the

30
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.300
Dan Ryan: the auditions are. Oh, she told me yesterday.

31
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.590
Dan Ryan: they're in May, but I forget the date. So I gave her like some

32
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.559
Dan Ryan: warm up video. And I gave her

33
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.109
Dan Ryan: like these 3 videos from this dude that

34
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.339
Dan Ryan: teach you about resonance and and.

35
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.340
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah. You told me about that last week.

36
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.180
Dan Ryan: So I gave her that stuff. She, of course, hasn't watched it yet, so we'll see. But I heard her doing the warm up video yesterday.

37
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.719
Dan Ryan: So yeah, she was in there for a little bit.

38
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.029
Dan Ryan: Then she came out and said, Give me a ride home. I was like, Okay.

39
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.330
Tina Marie: Hold on a second.

40
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.099
Tina Marie: That's good, though.

41
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.319
Tina Marie: What's the name of the play you told me? But I forgot.

42
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.280
Dan Ryan: Oh, it is Hadestown!

43
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.350
Tina Marie: Oh, I don't know anything about that.

44
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.150
Dan Ryan: Oddly, I've not seen that one.

45
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.579
Tina Marie: What's that about.

46
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.599
Dan Ryan: It is. Basically.

47
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.610
Dan Ryan: I'm not sure whose story it is exactly, but it's like a Greek mythology story set in New Orleans.

48
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.929
Dan Ryan: So all the music is like cajun-y tinged.

49
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.250
Tina Marie: Oh!

50
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.090
Dan Ryan: So

51
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:41.100
Dan Ryan: well what Greek story has Hades? Whoever goes down to Hades. Who is that? I forget? But I think it's that story. But you know, or it's based on that story, right? Except the characters are replaced by

52
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.040
Dan Ryan: I don't know. I forget, like a voodoo guy, and all that good stuff.

53
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.249
Tina Marie: Sounds like that. Actually, that sounds very much like the Princess Frog, the the frog. What is it? The Disney movie.

54
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.592
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

55
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.590
Dan Ryan: Tiana. Yeah.

56
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.790
Tina Marie: Yeah. Tiana.

57
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.379
Dan Ryan: I can't remember what it would be either.

58
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.350
Tina Marie: Princess on the frog. I think it is.

59
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.830
Dan Ryan: Something like that.

60
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.060
Tina Marie: Or the Frog Princess, anyway. Yes.

61
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.609
Tina Marie: oh, fun! But they can't call it that, of course, because Disney owns that name.

62
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.750
Dan Ryan: Well, no, this is like a this was a big musical

63
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.040
Tina Marie: Like. Been around for a long time, or something.

64
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:33.510
Dan Ryan: Within the last decade. It's touring now, right? So it if it gets off Broadway and goes on tour. That means it was good on Broadway. So it's it's a i saw it here, so it was touring

65
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.969
Dan Ryan: I've never heard of it, but my brother

66
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.049
Dan Ryan: was like, Oh, my! So my brother like

67
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.830
Dan Ryan: has for years bought them. Their birthday present is tickets to a musical.

68
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.830
Dan Ryan: So they started going when they were very young, and coincidentally. Now Mariel's really into it.

69
00:05:54.626 --> 00:06:03.109
Dan Ryan: Evelyn was. Evelyn likes to go see them. Evelyn really liked Hamilton, although I've never. I've seen it on, TV, but I never saw it live.

70
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.320
Dan Ryan: So that was one of one of them I forget who's

71
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.419
Dan Ryan: one of their birthday presents. So

72
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.710
Dan Ryan: you know, one's in October one's in May. So her Mariel's birthday present this year is musical tickets.

73
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.170
Dan Ryan: but I forget which one it is, but

74
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.610
Dan Ryan: it's it's a newer one, though.

75
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.640
Tina Marie: Nice.

76
00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:33.950
Tina Marie: So how well, actually, I would love to hear about another 71 1.st

77
00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:41.749
Dan Ryan: It's just go unsteady. So Bobby and I are. We're just talking right now.

78
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:53.570
Dan Ryan: I want to start working on Cpa exam.com. I'm like, all right, we gotta we gotta set up tracking and stuff. So the original plan was, oh, we're gonna set up a separate seg metrics account and

79
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.160
Dan Ryan: Yadda Yada Yada. And so he started working on that.

80
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.649
Dan Ryan: And today he was like, Hey.

81
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.850
Dan Ryan: what if we copy everyone when they become a lead. We put them into infusionsoft, and I was like.

82
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.409
Dan Ryan: Well, no. 1st he wanted to like connect 2 accounts to say metrics. I'm like, you can't do that.

83
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.559
Dan Ryan: And then he was like, Yeah, but chat gpt, I'm like, chat, gpt literally just makes up features for software. It's hilarious.

84
00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.629
Dan Ryan: And it sounds very true.

85
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:29.909
Dan Ryan: You're like, pretty sure it doesn't do that. Oh, you're right like, I know I'm right.

86
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.579
Dan Ryan: So Chat Gpt was telling him that you could. And then he's like, Oh, you're right, you can't.

87
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.679
Dan Ryan: So I think just now. A couple of minutes ago I was like, Oh, wait a minute. What we should do

88
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.080
Dan Ryan: sort of what we did with reset you. Not sort of. We absolutely did this.

89
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:57.759
Dan Ryan: We'd only put customers in infusionsoft, and then that was to manage the membership site. So the only people that ever end up in there are current customers. Thus

90
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.040
Dan Ryan: that account

91
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:08.410
Dan Ryan: doesn't get. You're you don't have to pay in both places like we'd have to pay in both places if we had a record in one or record another. That was just a lead.

92
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:16.669
Dan Ryan: And then I was like, yeah, man, we could actually just use activecampaign for all the nurturing and lead, and that

93
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.769
Dan Ryan: then only push the customers over there, which is what we're actually doing already for Cma.

94
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.860
Dan Ryan: And I'm like, Yeah, man, we should just do that. And then we can have one seg metrics account.

95
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.590
Dan Ryan: 1 1 active campaign and one infusion, and

96
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.600
Dan Ryan: we don't have to double up anything or move shit around crazily.

97
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.459
Dan Ryan: and then it would allow us to

98
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:47.059
Dan Ryan: take stuff that's already we can just migrate the campaigns for Ninja that are over there.

99
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.460
Dan Ryan: migrate those into active

100
00:08:49.910 --> 00:09:02.200
Dan Ryan: and then get our feet wet with stuff that's already running, and then just build out from there. And that would totally work for me, because I'll be like, okay, I'm just gonna rebuild something great.

101
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:11.689
Dan Ryan: and then I'll I'm sure I'll find what's and I'm convinced those things don't work right, anyway. So I'm like, Oh, yeah, it's like 2 birds with one stone like 3.

102
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.733
Dan Ryan: So I think that's probably what we're gonna do, starting soon here.

103
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.190
Dan Ryan: and then that will lead into doing

104
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:26.640
Dan Ryan: lead and lead magnet and nurture stuff for Cpa. Exam. And then Cma and then Cpe

105
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.069
Dan Ryan: and we'll get it. And then we've got like a hundred 90,000 contacts in there. I'm like dude. We just need to get. There's so many people we can just get rid of.

106
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.690
Tina Marie: Cool. Yeah.

107
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.569
Dan Ryan: And we might be able to do that.

108
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.450
Dan Ryan: Bring them over to Active. Send out an email, or you you want to stick around or not.

109
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.609
Dan Ryan: and then just clean the list and dump them. I mean, that's on top of the

110
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.370
Dan Ryan: 30 or 40,000 that we already have dumped into a g sheet or spreadsheet somewhere.

111
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.419
Dan Ryan: From the last time we gleaned it.

112
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.369
Tina Marie: That's wild.

113
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.030
Dan Ryan: But then, other than that, like we're, we're on track. There's a score release next

114
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.189
Dan Ryan: Wednesday, or I think it's Thursday, the 8, th

115
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:19.380
Dan Ryan: which means it'll bleed through the weekend, so sales are like a little down. But

116
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.549
Dan Ryan: they're on purpose, right? It's score release. And we just came out of

117
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:31.619
Dan Ryan: busy season, so this score release should kick off busy season, and that.

118
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.490
Tina Marie: Wild. It's already been going.

119
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.894
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.

120
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:48.640
Dan Ryan: yeah. So I like that. That was not the plan. But, as I told, just told him, I was like, let me just think about where this could be wrong. But I'm like, I actually don't see how this could be wrong. And it's actually going to

121
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.479
Dan Ryan: set the stage for then us getting off of infusionsoft

122
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.599
Dan Ryan: when I know that they're gonna implode after their acquisition.

123
00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:59.760
Tina Marie: Yeah.

124
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.949
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, they released some email editor, and everybody hates it.

125
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.220
Tina Marie: Who, that's not good, who acquired them.

126
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.899
Dan Ryan: Some company that does nearly identical shit. So I'm like, why would you keep

127
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.449
Dan Ryan: you would? They're not gonna maintain 2 softwares. They're just not.

128
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.040
Tina Marie: Right.

129
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.809
Dan Ryan: So it's going. Bye-bye.

130
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:30.890
Tina Marie: Well, and every time we've done a migration there's been loss and something breaking, and then you have to find it.

131
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:38.649
Tina Marie: But you process orders through infusionsoft or no, or will.

132
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.210
Dan Ryan: So that's another. It's like that. The the source of truth is Wu and and metric.

133
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:57.130
Dan Ryan: So none of that changes. So I'm like, yeah, we're really, we really, if we really just want better insight into emails than active campaign all day. Because I infusion sauce not going to get better.

134
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.380
Dan Ryan: And campaign is.

135
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.780
Tina Marie: And has been.

136
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.680
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

137
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.570
Tina Marie: Dots, fun.

138
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.750
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

139
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.489
Dan Ryan: Yeah. That'll keep me busy.

140
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.780
Tina Marie: Yeah. Well, we got a a nice puzzle to play with. That

141
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.859
Tina Marie: hopefully, isn't all like consuming should not be

142
00:12:23.935 --> 00:12:31.259
Tina Marie: that it's happening kind of like at the apex, though, but not really because that's not where you're processing

143
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.200
Tina Marie: orders.

144
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.310
Dan Ryan: Oh, it won't affect anything.

145
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.550
Tina Marie: That's awesome.

146
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.009
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's not gonna affect shit.

147
00:12:42.985 --> 00:12:47.730
Tina Marie: I had a question. What was it? Gonna oh, yeah, are you?

148
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.360
Tina Marie: So you have some goals you kind of like quietly already surpassed them.

149
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.100
Tina Marie: What.

150
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.129
Dan Ryan: No, I'm I'm agreeing with you.

151
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.639
Tina Marie: Yeah, but there's no like celebration or anything. Do you have anything? I mean.

152
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.460
Dan Ryan: Going to Italy, girl.

153
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:32.319
Tina Marie: I know I was thinking about that. But like that was already in place. So I feel like it's just basically taking a box because the box was there to take rather than intent of like. This is about celebrating. But I guess it kind of was just like, you know what the celebration is, we've got the freedom to do whatever we want to, and it's kind of like ongoing like that could be a way of looking at it, I guess, but.

154
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.570
Dan Ryan: I don't know.

155
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.639
Tina Marie: Have a significant goal to have met and.

156
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.079
Dan Ryan: I feel like.

157
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.679
Dan Ryan: But I mean, here's the thing right. The goal was set.

158
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.750
Dan Ryan: I feel like I didn't. It's sort of like I didn't even really do it.

159
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.780
Dan Ryan: So it's like, of course it worked. I'm like, I I knew it was going to work.

160
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.930
Dan Ryan: I just didn't know to what degree, and we still don't know, like we really won't know until the end of

161
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.740
Dan Ryan: middle of September.

162
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:12.440
Dan Ryan: middle of September will tell us what really is going on, because then we can absolutely predict what's gonna happen for the rest of the year.

163
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:20.720
Dan Ryan: so if, like, we get to 5,000, so it looks like we should get to over 5,000 subscribers by the end of the summer.

164
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.199
Dan Ryan: And that's like 5,000. And they're gonna stick.

165
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.700
Dan Ryan: Yeah, we've gotten over 5,000 in the past, but it doesn't stick. This is gonna be like the new normal will be

166
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.350
Dan Ryan: 5,000 active subscribers.

167
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.850
Dan Ryan: And then where it goes from there. Right? So then, if we start doing this other stuff now

168
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:50.440
Dan Ryan: during the high season, and then it's as long as it's rolling and tracking great by literally January.

169
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.640
Dan Ryan: It's like, then you roll into 2026,

170
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.109
Dan Ryan: and you're like, you've got a really well oiled machine.

171
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.350
Dan Ryan: And it's like, Yeah, I don't know where it will go

172
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.610
Dan Ryan: after that. But then you could. You might be able to set

173
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.050
Dan Ryan: new targets right. You can't even set new targets now, because

174
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.449
Dan Ryan: to your point, the targets that were set will be surpassed.

175
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.240
Dan Ryan: So it's like

176
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:23.400
Dan Ryan: I can't set a quarterly goal right now, because I don't know how to set it, and

177
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.019
Dan Ryan: I know and I can't.

178
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.640
Dan Ryan: And

179
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.099
Dan Ryan: I'm not. Gonna I already know I'm not. Gonna I mean, like, Jeff doesn't even show up to the Monday meetings.

180
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.419
Dan Ryan: And he doesn't.

181
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.025
Dan Ryan: Yeah. It doesn't even matter. It's like.

182
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.879
Dan Ryan: and he's he's. I don't know if I told you this, but he's like he was gonna go. He dropped this bomb.

183
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.209
Dan Ryan: It was really a bomb. It was. It was like a half a bomb. I was like, wait what

184
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:56.070
Dan Ryan: he was saying, how unbeknownst to us he and Josie were looking to move to Florida

185
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.689
Dan Ryan: so that he could go to Seminary.

186
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.200
Tina Marie: Whoa!

187
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.249
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And I was like, what?

188
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:17.270
Dan Ryan: But I thought, what he was saying is, they were doing that. And I was like, Oh, shit. What? Okay, that's interesting. And then the story. As the story proceeded, it was that they had been looking at it. And then they realized, like, it's just not

189
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:24.449
Dan Ryan: feasible. You're less house. You're not going to get all the land. You're not going to get all the house.

190
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.079
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, for sure. Forward is expensive.

191
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.629
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And it was just like, and then it was like, you're gonna uproot 9 kids or whatever. And.

192
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.649
Tina Marie: And Hello! Hurricanes!

193
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.800
Dan Ryan: Yeah. And it was. And it was like, I forget where in Florida not a popular place.

194
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.114
Dan Ryan: So then he was like the. So then they decided not to do it.

195
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.419
Dan Ryan: But I guess they started to tell the kids the same story like they were telling us.

196
00:16:52.880 --> 00:17:03.260
Dan Ryan: and like he was telling us, and the kids had the same reaction that Bobby and I had like, wait what? You're we're moving to Florida, and I guess her daughter just lost it. They're like, no, no, no, we're not moving.

197
00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:10.230
Tina Marie: You went through this. You know exactly how that goes. Huh?

198
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.679
Dan Ryan: Yeah, so he is doing it.

199
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.140
Tina Marie: Who.

200
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.049
Dan Ryan: So he's now he's in seminary.

201
00:17:16.974 --> 00:17:19.099
Dan Ryan: So like, and it's very.

202
00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:20.069
Tina Marie: Not moving.

203
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.689
Dan Ryan: But not moving.

204
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.551
Tina Marie: Okay, cause you're just like he's doing it. I'm like, Wait, Dan.

205
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.559
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. So so it's very time consuming. It's like going back to school.

206
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.820
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

207
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.170
Dan Ryan: Do you.

208
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:30.489
Tina Marie: Going back.

209
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:38.710
Dan Ryan: Only working on Ninja like 50% of the time, he says which he is. I mean, I we see him doing stuff.

210
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.570
Dan Ryan: and then he shows up to like every other meeting right now, which is fine.

211
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.920
Dan Ryan: and because he's like he's all in on selling it.

212
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.090
Dan Ryan: He's like I want to sell it in like 3 or 4 years. And then I'm gonna

213
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.380
Dan Ryan: be a preacher.

214
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.074
Dan Ryan: And I was like, Okay, let's do that.

215
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.007
Tina Marie: That's so wild.

216
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.770
Tina Marie: You got like super religious people sandwiched around you.

217
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.700
Dan Ryan: I do?

218
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:14.260
Tina Marie: Got my got my mission, but then you've also got you know your your I don't know. I would call them spiritual, probably the

219
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:29.649
Tina Marie: which is the one which and the whatever thing. But to me that's that's I don't know. People might call it different things, but I would say, That's spirit spiritual, or what do you call it? Like? Mysticism? Kind of thing.

220
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.066
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Woo, woo.

221
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:40.569
Tina Marie: Well, yeah, it's all connected, though you know, we label it differently. But it's all so similar.

222
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:50.400
Tina Marie: Honestly, I think the only delineator I really ever care about is intense. Like people want to go, do dark things dark, meaning

223
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.579
Tina Marie: sell out yourself or someone else right?

224
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.879
Tina Marie: And her whatever like, not care about the consequences of other people to me that's dark.

225
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.090
Tina Marie: But

226
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:09.680
Tina Marie: if it's not that, I don't really care what the label is like, you know, there's many paths to similar destinations.

227
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.359
Tina Marie: But that's a that's a big, that's a big thing. But didn't he?

228
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:22.240
Tina Marie: Didn't he have some kind of path like that before? I feel like I thought you told me.

229
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.060
Dan Ryan: No.

230
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.870
Tina Marie: Fine.

231
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:31.649
Dan Ryan: No, no, definitely not like this, like he, I mean, he's they're very religious. And he

232
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.530
Dan Ryan: they switched churches not too long ago.

233
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:43.670
Dan Ryan: But no, he, I don't think so. I don't think he ever considered this before didn't sound familiar.

234
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:55.560
Tina Marie: Interesting. Interesting. Okay? So anyway, goals, though, and rewards for goals or celebrations, I mean

235
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.910
Tina Marie: it. What? Whatever I just like at the very least acknowledging and celebrating

236
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:13.570
Tina Marie: internally. And one of the biggest reasons I think about it for you specifically, is because

237
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.020
Tina Marie: I feel like you're like, almost

238
00:20:17.723 --> 00:20:23.879
Tina Marie: intentionally detached with things right like I don't get excited. But whatever

239
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:31.539
Tina Marie: and it's not a right or wrong thing. But I just want I just want you to at least consider like.

240
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.390
Tina Marie: Do you really acknowledge what

241
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:53.199
Tina Marie: has happened because of your effort? Now it's it's group effort for sure. But it would not happen without you. You are the mastermind behind it, the conductor. Right? All of this is because

242
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.480
Tina Marie: architect, like all these different names,

243
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:13.950
Tina Marie: and it created it, has created freedom, powerful ability to choose for families, not just Jeff, U.

244
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:28.509
Tina Marie: Bobby, Eric, Norio. Everyone that works there regularly. They get to have a cool, easy job. Cool, easy people.

245
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.770
Tina Marie: good money coming in because of you, hey?

246
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:41.629
Tina Marie: And I don't. You know. I people want to be like, you know. I don't want to be egotistical, arrogant, whatever. Okay? But

247
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:50.645
Tina Marie: we also should understand what we bring to the table and know our worth for multiple reasons. Number one. Just

248
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:56.869
Tina Marie: that's that's a heavy load, even if it doesn't feel heavy because you just got broad shoulders right.

249
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:06.999
Tina Marie: But I don't know. I just think it's important. Do you ever really think about that in a

250
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.829
Tina Marie: hey? I've done this for people thing.

251
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.270
Dan Ryan: No.

252
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.669
Tina Marie: How, how does it feel when I said that.

253
00:22:17.623 --> 00:22:20.530
Dan Ryan: I mean, I'm aware of it, but I don't.

254
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.549
Dan Ryan: I think that I mean, I think part of my issue

255
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.520
Dan Ryan: right or just the way I operate.

256
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:40.110
Dan Ryan: for whatever reason or had learned to operate is like, I don't expectations of other people, and

257
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.730
Dan Ryan: I say this all the time. I am not doing this out of altruism.

258
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.660
Tina Marie: Yeah, so it's like.

259
00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.370
Dan Ryan: You know, like I recognize that, Bud.

260
00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:04.279
Dan Ryan: It's I'm getting what I want out of it. So that's the only reward I need, or the only you know what I mean. It's like I don't really care.

261
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.400
Dan Ryan: I'm well aware of it.

262
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.959
Dan Ryan: And I think that if I

263
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.520
Dan Ryan: I don't want to like, look at that, and then be like.

264
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:20.079
Dan Ryan: I think some people would look at that and then be like you. Should you know, then, then, that person should be doing

265
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.310
Dan Ryan: this, that or the other thing right. I think people can get caught up in

266
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.909
Dan Ryan: that effect like I'm glad.

267
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.020
Tina Marie: Yeah, that's not what I'm going at, though.

268
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:34.229
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know you're. I'm just saying that I'm just saying that like I think you open up that door if you sort of.

269
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.900
Dan Ryan: Have I reflected on it? Yes.

270
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.030
Dan Ryan: Do I think it's great? Totally

271
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.877
Dan Ryan: do I pat myself on the back for it? No.

272
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.079
Dan Ryan: I'm I'm glad that I can do that.

273
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.999
Dan Ryan: It was never my goal. I never set out like I've I've been around people that are like

274
00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:01.219
Dan Ryan: have said, shit like that. They're like, you know, I'm gonna change these people's lives. And when I hear them say that I'm like.

275
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.350
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah.

276
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.499
Dan Ryan: Sound like an idiot.

277
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.850
Dan Ryan: So yeah, I mean, it is great.

278
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.720
Dan Ryan: But

279
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:17.789
Dan Ryan: it really just boils down to right. I just want to do cool things with cool people, I mean, that's and

280
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:25.050
Dan Ryan: I hope that they appreciate it. I mean, I actually don't hope that they appreciate it. I mean.

281
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:38.050
Tina Marie: No, that's that wasn't even the goal. It. It comes to the fact. Like to me. It is a cool thing to be able to give that to people, and it doesn't matter if they even know it or are aware of it, just knowing that.

282
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:50.319
Tina Marie: And it doesn't matter. Also that that wasn't your goal. I don't believe anything is altruistic. I don't think it's possible, because anybody with any kind of awareness knows

283
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:59.179
Tina Marie: subconsciously or consciously, but to some level, always somewhat consciously, that if you do something for someone else.

284
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.779
Tina Marie: the law of reciprocity, like kicks in right, they

285
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:13.449
Tina Marie: feel like they owe you something, or either way, that you're going to get something back. Let's say you do something to make somebody smile, well

286
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:25.760
Tina Marie: knowing that you made somebody smile, gives you energy confidence like if you're an egotistical kind of person, right? Like I did that to them. That kind of right. There's always some kind of return.

287
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.110
Tina Marie: So. And you know that ahead of time.

288
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:35.110
Tina Marie: so can anything be altruistic like? I don't even think it's possible. Do you know what I mean?

289
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.787
Dan Ryan: Right? Well, yeah, there's like Martin.

290
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.979
Dan Ryan: what's his name? Friedman the Economist.

291
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.150
Dan Ryan: There's like a great quote or clip of him

292
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.229
Dan Ryan: where he's he's it's it's in like the eighties.

293
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.090
Dan Ryan: And and they're

294
00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:01.439
Dan Ryan: he's on like Donahue or something. And they're talking about Donahue's like these greedy corporations. And he goes.

295
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.139
Dan Ryan: Who amongst us isn't greedy

296
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:14.610
Dan Ryan: right? And then his description of greed shows it is like, Yeah, you're greedy for a better life. You're greedy, for, like greed can be good.

297
00:26:15.444 --> 00:26:22.329
Dan Ryan: And it's it's an interesting take on it. Not not like the Wall Street. Greed is good or whatever, but.

298
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:22.730
Tina Marie: Right.

299
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:30.160
Dan Ryan: Shows how they're wrong. Like, yeah, we you know people, the the you know.

300
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:42.690
Dan Ryan: you could look at like the invention of light bulb. That was him being greedy, he was being greedy to. He wanted to do this thing. It was for him. And then it just ended up being for everyone.

301
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.860
Dan Ryan: So yeah, I think you can do that.

302
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.699
Tina Marie: He, he! He and Ayn Rand would get along. Probably. Huh!

303
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.580
Tina Marie: I'm looking him up. Looks like Milton Friedman.

304
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.200
Dan Ryan: That's it. Yeah, he's he's awesome.

305
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.180
Tina Marie: I've never heard of him before. No.

306
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.539
Dan Ryan: God, he's great! He's like he's like the best economist him in Seoul.

307
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.079
Tina Marie: Soul! Oh, Thomas!

308
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.449
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

309
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:13.049
Tina Marie: I see his picture people other people also search for. Well, now, I have some people to go look up and read.

310
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.389
Tina Marie: Interesting Adam Smith. That's an old.

311
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.510
Tina Marie: It looks like he looks kind of George Washington-ish.

312
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.970
Dan Ryan: Oh, yeah, he's super up. Yeah.

313
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.060
Tina Marie: So all right, I got. I got some stuff to read. That's cool.

314
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.110
Tina Marie: So back to.

315
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.350
Dan Ryan: You see around the globe.

316
00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.923
Tina Marie: What I was like. Wait, that's not me right. I didn't click on anything.

317
00:27:38.585 --> 00:27:42.840
Tina Marie: Just goals and celebrations. But

318
00:27:42.960 --> 00:28:02.219
Tina Marie: so you one thing you did say, though, was that you're you are glad that you can do that, and then but it's not the thing. But that gladness, I guess, is really kind of like what I'm going for. So in terms of it's allergy season man. But actually

319
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.309
Tina Marie: okay, you want to go into a woo-woo hole. Life wave patches.

320
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.460
Tina Marie: These things are crazy. It's phototherapy. There's nothing transdermal.

321
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.980
Tina Marie: They have different elements that reflect

322
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:26.230
Tina Marie: specific wave lengths of light back into the body when it, you know, exits out the scan and said it reflects it back, and somehow

323
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:49.240
Tina Marie: some of them, and at certain acupressure points helps you regenerate or helps you generate new stem cells helps. One. Does the production of glutathione, another one of carnosine. Like all these different things, my little girl and I both have terrible sleep like for years I didn't have any rem sleep or deep sleep.

324
00:28:49.620 --> 00:29:02.289
Tina Marie: just like years. I didn't dream I did not dream. I thought it was crazy. I'm like I must just not remember it, but according to my apple watch, I never went into rem sleep, so I wasn't even dreaming.

325
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:15.689
Tina Marie: And I was able to improve that a little while ago. But after we've I've only been using this for about like 2 and a half weeks. Dude I have I? So I would wake up probably every 5 min.

326
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.520
Tina Marie: using what they're called life wave patterns.

327
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.960
Dan Ryan: Oh, okay. Gotcha.

328
00:29:22.062 --> 00:29:25.630
Tina Marie: I'll send you a link. But they

329
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:41.469
Tina Marie: anyway, I've been sleeping. So I woke up laughing out loud the other night from a drain like. That's how vivid they are, and and but instead of waking up every 5 min, I probably wake up 2 or 3 times a night.

330
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:46.390
Tina Marie: and it takes me, you know, maybe like 10 min to go back to sleep. But then I'm asleep for hours.

331
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:52.150
Tina Marie: and it's amazing. Anyway, I don't even know when I get there. Woo! Woo! What was I talking about?

332
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.010
Dan Ryan: Oh, cool woo all day.

333
00:29:56.676 --> 00:30:01.270
Tina Marie: Talking about being glad, anyway.

334
00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:08.320
Tina Marie: Yeah, just that's that's all I was looking at is just being glad for the things that

335
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:15.340
Tina Marie: basically having some joy in your work from the different aspects of it. Right? So cool people.

336
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:31.020
Tina Marie: cool things, the freedom that you have you get to do music. But also it's an element of it, right that you do get to create something that helps other people and other families get to do cool things with cool people, too.

337
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:42.309
Tina Marie: and if you're not taking like credit for all of that, because it's not just you, it's everybody right. You can only do so much all by yourself. You're a facilitator.

338
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:51.330
Tina Marie: It wouldn't exist without you, but it wouldn't exist to the level it does with without them, either. Right?

339
00:30:52.090 --> 00:31:00.119
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's it's like, there's a compounding effect. But and that's based on, you know, the the

340
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:07.790
Dan Ryan: the real trick is the idea. Right. Well, that was the that was the realization I had like. Oh, it all! It all just comes down to the idea.

341
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.670
Tina Marie: - execution?

342
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.719
Tina Marie: No, no, no, no. Like for me. It's like I, it needs to be my idea.

343
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.270
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm like, ideas are a dime a dozen. But yes, if it's your idea, it's not, but also.

344
00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.500
Dan Ryan: Right and.

345
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.379
Tina Marie: Because people can't execute, and you can do both.

346
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:29.639
Dan Ryan: Well, yeah, and they're a dime a dozen, and they're off. Oftentimes the ideas wrong.

347
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.420
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it's it's like with with wolfer. Right? Like

348
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:44.630
Dan Ryan: they came to me with that, like, they picked the niche. They picked the model. Yeah, they copied the model that I was using

349
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.790
Dan Ryan: which made sense to me like, Oh, yeah, I know that model.

350
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:56.219
Dan Ryan: But I don't know if I ever told you this, but at some point I and it was later in the game.

351
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.860
Dan Ryan: like last summer, or something.

352
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.060
Dan Ryan: So at some point I took a step back and was like.

353
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.099
Dan Ryan: Okay, what? What would I do?

354
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:16.170
Dan Ryan: What would my idea be like? I'm not saying that like this isn't my idea. I don't know that I would have gone down this path.

355
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.049
Dan Ryan: If I go look at this now.

356
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.999
Dan Ryan: Would I have chosen this path? And the answer was No.

357
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:33.869
Dan Ryan: and I figured out a totally different model for them that would have absolutely fucking, crushed like crushed.

358
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.170
Dan Ryan: And I was like, Oh, oh, this is what I would have done.

359
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:48.139
Dan Ryan: and I just never told them, because I was like, we're not doing it like, I don't want to work with these people. I don't. I don't want to do this I like, but it was interesting to look at it and go.

360
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:54.679
Dan Ryan: O, that's interesting, like they're they just picked the wrong model

361
00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:02.979
Dan Ryan: for what they were doing like for the volume of leads, and what their conversion rate was, and all this stuff, but they never, I mean they were never looking at it like that

362
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.489
Dan Ryan: model would have been like giving away

363
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.080
Dan Ryan: free websites and then putting people into

364
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:22.719
Dan Ryan: like a circle community and then giving them the whole free website thing. And then you get a piece. It's just a huge affiliate play. And then you get a piece of every registry thing that happens, it's

365
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.809
Dan Ryan: gazillions of dollars. But

366
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:39.789
Dan Ryan: I'm like, Oh, yeah, we could build that. Actually, it wasn't circle. It was something else. It was this other software. I even ran it by Norio. I was like, Hey could look at this really quick, and he confirmed what I was thinking. He's like, yeah, we could do that. And I was like, Oh, damn

367
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.365
Dan Ryan: yeah.

368
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.400
Tina Marie: Oh!

369
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:53.730
Dan Ryan: Same thing with like Glenn like that was never my idea. When we finally did my version, and I never said this to him. My version.

370
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.299
Dan Ryan: It was interesting that he want. He started having

371
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:05.009
Dan Ryan: issues when it came time to try my version. That's what I thought was ironic. I was like, really.

372
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.440
Tina Marie: Like, what did you hire me for, like.

373
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:06.790
Dan Ryan: We can'.

374
00:34:06.954 --> 00:34:07.610
Tina Marie: With me for it.

375
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:13.270
Dan Ryan: Mine worked like we did a soft launch, and people bought it, and they stuck.

376
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:20.310
Dan Ryan: and I just I never showed him I was like. Well, I'm not even going to bother showing him cause it. At that point I already left.

377
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.350
Tina Marie: Yeah.

378
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:29.296
Dan Ryan: In that same month, like we rolled out something in January, and they they stuck for a couple of months. So I was like, Oh, this actually worked.

379
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.779
Tina Marie: Which is average for subscribers couple of months. Yeah.

380
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.489
Dan Ryan: And it was just a matter of like figuring out the offer. But the the issue ahead. They torched

381
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.189
Dan Ryan: the email account. So that that was. It was never work.

382
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.980
Tina Marie: Yeah, I forgot that part.

383
00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.269
Dan Ryan: Also it's like he.

384
00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:54.629
Dan Ryan: His thing was like he pretended, like he didn't want to be in control, but he totally did.

385
00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:03.309
Tina Marie: Yeah, yes, that that's just him. Period to a T.

386
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.810
Tina Marie: Yeah.

387
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.679
Tina Marie: Let's see.

388
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:19.749
Tina Marie: mark yesterday put out a demand for a 3 million dollar settlement. It hasn't been accepted yet, but he is hoping to get it. It's also one of Lorenz's cases.

389
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.959
Tina Marie: But when.

390
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.760
Dan Ryan: Importantly, who's the lead source?

391
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:32.520
Tina Marie: Yes, also, we still need to do the whale math. So after you had to go on a call like a couple of weeks ago. I think it was.

392
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.150
Dan Ryan: He didn't want to do it. Does he want to do it now?

393
00:35:35.150 --> 00:36:03.169
Tina Marie: No, yeah. But okay. So we have that conversation. And then you went to your call and he stayed on. I said, Can we just go look and lidify real quick. And so we did start to do it. But the report that we needed wasn't right, and he said he'd go look at that. So I just messaged him to check again. I'm like we really need to do this math, because, like it seems like the whale volume is picking up. But I don't know if it's just corollary, right? Because we're getting more cases. He's at 105 for

394
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.340
Tina Marie: in April.

395
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.419
Dan Ryan: Interesting because it is not his high season.

396
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.340
Tina Marie: Right?

397
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:19.209
Tina Marie: Right? Yeah. And he. So he's doubling. Walker.

398
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.150
Tina Marie: Colorado opens up. Hold on, he said. One more thing.

399
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:34.820
Tina Marie: What's the other thing? Oh, and Salko is having them try a group that worked well for Mass Torts.

400
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.120
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I set that up.

401
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.820
Dan Ryan: I actually introduced soccer to those guys.

402
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.890
Tina Marie: Well, finally, get in the loop.

403
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.150
Dan Ryan: I never heard him. I forgot the other guy's name.

404
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.163
Tina Marie: Yeah. So

405
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:54.060
Tina Marie: combining all of that stuff should be interesting to see what happens over the next few months.

406
00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.940
Dan Ryan: What's up with Josh? Did he? Did his little sidekick ever take over that project?

407
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.870
Tina Marie: I never reached out to him.

408
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.330
Dan Ryan: Good job. Tina.

409
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.470
Tina Marie: I know. Right?

410
00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:08.990
Tina Marie: Okay, football there, and.

411
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.550
Dan Ryan: Dashboards are gonna come back to bite us in the ass, or the lack thereof.

412
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:19.070
Tina Marie: Yeah, that is part of my goal is just to look into it myself, because having to go to other people like

413
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.580
Tina Marie: you don't even bother. Don't even bother.

414
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.129
Tina Marie: It's wait! Don't bother what.

415
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.420
Dan Ryan: Looking into it yourself. It is an absolute shit show.

416
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.790
Tina Marie: Well, the thing is, we have the foundation. We only need tweaks to what we already have. I think.

417
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.999
Dan Ryan: It's way more complicated than it appears.

418
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.149
Tina Marie: Oh, alright! Then.

419
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:46.310
Dan Ryan: When he started doing it. I was like, Wait, what? Like what he was now, Isaac, that that was.

420
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.250
Tina Marie: My other thought.

421
00:37:47.250 --> 00:38:03.020
Dan Ryan: Isaac did go through the certification. I believe that Josh, so Josh's whole thing was like, I would like to set you up so that someone there could take it over. That's sort of what he wanted. So the play might be to have his guy finish it and then have Isaac take over

422
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.440
Dan Ryan: because Isaac is definitely better at it now.

423
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:13.250
Dan Ryan: And I think he did, Josh said. This is the only course I took.

424
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.780
Dan Ryan: and he was like, and I was like Mark buy it. It was like 200 bucks.

425
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.140
Tina Marie: Let me. I'm emailing Isaac real quick.

426
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:35.819
Dan Ryan: But maybe, like Isaac and that dude could work together so that Isaac gets some hand holding, and or just is all like watching it go down

427
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.199
Dan Ryan: so it's like, then the baton gets handed over.

428
00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.300
Dan Ryan: But I don't know that Isaac's ever built any reports like that like those.

429
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.110
Dan Ryan: I've certainly never asked them to do it.

430
00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.500
Tina Marie: Let me. CC. Mark, I guess Mark and Dan keep going in the loop.

431
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.680
Tina Marie: okay.

432
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:35.739
Tina Marie: Oh, there's Mark's April numbers 106 incidents, 133 cases. Oh, by the way, and I totally slept on. This didn't even notice

433
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:41.839
Tina Marie: that. And it's because of the way that he breaks it up. But there is a total.

434
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:49.479
Tina Marie: Well, he said, there was. Yeah, this is oh, there it is, Missouri. 17 cases in Missouri.

435
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:51.820
Dan Ryan: Nice.

436
00:40:52.760 --> 00:41:00.800
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean, because I was all thinking that Missouri was doing terrible the way that he makes everything sound. But Missouri beat New Mexico and.

437
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.799
Dan Ryan: Getting something wrong without just speaking on a motion of did he feel that there weren't going to be.

438
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:25.109
Tina Marie: What? Yes, and I made the mistake of paying attention to whatever he said, but also, if there is so much to have to talk about the there is. His business is not tiny, there's a lot to it, and his 1 HA week is just not enough.

439
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.710
Tina Marie: anyway.

440
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:32.150
Tina Marie: But whatever does what we does. And it does grow.

441
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.090
Tina Marie: Yeah.

442
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.010
Dan Ryan: I mean, I just even on last Monday I was like.

443
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.000
Dan Ryan: I didn't know 2 Mondays ago. I was like, do you have? I don't believe them

444
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:49.490
Dan Ryan: when I was like, do you have goals set up like, is this based on anything he's like, yeah. And I'm like, I don't believe you.

445
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.270
Tina Marie: No.

446
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:56.539
Dan Ryan: I believe you're telling me what I want to hear. But wouldn't it be better that it was known to the group?

447
00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:18.939
Dan Ryan: And then, right like you can do. Not necessarily like an Eos call itself right. But it's like that sort of structure where you just go. There's a structure to the call. It's like, okay. 1st and foremost, the numbers which we kind of do right? And then it's like, Okay, this is the shit from last week on the call. Did this get done right?

448
00:42:19.983 --> 00:42:22.669
Dan Ryan: Cause there's like sometimes he does stuff.

449
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.429
Dan Ryan: and you have no idea but that. And then that's the whole thing I'm like.

450
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:33.230
Dan Ryan: what is Tina's role really like? You're not the Ops guy like Bobby is for me right? So it's like

451
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:42.269
Dan Ryan: he doesn't like. I don't. Did he, were you you weren't involved in? I knew about these new vendors because he's emailing me, me and Eric directly.

452
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:50.719
Dan Ryan: So it's like, Okay, but it's a. And then we made like the the landing pages we talked about on the call, right? So that

453
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:58.729
Dan Ryan: was like a task that came from the call. But then that turned into oh, they they wanted a Spanish landing page. So it turned into another task.

454
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.539
Tina Marie: Right, and I've asked repeatedly to be looped in on that stuff so.

455
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.580
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So I'm like, there's no like, it's not.

456
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:11.449
Dan Ryan: It's it's fragmented. I don't know that it needs to be not fragmented.

457
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:22.581
Dan Ryan: But then it goes back to what I said like 5 weeks ago, where I was like, you need an Ops person like you need to start looking at it from that sort of vantage point.

458
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.270
Dan Ryan: And he seems to think the out person needs to be a lawyer, and I was like, I don't know why you would think that.

459
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.630
Tina Marie: No, it doesn't.

460
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.180
Dan Ryan: They do not.

461
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.580
Tina Marie: Well.

462
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.690
Dan Ryan: Lawyer, thing.

463
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:32.150
Tina Marie: July.

464
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.300
Dan Ryan: Operations.

465
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.240
Tina Marie: There's a lot coinciding. So mark

466
00:43:38.232 --> 00:43:51.139
Tina Marie: part of the reason to not that that I haven't really trying to like compel Mark into structure is, he just resisted too much, and I'm a i i won't work at it harder than you do. Kind of person.

467
00:43:51.843 --> 00:44:05.030
Tina Marie: That's 1 aspect of it, but there's always so many other things going on that makes him emotionally volatile, and like I said so much to cover in a short amount of time, and part of what I also do is like

468
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:17.530
Tina Marie: head check right? And that takes some time, and it takes probing which goes off the rails. So there. I'm serving a function that isn't the typical type of thing, and it requires

469
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:25.780
Tina Marie: less structure. And so those 2 are almost kind of opposition opposing roles.

470
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:30.569
Dan Ryan: It should not be happening right? That's the back to what we talked about way back in the day.

471
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.090
Dan Ryan: So what he's been in this entire time.

472
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.769
Dan Ryan: For lack of a better phrase, I'll use. My terminology is level. 11 meetings.

473
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.880
Dan Ryan: You're right.

474
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.520
Dan Ryan: He needs a level 10. The level 10 is what's the business only.

475
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:57.379
Tina Marie: I think we're coming into that. So the other things, though that have been going on, is all this stuff which? Well, okay, his Dad, his dog Chona, these things that have been going through, and now his back.

476
00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:05.979
Tina Marie: like he doesn't talk about it as much, but he is in pain all day every day he's been going and getting treatments regularly.

477
00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.149
Dan Ryan: What's wrong with this back.

478
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:12.299
Tina Marie: Depressed by it. He has got a degenerative disc disease.

479
00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:15.120
Dan Ryan: That's true.

480
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.750
Tina Marie: Yeah.

481
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.170
Dan Ryan: I mean I don't know.

482
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.210
Dan Ryan: Well.

483
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:30.729
Tina Marie: Okay with regardless. That's what the diagnosis was that he got from the doctor, and he's in extreme pain. And he has been, and he goes, and he gets injections every other week, I think and tomorrow.

484
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.390
Dan Ryan: Cortisol, or cortisol.

485
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.980
Tina Marie: No no peptides

486
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:37.010
Dan Ryan: Oh, to. To yeah.

487
00:45:37.010 --> 00:46:00.540
Tina Marie: Yes, yes, so. And and then he's been trying to reduce his movement. So all the fun things he was doing, he's not doing anymore. He's done some of them, but not the thing. When he was happiest and being most productive, he was not doing it with Chona. He wasn't doing with work. He was actually like having friends and going and doing some stuff for the 1st time, and that stopped because his pain.

488
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:08.770
Tina Marie: So tomorrow he's supposed to go find out. Has he been actually healing because he doesn't want to go to surgery and

489
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.620
Tina Marie: no

490
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:18.299
Tina Marie: surgery? It doesn't even matter even if they do say, that's what you need. That's not what he should do. But he's been holding himself back

491
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:23.120
Tina Marie: from going and doing things because he's trying to like create healing in his back

492
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:33.140
Tina Marie: and anyway. So again, when you stock all of these things, Dad dog Jonah back

493
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:44.390
Tina Marie: and freaking the stuff with Lorenz. Yeah. And but that's that's minor. Anyway, there's a lot. But in that

494
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:53.930
Tina Marie: he he has. Still he does consistently show up, and I'll it. It isn't consistently day to day.

495
00:46:54.773 --> 00:47:03.039
Tina Marie: And it isn't consistently across all the things, though that doesn't exist but week over week

496
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:15.760
Tina Marie: there are, because he's always messaging on signal. Tona does, like everyone else, pretty much, messages me regularly on signal and tells me updates things that are happening.

497
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:22.006
Tina Marie: So I know that he's doing things

498
00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:43.359
Tina Marie: But he does need the Ops person, and it's just becoming more and more clear. And you know, what's funny is everybody that like I end up talking to related to him. They're like, we don't have mark money like I don't. I don't know how much he has. I don't I? What the reference point is because I don't think the you know the profit margin.

499
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.650
Dan Ryan: Who says we don't have mark money.

500
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:51.450
Tina Marie: A any of the doctor friends he's had me talk to, or yeah, so.

501
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.199
Dan Ryan: Makes 3 million a year.

502
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.840
Dan Ryan: That's how much you make. So.

503
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.559
Tina Marie: Yeah. But how much of it does he actually get? And like.

504
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.429
Dan Ryan: He makes 3 million, and then he pays

505
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:08.489
Dan Ryan: 40% in taxes. He makes over a million a year. Take home.

506
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.769
Dan Ryan: I don't know.

507
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:24.059
Dan Ryan: like if he is, I think he is. I think we touched on this at 1 point with him. But I'm like, Hey, are you? Do you have like is the company matching right? If you're doing all that stuff.

508
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.129
Dan Ryan: then you're taking home less. But you're pre-tax sucking away.

509
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.470
Tina Marie: Right.

510
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:36.769
Dan Ryan: And then him and Salko are doing all that weird alpaca shit. So they're trying to create tax havens there. So God only knows what that is.

511
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:37.840
Tina Marie: Right.

512
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.310
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

513
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.930
Tina Marie: I've only heard the tiniest bit about that, so I don't like really know.

514
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:46.249
Dan Ryan: Yeah, I'm like, sounds great guys. I'm like, Send me a sweater.

515
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.100
Tina Marie: That.

516
00:48:48.470 --> 00:49:14.600
Tina Marie: Yeah. So anyway, there's a lot that I don't know, because there's a lot and it cannot be covered in an hour like I've offered like I'll spend more time with you if you want to. We can be more productive. But also, you know, there are some days when I'm asking the questions, and it doesn't happen that often. But clearly I'm more annoyed than other days that we're going in circles, and

517
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:29.459
Tina Marie: those are usually the days where he's just shut down and doesn't want to talk, and then I don't really hear from him for almost a week, and then he's like I was paying attention, and then he gives me the status report of, like all the things that he got done. So

518
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:38.260
Tina Marie: He! Because he's very emotional without being.

519
00:49:39.680 --> 00:50:02.560
Tina Marie: I don't know how to say it. Like emotions affect him and and his work a lot. He comes back and regulates it, but it but it takes a while like, there's multiple reasons why he's just not the number one, the Ops person right and needs the Ops person. So the biggest lever we can pull the biggest angle we can work is

520
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:08.660
Tina Marie: get him to get that person. And so we need to understand the money. Enough

521
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:27.050
Tina Marie: to say, this is a no brainer you can afford this person. This is what they should have. The qualifications of this is what the qualifications they don't have to have right. They don't have to be an attorney, and, matter of fact, they might be better because they're not an attorney, because they don't have the same blind side spots that you do

522
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.920
Tina Marie: right.

523
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.389
Dan Ryan: Well, I mean, he's not. Gonna do you know why he's not gonna do it?

524
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:43.619
Dan Ryan: because he does not want to look bad. And what does looking bad look like? I don't know if you know this, but I mean I hear from Salco constantly. Mark does not work.

525
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:57.920
Dan Ryan: He never goes to the office. He does not work, and Salko, like always. Salko's like Mark's hilarious because he's like all he does is like, go run errands for Chona, and take care of the dog. He's like he's never at the office.

526
00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.819
Dan Ryan: He's at the office all the time. So then I no, we don'.

527
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.450
Tina Marie: Lying to me then. I don't even know.

528
00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.540
Dan Ryan: He is lying, too.

529
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.080
Dan Ryan: What do I do with people that lie to me like? I don't.

530
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.240
Dan Ryan: He doesn't view it as lying right. It's like in, you know what I mean?

531
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:22.600
Dan Ryan: But yeah, he doesn't. He doesn't work that much. So he's not gonna want an Ops guy, because then

532
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.380
Dan Ryan: he'll be exposed.

533
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.870
Dan Ryan: So.

534
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:33.740
Tina Marie: This just goes back to the same whole thing like, why do we not have more structure? That's why we don't have more structure. But there is still growth.

535
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:41.189
Dan Ryan: Yeah. But now, but to your point, I think we can build. So this should be the thing. It needs to be like

536
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:53.779
Dan Ryan: a Trojan horse situation in a way. But what we're exposed to him be like, hey? What if we did it like this? I mean, you need. I still believe that you need to do the thing 1st before you can pass the thing off.

537
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.670
Dan Ryan: So the focus should be on like

538
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.940
Dan Ryan: putting the things in place that someone like that would need

539
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:09.639
Dan Ryan: rather because they're not going to be able to come in, especially if they're not familiar with the law firm, which is probably going to be the person on your hire.

540
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:15.199
Dan Ryan: They're not gonna be. Come, come in and like, say, Oh, this, this, this and this are missing.

541
00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:20.089
Dan Ryan: like most. Even if you hired a lawyer, none of them have run a pre-lit firm.

542
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:22.859
Dan Ryan: so the only one that could do it is Salko

543
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:32.360
Dan Ryan: And then and he does not want to do it. So it would be like, Yeah, you put all these pieces in place so that someone could come in and look at

544
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:50.640
Dan Ryan: the the console, if you will, the console of this business and be like oh, I know what I can see something. I just keep thinking like Homer Simpson. Right? He's like at the thing, and you're looking at the dials and the charts, and it's like they mean different things. But like when that one goes red.

545
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.760
Dan Ryan: You should know that that's a problem.

546
00:52:53.604 --> 00:52:56.030
Dan Ryan: That does not exist right now.

547
00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:06.680
Tina Marie: You know. I wonder if we could figure out like, what type of person? Maybe like some types of assessments like Colby.

548
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.170
Tina Marie: specifically.

549
00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:14.820
Tina Marie: or disk like, what are the Ops people score on, and they're not all the same. I know that.

550
00:53:15.428 --> 00:53:23.209
Tina Marie: But what if we had like a few like if they score in this area. And right? So what are the how can we triangulate the quality.

551
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.219
Dan Ryan: Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, I feel you.

552
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.750
Tina Marie: That we need. And so but but then what if we find somebody who maybe

553
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:46.669
Tina Marie: failed law school but fits in our triangulation right? So they've got some awareness of it or a case manager who's just like they're not happy. But the reason they're not happy is because really they have an Ops brain. They need to do more.

554
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:54.129
Dan Ryan: Yeah, he he needs like, okay, it's twofold. First, st these things need to exist.

555
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.630
Dan Ryan: Then he needs someone that's fractional. They don't even need to be in the office right? That's perfect.

556
00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:01.560
Tina Marie: Yeah, fractionals are good.

557
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:11.903
Dan Ryan: That's probably a a better fit for him. It because if I'm right is that it's not someone that knows he's not where he's supposed to be air quotes supposed to be

558
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:18.799
Dan Ryan: So it's like, if you had a fractional person that is really just like

559
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.499
Dan Ryan: the co-pilot, right? Because I don't think he's ever leaving.

560
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.370
Dan Ryan: I don't think he's if he sells the firm.

561
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.030
Dan Ryan: That's the only out.

562
00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:35.490
Tina Marie: He, yeah, he's not planning on it, so I know what his goal is. He he did the math, and I asked him like, what?

563
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:45.440
Tina Marie: What do you like? What is the question that I ask is, what does this look like when it's all grown up like? What is the goal? What? What makes you happy? What's your purpose? All this stuff?

564
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:53.030
Tina Marie: And it is to take care of everyone, I said. We'll define what taking care of everyone is. It's he goes.

565
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.299
Dan Ryan: He's 1 of those people.

566
00:54:55.330 --> 00:55:02.569
Tina Marie: Realistically. He's like, I've got maybe 30 years left of life based on, you know, family history, health whatever.

567
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:18.010
Tina Marie: So he wants to make sure that everybody at sweet Laws taken care of has a good job, and I'm like, I don't know if he thinks it's gonna last that long or whatever. But that's basically it. He likes making people happy.

568
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:36.590
Tina Marie: and he wants to make sure that they're financially taken care of that. Jonah's taken care of his mom's sister, even though he does plan on not living his mom like he just that's it. That that literally is the because you asked like, where's he going? What's the goal? That's it. He! He won't get more specific than that.

569
00:55:37.643 --> 00:55:39.230
Tina Marie: But also.

570
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.380
Dan Ryan: Send the call. I'm like, I don't believe that.

571
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.150
Tina Marie: What's that?

572
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.540
Dan Ryan: I'm so cynical I don't believe that.

573
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.680
Tina Marie: Oh, no, but that's what he says.

574
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.480
Dan Ryan: No, no, I know. Yeah. I believe he says it. Yeah.

575
00:55:50.480 --> 00:56:02.689
Tina Marie: Right so, but but we can only operate within what he says, but I know that doing something with dogs. We know that he wants to make money and more money and more money.

576
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:22.649
Tina Marie: but I think it's also still, mortality is weighing on him. That's what happens when people die and losing his dad and his dog at the same time. That takes a while to recover from it. But he can't recover from it, because right now his back has basically shut down his life, which is still implications of mortality.

577
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.830
Tina Marie: Right?

578
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.560
Tina Marie: I don't think he's in the mental space to do that yet to your point of building the thing.

579
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:32.710
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

580
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:39.660
Tina Marie: There is still a framework that is evolving that is, more States opening up

581
00:56:41.522 --> 00:57:01.849
Tina Marie: more vendors wherever we can get them. He's diversifying his portfolio, so that there's more money to hopefully, maybe right, or at least better, or some kind of money management to keep him stable. If anything happens economically or to the market, for that he works in.

582
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:11.960
Tina Marie: So all of those things are part of the scaffolding at the very least, if not part of the infrastructure of the business itself

583
00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:22.310
Tina Marie: that is growing. Lorenz, the work that I'm doing with Lorenz Lorenz is a sponge

584
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:30.289
Tina Marie: and his changes. So did you see what I went through in litify and pointed out.

585
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:37.449
Tina Marie: like all of the cases, are taking longer to settle and close. But Lorenz closed the gap.

586
00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:45.429
Tina Marie: and everyone else made less money, but he's made more. I don't care about the out. They've all had outlier cases, I know, cause he's reported that.

587
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.310
Dan Ryan: Yeah, you gotta throw those out. Yeah, totally.

588
00:57:47.310 --> 00:58:00.730
Tina Marie: So I don't think that that falls in the mix with like what Laurent has, because it is one case for this year it's possible. And that's part of the math that I do want to try to figure out is, how do we throw out the outliers?

589
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.769
Tina Marie: But even.

590
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:02.570
Dan Ryan: Throw them out!

591
00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:06.700
Tina Marie: Either. Yes, but you have to identify them first, st and you know.

592
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.070
Dan Ryan: It's going.

593
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:11.180
Tina Marie: Somebody thinks it's a pain in the ass to go look at the numbers to that level. That's my point.

594
00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.900
Dan Ryan: No, it should be easy, because it's literally over X amount.

595
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:22.349
Dan Ryan: And it's gonna be, you know, if your average case is 50, his average case is like 15.

596
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.950
Tina Marie: So it's like.

597
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.610
Dan Ryan: You. If you were to spit out

598
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:36.100
Dan Ryan: every settlement ever, then you just have a 1 column of like just the outcomes you would be able to identify. You know, the

599
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:53.479
Dan Ryan: 5%. And whatever it is, be like these, clearly don't look like these. Right? So if you 80, 20, it you'll go. Okay, 80% or 15 grand. What are the other 20? And then, if you 80, 20, that that remaining 20 is probably your outliers.

600
00:58:53.730 --> 00:59:00.509
Dan Ryan: and whatever that is. It's a range of whatever that low end range is is outlier. The start of Outlierville.

601
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.520
Tina Marie: Yeah.

602
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:09.289
Dan Ryan: To your point. I I agree I don't know what that number is, but it's certainly anything in the 7 figures like those are all outliers. So.

603
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:09.690
Tina Marie: So.

604
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.460
Dan Ryan: Whales.

605
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:16.850
Tina Marie: To. Okay. To add to the mix, though of what happened when we work with the attorneys.

606
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:25.869
Tina Marie: everybody's caseloads have increased, including Lorenz's and Lorenz was the slow dog right in the race.

607
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:26.560
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

608
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.240
Tina Marie: And he, even with an increased load, is picking up pace.

609
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.859
Tina Marie: What what did that come from?

610
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:52.723
Tina Marie: It wasn't Lorenz. It was the work that I'm doing with him. And it's not necessarily because it's me. It's that work is being done. Period to manage operations within the teams. That's not what attorneys do, like. Samantha obviously has a system, but.

611
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:53.560
Dan Ryan: I.

612
00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.190
Tina Marie: Stature are suffering also, so.

613
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:58.150
Dan Ryan: That's an assumption.

614
00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.080
Dan Ryan: She does not have a system.

615
01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:05.259
Dan Ryan: Samantha has a way of doing things, but I guarantee you it's not a system.

616
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:10.469
Tina Marie: Well, I would say it is a system, I would say. It's not an optimized system or the best.

617
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:13.550
Dan Ryan: Wouldn't even say it's a system. I would just say it's a way of doing things.

618
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:21.480
Dan Ryan: So if you so here's this goes back to like

619
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:26.829
Dan Ryan: many months. This goes back to our call with Josh, where I said, Hey.

620
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:38.390
Dan Ryan: could we set up a system where we define the different stages of a case, and then we can look at hey, all Sam's. This is the breakdown of Sam's current cases. This is where they're at.

621
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:42.330
Dan Ryan: And Josh was like, yeah, we could do that.

622
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.889
Dan Ryan: So if Lorenz is working a system, whether it was there before or it's there now.

623
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:57.789
Tina Marie: It was not. It is there now, because I had them do the anatomy of a case, and they exactly what they track right now in a spreadsheet.

624
01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:00.370
Dan Ryan: So that system, whatever it looks like.

625
01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:05.199
Dan Ryan: could be put into lidify for everyone.

626
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:13.710
Dan Ryan: And it doesn't have to be Lorenz's system, or you know what I mean, and then it might not be the perfect system, or you know, but it's like

627
01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:20.010
Dan Ryan: that should be happening. And that's just another layer of being able to.

628
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.180
Dan Ryan: So

629
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:32.769
Dan Ryan: to the point that you were making. Now, if you could then look and say, Hey, everyone's cases are taking, they're taking a long time. Part of what we talked about with Josh is you'd get an in and out date

630
01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:39.379
Dan Ryan: so you could start. You could zone in and say, Oh, that's weird. They're staying longer in X step.

631
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:42.330
Dan Ryan: And then it's just an evaluative thing of

632
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.539
Dan Ryan: does that make sense? Or is there something wrong with that right.

633
01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:50.359
Dan Ryan: So if that step were collecting the money, there's probably something wrong.

634
01:01:50.990 --> 01:02:00.969
Dan Ryan: If that step is, they're in treatment. There's maybe something wrong, but there's no way to that insight cannot exist without that

635
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:01.930
Dan Ryan: data.

636
01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:06.379
Dan Ryan: So we need to take your system and build that Isaac. Get going.

637
01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:08.600
Tina Marie: Oh!

638
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.930
Dan Ryan: For a second I was like, you sound like you're talking to a dog

639
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:17.450
Dan Ryan: was also. There was also that Josh, that then you could do like a red, light green light.

640
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.899
Dan Ryan: When a case was in a stage too long it would be flagged, hey? This needs to be looked at.

641
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:28.420
Dan Ryan: And then the lawyer, or whomever looks at it and goes. Nope, that makes sense.

642
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.720
Dan Ryan: It's not.

643
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:36.970
Tina Marie: That would save that would save not a ton of time. But it would save time in the reviews, because they manually do that, so that but.

644
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.000
Dan Ryan: God. Yeah.

645
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.880
Tina Marie: For example, and I know you've heard me say this, but I don't know that it's really hit.

646
01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.379
Tina Marie: Lorenz used to take 3 and a half weeks just to review all of his cases, and now he does.

647
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.609
Dan Ryan: And never heard that.

648
01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:50.600
Tina Marie: A couple of times a week.

649
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.270
Dan Ryan: I've never heard.

650
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:53.850
Tina Marie: Do you know how insane that is?

651
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.319
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it seems ludicrous. Yeah.

652
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.350
Tina Marie: Yeah. But do I.

653
01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.340
Dan Ryan: This sounds like it's a pile of paper.

654
01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.319
Dan Ryan: It's like, where where were these.

655
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.150
Tina Marie: Right. And really, it's just a.

656
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:05.609
Dan Ryan: Spread all over the floor.

657
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:17.439
Tina Marie: That. Yeah, that is, is crazy. So to get the momentum that we got really hasn't been difficult. It's been like, I can't believe you're not doing that. Go do that right. But.

658
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.000
Dan Ryan: No.

659
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.299
Tina Marie: Is that happening in suite law? I guarantee you it's all over the place, because it's as simple as Mark. What's your numbers? I don't know. I can't believe you don't know that. Let's do that.

660
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:32.250
Dan Ryan: So. Do you know, I don't know how you could know this, but you might know this.

661
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:38.180
Dan Ryan: Do you know where his slowdown was?

662
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:44.690
Tina Marie: Yes, mostly almost across the board. It's not following up enough.

663
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.173
Tina Marie: So a few things happen.

664
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.490
Tina Marie: is that a certain stage like where?

665
01:03:50.490 --> 01:04:13.950
Tina Marie: So that's why I'm getting ready to tell you it's multiple stages. So sometimes it's patients not going to treatment, right? So they've noted patients going to start treatment, and so nobody talks to them because they're in treatment except for the patient wasn't going, or the client wasn't going to treatment right. And let's say it's a stack of treatments that have to happen in order to hit policy limits, which happens a lot.

666
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:27.710
Tina Marie: So they just don't feel like doing it. They're busy. They just don't want to go to the doctor. It's too far away. All kinds of reasons, right? And the attorneys aren't checking in and being like. Look. If you don't do this, you don't get your money.

667
01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:50.960
Tina Marie: but that conversation has to be had, because people that's not their job. That's not their business. The attorneys might have told them once, but you know, in one ear out the other, life happened to them. So it wasn't being managed. So that's 1 level of it. Another level is not following up with other attorneys, right opposing attorneys and making sure that information is going back and forth

668
01:04:51.307 --> 01:04:59.080
Tina Marie: following up with doctors, making sure that doctors are actually getting their reports in insurance. All of it all across the board.

669
01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.670
Dan Ryan: Oh!

670
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:06.800
Tina Marie: Relying on other people to follow up when they say they're going to follow up, not following up. And so the case is just

671
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:13.389
Tina Marie: sitting there. Nobody's touching it. Everybody waiting for the next person to initiate the signal of Let's go.

672
01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:18.030
Dan Ryan: Are those, and I have no idea if this I have no idea.

673
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:26.580
Dan Ryan: are those actual things that are in litify like, if a patient doesn't show up to an appointment. How would.

674
01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:40.955
Tina Marie: So I I already know. The the answer to the question is, it goes in notes. Very few things actually have something that you select right that you can. There's it's not a status. It's not right. That's where you're getting at right.

675
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:45.490
Dan Ryan: Well, I don't. Yeah, I'm just, I'm thinking, how would you?

676
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.609
Dan Ryan: How can you let the signal come through?

677
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.839
Dan Ryan: And you can't, because yeah, but you could could you.

678
01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.600
Tina Marie: You could.

679
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.009
Dan Ryan: So what you've done is identify the signals

680
01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:03.129
Dan Ryan: right? So that was certainly what was missing. I don't know any of this, but so I'm thinking like.

681
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:19.210
Dan Ryan: Oh, so, doctor, whomever that Joan is working with. If a patient didn't show up to a thing that software would then say patient didn't show up, and it would send an email to the attorney and go hey? Or whatever like it could send a signal to the law firm.

682
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.760
Dan Ryan: hey? The patient didn't show up for this appointment.

683
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.960
Dan Ryan: so you know that the doctor's probably going to follow up, or maybe not. Maybe they don't right like. Then where's.

684
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:44.620
Tina Marie: No, the doctors are just as bad as everybody else. Some of them follow up, but they are incentivized right? They don't get paid if the patients don't show up so some of them are good at it, but some of them are not, because, you know it's still a business, and they have.

685
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.750
Dan Ryan: Law firm is super incentivized to follow up

686
01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:52.209
Dan Ryan: because they're they're essentially it's literally affecting the settlement.

687
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.469
Dan Ryan: So the.

688
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.459
Tina Marie: It's the same thing for the doctors, because the.

689
01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:56.029
Dan Ryan: But.

690
01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:57.760
Tina Marie: You paid the lien payment.

691
01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:01.290
Dan Ryan: Yeah, but the the amount is so much greater for the law firm.

692
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:02.530
Tina Marie: Yes.

693
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:10.699
Dan Ryan: Like the law firm could be. You could just have people that say, Hey, patient didn't show up. The lawyer doesn't need to call that person. Just someone on the team does.

694
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:26.429
Tina Marie: Oh, there's 1 more thing that's a bottleneck is people who don't want to make calls to certain clients because those clients don't listen to them pains in the ass whatever. So that comes to the call control training right? If Jessica doesn't want to deal with.

695
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:30.520
Dan Ryan: These could be just voicemail drops like, Hey.

696
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.230
Tina Marie: Right.

697
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:37.079
Dan Ryan: Right. It's the you missed your appointment. Voicemail drop from the team. Member. Queue like.

698
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:38.090
Dan Ryan: Oh, oh.

699
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:50.429
Tina Marie: As long as that actually works. So in Arizona they have people who want phone calls, voicemail drop works right. But if they don't answer their voicemail, which is a lot of people.

700
01:07:50.540 --> 01:08:03.319
Tina Marie: So we've got a lot of retirees in Arizona. They don't want emails. They don't want text messages. They want phone calls. So part of it is also cultural, demographic, right behavioral.

701
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:28.250
Tina Marie: And let's say that there's a mismatch of the person on the team that has to behave a particular way, and then the client that they're dealing with. So there's lots of different friction points that have been identified, 2 major things that could fix it number one using lidify much better and having a either an alert system because we are able to select statuses with

702
01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:40.060
Tina Marie: maybe like time frames, right warnings that are built in there. Or they're actually just doing case reviews more efficiently and and more frequently. That's what Lorenz did.

703
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:48.779
Tina Marie: And then things like call control training, but also paying attention to each person. So

704
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.710
Tina Marie: the part of the culture is and has been from the beginning.

705
01:08:53.241 --> 01:09:07.080
Tina Marie: If there's not smoke. There's no fire, so I'm not looking at my people. I'm not micromanaging. I have no idea what the intake team does day to day. How many times have we heard that I got tired of asking the question.

706
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:08.429
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

707
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:11.729
Tina Marie: It's the same thing. I don't know what everybody's doing all the time.

708
01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:17.760
Tina Marie: There's a lot of I don't know. You don't have to micromanage to know what everybody's doing. Because if so.

709
01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.990
Tina Marie: how many is being really productive? You're hearing about it. You're seeing it.

710
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:37.019
Dan Ryan: But and you can also so. But even the thing, if they miss an appointment. So even if someone's like, I want you to call me no one's calling them right now when they miss an appointment, so you can't go by the rule for this instance. You can't say, Oh, that person needs to be called.

711
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:49.109
Dan Ryan: All that needs to happen is you? Someone needs to tell them, hey, you missed your appointment like, yeah, they want to be called about their case. Great! That sounds great. This is not their case. This is, hey, Bitch, you didn't go to your appointment.

712
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:50.760
Dan Ryan: It's like.

713
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.310
Dan Ryan: that's a text that's like you missed your appointment. It's going to affect the outcome of your case.

714
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:57.619
Tina Marie: Oh, sassy Dan.

715
01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:05.339
Dan Ryan: No, no, seriously like, I don't care what they want, right? It's like, and and it's and you, if they're not doing what they're supposed to do.

716
01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:11.730
Dan Ryan: It's it's behooves the law firm to try to keep them in line or on on the course.

717
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:19.529
Dan Ryan: And then, if it's like, if people don't want to call. Then I get to the thing where you're just this is the there

718
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:23.970
Dan Ryan: certain people do these calls, then like, if you.

719
01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:26.650
Tina Marie: So that's actually a new evolution.

720
01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:27.669
Dan Ryan: You know what I mean?

721
01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:45.680
Tina Marie: Yes, so Lorenz had separated. He had 2 teams, a red team and a blue team, but because of Hank disappearing and now I don't remember who it was on his team that's leaving Karen. Karen is going to Samantha's team because Karen did something really bad.

722
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.199
Tina Marie: This lady

723
01:10:47.830 --> 01:11:01.809
Tina Marie: told a client that I don't remember what the issue is. Oh, but she couldn't figure out something. She couldn't figure out how to sign a doc. And Karen basically said you should go find another law firm because you're not technically able to do this job

724
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.770
Tina Marie: like

725
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.740
Tina Marie: cost them a case. Lorenz was able to go and get it back. And Mike knew that Karen was doing that because he's been hearing it.

726
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:19.480
Tina Marie: and instead of firing her, they're putting on her Samantha's team 1st to see if Samantha can basically corral her.

727
01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.660
Dan Ryan: I mean to a degree like

728
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:29.499
Dan Ryan: Mark is throwing bodies at this, and it's not gonna make it better like bodies aren't making it better because

729
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:37.220
Dan Ryan: you. What you need is a system. What you need is whatever you figured out with Lorenz is like, version one.

730
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:52.460
Dan Ryan: and then you literally run that by Salko, Salko and I already did this, and it was like, I don't know what we're going to do with this like Mark's not gonna use it, but it sounds like it was implemented in practice, not in software, let's call it.

731
01:11:53.150 --> 01:12:06.050
Dan Ryan: And if it were, you could just roll that out to the whole team. Samantha doesn't need to agree to training or whatever. This is how it works. Now, you and they don't actually do anything because you're as it moves through the thing the software is doing it.

732
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.130
Dan Ryan: All they have to do is say, Yeah, they're in the next step.

733
01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:15.689
Tina Marie: The thing that we've run into before is that Mark is afraid to rock the boat because he can't afford to lose attorneys.

734
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:18.200
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. But I don't think this is rocking the boat.

735
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:24.079
Dan Ryan: I don't think they actually it changes what they do at all. All it does is send data back into litify.

736
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.170
Dan Ryan: They? Why would her?

737
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.690
Dan Ryan: Why would her stay.

738
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:35.260
Tina Marie: To have them check a box. Then that's been like this is part of why I'm just like, capitulate constantly, because.

739
01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.010
Dan Ryan: Like, what.

740
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:50.999
Tina Marie: We have done things where but like, what if we just had them, you know, created this thing and litify, and they tick a box. Yeah, if we ask the attorney just to do that, then they won't. And blah blah like, that's the response that we get. I'm like, if you respond that way. Of course your people are gonna.

741
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.649
Dan Ryan: Well, now, you can point at Lorenz and say, this dude's making more money, and if we implement this, you're all gonna make more money

742
01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:08.039
Dan Ryan: everything right. And if Mark truly says, Oh, I want to take care of one. Make sure they make more money. We need to do this so that we can all make more money.

743
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:27.889
Tina Marie: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this call and I'm gonna go extract the transcript and all this shit and base. See? Now you got me cussing because I'm mad again. Outline it, though, as a written thing, we're gonna just look at this and just basically just keep harping on it while literally looking on it. Screen. Share same time like

744
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:36.419
Tina Marie: like, go ahead and keep evading it. I'm just gonna you see the screen. I'm coming back to this. I'm gonna come back to this. I'm gonna come back to this until we do it.

745
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:43.240
Dan Ryan: It will it, will it? It's incalculable how much more money he can make, and like.

746
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.959
Tina Marie: I agree with that, because I'm we're watching it happen with Lorenz. His slowest person is not his slowest person anymore.

747
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.580
Dan Ryan: Right.

748
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:54.149
Tina Marie: And it hasn't even been a year.

749
01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.570
Dan Ryan: Right, and then new efficiencies will emerge

750
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.230
Dan Ryan: just once the the things in place you start to see like. Oh.

751
01:14:02.690 --> 01:14:04.189
Dan Ryan: we went and looked at that more.

752
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:10.349
Tina Marie: Also, Mark has effectively pretty much the same team that we had

753
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:19.339
Tina Marie: starting in the beginning. It really hasn't grown much. Remember all I need new pods. I need this. I need that. So, Lorenz, the the Arizona pod

754
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:45.670
Tina Marie: is new, but other than that, there's been very little actual like team growth. But he has tripled the size of the business in in terms of revenue since we started working together like almost 4 years ago, and that is almost like haphazardly, basically going about it with very little time spent. Imagine what could happen if we were actually strategic and consistent.

755
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:50.299
Dan Ryan: Well, and bringing on another lawyer into a system way easier.

756
01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:56.419
Dan Ryan: You can see if you can evaluate them, however long each stage is.

757
01:14:56.550 --> 01:15:05.759
Dan Ryan: the evaluations are set up, you'll you'll know like, Hey, if I give them 10 cases, then in 45 days they should all be in step whatever

758
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:10.310
Dan Ryan: in 45 days. The system is telling you. Is he on track or off track?

759
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:16.809
Dan Ryan: And then it's clearly defined for him what each stage means. Right? It's it's way. Better.

760
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:41.350
Tina Marie: Note to self for me that I need to get extracted out of. Here is I need to go get the documents that Lorenz has shared with me. Because we do have these stages broken out. A lot of this work is already done. We've we've done it on calls. And then he went and created additional systems on top of it on his own, and then shared them with me. So I just wanted to have a note in this transcript to go

761
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.479
Tina Marie: get that from him. So I can basically have this system framework

762
01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.900
Tina Marie: visually to show Mark where I haven't gotten there yet. But also

763
01:15:53.700 --> 01:16:02.410
Tina Marie: we haven't had the measurement until really the last few weeks, and and I'll give perspective. What.

764
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.949
Dan Ryan: Yes, auto version.

765
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.599
Tina Marie: Well, but but okay, so, but also.

766
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.139
Tina Marie: you know, you don't go through.

767
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.530
Dan Ryan: I'll go build it right.

768
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.010
Tina Marie: You'll be quiet for a minute, so my brain.

769
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:12.450
Dan Ryan: Problem.

770
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:33.290
Tina Marie: We started. It started slow, and then we had a massive dip in November and December, and and for multiple reasons. So December was like Lorenz's worst month ever. Well, we already know it's slow for everybody, and he was super sick in November, and then his wife got in a wreck. So he went through it mentally.

771
01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:40.709
Tina Marie: And then January, I was like, well, you can lick your wounds or you can get shit done, basically. And so

772
01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:50.250
Tina Marie: we really started ramping things up, but we ramped it up, based off of the foundation he had already been building and working on.

773
01:16:50.310 --> 01:17:19.829
Tina Marie: He just had a massive dip, and the dip was mostly mental. Some of it was performance wise. But then, when I we got the mental line, he's not afraid anymore. He knows his value. He he was a wounded puppy, and now he's a leader. He's like, I've never led people before. I've never had a team. I've never managed people. So now he's starting to feel like a leader, and that did not exist until January. January is just 3 months ago.

774
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:26.540
Tina Marie: And now we've got like he's got one big win under his belt. There's another one pending.

775
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:44.150
Tina Marie: He went through all this crap where? Where Hank disappeared, and they took over. Patrick ended up taking over. But he started with that. He's helping to train a new attorney Yuri building all these structure. And he's had massive changes in his team

776
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:59.099
Tina Marie: very, basically also never talked. She came in. She did her job. She was very scared. He was very scared, and now she's confident, and she shows up, and she does things like there's been so much evolution on a person level

777
01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:17.460
Tina Marie: right? And now the stats are starting to actually show it for the 1st time. But this is, it's not just that Lorenzo stats were improving now. We've just looked at it and gone. Holy crap! Everybody else is regressing, really they're taking longer. They're getting less money. And Lorenz is pulling for. So

778
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:37.929
Tina Marie: all of this is evidence that just in the last couple weeks have revealed itself to say, Here's the evidence right, Mark, let's stack it. This is to your point, the Ghetto rough version of the system that is proven. So there's no reason to not get on board with this right now.

779
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.010
Dan Ryan: Correct.

780
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:40.360
Tina Marie: Anyway.

781
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:41.549
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

782
01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.360
Tina Marie: I need water.

783
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.749
Dan Ryan: Do you transcribe this.

784
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:49.579
Tina Marie: Automatically with zoom! It goes into a cloud for me.

785
01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.389
Dan Ryan: So I saw in part of my notion stuff that I'm working on.

786
01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.659
Dan Ryan: One of the dudes he uses pipe drive, so he goes.

787
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.199
Tina Marie: Hate pipedrive unless they've changed it. That was like.

788
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.140
Dan Ryan: Well, I think he uses it because it's the only one that you can do this with.

789
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:13.310
Dan Ryan: I got to double check, but it's pipe drive. So it's file to Google drive.

790
01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.920
Dan Ryan: Then the new file exists in Folder X.

791
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:27.520
Dan Ryan: That's the trigger triggers to pipe, drive, to whisper Gpt, and which is the best transcriber hands down.

792
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:37.510
Dan Ryan: that does the transcription. Then it passes the transcription to Gpt, prompt to do the summer whatever you want, whatever prompt you right.

793
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:42.699
Dan Ryan: and then it outputs that I think in his version he outputs it into notion.

794
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:47.879
Dan Ryan: So I think he uses that one because it's got it's notiony I don't know, but I.

795
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.330
Tina Marie: That's what I'm building right now.

796
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:54.510
Dan Ryan: I saw the flow, and I was like I was like, Oh, God damn! That works really well, like.

797
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.919
Tina Marie: Would have been great to know, but.

798
01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.910
Dan Ryan: I'd never seen it before. I'd never heard of pipe drive. I was like, what the hell's pipe drive.

799
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:07.420
Tina Marie: My niece used to use it in Justin Christensen for conversion. Fanatics.

800
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:12.050
Dan Ryan: Oh, it looks like it looked really good, I mean.

801
01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:23.199
Tina Marie: Well what it what it used to be was sales flow like, mostly acquisition. So now I don't know what it is now, but that was like 15 years ago.

802
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:28.549
Tina Marie: Hold on! What year is it? 14? No, it was like 11, and 12 years ago.

803
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:29.490
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

804
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:37.059
Dan Ryan: and I don't know. I I just have a feeling he's using it, because make and Zapier don't have that exact

805
01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.759
Dan Ryan: set up. But I might be wrong.

806
01:20:39.731 --> 01:20:48.369
Tina Marie: Zapier. So most of my stuff was done with Zapier and I'm almost positive they can do it now.

807
01:20:48.440 --> 01:21:11.280
Tina Marie: And Openai so whisper you can use through the Api calls also. So I would almost bet that Zapier can do it. But that's what I am building. So I'm just staying focused on my primary app, which is basically the second brain right? That has the Pinecone library. It has Lane graph. It has the

808
01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:21.619
Tina Marie: Archon in it. So it's the libraries, the logic, the contextual memory the ability to make.

809
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:37.260
Tina Marie: I don't know, basically connect all of these dots together with it. So the for it starts with. Here's all of the transcripts, but like over time. So where you know it, it can process the growth better than I can.

810
01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:42.679
Tina Marie: and that's what the contextual memory is. So that's actually been. The biggest issue

811
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:55.690
Tina Marie: is how much context they have. It really hasn't been able, because the length of transcripts, and quality of transcripts which zoom Zoom's transcripts is actually verbatim, almost perfect.

812
01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:14.619
Tina Marie: and it does put the timestamp and the name of the person. So I run those through, Claude because Claude smokes chat, gpt. Still, every model of Chat Gpt when it comes to extracting usable data from the transcript without

813
01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:29.319
Tina Marie: changing the language so much that the context is lost right? Because Chat gpt will rewrite everything. Let me summarize it. No, thank you. Write our actual words, and I'll have to prompt it like 6 or 7 times, whereas, Claude, I only have to say one time.

814
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:35.710
Tina Marie: Stay true to our language. Don't, don't you know reword it, rephrase it because too much is lost. There.

815
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:39.360
Dan Ryan: You know, when Norio showed me, and that and he was right.

816
01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:40.170
Tina Marie: Hmm.

817
01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:43.379
Dan Ryan: Apt through the Api is just better.

818
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:53.220
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, because I told you this, I told you the reason why is because people dumb down the model. That's why you have to build your own wrapper. That's what I was telling you.

819
01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:58.080
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. So I mean, we're just using it for, like some of the apps and fanflowy. But

820
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.490
Dan Ryan: things that we could not get to work with

821
01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:08.779
Dan Ryan: Gpt queries through the interface or the app, or whatever, and then gpt through Zapier.

822
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:09.520
Tina Marie: No, we're not.

823
01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:15.760
Dan Ryan: Isn't really using the Api it made sort of is but him via code.

824
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:19.870
Dan Ryan: The accuracy was infinitely better.

825
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:33.939
Tina Marie: Do you want to know what's stupid, Dan is? I told you that I know that I built the wrapper so I could get out of it, and I still kept using the stupid chat app to get my coding that's been broken so dumb.

826
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.449
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah. Well, it's just so much easier to use the app.

827
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:44.439
Tina Marie: But I I forgot that that was the main reason. I heard that to build the wrapper to get to it

828
01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.150
Tina Marie: freaking that we, you know, I happen to have a lot of things on my plate, too. So

829
01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:55.089
Tina Marie: but it's funny how easy it is to forget a linchpin.

830
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.490
Dan Ryan: Yeah, like.

831
01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:59.450
Tina Marie: That you, you identify the linchpin, but

832
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:08.229
Tina Marie: that that concept, that that's what it is is so new that it's easy just to let it go and go right over it, anyway.

833
01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.080
Dan Ryan: Yeah.

834
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:19.779
Tina Marie: Holy crap. My sugar is dropping. Okay? This good call, though I will. I've got a lot to assemble and put together, but I have a nice quiet weekend, so I can do that.

835
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.289
Dan Ryan: There you go!

836
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:27.240
Tina Marie: All right, sir. Well, you have a good day, and I will talk to you Monday.

837
01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:27.960
Dan Ryan: Alright, cool.

838
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.360
Tina Marie: Bye.

839
01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.090
Dan Ryan: So.
