00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:04 - Laura L (3)
How are you? Doing well yourself.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm just texting my daughter and she's just frustrating and having a bad day. So I was ready for this.
00:00:18 - Laura L (3)
I lost track of time because I'm messaging her. Sorry. All good. I hope she's okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. She's just emotionally struggling. Just like. Let tell her this real quick. Okay. Okay. Um, um, so. Let me go look at Trello. Hey. I had already, I'm in a long browser. Nope, that's the one. Where's my workspace? This one. I think it was the one called business HQ. Yeah, there you go. Okay. And you updated one for the, what you call it? DNS.
00:01:45 - Laura L (3)
Yeah.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Questions for next meeting? Is that in there? What is it at? Okay.
00:01:56 - Laura L (3)
I'm the current in progress that we have is. for the thinkific and I assume we're no longer using thinkific.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I don't know. canceled it. I have so many things going on right now. I'm I am all over the board and still just trying to figure it out. But what I did do is I had a man, I wish he could give you access to it, but I can't. So I bought that snapshot I told you about with high level. I just got access to this training for it today to know how to use it, because so there's kind of like two tracks that I'm working. So one is just being able to create my own training content and deliver it to people in an easy and simple way. So high level is not easy and simple, but I want to learn high level and use it. And so slowly just creating things. inside of it and building it. Um, let me log in. Let's see. Oh, yeah. I need to change the, no, I'm going to keep that. And decide if I want to keep it as agency or not. I think I will. we'll see. Let's see, profit drivers.
00:03:24 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, you bought a subscription in go high level. Still blowing one.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, it's, it's, they're kind of the same. Like they combined it, I think, because of my email address. It shouldn't have. It was really weird because one is a white label agency. that definitely shouldn't have happened. Um, um, okay. So sites, memberships, Okay, so maybe these are separate now, because this is not an agency dashboard. All right, let me. I have one account. Settings, let me change this account to different email address and see if that will help kind of clear up the confusion. I profile. I think it would be there. I'm not changing it, so let's see if I can do the profile. NTP. Send me the thing.
00:05:40 - Laura L (3)
I think you could also add your other email to the agency account.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
whenever it already is, so when you say other email, it's go high level, right?
00:05:55 - Laura L (3)
Yeah.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go high level. You have to say exactly what email. Because if you say other one, I'm assuming that you meant the profit driver's ink.
00:06:04 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, both emails like as a profile or admin. So you do both have access, whichever you want to use.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Um, okay. So here's which also this makes no sense. Like this is got to be an example. Yeah, I don't actually have that. So, um, let's see which one I pinned this. So the one that's called beverage systems, memberships, communities, three. Well, again, um, beautiful. Yeah, so they have. Um, let me go see if I can. Let's show you something a little bit. Let's see community builders. Let's check my email and see if In here, last one. Snapshots set up in training, community funnel overview, community setup, setting up their surveys in the CRM. Yeah, how are we? Oh, this is a free group. I wonder if they'll let me invite you. Well, yeah, maybe under members, you could invite someone to join. Yeah, I can invite you, but I think you wouldn't have access to that. So, um, wait, okay, so things. Oh, yeah, group profits again by a copy and let's go to zoom chat. What was the guy's name, Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? All right, we'll see. Um, hopefully they'll say yes, because that doesn't make. I mean, so like if you purchase a membership area anywhere else, you can pretty much just share the password, but school is different. Like that's all these different communities and that doesn't make it. So we'll see what they do with that. So I just want to learn how to use this and it's it's got training. So anyway, it's a whole whole thing that probably keep us a little bit busy for a while because they have this.
00:11:55 - Laura L (3)
The guide is for the school, I mean, for school community or membership.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:12:02 - Laura L (3)
I mean the guide or the training that you shared is for school community, grading, or higher level.
00:12:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. they have all these automations that are set up and they teach you how to different surveys and connecting it all in the high level CRM. Okay. but I don't know if it's actually already in, like how much of that was in the snapshot already?
00:12:44 - Laura L (3)
Yeah. But I think if he shared you with the link, you could import it to go high level so you could see.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's already imported.
00:12:53 - Laura L (3)
It's already there.
00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. And I don't see it here. I don't know how much of it is, because, yeah, things just aren't Legends Academy, no one if that's part of it. Anyway, we really need to have the training to put things apart because all that should be in here is the existing snapshot that I imported. So, I'll show you, let's see, switch the agency view.
00:13:31 - Laura L (3)
Yes, okay, if you could also invite me in that account so I can have a look.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should be in here.
00:13:38 - Laura L (3)
I think I'm invited for the other account with your lead loan at the agency.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Oh, what's the number I forget?
00:14:04 - Laura L (3)
I'm sorry. Yeah, two five eight. At gmail.com.
00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry. Stations. Stations. Okay. All right. now you should have access to that. And this one leveraged systems membership is the one that I have imported that snapshot. I'm sure let me go back and show you. But it's snapshots, imported snapshots, launched a simple community. So that one, this is what I did, right? I just created a new thing off of that. So that is what this is. There's a sub account created from that snapshot.
00:15:25 - Laura L (3)
Huh?
00:15:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:15:27 - Laura L (3)
And I'm just reading the name of the sub account so I could navigate when I'm okay.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see.
00:16:33 - Laura L (3)
For the product in WordPress, I think we need to set up Stripe for that. What product? You mentioned that we will be using WordPress for the sales page.
00:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's see. Wherever you need to go and set up Stripe, let me know I can set that that up because my brain can't even go there right now. We haven't talked in so long, and I'm just trying to get there. going down these tasks, if I get updates throughout the week, so really what I would like this call to be, would be to do things that we can't communicate through Trello during the week. I'm still trying to find the DNS task.
00:17:25 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, I think you put it up there in the domain, like the July 20 due date. I added there the articles where we can, there's a guide how to update the DNS record. I'm sorry, it's August 6th, the July 20 due date. Yeah.
00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, so profits, rivers. I think, right now it's still in, I need the error, it's still error, okay, hold on a second. Because I think what I did was used leverage systems instead. Yeah. Sites. Yeah, this is just not like intuitive, where's domains. No domains found. I'm moving all around I'm Right, that's not it. So I set up clouds layer, first of all. Which I can share with you. Okay. Didn't launch that. So what I figured out is that if I point the domain to cloud flare, then it can work with chi level and you can have the Access to cloud flare to set things up, but that looks like it's not working.
00:20:08 - Laura L (3)
Just to confirm. So the sales page would be in WordPress with the profit drivers domain.
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I'll probably use leverage systems.
00:20:21 - Laura L (3)
Okay. That's the domain, but it would be in, I mean, WordPress, not high level.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:20:33 - Laura L (3)
Okay. from WordPress, we'll be pushing the signup or contacts to high level. Yes. Okay. I must wonder you don't want to use the high level site for the sales page or landing page.
00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. We use WordPress for that. All right. High level is basically, the power of it is automations.
00:21:06 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, because most also people using the sites, mean, for the landing page, so it would just want access. I'm not sure I understand what In building the sales page or landing page, so it will just be in one go. They don't have to push the contacts from the other side to go high level. It would automatically captured inside go high level and go directly to the automation.
00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you saying you think that I should build the site on high level? I'm trying to understand where you're going with this.
00:21:57 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, I'm just trying to confirm or check.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you don't want to use the high level because high level is too glitchy. They're not good at hosting.
00:22:05 - Laura L (3)
They have too many issues. Okay.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's just, that's what I want to check and yeah, when they are more solid and things work more fluidly and then I would use it, but their word press hosting is not very good. And I host it on percidium, which actually maybe that's part of the issue.
00:22:30 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, I think you could use high level without importing the side from go. mean, word press like directly from high level.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Say that again.
00:22:46 - Laura L (3)
You could use the high level side without importing or yeah, embedding your press site.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just directly in high level. So let me just break down what we are. are going to do. The sales pages and landing pages will be on WordPress. And when somebody orders something, then it will probably be zapped over to high level. And depending on what they did, if they opted in or if they purchased something, then that zap would have some data appended to it, which would say it's either a customer or an opt in a river, and then it level would trigger automation as to how to handle them based off of what data was appended, whether it was a customer, what they bought, what they should get access to, if they need to have an account created in the membership site. So the membership site will be hosted there. And primarily, though, primarily, what I'm using high level for is to learn how to use it well, so that I can help teach other people who don't, do things, because the stacks get really expensive, you know, Click when it's expensive and it's bloated and it's slow. If you have school, you have multiple memberships, then you have to pay $100 for each one. So because I teach business and simple business systems and because high level is evolving very quickly with the types of automations they can do, with all the services that they offer, I want to put some things in it to learn how to use it so that I can create a simple system inside of high level, but in the meantime it doesn't work really well. So I'm not going to put everything that I'm using there at the same time. Does that make sense? Yep. Okay, which I get is confusing because it's all all over the place, but that's kind of the process that I had to go through is so many of these things are either too expensive or they just, when people are starting out their business. They need to leverage all of their investments and everything that they're spending and they need it to return quickly, but that's not usually what happens first you start building, then it takes a while to make sales, it takes a while to, you know, get any kind of volume. And they don't know how to create nurture sequences and follow up with people. So the really big value that high level has is the CRM. It's how you handle customers and process them following up with text messages, following up with email messages, giving them magic link access to whatever they purchased. It's that. What they are not good at is WordPress hosting, their sites are slow, they have down issues, they're doing okay with email delivery, their membership is okay, it's not great. So, what we're building there, most of it is going. to be just kind of a test functionality. I also have a school membership. I may do something else, but our assignments and you and I talking about this is going to be figuring out how these things work together. And if we can make it work well, then we can move things over to it. So I almost have two separate tracks. One is building for the future through with high level and one is building for the right here right now. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. And that's kind of been an evolution for me because I didn't know what I wanted to do in the beginning and how I wanted to go about it and what I wanted to do, but because in the last month or so, you know, just getting busy now that the girls are in school, but also seeing the things that some of the things and the snapshots that are coming out in high level, because I didn't want to have really anything to do with it too much. to go have a simple community and be able to teach and get people to this but I do think that there's a lot for a lot to be said for being able to create small snapshots ourselves and provide them to people so ultimately that's what I want to be able to do with the agency account but I've got to learn how it goes and if I do it all by myself it'll take me forever so you already know a lot of things about the automations and how they work so if you can figure out and we can figure out together how to use the snapshot that I got and set up an automations that has to do with the membership that will be step one and that will be great so in the domain man I'm like okay so cloud flare so we're first sitting on we've got all these pieces and everything Time, like I saved this password and updated and it does not save it correctly or it does and I have to fill it up. Okay, let me do this. And we'll see, um, authenticator, okay, so we've got, what do you call it, it's, okay, so that's 20 day cloud flare. It's hosting at Presidium. Cloudflare is not a host. I'm not really sure how That works actually. Well, let me go see you. So you found. How does that have a domain and that's DNS records? Yeah. That I know for a proceeding, I think we add different things. So let me I don't know if I can do that, but I'll see if I can do this advanced DNS. I think I would have to do custom name servers, which I think would change. Now that some of that I'm going to struggle with domain. It's in DNS. And it's left there. You can manage those records in this game. You Yeah, I feel like I have to for new cheap stuff, because you have to do a name and C name records. I guess they're all a name records. How do I add a record? Okay, that's it. So I need to do that here. DNS. Oh, so that should be. Right. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go back to next I'm to slide.
00:31:29 - Laura L (3)
Your website.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I have to get rid of it because there's a max of five. So I'm trying to figure out how to delete this real quick. I'm going to go back to the request plan. Let me see. And I really don't need this, so let me go back here. I'm trying to figure out the fastest way to just delete it. Right now on the website, no, it's probably I guess so far on new website. Really? Did they change it? So I deleted it in the last or just hasn't happened yet. Right. It probably will take a little while. So we'll an additional site on. Let me see what their CL plans to see with the one WordPress site, three WordPress sites, five WordPress sites. I feel like they've changed the prizes. I'm pretty sure I paid. $49.99 for mine. First, let me see what is going on. Oh,.80. Okay, so I guess that's what I'm getting there. Something like that. All right. All right. All right, that'll take a little bit. So it's already pointed, so this domain is the one that I want to use. It's already pointed at CloudFlare. She couldn't see here. So and you go, sorry, CloudFlare access. So you should be able to add a records. Let's see, I've got one a record there. I was just trying to find what it's supposed to be. But it should be the same for all of us at once it needs to be. Yeah, add a record, a, there, and it will be, I think, a step to be. That's why you. Well, it's, you know, what that already exists. and you're not showing me that, 173.230, I do not see you, 173.230, here. So, A, W, W, there's the thing, Or is the other thing, 3,000, 3,000. Okay, well that worked. Yeah. Oh, why wouldn't you let me do? Parking page. Oh, that's why. Oh, yeah, that was the issue, okay. Which one did I just do? Okay, so I don't know how fast it takes to propagate. right, so proscenium is definitely hosting it. Okay. It just doesn't have a site created. So, um, and it's on cloud there. And then, okay, so, vercedium is, it's pointed at vercedium, but I haven't created that domain yet. So let's go here. And now be able to So, I don't want probably working to create that. And then once it does show up here, we can install WordPress on it in the manage website. I feel like, I mean, this is WordPress posted. So it probably will happen automatically.
00:39:35 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, as connected.
00:39:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so then you should share this with you. you. This should be the one because nothing else makes sense. No, edit. So it actually be... It should be this, and then not for sure, and then share. All right, let's check this one time. Yeah, it's not there yet. Okay, so just to recap, we are going to have WordPress installed on a site that is Leverage Systems. Actually, you could probably clone, you had it on tinamarita.io, right?
00:41:23 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, I could actually, I mean, export those and import it to the website.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so you can do that. It's pointed, you have access to cloud player. You should have access to everything that you can do. And we can create that landing page that you had on tinamarita.io. This one could be the whole page of Leverage Systems.
00:41:56 - Laura L (3)
And.
00:42:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Separately, we'll see if I can get access to this training and just look at and try to wrap our heads around how the snapshot works for the membership site and high level. So the other thing that's happening is I'm helping, I'm working with another lady on launching a product with her, so we'll have some traffic and sales coming in through that way. we'll have a little bit of people to put in kind of slowly and make sure everything works before trying to build it at any kind of scale. So we'll have time to be able to break it and still take care of people if something goes wrong, you know what I mean? Yeah. Okay, because I don't want to create a big support issue and not and give people a bad experience. Okay, so leverage the Trello. Trello. So, you can get rid of anything or ask if I want to close it off because my brain can't pass it right now.
00:43:11 - Laura L (3)
In progress, we can delete for the thinkific task since we're no longer using thinkific.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, hold on a second. No, not leave that as the task for right now. And the card. See. Wait. We've got two of you in here, which one That one the next two Tina. Yeah, okay, this one, okay And worse think if I do you see it Yeah Is it in progress with that? Yeah in progress that one there because that's where they think it's this Yeah Okay, well, um, let's see, or maybe we can you tell it's still the same Can we do this in WordPress Let's explore Funnel kit with WordPress and And More plus so I'm gonna say this and so I'm gonna put a let's see What's just kind of like an overview project resources, we'll call this, and I'm going to put master plan, call it that. Really, it should be like a flowchart, but we'll say this. So landing pages, popped in sales pages on Elementor, Wordpress, all kits, match 100% sure how that works together, but wants to explore it. Every customer or lead pops in, gets zaps, Over to higher level and needs an automation that handles whatever needs to be done depending on how the trigger, for example, need a sequence, not your sequence, that's the delivery. Or feedback, et cetera, sequences, how that's accessed. Let's see. Okay, I'll maybe not try this. You You You Okay, so this is just kind of I don't know this to the top. Would be great to create this like in a flow chart or something so and then make that a picture right there so it's easy to look at. Yeah, that is actually a great board and it's not one that I came up with but. So, like, if we have questions that we need to talk about for the meeting, this should be here to do. already have a couple. To do progress for a block area, you have that. Where did you go? Right. We have some structure. going slowly but surely. Okay. Do you have any other questions?
00:50:08 - Laura L (3)
Do we already have a Zapier account that we can use for the Zapier to create like push contacts to go high level?
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:50:22 - Laura L (3)
I think also be great like give me like a draft or object teams of the automations that will be creating inside high level depending on the segmentation of the list.
00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry again I was doing that.
00:50:41 - Laura L (3)
I mean be great if we also have like the list of objectives of the email nurtures that we will be doing.
00:50:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have not got that mapped out yet that'll that'll be a little while it will just kind of first it'll depend on what I want to offer and then the kind of experience that I want people to have so that's going to take weeks. the kind of formulate, but for sure the way the way that I would give it to you would be like a flow chart kind of map. So and and something that looks a lot like what what they had. I mean you know what a flow chart looks like right? Yeah. So like here's the entry point, here's the ad, here's the whatever, here's the landing page. This is what happens next. This is what happens next and just kind of flow all the way through. If this does not kind of thing, decision matrix kind of thing, so that like it will all be heavily mapped out when the time comes. But the first thing is just kind of so there are some snapshots already and automations already in in these accounts and you can play snapshots. These are all the same. I don't have these. These are templates that came with them, don't really need these, but we're not delegating them because they could be valuable down the road. But the snapshots that I bought from other people, you can create a sub account with one of them. So this one already exists, and this one is in the Leverage Systems membership. I'm not positive where this one is, I think it might be in here. I'm automation. I think that's this, but I'm not totally positive. So you could create a new one if you just wanted to see and see what the snapshots do. you. I'm pretty sure this is from Anik. Let's see. All All right. So this is good to know, and those are, well, that's pretty cool. Wait 10 minutes before that. That's awesome. That was only two workflows. I swear there was more things. Okay, it's just because I put it in community nurture, join the community. Oh, this seems like it might be. Transfer access for an offer to say, well, D and D school tracker pipeline. This is definitely the one that I bought. Um, so then. Alright, so let me go to here, so this should have that here, too, then if I go to Automation's weird, it's not here, extra low, no, no, it's not it. Very confused by how these things come. This is webinar, this is totally good. Let's just experiment on. Yeah, so, is it this one in Automation's? Yeah, other one. Yeah, that's the only question. Yeah, I won't know until I go through this training to see exactly what all it is and hopefully they'll let me share it with you, but anyway, as you can see, there are some automations that are already fully mapped out that just, you know, you would plug it in your own product, your own text. Let's see, okay, action name, type, date, email, alright, from name, from email, subject, template. It's awesome. Today we're posting a line and put all of that in there right now. Yeah, this will be great. Just got to go through it all and just kind of wrap our heads around it and then put a product to attach to it and then some ads to drive traffic to it with the product. Then it all takes a while because I'm also doing a whole bunch of other things including going to school, answering your mission, answering clients, and raising kids, just a little busy, just a little bit. Yeah, but you say automations light your brain up, so it's about the time to get your brain light up and take a look at it. And if you could, I'm going to pause on any assignments for right now other than just this one that we have, which is, and I'm going to move this up here because it's probably the other one, page for local ticket offer, don't know if this driver's live going to. Okay, uh oh, I think I need to get some of it, but one more second, this is... Yeah, think once I imported all of those things, then we can integrate the stripe or paper. Yeah, we'll just edit. Oh, think if the final gets out of order, too. Okay, change the date for like a couple weeks from now. Oh wait, let's see. What? Oh, that's obvious. Okay. Okay. Okay, I have to go to my daughter.
00:57:52 - Laura L (3)
She's blowing my phone up and having a hard time.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she came home at lunch and was just crying. Okay. Okay. So anyway, just. You could spend a few hours if you wanted to just getting the, what do you call it, the this one website leverage system set up and then just playing around with high level and the snapshots and getting familiar with what's in there. And getting familiar with both snapshots is good too because there's a lot in both of them.
00:58:23 - Laura L (3)
Okay. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:58:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. Do you have any questions?
00:58:32 - Laura L (3)
Yeah, I'll get so far. once the site is added to a proceeding, then I could go ahead and put all those templates and play around as well as, as well as the snapshots in go high level.
00:58:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Okay, sure, we'll do. So I'll just update here in Trello and that you know.
00:59:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
