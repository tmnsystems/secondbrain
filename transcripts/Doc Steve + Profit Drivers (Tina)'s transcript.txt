00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Tina Marie: Hi Jadine.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Jay: Bye.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Tina Marie: How are you?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Jay: I'm good. How are you?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Tina Marie: Good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Jay: I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it on time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Tina Marie: How was your. Well, you made it yay.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Jay: I know. I was like. Oh, my gosh.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Tina Marie: Why is that going.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Jay: Where's the husband? Anyone yet.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Tina Marie: Uh. No, he's not.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Jay: Okay. Let me. Let me see where he is. He's he's always on time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Jay: Okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Tina Marie: I'm just opening my notes. There he is!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Jay: Okay.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Dr. Areta: My bad. I thought I had already clicked join. I was already. I missed.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Tina Marie: It's. All good. I have steps in my head, conversations in my head, all kinds of things, I'm like, oh, that didn't actually happen. Oops.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, I had the zoom up and everything I was like, Oh, shoot! I forgot to click, join. But yeah.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Tina Marie: I get it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Dr. Areta: All right.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Tina Marie: And. See.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Tina Marie: I'm trying to find the notes I sent you. I just sent them last night. But.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Jay: We. I have them too, though, if you need them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Good. Well. It.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Jay: You want me to forward it back to you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Tina Marie: No, it's in. It's in my stuff. I'm just. Hold on!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tina Marie: One second. Or I mean, I guess that might be fast. Me and my.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Jay: Okay.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Tina Marie: Pride. What the heck.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Tina Marie: I've been all over the place today. And then I just went into this like massive AI deep dive, and my brain is like.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Jay: It's okay.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Tina Marie: Focus focus focus.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Jay: Alright. I'm sending them to you right now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tina Marie: How. Perfect. How are you sending them email.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Jay: I'm just, yeah. I'm just sending it back to the same email that you sent me. I'm just forwarding it to you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Tina Marie: Perfect. Thank you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Jay: You're welcome.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Tina Marie: Oh! So while I'm waiting for that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Tina Marie: Had. How, what kind of thoughts did you guys is a little bright out there.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Tina Marie: You're so cute, they're just so.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Dr. Areta: He's outside.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Tina Marie: I know I love it also. I love the nails. My nail lady is out of town, and I'm dying, but you look so cute.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Jay: Thank you. Oh, that's the worst.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Um. Okay.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Tina Marie: I don't know where the heck they are. I'm trying to think of like where I saved them. I know I saved them.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Jay: You should get them in the next like 30 seconds or so. I just resent them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Tina Marie: My own folder. Yeah, it should just be in my drive, anyway. But.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Tina Marie: What I can start with is, um, what kind of thoughts did you guys have. Since our conversation last week.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Jay: Uh. Well, I learned a little bit about myself from conversation from the conversation last week. Um.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Jay: Pretty much, you know, just I learned a little bit about myself that I need to um. Let go a little bit.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Jay: Uh-huh.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Jay: Go ahead!

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Tina Marie: In in like in a good way, did it. Did it feel good like? What? What did that feel like for you?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Jay: No, I realize why I just realized why I'm so frustrated and overwhelmed all the time is because I do take on more than I should, and I. And I have been taking care of people my whole entire life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Jay: So that's why I'm just like I'm tired. I just want to check out. And just I want to be selfish. I want to just take care of me, but I can't, so.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and kind of that. All or nothing like.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Tina Marie: There's a there's a space where you can take care of people.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tina Marie: Without. Losing yourself in it. So it's not a lot of times what happens.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tina Marie: And I'll I'll tell you this so you can watch for it in in yourself. When we didn't have the boundaries in place. To begin with.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Tina Marie: And we recognize it. It's like something snaps, and we just want to cut everything off and over correct. And especially with anyone that's been repressed, and I find it tends to happen more in women. It's definitely not an only female thing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Tina Marie: Um. That tendency to over correct is huge. It's like, Oh, I just realized what the problem is. I'm going to fix it right now. Bye, bye, bye. And you want to be careful of that, because the thing there, you know.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Tina Marie: That is um, that that's probably like our the same part of our fight or flight mechanism. Right? It's like, Oh, we know what it is. Let's fix it. Um. But then there's that higher level of thinking, that prefrontal cortex. Right? That's like, Oh, well, actually, I need a balance. I can do all of this.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Tina Marie: Um so. So then you you want to recalibrate. So if you know that in advance.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Tina Marie: You can kind of watch yourself. That whole cognitive behavior type. Thing, right.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Tina Marie: Observe yourself going. Am I over correcting? Am I like? Is this. Long term. Just kind of slow down a little bit while you're going through that. So just watch for the snap.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Tina Marie: And uh. It helps sometimes because I did it myself. I've watched other people. That overcorrection tendency is huge.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Tina Marie: All right.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Jay: Okay.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Tina Marie: Doc? How about you?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Well, it definitely got me thinking a lot more about like you're you're talking about the whole. Energy and.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Dr. Areta: What? What are we putting our energy towards? What drains us? Um! And the whole delegation part. Um, that definitely got me thinking of, like, okay, what can we.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Dr. Areta: Due to. Take a little bit of, take a little bit. Um.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Dr. Areta: From the load that we have on on from both of us. Pass it on to some of our employees. And you know, who can we trust that type of deal.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Dr. Areta: So that way we can. I, I feel like we need to some. Eventually, we're gonna need to cross that bridge.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Dr. Areta: If we plan on growing. We can't run it all because we're only 2 people, and we need to be able to.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Dr. Areta: Rely on on other people as well too.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Dr. Areta: I feel like I don't know.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Tina Marie: And then um. How did the conversation go together? As you guys kind of.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Tina Marie: Distilled. You know those thoughts. So you would have individual thoughts for yourself and for the company, and probably for the family.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Tina Marie: How did did you? Did you discuss it more together.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Jay: We discussed a little bit. Yeah, we've been. We've already been like trying to make um a little right now we're working on making some changes with one of our staff members being able to take the load off for pi exams. Sorry for for exam for my husband, and then um! So we're working towards that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Jay: Um. We hired another employee recently.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Jay: Um so. But as far as like so.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Dr. Areta: And we have cleaners, and we have cleaners at the house right now, as we speak that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Jay: And we have someone cleaning the house the whole house right now. Yeah.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Jay: That's why I'm sitting outside.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Tina Marie: I love it. Yeah, that's the hard thing about having cleaners, I'm like, but I want my space and you not in it. But I want it clean. But uh you know.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Tina Marie: Trade-offs uh. So for some an employee to help you with the pi.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Dr. Areta: Here.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Tina Marie: Is it a doctor? Then.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Dr. Areta: No, so we have. So I guess, in terms of our business, just so that you have it a bit of an idea. We have 2 main forms of income, right in terms of the business. Either they come in cash.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Dr. Areta: And they pay for our services, or we work with attorneys like Mark, our personal injury, attorneys. And we do the service now and then. We get paid at a later.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Tina Marie: Leans.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. Liens on a later date.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Tina Marie: I'm very familiar.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Dr. Areta: Um, and so. Legally, I'm able to have my staff do exams.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Dr. Areta: Just not interpret the results or anything like that, or play doctor.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Dr. Areta: Um. So I've been doing a little bit more of that where I'm I'm passing it on to one of my, to one of our girls uh to do so that way. I'm not having to physically be. There!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Tina Marie: So um. I have to control myself, because now my brain just wants to go into the Pi side of it and ask you all kinds of questions because I do a lot of that. But uh, let me stay focused. Let me say focus because order of operations is huge. And if I only get you for 3 sessions is this one and the next one. Then I want to give you.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Tina Marie: The most useful thing possible, so. Um.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Tina Marie: Did you happen to look at the notes that I sent.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Tina Marie: And. Was there anything there that stood out? Because, like, I said, I mean, my brain can go all over the place.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Tina Marie: Um. Looking at the order of operations for sure the things that I want you to think about.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Tina Marie: Are going to be the currencies. Um, it's going to be the the trade-offs.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Tina Marie: Right, being aware, 1st of all, that you're always making them, making them. It's never uh. We just. Do this, or we don't do this like there's constantly trade-offs like, what are they.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Tina Marie: Do they work for us? Um, and then the 80 20 rule, knowing that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Tina Marie: Of all the things that you do. A lot of this stuff that you do doesn't actually really matter that much.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Tina Marie: A few of the things that you do matter a ton. So trying to figure out what those things are, and that really makes it Jadeen helpful, more helpful when you're like trying to let things go. The reality is that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay, have you guys ever watched the Big Bang theory?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. That's my show.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Tina Marie: Sort of obsessed.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Jay: Don't see it showed online. I watched a couple yeah.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Tina Marie: I've. I watched it. I don't know how many times I just put it on the background. I don't really even watch it anymore. But like. So I catch lots of it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Tina Marie: But Sheldon Cooper, he's this basically autistic, brilliant guy, right? And then I've worked with any of them.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Jay: Oh!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tina Marie: But his whole premise is that if he controls everything, if he has the same exact. Routine, that his routine, his environment, his processes. That he's thought of himself is what brings specific outcomes.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Tina Marie: And then his routine gets disrupted. And.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Tina Marie: Significantly. He has no control of it, and it happens for like a week. And he's like, I just realized everything was still the same. Meaning.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Tina Marie: I did all this for nothing. And that was a huge epiphany, because he was like.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Tina Marie: I thought everything that I did. Created this particular outcome, and then he realizes with his genius, brain.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Tina Marie: That's not really how it works.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Dr. Areta: That was a haircut episode when he got his haircut with the barber.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Tina Marie: And. That's exactly the one it was. That's exactly the one it was.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Tina Marie: Um. But he doesn't have my like haircutting records.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Jay: Oh!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Dr. Areta: I don't know.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tina Marie: All right. Um, yeah, anyway. So. That I, that that show actually teaches a lot about our psychology because of all of the different people. And you watch their character development. Um.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Tina Marie: We get to see a lot of narcissism, we get to see a whole lot of things play out. But Chuck Laurie is a brilliant writer. And so we can actually learn a lot about ourselves. Through some of that, but that's it. You know that.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Tina Marie: Just a little bit comes out of what we're actually doing. And so that strength, weakness, paradox, you know that that all flies into it. We talked about today going over the financial stuff. So again, like, if if we have just these these 3.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Tina Marie: Meetings. How do I help you? Maybe create kind of a framework. With enough information that you could go and.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Tina Marie: And and make some impact uh. You know, moving forward.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Tina Marie: I think that that would be the best. But. I do want you. This is your gift. I want you to be able to use the time where you would like to. Most.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Tina Marie: So what what would you like to talk about? So you've got that. That sheet. What what's.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Tina Marie: Pops out to you the most. And what are you drawn to?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Dr. Areta: Um. So me in particular, I was.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Dr. Areta: Again. I was looking at the the financial information to gather. So I have. Revenue expenses and all that other fun stuff. Um! I don't have.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Dr. Areta: Profit margin analysis, but I have. I have numbers in front of me. Um.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Dr. Areta: You know. Of course it's always good to. Increase our margins and and make more, and so.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Dr. Areta: That'd be cool to kinda explore. Um.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Dr. Areta: Current staff roles and responsibilities. We probably have maybe one or 2 employees where that we can really.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Dr. Areta: Trust. Outside of me and Jadean to like.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Dr. Areta: Get things handled. Um. And so those are the 2 where we have a tendency to give more responsibilities to.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Dr. Areta: Um in terms of. This whole section over here.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Jadean.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Jay: Yeah, we have, we have a. One staff member. She's been with us for almost 3 years.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Jay: Um. We've had her in different positions, and she just. She can't master any of them. Um! Actually, she's um.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Jay: She's been one of the things that's been kind of like upsetting me lately, because, like a lot of like things will get missed. But we just.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Jay: Have too big of a heart. I have too big of a heart, I guess. I keep on allowing the mistakes and trying to correct them.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Tina Marie: So is she wanted because you just talked about people you can trust. And then you just talked about someone that can't do the job right? Or is that the same person you can trust.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Dr. Areta: No.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Jay: No, no, no, no, we have. We have 4 um, we have 4 people, and only out of the 4. Only 2 of them we see that have potential to grow and go further with us.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Tina Marie: So let's talk about a few, at least a couple different qualities of people that work for you.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Jay: Okay.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Tina Marie: Actually, I'm gonna talk about a few of them 2 of them you brought up. And I'm talking about others. So one of them is trustworthiness.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Tina Marie: That is not trainable. That is not something. You can just go out and find.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Tina Marie: Um. So when you have it. That is a currency that's high value right? There.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Tina Marie: Um. Sometimes that trustworthiness does not come with the most powerful brain.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tina Marie: It doesn't matter. You find a place for it, and you put it to work, and you count on it, and that is a. Block of your foundation that, you know, is not going to shake and move.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Tina Marie: That kind of that loyalty.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Jay: Good.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Tina Marie: Uh, Jenny, you just smell too sweet that they just wants you.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Jay: Sorry I hear you.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Tina Marie: Um. So that's 1 quality, right?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Jay: Okay.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Tina Marie: Another quality would be um, so so trust. Isn't necessarily.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tina Marie: Uh, there's different ways. You can trust it. So a person who is not going to tell your business, you can trust them to be. Discreet or honest, or whatever. There is also dependency that you can trust. A person is always going to show up on time all the time, do what they're asked to do, um, and and then um.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Tina Marie: Or or let you know when they don't understand something. There's there's degrees of that trust, and and how it can be applied. That's a value. Um, there's another value of someone who just is.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Tina Marie: So. They're really kind of the same. Just the person that shows up all the time just loves their job wants to be. There may not be the smartest person, but just always there.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Jay: Mhm. And that, and that is her. She. She's been very loyal, and that's 1 thing I do like about her. She's loyal, she shows up. She's been with us for almost 3 years, but.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Jay: Um.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Tina Marie: Is there anything she does? Well.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Jay: Yeah, she's really good at um.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Dr. Areta: Getting reviews.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Jay: Getting reviews. Sometimes she does amazing, and sometimes she just like falls off and like things will slip, or she'll fill out a form wrong, and it'll you know it's those are expensive mistakes you can't like. Send out a patient for an MRI that. They're not supposed to get. And just things like that, you know, and I don't have time to double check her work. I'm just trusting it'll get done.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Jay: But she is loyal, and she does. Want to be with us forever. And I that's what I do admire about.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Tina Marie: She's loyal, but she's inconsistent.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Jay: I'm sorry.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, her her performance.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Tina Marie: She's loyal, but she's inconsistent in quality.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, her performance is inconsistent.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Tina Marie: How much, how many hours a week does she work.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Jay: Uh she's working about. 30.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Dr. Areta: But. Pretty, mish.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Jay: 38. They're almost full time. But yeah.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Dr. Areta: Just a little, just a little on the room.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Tina Marie: We'll come back to her. But one of the potential solutions is somebody else has oversight. But the the thing that can't happen. Is, she can't cost you more time and energy than she's saving you.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Jay: Okay.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Dr. Areta: Exactly.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Tina Marie: That can't happen. It can't even be close.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Jay: Okay.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Tina Marie: Um, because that's not a good investment, and I'll tell you what else when you have. Somebody who is allowed to underperform on the team.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Tina Marie: It holds everyone else back. They feel disrespected because they show up the way that they show up, even if they're not consciously aware of it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Tina Marie: When you take out the weakest member of the team. And I, you know, or a person who's underperforming, who's inconsistent, who creates a burden for others because of their mistakes. The rest of the team raises up and performs better when that person is gone.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Tina Marie: It's also true of a toxic person. So if you have somebody who's negative, who bitches and complains, excuse my mouth, but a lot.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Tina Marie: When when that person is gone, everyone else is happier and they perform better, and you won't know it, because they won't tell you. You may get lucky and somebody tell you, but you will not know the impact until that person is gone. And so when you know inside your heart that you should have been making a leadership decision and you didn't do it.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, the rest of your team knows it, and they're judging you for it, even if it's not consciously.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Tina Marie: They're filling it. Um, and it is.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Tina Marie: Holding you back. I understand.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Tina Marie: Mutual loyalty. And wanting to take care of somebody.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Tina Marie: I also understand that. Enabling.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tina Marie: Is not a good property in quality. Um, and that trying to put a square peg in a round hole is really just.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tina Marie: Keeping the truth from finding their their perfect match that really does exist. But you're occupying the space with the wrong match.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Tina Marie: So things to consider. I don't have enough details to know that that there's not a match in your company for that, and maybe it's only 10 HA week doing reviews.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Tina Marie: So. The the thing is that people want to um.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Tina Marie: Make everything work under specific parameters. Full-time employee.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Tina Marie: You get to stay a full-time employee. Well. Or fire.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Tina Marie: The solution may be, hey? I'll offer you 10 HA week doing reviews. As long as you do them right.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Tina Marie: Because if you can't do one job right.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Jay: Mm-hmm.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Tina Marie: You can't have the job. You didn't earn the job. Um.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Tina Marie: If you want more hours. You have to be more consistent. So now you're giving them the choice and the power. It's not on you, you said. Here are the qualifications.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Tina Marie: Can you meet them? If you can't.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Tina Marie: Your your effort made the decision right. We just set the parameters. Does that make sense.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Dr. Areta: Think I like that.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Tina Marie: Don't! It's not about.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Tina Marie: You're just not good enough, right? Not you. As a person. This is the job.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Tina Marie: This is the description. Are you doing it, or are you not.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Dr. Areta: Blackout.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Jay: Okay.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, the whole, the whole team pretty much knows that she, the the one that we're talking about, is the weakest link in the group.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Dr. Areta: And you know they're all kinda.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Jay: Trying to figure out a helper, too, like.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Dr. Areta: And I'll try to help her, too, right just to kinda.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Dr. Areta: But again it just takes up everybody's time and effort and energy and. Trying to make sure that she's not making mistakes, and blah blah and.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Tina Marie: That is wonderful. But here's the thing that a lot of people fail to take into account. There are people outside of the office that are being impacted by this.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Tina Marie: Your children, your parents, their children, their parents, everybody else. Because when you take that stress home. It affects and infects.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Tina Marie: Everyone else that day. And people fail to take that into account in the equation. But it's a huge part of it.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Tina Marie: So why are we taking so care of this person and enabling something that they're not doing the work on. And consistency, by the way is a character thing. It can be a brain thing. It can be environment, it can be diet. It can be all kinds of things right.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Tina Marie: But as an adult they they have to own it. Um.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Tina Marie: Is that person worth more than all the other people? Impacted by that that risk.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Tina Marie: Um and the mood and the energy that happens by dealing with the risk and the problems that go into families. Not just the office.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Tina Marie: It makes it simple when you look at it that way right.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Tina Marie: Not easy. Not easy.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Dr. Areta: Like like again, yeah, like, it comes down to, you know, our our brain versus our our heart, right? Like we know.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Tina Marie: This painful.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Dr. Areta: We know that. She's not the best.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Dr. Areta: But our heart.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Tina Marie: But does it? But doesn't your heart care about your family and the other people's families?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Dr. Areta: It does. It does. Because.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Tina Marie: So I don't think it's 1 or the other. I think it's failing to make the connection that they're all related. And being willing to do the hard thing. So I'll tell you something else.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Tina Marie: Um and Jay. This might help you more, because. I'm not saying you can't do this, doctor, but I know females.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Tina Marie: We're wired more to want to like. Take care and love everybody.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Tina Marie: I don't know. I feel like sometimes it's not good to make that delineation, but. Statistically.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Tina Marie: Statistically, and that's a good reason for it, because if you guys got as emotional as we did about everything, some things would never get done. That's the truth. We need the balance.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Tina Marie: But Janine. The. It's about a 72 h window.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Tina Marie: Of. The deepest pain and grief and remorse. Everything that we go through the 1st 72 h are the worst.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Tina Marie: And then healing begins. And it's across the board with almost anything scientific data watching the brain. So.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Tina Marie: If you have to do this. You do it, and then you prepare yourself for the 1st 72 h.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Tina Marie: But it's not gonna take you that long, because when you make the right decision. Peace, kicks in.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Tina Marie: Even if that piece is on a momentarily. But it'll start to grow, and it'll start to grow, and there will be relief. That's how you know that you made the right decision.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Tina Marie: The energy in the office will shift, because everybody will feel guilty and sad and terrible. And then all of a sudden it that weight got released, and then everything starts floating up like Oh. Now, what can we do? We're not having to fix these things. Where can we put that energy.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Jay: Yeah. Um. I brought it to her attention already that she's walking a very thin line at this point.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Jay: Um.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Jay: And she knows. And.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Jay: And I've had to fire. I've had to fire friends, and that's why I don't really hang out with Staff, and I don't like I used to, you know, before, and I was just a manager. I would hang out with my staff and stuff like that, but not anymore. I don't want to get too close to them, because I know what needs to get done has to get done.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Tina Marie: No.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Jay: So I do have. There is space for her in my heart, and I do care about her as a person. But I've also brought her. I've also told her like this is your last verbal warning. The next time I'm writing you up. And then, after that, I don't know where you stand anymore. So.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Jay: So we're kind of we're trying to. We're obviously want to take the legal steps to make sure we have things in writing, or whatever, just in case, but.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. And and for that purpose, just as a matter of practice, I would just make every warning like. After the 1st verbal warning, everything is written immediately.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: Quickly. When you know you have to make a decision.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Tina Marie: You can document it, but. The other thing is, you know, hiring how you hire. So how did that person get into your company? In the 1st place.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Jay: Through me.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Tina Marie: And and.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Dr. Areta: No.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Tina Marie: So. There are things that.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Tina Marie: This is. This is why we do weekly, and it's a long thing, because there's so many facets of business, and and you're responsible for so much. So even if you have all the skills depending on what task you have that day, and all the other things you have to do. There, there's a lot to it.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Tina Marie: But improving hiring practices. What's up? You're I.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Jay: I was. Gonna say, I already have, like I have somebody in mind in the office already who I would like to do front um, I just need to talk to her and see if that's something that she would be open to and start training on it more. Um.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Jay: In the event that I'm not going to tell her. Obviously, in the event that we need to let someone go. But it's just to be able to cover if we need you to, if we need you to. So I already have somebody in mind that I do with. I feel would be a better fit in the front.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Jay: And then with the new person that we just hired, they can go to full time in the back because she's. Pretty good, too, with back office, so I kind of already have it in play, like in my head. How I want it to play out in the event that this has to happen quickly. So.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Jay: We're already. That's not really the problem. Um.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So staffing is a whole big, long conversation. And again, we've got little things. So we'll just focus. Do you didn't? Oh, so we can get to the finances. I asked Uh Steve what he wanted to talk about.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Tina Marie: Where would you like to spend most of this time today? What would be most helpful to you.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Dr. Areta: Talk to you, Babe.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Jay: Oh, he's she's asking you.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Dr. Areta: No, she's asking you.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Tina Marie: No, I'm asking you.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Dr. Areta: And by you you mean me.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Tina Marie: No jading.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Dr. Areta: Meaning.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Jay: Oh! Oh! I thought you.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Tina Marie: He said he said financials and and then um! And then we talked about staffing for a minute, but I would like to know where would you? So we can balance out the use of the.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Jay: Um. I would like to talk about the finances, too, I think honestly like, after I talked to the 1st time I was like. Honestly, I think I just need to work with her on more of my own personal life.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Jay: But um. I would like to talk about the finances. Obviously, why we want to make more money and.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Jay: That way. We're not stressing about anything, you know. I want to be able to.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Jay: Grow that that's 1 that's important to me.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tina Marie: Perfect. Okay, so um, Steve, can you screen share? Can you show me. What you've gotten and.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Dr. Areta: How do I do? How do I do that.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Tina Marie: Uh. So there, depending on how big your window is uh cause. Sometimes the menu is hidden. There should be a share. Button looks like an arrow, pointing up.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Jay: It says, share screen. It's right there at the bottom of.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Jay: The green one.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. Gotcha.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Dr. Areta: Desktop. Boom.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Tina Marie: Or you can just choose the window. So if you're gonna show multiple windows, just choose desktop. Otherwise you'll be back and forth and we won't see everything.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Dr. Areta: Okay, so let me just go. I guess this. Let's try that.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Dr. Areta: I feel like such a boomer.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Tina Marie: That's hilarious. Definitely, not.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Dr. Areta: Later is going on.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Tina Marie: We can't have all the same skills, you know. We just can't.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Tina Marie: We don't. We don't have to label it when we don't have the same skills.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Jay: That's a good point. That's a good point. We do. You're right.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Tina Marie: No. All right. Oh, well, I know that's.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Dr. Areta: Do you see? Do you see anything?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see, I see my notes.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. You see your notes.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Dr. Areta: So now we are gonna go to, I guess quickbooks.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay. So that's for this month.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Tina Marie: Um, you wanna just do quickly. Show me your P. And l's for um. Let's go last year and then work backwards a couple of other years.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Dr. Areta: Okay.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Jay: See, this is his, this is his, uh, this is his uh his thing. So um.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tina Marie: Domain.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Dr. Areta: And hey? And Tina, just so that we're clear. 8.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Dr. Areta: We're still babies in this whole game.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Jay: Don't! Don't laugh at us.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Tina Marie: I am not judging.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Jay: She's she's like they're so poor.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Dr. Areta: When I cause I I've seen.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Tina Marie: Oh, my, gosh, you guys, you guys.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Dr. Areta: I was hanging out. I was hanging out with Mark one time, and this guy showed me his credit card bill for his business, and I was just like. Mind blown, and so I'm like he's way bigger than us. I'm just just letting you know.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Jay: Oh, babe!

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay, first, st yeah, you guys. There are so many things that go into us the bigger you go.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tina Marie: So this is the conversation, too, that I I thought about it earlier, and I want to say it. But um. It wasn't the time.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: But as you, as you grow and expand, you're still 2 people. So there there becomes a ceiling of. How many people you have to manage, and and going back to trade-offs, how much gets.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Tina Marie: Falls by the wayside and doesn't get managed. Well, so maybe you've got and we call them vanity numbers right? Just really great, beautiful numbers. But what you're not looking at is what what has been diminishing inside of this and kind of. Corrupting and decomposing because we grew so big that we can't actually manage it. Well.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Tina Marie: There are so many different things that measure the health of a business. Um.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Tina Marie: At the end of the day, and this is why I take the holistic approach to business. I want to see happy people.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tina Marie: Business is just kind of the vehicle for that. You your teams, the families, your family, but also the families of the team.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Tina Marie: And. This bottom line is is is not the real bottom line.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Dr. Areta: Okay.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Tina Marie: So. But I'm gonna tell you you gotta let go of that. You really got to let go of that, because it will lead to poor decisions.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Dr. Areta: Well, this!

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tina Marie: It will lead to unnecessary anxiety which just robs you of joy. So you really got to focus on what is the growth? And that's why we're going to do this exercise. So I really want you to pay attention to this. Um my my favorite way to review things rather than going. What did I do wrong?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Tina Marie: Um, especially when I'm having a hard time. Do it is. Look back a year from now and then. Look at all the ways I've grown. Whether it's financially, emotionally relationships, things like that.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Tina Marie: Let's not talk about the waistline, because perimenopause is a bitch.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Jay: Okay.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Tina Marie: I didn't just go personal. What? No, anyway. Everything is.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Tina Marie: But for the most part I can measure progress across everything.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Jay: Okay.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Tina Marie: So take that into account. All right. So total income. How do you even have refunds in your job? That's insane.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Dr. Areta: They start treatment, and then they maybe they they bow out after a day or 2. Buyers remorse. Or something along those lines.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Dr. Areta: It's like we we collect payment upfront. So far, our cash.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Tina Marie: Oh, that's interesting!

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Dr. Areta: Our side of our business. We collect payment, upfront.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So let me. I'm just looking at these line items real quick.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Dr. Areta: Are you able to scroll, or do I have to scroll for you?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Tina Marie: You're scrolling for me. Thank you. I see you. But you're going too fast. It'll read that fast. All right. So all right. But.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Dr. Areta: So we yeah, we run a lot of.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Jay: Was this last year.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Dr. Areta: Say that again.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Tina Marie: You can't.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Jay: This was last year.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, this is, last year.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Tina Marie: All right. So total expenses.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Jay: Okay.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: Net operating income payroll. Where is your payroll? Where is your money coming out.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Dr. Areta: Our, so our. We pay ourselves uh, like a small salary.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Dr. Areta: So that's gonna be thrown into the payroll expenses over here. Like on paper.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Dr. Areta: I think I'm at 35,000 a year. Jd's at 30,000 a year on paper.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Tina Marie: On paper.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Dr. Areta: Um. And then, if we ever need money.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Dr. Areta: Then we we draw from the business. If we have to.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Dr. Areta: Are, we. Keep relatively low expenses relatively low at home.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Dr. Areta: So we never really have to pull too much. Um, all our insurances, health insurance, life insurance, all that we run through the business.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Dr. Areta: Our our phone, our. Gas. Everything with the cars all runs through the business as well, too.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Dr. Areta: Um. So we put the majority of our expenses on on this bad boy. Here.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Tina Marie: Well, the thing about high profit margins is high taxes, right? So you know. I get that.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. So we try to minimize as this as much as we can, I think, is.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Dr. Areta: The name of the game.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Tina Marie: So what are what are the lights on expenses at home? Let me mute this real quick. Sorry.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Tina Marie: And then what are the lights on expenses for the business? So that means. Basically, what does it cost you.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Tina Marie: To. Live at home.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Tina Marie: Comfortably. Not, you know. Not under stress, but not all the luxury items you want. Just.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Tina Marie: You know everything is okay. What is that monthly nut.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Dr. Areta: That number.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Jay: For home.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Dr. Areta: Oof.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Tina Marie: So you should know that off the top of your head.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Jay: We don't.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Dr. Areta: This is what this is, what I mean by you need to ask the tough questions.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Tina Marie: All right, what? Yeah, and and but you know, it's a whole process.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Tina Marie: You've been building all the things and. Anyway, building the parachute on the way down. So now we're just like, okay, let's build the thing.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Tina Marie: Um. Do you? Do you know what that is for? The business for the office? What is the monthly lights on number? What it costs to staff everybody to pay the rent.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Tina Marie: Utilities and everything.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Jay: Marketing. All of that. Yeah.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Dr. Areta: So I was. I was looking at that earlier, just before we hopped on the call.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Tina Marie: Month.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Dr. Areta: And it looks like we float around the well. I'm just looking at this bottom line number here.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Dr. Areta: Um.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Jay: That's yeah. What I figured about 24.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Dr. Areta: I need 25 k. Or whatever.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Jay: 30.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And then what do you do to bring business in.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Dr. Areta: Personal injury and cash.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Jay: We have marketing teams.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Dr. Areta: We have marketing teams.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Tina Marie: That's what I was getting at, Janine. Thank you. Um! So.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Dr. Areta: Yes. Yeah.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Tina Marie: What is. What comes into you? Do you have any idea what what your lead volume is, what your conversion rate is? What's your return on for each of your lead sources.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Jay: No.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay. And how often do you look at. Getting new money coming into the business and trying to improve that as a system.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Jay: Every I mean every month we I keep like a log of money that's coming in, and as long as. So I have an idea.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Jay: Of how much money the office is making. This is how I look at it is just. Like, okay. So if we've made this amount this month.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Jay: I just look to make sure we have enough to pay what we have, and then, obviously to pay us.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Dr. Areta: Okay, let me let me let me just chime in here real quick. So our marketing that we pay for is 2,500 a month.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Jay: 5.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. And by having them they give us leads for these personal injury. From these attorneys.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Dr. Areta: On average we will get. Maybe. Anywhere from like 35 to 50 cases.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Dr. Areta: Just from that $2,500 investment.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Dr. Areta: Now, if we're calling, each of these cases, give it a value of approximately. Call it 2 grand.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Dr. Areta: 3, grand, 4, grand anywhere in that range. And again, these are accounts payable because we we do the service. Now.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Dr. Areta: And we don't collect the payment until. The lien has settled.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Tina Marie: Like 12 to 18 months.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. So in my mind. If we're just paying 2,500 a month.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Dr. Areta: One of the cases that we receive from these, from these lawyers, or or anywhere. Will pay off that that expense which means everything else on top of that.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Dr. Areta: Is is kosher is, is a is a little bit of gravy. So. And since we've been 3 years in practice now, because sometimes it takes.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Dr. Areta: Months, years, several years, for some of these liens to settle. And now we've been in practice now for 3 years.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Dr. Areta: The money started to trickle in from some of the old cases from 3 years ago, 2 years ago things of that sort. And so last month was the the epitome of that when we hit our best month.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. Um. When this number came around.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Dr. Areta: Um, and that's a little bit closer to 100, because sometimes we do have cash that gets paid to us, so that show up on the books.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. Nice.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Dr. Areta: So, yeah.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Tina Marie: So your trajectory is good, and you like that. Yeah.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Dr. Areta: I think our trajectory is real good, and I and again.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Jay: I I would like to have our best month every month.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, yeah, I mean.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Tina Marie: A.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Dr. Areta: Well, I I think we we've already started to open the faucet of like these liens starting to settle, and we've been in it long enough.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Dr. Areta: So. I am hoping that as these liens start to settle.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Money like this will start coming hopefully. On a monthly basis. And then, if we have that coming.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Dr. Areta: And this is our just our operating expense. Now. We have a lot of leeway of, or a lot of things that we can do with what's left over.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Tina Marie: So. I have to think about phrasing my words carefully, because I don't tell people's business.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, you gotta do it! Tell us our business.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Tina Marie: No, no, no, no! I mean other people's business.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Jay: She doesn't want to talk about other people's business level.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, okay. Okay.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Tina Marie: Bye. But what I will say.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Tina Marie: And. Um. Part of this equation is that I only work with amazing people, and it's not patronizing. It's the truth.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Tina Marie: Um i. Like. I'm a thoroughbred racehorse, and I want to run, but I can't run. If I have a slack jockey that doesn't know what he's doing, you know.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Jay: Oh!

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Tina Marie: I'll try to like give you an analogy. So. But I but I want to have fun like if if you're a racehorse, you were built for racing like I'm built for. Building and growing and things like that. So it has to have the right.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Tina Marie: Um. Qualities, meaning the person that's running it. And also, you know, they happen to have enough money enough team enough. All these things.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Tina Marie: So when I say what I'm about to say, I'm pre-framing it with, it's definitely not just me. It's it's it's the combination. That's why I call this the catalyst call, because that's what I feel like. I can bring.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Tina Marie: But a particular law firm that I worked with starting about 4 years ago. Um.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Tina Marie: Has. Roughly tripled their volume since we started working together.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Tina Marie: The 1st thing that we did was dig into numbers. And.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Tina Marie: That person didn't want to do all of that work. I find that a very common thing that people are like, yeah, but it's a pain in the butt to do this, and I don't want to do this, so resistance shows up. Um. But when we go do this work and they focus on a couple of things. 1st of all.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Tina Marie: Really understanding what happens with your marketing. And then fulfillment. So we focus on.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Tina Marie: Acquisition, marketing, getting new people. Retention.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tina Marie: Um keeping the people that you have. Well, okay, acquisition, conversion, rate and retention.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Tina Marie: So you get a certain amount of leads. How many of those leads convert into actual clients? Right.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Dr. Areta: So, and and so. In terms of our 2 sides of the practice, right.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Dr. Areta: Again with with the personal injury and with with the cash side with the personal injury side. When those patients come in, they're ours.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Tina Marie: Yep.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, and there, and there are. They're with us for 20 visits. Um, and then they're gone. We don't need them to stay with us. We just we we do our lean treatment, and then they're gone.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Dr. Areta: Um, and then.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Tina Marie: You get people to come in for 20 visits.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Dr. Areta: Yes, ma'am.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Tina Marie: Ah!

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Dr. Areta: We're like, we're likable people. When we we actually care about our patients.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Tina Marie: It is that does not seem to be the industry standard. Am I right.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Some people try to overdo it.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Dr. Areta: Or some people.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Tina Marie: No, no, I mean like. Getting people even in for second and 3.rd

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Tina Marie: Maybe chiropractors are different than just like pain. Doctor.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Jay: Our. Oh, we're way different than pain management. Yeah.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Dr. Areta: The pain you're dealing. Yeah. Cause you're if you're talking about Chona. Yeah, you're on the pain side.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Tina Marie: You. Not necessarily just, Chona. I have. I have other doctors, but so I'm I'm trying to.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Jay: They just go in once or twice for, like pain management, but for chiropractic, they come in twice a week for.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Tina Marie: But also.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Jay: 20.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Dr. Areta: Couple of months for a couple of months. Yeah.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Jay: 25. Visits. Yeah, even our cash paying patients, they they treat for 24 visits.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Dr. Areta: Good. So, but in terms of your question of like what converts they all convert.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Dr. Areta: Anybody any patient that gets sent to us on a lean basis. They stay here.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Dr. Areta: Until they're done their treatment.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so how many law firms do you have, no matter where they came from? How many law firms do you have now? How many did you have last year?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Jay: Mhm. Um.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Dr. Areta: Poop.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Jay: We got a lot we don't even know how many to count, but compared to last well, last year we got a lot too. Um.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Dr. Areta: Put it this way when we first, st when we were working.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Jay: We are.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Dr. Areta: Without this new marketing team, and and Mark knows about the marketing team as well, too. But when we were when we weren't working with them we were working with Mark.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Dr. Areta: Couple of other different lawyers that we knew so probably could count it on our hands. And now.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Dr. Areta: Because of this marketing team. BA, basically, we're we're put on a directory that all these lawyers in California can access. Um.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Dr. Areta: And they'll see us right. So. Now we're working with at least.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Dr. Areta: What? 50 to a hundred. More than that, maybe.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Jay: We get new ones every day. It's hard. Honestly, we don't keep up with how many different firms we work with, but we do keep track of all the leads that do come in. I have a spreadsheet. I put them on.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Jay: Um. But we yeah, we work with a lot.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Tina Marie: Hold on a second. Is it. I'm trying to find it. Did I send that to.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Tina Marie: Is it the injury? Med network.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Dr. Areta: It's the doctors on leans.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Tina Marie: Doctors on mains. Okay.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Dr. Areta: Which is the it's the biggest one in Southern California.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So that's awesome that you tapped into that.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, so basically like, if they have a, if a lawyer has a patient. They're okay. All right, Mr. Patient. What's your address? They're gonna type in their address.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Dr. Areta: And then they're gonna pick. You know, they'll have a list of different doctors that's available in the area.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Dr. Areta: And where our location is is a primo location in terms of where we're at.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tina Marie: Nice location.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Jay: And we're 5. Star Review.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Dr. Areta: And we're 5 star reviews.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Jay: And we're 5, 5 star to 200 reviews. So we're we're pretty good.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Tina Marie: Hey! Look at jd, like, we got those reviews. Okay, okay, okay. And so you spend a lot of effort managing that. Or it just happens naturally, because you're that good.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Jay: My, yeah.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Dr. Areta: It.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Jay: Well, that's where.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Dr. Areta: Hopeful.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Jay: Our go ahead. You want to go, love.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, no, both. We. We make a concerted effort to try and get reviews from people.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Jay: We yeah.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Dr. Areta: Um and. In the industry, like in terms of the personal injury world.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Dr. Areta: A lot of patients. When they get sent to other chiropractic offices they get sent in the middle of nowhere. The facilities are horrible. They don't see the chiropractor. They don't even know who their doctor is, and it's just a mill. Where they do basic therapy. But when they come here.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tina Marie: Mm-hmm.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Dr. Areta: We have staff that are. You know, that people love. Um. I'm here all the time, and I'm you know, spending time with them.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tina Marie: Yes. Okay.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Dr. Areta: So they know who we are, and then they know how we operate.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So you've got a brand. And that's important. And I that takes into account. If we did work together a long time, that's something like if we're going through and hiring.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Tina Marie: You got to make sure that you keep that because that will cost you if you don't. So just keep that in mind regardless um.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Tina Marie: Oh, where was it? Okay, so do you have any idea. Do you track individual law firms and case managers? I know your leads don't come through there, but do you track them and know who sent you? What.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Tina Marie: Do you interact with them at all? Do you thank them? Do you like? Do you know what their pattern of sending you patients are.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Dr. Areta: So that would definitely.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Jay: I don't know their pattern.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Dr. Areta: That that would definitely be. A jadine thing. So Jadine is the one that handles all the the she's like the middle person that's.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Dr. Areta: Handles all the conversations with the lawyers. She does have a log. Where she keeps track of you know who the lawyers are.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Dr. Areta: Um, how well do they pay after the liens settle? Because some lawyers like it, while you.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Dr. Areta: Um. And so we we try to. It's basically a a Google.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Jay: Spreadsheet? Yeah.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Dr. Areta: Excel spreadsheet that we keep trying to keep track of everything.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Tina Marie: They work. And and like, do you keep track of the people that try to like nickel and dime you to death, and the other ones that just like pay you what you're actually owed.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Jay: You already know, we already know. Yeah, I mean, most attorneys kind of pay the same. So um, there's just.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Dr. Areta: Mostly.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Jay: As of right now. There's only one law firm that I will not work with. But um, other than that, it all depends on the settlement. So we don't have like set numbers, or it all depends on the settlement. We obviously want our patient to get paid as well as.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Jay: We want it to be fair for everybody, so we don't try to like hog all the money like we depending on the settlement. We'll make a fair arrangement.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Cool. Um what I would like to see. Let's go back. So I want to look at March of 2024, and then I want to look at all of 2024, please.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Dr. Areta: Join. 2024.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Dr. Areta: March of 2024. Oh, that's so cute.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Jay: What?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Tina Marie: He said. It's so cute.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Dr. Areta: Or March 2024. You don't even want to look at that shit.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Jay: Let me see what needs it?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Jay: It's so hard to see.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Tina Marie: It's only $70,000 less. It's gonna be dope.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Tina Marie: Um, okay, before we go to olives.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Dr. Areta: And it's. And it's negative. 6.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tina Marie: Okay, actually, let's do all of 2024, real quick.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Dr. Areta: But that's just last year.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh, you already! That was the 1st one you showed me. Huh!

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, this 4, 19, one.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay, show me march of 2023, please.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, that's gonna be even cuter.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Tina Marie: Grace yourself.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. It's gonna be very cute.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Tina Marie: Cute. Oh, no wrong wrong wrong.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tina Marie: Period.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay. This is why we do this exercise. Okay.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tina Marie: March of 2022, please.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, no! That was like.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Tina Marie: It's it's.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Dr. Areta: I think we.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Jay: Actually it wasn't, too we we just barely opened. I I was really proud of us. I think we hit the I. We hit the ground running. I think I'm happy.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Dr. Areta: I want to say we open.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Tina Marie: What happened? In 2023. Like oh, no!

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Tina Marie: Hold on! 2020.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Dr. Areta: That in that month in particular.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Tina Marie: 2024. What happened? In 2024.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Jay: Why, what was 2024? I didn't see it.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Tina Marie: The worst number out of all these. 3 years.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Jay: What is the only thing?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Dr. Areta: Memento portfolio.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Jay: Okay.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, that is a bad month. I don't know. March 2024. What the hell happened there.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Jay: I don't know.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Dr. Areta: We started with doctors on leans. What 2023.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Jay: We started with doctors on leans in October 2023.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. So we weren't there.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Jay: Also our marketing department started like they were just failing us. We had 2 marketing departments. During that time, and we actually let go of one because it was just horrible. So we were actually losing money than making money with them.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So we're gonna take a few minutes. We're gonna go down memory Lane.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Jay: Uh-huh.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Tina Marie: And let's start with um. March of 2023, and then we're going to go month over month. From there till now.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. April.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Dr. Areta: Is there a way to do this.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Tina Marie: Nope. This is the. It's a pain in the butt to go over the numbers, but you can't. There's no other way to have this kind of epiphany and insight.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Dr. Areta: Nope.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Tina Marie: Um actually there, there might be. There might be a a line graph bar report. Um.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Dr. Areta: Probably, yeah, yeah.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Tina Marie: Month over month for the last, like 18 months, but I don't know how to do it. I'll ask Chat Gbt. While you look that up.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Jay: Oh, my God!

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Tina Marie: This is quickbooks. Online.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Dr. Areta: April 2023. Display. Columns, compare.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Dr. Areta: It's gotta be a way to do that month to month. Sure there's a way I I can figure that out.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Tina Marie: I'll get it.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Dr. Areta: Eventually.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Uh, what are we doing? So this is April, okay, cool.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Dr. Areta: This April. Yeah. So like, this is again, before our personal injury side really started taking off. And we were reliant on the cash side.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Dr. Areta: With the cash side. It was a little bit more difficult, because in that, you know. Um, we had to go get the patients. We had to close the patients. Um, so we had that pressure on us with the personal injury side. There's no pressure, and that's 1 of the good things that I like about it is that we don't have to. Worry about closing patients and.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Dr. Areta: Trying to get them to sign up for our our care plans, or things of that sort. But it is nice.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Jay: Yes, so.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Dr. Areta: To have money upfront like that, though.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Jay: The numbers that you're seeing at the beginning are just basically us collecting cash upfront. Now we're collecting off of pi checks from all the pi that we've been doing over the years.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Dr. Areta: And so we can.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Jay: So that's why the the numbers are slowly increasing.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Right. And and that's what I want to look at what the trajectory is. So this will take a little bit longer to get the report that we're looking for. It's a custom report, and you have to build it. And so this, probably for today, is faster. But I put that in our notes so you can go get that later.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. Okay.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Tina Marie: Which would be a great thing to look at. Okay, so May, I'm looking at may go ahead.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Dr. Areta: May. Yeah. See, the numbers were cute.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Tina Marie: The.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Jay: We're just starting. Those are all that's all cash.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Dr. Areta: No love, I know. And again.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Jay: Good for a cash practice.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Tina Marie: Well, and the whole point of this is not to beat yourself up about what was but to celebrate what is.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Dr. Areta: And.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Jay: I, I.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Tina Marie: And to look at how you got here.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Jay: Thought, yeah.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Dr. Areta: And just so, just so we're just so we're clear.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Jay: I'm healthy.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Dr. Areta: Even when we were making just this. I felt richer.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Jay: So.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Dr. Areta: I felt like we had more more money than.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Jay: But now, looking at the numbers, I'm like, Dang, did we.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Dr. Areta: Like, Dang are we? Are we poor, are we poor?

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Jay: Now looking at the numbers.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Tina Marie: And and. That's.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Jay: I didn't. It doesn't. It doesn't feel like it. But.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Tina Marie: That's beautiful! Well. And also what tends to happen is when we make more people spend more. And that's why there's never really enough. And so that's a mindset, and that's a money management kind of thing.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Tina Marie: Um. And and maybe it's a.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Tina Marie: You know, not everybody goes through that. So there's that. See you.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Tina Marie: I'm just watching these numbers. It won't take that long. We're gonna go through this a few times. We've already been through several months. In 2 min.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Dr. Areta: It's August now. It's a month.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Tina Marie: Okay. The other thing I'm looking for is is there any um anomalies over months which will be easier with the line graph.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Tina Marie: What would be great is in the, and I'll leave this as a homework assignment jade is if we can build these custom reports, and then you notate things like this is when we started with this marketing agency. And so, you know, these will start to pay out roughly this time that type of thing.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, so we would typically float around the. As you know, 20 to 50 range.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Dr. Areta: With our marketing expense, or with our uh operating expense being at that steady where are we at. 20 to 25 KA month.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, this was a bad one!

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Tina Marie: So even then your so your expenses really haven't gone up. That's nice. Good job.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Dr. Areta: It really depends on the. So sometimes, like with these marketing things, um, they ask for sponsorship opportunities, or whatever. So we sponsor, you know $5,000 to an event. Just to meet a whole bunch of different lawyers and blah blah blah.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Dr. Areta: Okay.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Tina Marie: Got you. And so does November, December. Slow down for you as well.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, it's just that time of the year, and then we take time off. Uh, you know, vacay, or just.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Dr. Areta: Close the clinic down for a bit as well too.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Jay: Yeah, we'll shut it down for a bit. Everybody needs a break.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Tina Marie: Through that.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Dr. Areta: Yes, ma'am. True that.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Dr. Areta: 2024. 1, 1, 1.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Dr. Areta: 2024. Oops!

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Dr. Areta: Sorry.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So picked up from November, December.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Tina Marie: I'm also interested in where your trajectory will go, like, if we can look at this historical data where we're expecting it to go this year. All right.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Tina Marie: Big jump. And I realize some of that is the timing of things paying off from you, starting the marketing agencies.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Dr. Areta: Yep.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Jay: This is still, yeah, this is mostly still, just cash, like we haven't really.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Jay: We're still not really collecting the pi checks. I think we didn't really start collecting more of those until towards the end of 2024.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Jay: Beginning of this year is when it started, really. We're not really stressed about the cash side of it as much. Because before we, that's all we relied on to pay, everything is the cash from our patients.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Dr. Areta: The hell? Is this. That's an anomaly.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Jay: Maybe we sponsored, or something.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Dr. Areta: Oh! I know we pay taxes.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Dr. Areta: This tax season.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Jay: Oh!

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. Uncle Sam needs to get paid.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Tina Marie: Uncle Sam needs to do something, but I don't know. It's get paid. What I but I don't say anything.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Dr. Areta: And.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Tina Marie: Okay. May all right.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Tina Marie: Puppy's over there yawning. See, we're already almost there. Well, we've got a few to go, but still.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Tina Marie: Gone through a lot. Okay.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Dr. Areta: You guys being curious to see? Like, okay, why is this number. Makes me want to look at it.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Tina Marie: It should. Because there will always be when you start to look at the data. More often there will be revelations, and those little things.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. I've never done this.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Jay: We? Yeah, we don't, I? We're I guess we're not. We're locking that side of the business.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Tina Marie: Nobody does this, almost nobody does this. So.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Dr. Areta: Oh, this is the best! So the bad one.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Tina Marie: Don't feel bad.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Dr. Areta: This was a bad bad month.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Jay: Okay.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Tina Marie: This is a perspective exercise. And it's really.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Dr. Areta: The hell.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Tina Marie: Useful.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Dr. Areta: I'm gonna open one more page. Give me one. Quick sec cause I wanna cause I'm curious.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Dr. Areta: About that month. Now. Here's our 2024 love.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Jay: That's 2025. You have to go. It's a completely different log. But, Babe, let's go finish going through those, and then you can go through that later.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Dr. Areta: Okay.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Tina Marie: Good idea.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Jay: And then just it's July 2024. We'll look at it. And see what happened.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Tina Marie: I'll give you the notes from this call to Jamie, and I think you probably just wrote that down. But. Ah!

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Jay: I'm like. Can you go a little faster? Please.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Tina Marie: Let's go. Let's go.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Dr. Areta: Hey? Just wait till you wait. Wait till I get that line chart, and then you'll be. Then you'll see.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Tina Marie: Okay. September.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Tina Marie: Coming back. We're in it. Now let's go. Let's go.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Dr. Areta: Oh!

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Tina Marie: Come on! Come on!

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Dr. Areta: Almost there.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Tina Marie: No pressure, Steve.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Dr. Areta: Home.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Tina Marie: Nick Foster. I'm just kidding.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Dr. Areta: All of them. Boom, boom.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Dr. Areta: Boom.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Tina Marie: I would cave under pressure. I would click all the wrong things if this was me having to do this right now. Whoop! December.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Jay: That was a. Yeah, that was a sad month.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Dr. Areta: Well, that was a Christmas time when we took off.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Jay: Oh, yeah, we're only open for like 2 weeks that month.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Dr. Areta: Love, the clinic. What is this?

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Dr. Areta: Sorry. 2025.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Dr. Areta: Now we're this year.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Tina Marie: And do you guys mentally like and and financially prepare for that down period, those 2 and a half months roughly.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Jay: No.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, we have. We have savings. We have other.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Jay: Oh, yeah, we have savings and stuff, but we don't like.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Dr. Areta: But we don't touch it. We've never had again. We we live relatively frugal.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Dr. Areta: Um. Relatively.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Dr. Areta: And.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Tina Marie: I mean you can't take it with you. There. I've never seen an armored car following a hearse, so you know.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Dr. Areta: All of them. Well, there's February, right? So now we get into the forties and the fifties, and then.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. Last month was.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Tina Marie: My heart was. The bone.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Dr. Areta: That's when all of the checks really started to trickle in.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Jay: But it seems like as even like this month it looks like we're about to end at about like. 50, some 50, yeah, 50. Again.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, we're ending at 50 this month. I think alright. Let me see, help me!

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Dr. Areta: Right, now boom, current, date. Yeah, we're about 46. I'll probably go check the mail, and there might be some checks in there that I'll deposit to.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Dr. Areta: We'll probably end at around 50.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Dr. Areta: Uh, and I think Jadine says we have about another 11 grand coming next. So maybe. Sometime later, this week.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Dr. Areta: To start off next month, and so. It's just.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Jay: Now we're starting to feel the pi money come in. Yeah. And we have, like, we're how. So for us like, this is a huge.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Jay: A huge, huge progress for us, because we're used to seeing like 2030. And we're like working really hard for that.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Dr. Areta: And even like, even like I remember talking to Mark. And I was, you know, I would discuss like, Oh, yeah, you know, eventually want to open another clinic. Blah blah! He's like, just wait for the. Wait for this. The checks to start rolling in.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Dr. Areta: Because some some cairos have jumped, jumped the gun in the beginning, and.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Dr. Areta: And they crash and burn if they if they try to open up a little too fast.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Jay: If I'm being honest, I don't think we're. Yeah. The the checks are starting to trickle in now, but I don't think we're at the the place yet where it's smart to open an office.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Tina Marie: No, what you want to be is almost full capacity.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Jay: Yeah. Yeah.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Tina Marie: And.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Dr. Areta: At this location.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Jay: I need more of the checks to start coming in. Yeah.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Tina Marie: Almost bursting at the seams.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Jay: Mhm.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Tina Marie: Before you try to move in, because if you don't. The financial suffering that you're going to go through, and it will just break you.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Jay: Yeah.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Tina Marie: So. Um! The other thing is, you have to get everything lined up first, st you know. Talk to your lead sources and let them know. Hey? We're about to go. Do this. Can you help us with the? We're good. We're going to have um.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Tina Marie: Increased capacity. Can you help us fill that like what what you know you? So you want to have really solid relationships and make sure that that can happen. Then you want to start very, very, very lean, small team, skeleton crew.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Tina Marie: Right.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Jay: That's why we try to keep it now.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah. And and that's why. And that's why we sponsor those events.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Tina Marie: Hey!

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Dr. Areta: So that way, we have, you know, these good relationships with this marketing team.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Dr. Areta: Um. They know that we're young, and they know that we're hungry. Um. And so when they see us sponsoring those events which again, only the older chiropractors that have been in the business for a while, and when they see the younger people doing it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Dr. Areta: Then I I'm I'm thinking that it puts a put. It puts us in a good light that we're that we're capable. Of sponsoring such events.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Okay. So here's what I would love to see happen is, I would love you guys to go.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Tina Marie: Through these things from day one forensically. I want you to look at what came in, what went out, and look at the patterns. I'd love you to go try to find the line graph so that you can actually see it over time.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Tina Marie: Um at least uh net revenue and expenses, gross revenue expenses, net revenue. Right. Um! Any any other thing that you want to keep an eye on? Add that to the line chart, so you can see how it changed over time!

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Tina Marie: Then what I'd like you to do is is either whether it's a screenshot and you write on it digitally, or you print it out, and you write on it with a pen. Notate. Some of the things that happened on that timeline.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Jay: No problem.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Tina Marie: Um, what happens when you look at that is just it's a new perspective. And understanding that doesn't happen until you look at the data in that particular way, and the relationships that it has over time and with activities and choices that you've made. Okay.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Dr. Areta: I've always been. I've always been scared to look at this stuff. Actually.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Uh, that's almost everyone. But this is this is why this is why the people who have really thick skin and will do the hard, things smoke, everyone else.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Tina Marie: Because they're not afraid. They'll make the mistakes. They'll they'll face up to it. But if you have an avoidant behavior you're avoiding success.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Jay: We're gonna do it.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Tina Marie: Success. Yeah, success has to work through the problem. So the other thing is, Jadean, is that I want you to do the same kind of thing with all of your case, managers and all of your lead sources.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Tina Marie: So whatever you know is going to be improved, increased. And your perspective should change if you go through it, because we all know what we know, but nobody can hold everything in their amazing brains all the time.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Jay: Mhm.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Tina Marie: So what you want to look for is patterns that you might not have recognized. Do you have somebody that's just massively consistent and always sending you times. Do you have people that like sent you a ton, and then dips. And then you called them, and then they sent you more like, what kind of patterns can you notice about where the leads have come from over time. Not just the brokers that connect you with the case managers, but the case managers themselves right.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Tina Marie: Um. So if you guys bring that back next week, then then what I can at least leave you with the last call. I don't want it to be the last call. But whatever, if it's the last call, then.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Tina Marie: You'll have something that you can. You can keep working with and understand that. One of the biggest levers that you can have is looking at your data.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Tina Marie: And. Asking yourself questions and looking for patterns.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Tina Marie: And then. Understanding? What created?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Tina Marie: That pattern. Why, it occurred. And if you like it, how can you get more of it if you don't like it? How can you avoid it? How can you improve it. That kind of thing.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Dr. Areta: Okay.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Jay: I don't know how I'm gonna get that information. I don't. Babe, do you have.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Dr. Areta: We'll I'll help you. We'll look at it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Jay: Okay, I'm like trying to. I don't trying to think of a night way to to figure that out. But okay.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Dr. Areta: Well, we're gonna just have to dig through our Google, our Google docs that we have. Yeah.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Tina Marie: So.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Jay: Okay.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Tina Marie: Yes, um. I'll give you a tip to do either of you play with AI at all.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Jay: Yes. Ah, no! We.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Dr. Areta: I've been wanting to, but I haven't. I haven't. I haven't dived into.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Jay: We want to. But we yeah.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Tina Marie: Look.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Dr. Areta: But I've been wanting to.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Tina Marie: If you guys can figure out a way to get Tina in the budget, I will show you all kinds of things, but if we can't.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Jay: Wait. What? Okay, real quick, Tina. What is Tina's budget? Because we were a little confused on your last one? What is it? 4 a month.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Tina Marie: It is. If you pay 6 months at a time.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Jay: That's what I thought, okay.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Tina Marie: Um, it's it's 4,500. If I think I said it wrong last time. It's 4,500. If you pay quarterly. And then it's 5,000 a month. If you pay month to month.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Jay: Okay.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Tina Marie: And for me. That's the incentive to get people like. Look, I'd stay here. I don't do marketing. Everybody comes word of mouth.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Tina Marie: And so it's kind of my reward for okay, you're going to commit to me. I'm committing to you. I'm not going to worry about looking for anybody else. That kind of thing.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Jay: Yeah.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tina Marie: So. Um.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tina Marie: Chat gbt. Ah!

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Jay: Love it.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Tina Marie: I'm such a nerd, let me tell you. 1984, little Tina, I'm 48, almost 49. I don't care. I'm not ashamed. I'm proud I've been through it. Okay, I earned these stripes, all of it.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Jay: That's right, girl. That's right.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Tina Marie: Uh playing on the radio shack. Trs. 80 in Jackson, Mississippi. My, my family were the only non blacks in the whole family, so I've been through all kinds of things. Okay. Uh learned how to code then. So I've been nerdy from the beginning, and I love it.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Tina Marie: But if you go have a conversation it could be Chat Gbt. It could be Claude, it could be Grok. It could be whatever you like. Pick a platform, stick with it, for the most part.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Tina Marie: But. One of the things it's really good at is processing data.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Tina Marie: So like if you say, look, I've got all of this raw data. I need to extract this.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Tina Marie: Could you help me with the formula.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Jay: Oh!

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tina Marie: That would help me extract it. Now the formulas don't always work right out of the gate.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Jay: Mhm.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Tina Marie: Sometimes you have to go okay, and then you screenshot it right and show it. This is what happened. It'll be like, oh, my bad. I should have done this.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Dr. Areta: Fine tune it.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Tina Marie: So it does make mistakes. So you have to be willing to be iterative with it and go through it. But it can shorten the the length of the homework session.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Tina Marie: Which is really nice. Because this stuff is tedious.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Tina Marie: But don't avoid it. Go through it and try to get what you can capture. The other thing is, sometimes we don't. Because people don't know how important data is. We don't necessarily capture what needs to be measured. In the 1st place.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Tina Marie: You may not have everything that we need to be able to get. What I want to get at. So we take what we can. And then what we might do is say, okay, you need to create a better tracking system.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Tina Marie: So that this data is easier to 1st of all just capture and then analyze. Because once you analyze it, then you know how to manipulate it. Okay, this is what it reported. How do I make the report look better. How do I like make those numbers better?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Tina Marie: So that's the assignment for this week. Um.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Tina Marie: Jadean. I don't have your number. We didn't connect on signal, but while we're still here you have access to me. If you want to ask questions. If you want to tell me stuff like.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Jay: Okay.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Tina Marie: The the things that are on your mind like you want to work through until we're done next week. I'm I'm here with you. So use me.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Tina Marie: I'm I'm offering that to you. People rarely take me up on it, and then they'll be like. But you can't abuse me.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Jay: Okay. Thank you.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Dr. Areta: Doing the program. For chat. Gpt, you use a subscribed model. Right? Yeah? Obviously, you have to subscribe to that thing. And then.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Tina Marie: You, do you? But you could try the free version first, st you know, before you pay for it. But the $20 a month is worth it.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Dr. Areta: Okay. Because I've I've been right.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah, I've been telling her like, I I wanna somehow incorporate AI into. You know, streamlining some of the processes that we do, it would take time off, or it would save a lot of time.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Tina Marie: You will go faster.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Dr. Areta: A labor, time.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Tina Marie: But you need to know how to use it.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Dr. Areta: Install. Yeah, that's the one thing I need to learn.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Tina Marie: And that's. That is not something that most people are good at, even the ones who are AI experts. I'm gonna.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Tina Marie: Do this a little bit, because. Because because it is a, it's a process. And and people want to think that AI can do all of the thinking and strategy for you.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Tina Marie: It can't. It may do better than what you do. But. It, it will still have some gaps, so it's a skill.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Dr. Areta: Still gotta teach it. Still, gotta learn, you know. Still gotta learn it. Yeah.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, and and values it so it will give you output based on what it thinks is valuable in the answer. But it may not be the right value, system and perspective. So take that into account.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Dr. Areta: Okay, I'll definitely be looking into that. Then, sweet.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Tina Marie: But yeah. So I I will wait until this transcription is done. I won't leave my desk and I'll send you guys the notes. I'm gonna append it to the first, st Doc.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Tina Marie: So that you guys can have it and make use of it and um, before we wrap up. I know we're over. It's okay. Do you have any questions?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Jay: No, not right now.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Tina Marie: No. All right.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Dr. Areta: I'm good.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Tina Marie: Well, you guys are awesome, and it was great talking to you. Thank you for spending time with me, and I will.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Dr. Areta: Thank you. Always.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Tina Marie: Talk to you next week. We're we're good for the same time next week, right.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Dr. Areta: Got you next week.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Jay: Okay. Yes, Tina.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Dr. Areta: Yeah.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Tina Marie: Talk to you. Then.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Dr. Areta: Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Jay: Alright, bye.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Tina Marie: Bye.
