00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm trying to get myself this, stabilized real quick. Sorry. Sorry. How do you say?
00:00:32 - mark sweet (3)
Dan, how was college?
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:36 - mark sweet (3)
You're about college.
00:00:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, wasn't great. I mean, wasn't until that final moment.
00:00:47 - mark sweet (3)
Oh.
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then Denise completely, which she was doing so good. And then at the last moment, she just lost her ship. And Denise is like her friend. It's very very empathetic.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, oh God. She's wearing it all over her face So and like so she's hugging Evelyn.
00:01:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She backs up. It's all over her face Then she just totally just starts bawling and Evelyn she broke Evelyn Evelyn starts crying like and I was like, oh God now I'm gonna start right like I thought I was gonna get out clean And then Evelyn was like do you need another hug and then they hug again and then Denise was like sobbing at that point I'm like, oh Jesus Christ I Then we go we get in the car and she's like Just breaking down in the car. Like in the passenger seat saying all kinds of I'm like, I'm not gonna repeat some of it, but I'm like, okay Like all right, but one of the lines was like so that's it You do all this work and then she thrust her hands out here. You just hand them over and I'm like, oh boy Like I'm not sure that's exactly I can what's happening here, but I guess in a way, it's what's happening. And then now we're in the aftermath. There's already been one episode today where she comes in crying and she goes, it's fall. I go, okay, I'm not sure where this is headed. It's fall. She'll never get to eat pumpkin pancakes.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, what?
00:02:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, oh, you're pumpkin pancakes. This is true. I'm like, okay. And then that whole thing. So I'm like, oh, boy, I talked to some of friends that just did this. And they're like, oh, you're going to get a month at least. Okay.
00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it's going to be all year. It's going to be all the things that you did traditionally. And they're not the same.
00:02:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, apparently this hard core, like just random crying and what like, and they're like, it sort of dissipates in that. But yeah, then it's going to be the thing. Yeah, it's going to be Halloween and it's going to be whatever. And then Evelyn's like, she's no help.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. No.
00:03:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She's very much like me. And when my parents dropped me off to college and they were driving away, I guess, I think my mom was upset, right? And she turned to my dad and said, you know he's never coming home again. And my dad's like, what are you talking about? She's like, he's never going to come home again. And I never did. So she knew, whereas with my brother and sister, she did not say that. And she's like, you, I knew, I knew you weren't coming back. And I never moved home again. Evelyn's already talking like that. Like in Evelyn's mind, she's not coming home next time, or in Denise's like, what are you talking about? Of course you're coming over the summer. I like, oh, not everyone does. Just enough why I was that kid. Were you the oldest?
00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I went through that during the pandemic and perimenopause, and I got COVID the first time. Before we knew what that was. That was fun, that was fun.
00:04:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm still not better yet. But I'm sure this is just a flon, and make a frickin' hot flash.
00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I know. Now I get to live with someone with that too, so it's...
00:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Enjoy it, Dan.
00:04:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
it. Not new to me.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to Mark, maybe.
00:04:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark's got like 10 years, probably, for what happens, but, cuz I don't Yeah.
00:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, leads. Yeah, I wanted to look at LiveFi, actually. Did you talk to Monkey?
00:05:01 - mark sweet (3)
That's it. Everyone.
00:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:05:04 - mark sweet (3)
They're all working on it. But generally speaking, when I get on them, something happens.
00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm not just that. Arizona is. of helping us a lot for sure.
00:05:23 - mark sweet (3)
I needed to because last month it was down.
00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. And then you just, oh, there it is. 63 and we're at. The 23rd.
00:05:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So last week kind of just. Felt apart little bit.
00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And. Anything else standing out to you. So. So. You. Avoid this. Let me talk about it a lot, paying attention more to intake, oh I swear, I could just turn on the air conditioning, like over power, just drop the temperature of 15 degrees, it's not even hot, it's 5 degrees cooler than it normally is, I'm freaking dying, you're lucky you're meant, that's all I'm saying. Anyway, that was the first time I'd ever thought about like dispersing the burden across the attorneys, but I also think that the insight, even though I'm sure they'll be annoyed, some people more than others, but having them randomly listen to five, and maybe not randomly, maybe strategically if we identify them first, but listen to intake calls so that we can get some other feedback about how they're doing and what they might be doing better. It's not about picking on intake, it's leveraging intake. It's that they are the front line of the entire business and they get very little attention on what they're doing. We should be listening to intake calls.
00:07:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It shouldn't be random. It should be five calls, five person, five random calls per person.
00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and we should be having the attorneys help with that. So they listen to five across the board and maybe we rotate it. Maybe one attorney listens to one person on intake one month another the next month and they're all assigned different people so that they're all getting feedback from each of the attorneys every month and it isn't so much about the intake person but the intake process. process. The framing is going to matter about, you know, how offended or egotistical people get. The framing matters. But instead of you being the one to do all of it, and you should be doing some of it, we really should be inspecting the intake process much more. It's just too important. And we've been talking about it for so long. There's so little that you can fix for sure. But if we're using multiple different brains as well as time, to look at it, we have the better likelihood of coming across something where we're like, oh, no, but I notice this happens rather consistently or fairly inconsistently, this should be changed.
00:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, not to be a dick, but the attorneys would be useless in this arena. Um, it'd be like a total waste of their time.
00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How?
00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
As you listen to the intake calls, it's the the factor of intake to me is going to just be purely are they following the script? Because if they aren't, that's the problem, right? And so the attorneys can't, they have nothing to offer, right? the goal of intake is to extract the right information to say this needs to move towards a retainer. And that's like a checklist. And it's like, were you in an accident? Yes, were you at fault? Yes, call over, like for the most part, right? That's where you're in accident.
00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fixing the script. So if they notice that the call is going a particular way, and they're going, okay, well, I would have needed to know this or needed to know that, then they can help them for the script.
00:09:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The attorneys don't get to choose what they get to know, right? It's like a fact pattern.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The present or not? about some of the cases that they're dealing with. And I don't know, I don't know, damn, this is that.
00:10:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, tell me what, tell me what your, I don't know why you're saying this, right?
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you have a question about some of the cases that they've got and some of the cases that they lost and they got subbed out on, they're like, we shouldn't ever have this case to begin with. So I don't know how often that comes up, but it's enough that I've heard it a few times and I wonder what could have been done to prevent taking that case in the first place. It came through intake. Was there anything in the process that could have been identified? So I, knowing that we don't know what we don't know and wondering what kind of insight would we get if they spent just five calls a month each one for a year, what would we learn? I can't see how we don't learn anything valuable.
00:10:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I would say go back to the subouts in the process. the these case go identify these cases and be like oh whatever these are the suburbs what was the reason these are the ones that we lost whatever lost means right now obviously not lost the case because these don't over trial but and then what was the reason and then are there patterns in those reasons if there are it's fixable but if they just happen to be and they could be because I don't know the volume of sub-ops and the volumes of this other category but if they just happen they just be these one-off scenarios like and to be honest I could back me up here or not most of the reason the bad cases get through is because they've been lied to and then it's like oh that turned out to not be true you I mean I see the intake notes then you find out after the fact oh no they were actually at fault and they were deemed at fault by the police but in the intake they don't say and then when it goes to the right before they sign the retainer also the comes out. Oh, yeah, no, the cops did show up. I was at fault. And it's like, okay, so you just wasted our time. So some get caught in advance. And I think some leak through. And it's because the people are, I think some are lying. And I think some are just not totally, you know, no one's ever been in a car accident. So they're not communicating things correctly. And you see it also with the leads, right? So many leads come in and say, do you have an attorney? No, not only did they have an attorney, they already said or settled their case. The intake is doing calls where it's like the case is settled. So what how does that because they lie in the form? They think that they can get a better result. They think that they can sue again. Like, I don't know, but now they can like, it's, I feel like you should dedicate someone to. like not mark, like get someone, I don't know if you can hire someone outside to do this, but to like just put themselves on this and say, hey, I want you to make sure this is your only job. I want you to make sure that they're following the script, and this is how you're going to do it, you're going to listen to these calls. I mean, in theory, you could listen to the calls, transcribe them, run them to through chat GPT, have chat GPT know what the script is, and be like, is what was wrong with this, whatever, but just because it's about introducing consistency. I guarantee you, they're not consistent with these in the script. I guarantee you, because to get people to adopt those, they fall into old habits, right? The old habit is sweet love, how can I help you? And then instead of just being like thing bang boom.
00:13:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, also you can put something.
00:13:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, that was, I was going to say that you're on Pepsi.
00:13:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So who's the best place now?
00:14:03 - mark sweet (3)
It's split between two people, Mia and Maria. So Mia is doing the, do we take this case, not take this case, Maria is making sure the file is correct before it gets converted over the goods.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think you could put something in the script that says, just so you know, I want to make sure that that you're aware, if the case has already been blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever, that will be discovered and we will not be able to help you like just make a disclaimer, just basically let them know you're wasting your time if you're lying about this, this or this, but you don't say it that way. You just say, just so you know, this happens. This is how it gets discovered. Nothing can be happened and you may be receive a bill for our time that whatever just skirts up. You can't.
00:14:59 - mark sweet (3)
No. We really.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really can't because of how we're built because of contingency fee I completely totally get what we're saying because right now there's zero repercussions that I'm just glad I'm lying to us but that's unfortunate part of our business okay and I completely agree with you I would love to sense these people who waste our time about them well at the very least for sure we should be listen look any call center with their whole job and their business is calls which yours is still this call will record it for quality assurance and people are actually listening to the calls evaluating them and then coaching them we don't do that it needs to happen that needs to happen that's what it should be someone that does that well it's not going to happen unless Martin makes it happen
00:16:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, I'm wondering if you can hire someone to do this, someone probably does this. Yeah. Look into it.
00:16:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But is it not more cost-effective to train somebody in-house to do it?
00:16:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, because they don't know how to do it. It's like you get them on the script and then you hand it over to someone in-house, right? you get to the expert, like, hey, help me get to some place.
00:16:27 - mark sweet (3)
The ones for this, because the attorneys want everything perfect when it comes in. So they would say no to several of these cases that turn out to be just fine, because not everything is perfect, because they're not. I'm going say salespeople for lack of better term. Okay. would be some of the worst ones to do this.
00:16:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The other bit is we need this thing that I'm sending to Stacy, because as I'm doing it now, I'm going to fill in like 12 more records and then send it to her. But it's this absurdly analysis. So I wanted to see, like, I want to go back. to them and say, okay, here's what happened from our purview or our perspective. Is that so they're unable to contact, right? For whatever reason, that's one of our things. So our contact rate, if it's unable to contact it, that means we never were able to get in touch with them. So they're like, this is our, so our contact rate is everything other than that. Well, it's whatever it is, 80% and whatever. How does that compare with your other problems? And then we're the only ones giving them turn-down reasons. In my argument to them is, hey, turn down for no injury. That's not, that was never a lead. If there's no injury, there's no lead. So your no injuries are this percent, your no insurance are this percent, your already have an attorney, which they got those, or this percent. And give them that breakdown and say, this is why, so, and it will hopefully reveal math, For us it says this is how this would work you would need to give us Less of these and more of those whatever they are and like maybe they can modify their form I don't know. I don't know what they can or cannot do or it's just that The their business is predicated on their customers not really knowing their numbers, which is what I believe is true But well of math on that then it would be then this math will break down or whatever you want to do it Can then be applied to monkey which I want to do I want to do a side-by-side between them ago This is our number one vendor and either their numbers are gonna be their numbers are gonna have to be different I just don't know in what way. I don't know if they were theirs are gonna be have higher contact rate I don't know where they're gonna differ, but they're gonna differ and then we get this side-by-side view But then you could use this as part of like an early warning system, right? could then see hey Here and I don't know I could send you a little to Josh about this this. I would love it if I could build something solidify and be like, hey, dude, if this is off trend, make it red. If this is on trend, make it green. I don't know if it has that capability, or it'll just be a matter of knowing the numbers. But you would look at monkey and say, okay, monkey for the month is that X amount of leaves, that's on point, right? on track. But then you can look at the breakdown of the turn down reasons and be like, okay, that's off. This number is already, whatever it is, this number is already starting to look wrong. Their contact rate is wrong. So if the contact rate is wrong, then you could go look at intake potentially. If the attorney already represented is higher, then that's a lead quality issue. And you can point that out to them or whatever. And then conceivably, you just build this on track lead dashboard that gives you this insight into each vendor on those. So on that sort of for the top level and then sub-level. And then hopefully Josh can go back. Because then you would, like, would you have seen last week coming?
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, Mark?
00:20:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, that is the question about last week. What went wrong? Right? Well, I don't know if it was intake. I don't know, was it just lead volume? Was it another internal metric inside of lead, like this is what I was just talking about? We don't really know.
00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello, Mark.
00:20:49 - mark sweet (3)
No, I'm here. I'm just looking at the lead volume, because it doesn't look like the volume dropped off.
00:20:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right, not them.
00:20:58 - mark sweet (3)
Right.
00:21:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, I was looking at something for someone else today, just randomly, and I looked at one thing and I said something's broken, and it's not something that we track, but I just looked at this one thing, I looked at the sort of the brief history that I had. I was like, hmm, this should have happened more times than it has since that last time. Like we need to look into this because something is broken somewhere, but it's not a metric we track. It's not something that doesn't really matter matter, but it was like, oh, we could have been alerted to this because it broke in March, as far as I can tell. Six months later, we're realizing something might be broken.
00:21:52 - mark sweet (3)
No, I mean, when I'm looking through it, know, Walker's based on pay his website is just more what it's at. Life's is the one that's just
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Massively different which is no they're done. They're not paying them right now.
00:22:04 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, so yeah That's a huge difference volume wise, but it wasn't like you were signing up a lot from them. Yeah The monkeys the only other glaring number along with fully bay who's 16 off but 16 off with another week in apt to go is not Take us per se Blue steel seems to be pretty much exactly where they're supposed to be. So really the only gigantic difference is monkey But it's not volume it's gotta be it's something Looks to be relatively the only thing that's different because comparing in three weeks versus four plus weeks Yeah, right so that's my point right there.
00:22:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like oh, it's something Internal it's something within those leads if not volume there for some sub level So it's going to be re-type or contact grade or something.
00:23:11 - mark sweet (3)
And then for whatever reason, he's going back through a lot of what I don't know why I just ran away. So he used to use way back in the day to do leads.
00:23:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're sending into a long way?
00:23:31 - mark sweet (3)
Getting notifications that there's a new lead. So take through a lot of what I learned.
00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you really far from your mind? Because you're so quiet. And if I turn it up any louder again, it's going to blast my hair down.
00:23:49 - mark sweet (3)
But I don't think it's him. No, it's me.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I have a sore throat. I'm trying not to yell. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'll trade you my hot flash for a sore throat. I'm I use my song. Okay, anyway, so what I mean. Is there an issue with them doing that? what what is the is there a concern with them doing that?
00:24:24 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, yeah clients getting texted on multiple You know numbers emails whatever.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so when did you notice that? Have you addressed it?
00:24:36 - mark sweet (3)
Uh, it just happened starting Friday, so it's still brand new so I'm trying to figure out why. Okay Okay I have a feeling because they just had a quote unquote AI to what they do
00:25:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Of course, I could hold it.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Dan, Josh's report, because we're at the end of the month now for, I think it was cost of lead by source by state.
00:25:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You'd have to ask Stacy.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Gosh, okay. Email Stacy. Stacy. Oops, that's all caps. I'm not yelling at Stacy.
00:25:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it's not y'all Stacy.
00:25:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. This is awesome. Thank you. Okay, emailed Stacy, I wanted to look at I'm trying to remember through the devil, I'm just going to back a monkey. Why?
00:26:29 - mark sweet (3)
Because we have another bar that came on board, so we're trying to scale should be back to normal next month.
00:26:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? What? How does that mean going to law reward?
00:26:41 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no. Why the monkey leads are low.
00:26:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so we got new business, so screw you, you have to wait.
00:26:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they're probably, yeah, they're probably siphoning off leaves to the other dude to keep him happy. and sorry Mark yeah so we're gonna screw our long-term customer that sounds like business forward like forward whatever you're getting to Eric and we'll see if he can he's not breaking he can but I don't understand why they go to her lower lower again yeah I have a feeling it's a law ruler as she was I want to is it your law ruler it's theirs right no mine okay do we have access to that I don't even know I don't think we're do in class here We can probably kill it then.
00:28:03 - mark sweet (3)
Uh, yeah, my guess is. The sweet monkey email is the reason why.
00:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right, we'll get rid of.
00:28:23 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, because we've got that sweet monkey. Yeah, provide that.
00:28:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's, uh, is that.
00:28:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, but if we can just kill that going to.
00:28:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You.
00:28:37 - mark sweet (3)
I think we're really, but yeah.
00:28:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because I I'm texting Eric right now. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:00 - mark sweet (3)
Well, unfortunately that explains that, but that does suck for us.
00:29:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:10 - mark sweet (3)
So again, another reason why we can't build things around only one or two or three.
00:29:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you haven't. It would be a totally different story. This was in back in the day.
00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You'd be like devastated.
00:29:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Eight cases in Missouri. Eight returns to Missouri that we're not set down on. So far. Well. And goodness for that so far. Anyway, how. So we have one doctor source there. Is that right? Right. Like referral partner.
00:29:58 - mark sweet (3)
Sorry. Sorry.
00:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a. Yeah. I'm Oh, I'm not getting done to referrals. Right. That you're just getting leads from who?
00:30:10 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, paying a crap ton of money for leads and not getting anything back from doctors.
00:30:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Okay. And do we know what the cost of the leads are from Missouri. Not the leads, the retainers.
00:30:28 - mark sweet (3)
A lot. I'll tell you the exact amount in a second, but it's more than I would like.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's always more than you would like. just want to know how bad it is.
00:30:39 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Let's look at what it is for the year.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you look that up.
00:30:58 - mark sweet (3)
I am gonna go get a drink. ours on Missouri lead so far.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many of your chairs have we got? I'm actually in here. can get that really quick. Um, Missouri. Run. No, I can't be right. No, that's Arizona. must want to clear to Arizona. Exactly right.
00:31:31 - mark sweet (3)
Wanting to.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Well, I mean, that's average. 4500.
00:31:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And if those sub-outs didn't happen, it actually would have been pretty good, right?
00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the sub-out issue, we believe, has been resolved thanks to moving off of the queue with those.
00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many were we said that wrong?
00:32:07 - mark sweet (3)
Sorry. Can you repeat this one more time?
00:32:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Repeat which one more time? Either you or Dan, there were two different. So I asked how many were we said that on in Missouri?
00:32:32 - mark sweet (3)
I might keep dropped and summed up this.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to say it was six.
00:32:44 - mark sweet (3)
Sound inaccurate.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the total records are twenty eight and you said we have twenty two.
00:32:51 - mark sweet (3)
Six.
00:32:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So if we hadn't been subbed out, then the retainer costs, yeah, would be. 35, 35, 35. So that everything is more than you want to pay, but that's within that realm of acceptable costs. And it's less expensive than some other states, depending on what lead it is, what lead source.
00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. It's it's fair with in a blended capacity. And then in a place where we don't know the average value of Missouri, which it could be like a Washington or right in Arizona. But blended 3500s in the strike zone.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll say again, why we want to know these numbers rather than how we feel it is, because your feelings about particular things tend to be the where that comes in mind is pessimistic. But and not that that's necessary bad. but to the point where you get frustrated and you think that it's not the thing to be growing or nurturing or potentially wanting to pull back from, but there's nothing that indicates that I can see right now that Missouri is anything but helpful at the moment, even though it may simultaneously be a pain in the .
00:34:19 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I apologize, that number is low.
00:34:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more than anything. I was waiting for this.
00:34:27 - mark sweet (3)
Nice. Just Walker. part of the problem is when we do, like, lose steel and just pay 10 grand and they just give us the leads. So yeah, that was lose steel was like two or three of them. I'm confused. Sorry, lose steel's quantified. All right, I get that but what what I'm saying is in the $3,000 numbers low Because all of them you mean it's not right Like it's lower than what it really is Like Valiant which signed up six of these we just get a bill at the end of the month. It's not broken down.
00:35:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay I spent $93,000 on 11 cases Okay, well, that's very different Very very very different. That's twice as expensive two Rolex ones I Don't exactly know we spent up three Valiant ones we got pulled into everything else This is where the Josh Dab That becomes a play right yeah, because everything needs to be untangled so we can measure it accurately Otherwise, there's no point in measuring it at all not doing any good so um well let's see yeah so yeah okay we'll wait for Stacy to get back to us and let us know how that goes because we definitely need to have that information um three hundred or well nine grand i guess um is not great no it's terrible um but it's also not even the most expensive like there was a point a couple few months ago i don't remember what it was but one source one state was roughly ten thousand dollars and it was terrible so i feel like it was walker somewhere but i don't remember where it was Arizona that's why you could do that them i don't remember You know what, I mix things up together sometimes. Oh, let's see. Oh, okay Dan, so where's your valent replication effort going?
00:37:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They would not, we're still in my accounts. don't know what black hole that went into, but the black hole is deep. I literally, I think they removed them. I can no longer find the accounts. I was like, wait a minute. I purposefully, these were here the other day, now I cannot find them in any of my accounts. all gone. So I had two, well there were two, they're gone. So I'm going to just open a new account today, and hopefully they'll, I don't think they tie things to domains. I think they used to. But they weren't. Well, we'll find out. I should be, oh well, I'll use the domain I've never used. And then I can run ads on the domains. So I have car accident settlement quote which is the one I really want to use so opening account based on that name and then I'll run ads for car accident settlement whatever the other one is I'll run ads for both actually so I'm just opening into the company today and just running the ads there we take a two-minute break yeah I will get a drink you
00:40:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, sorry, I'm back because it's not, it's just really, really, really got to be, amen.
00:40:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, had to get a drink, so, okay. Um, where are we at? Oh, okay, so you're going to get a new domain, get the ads going. It takes so long. But I'm glad that we at least have that going by. So, Walker 13. Did you talk to Walker at all?
00:40:52 - mark sweet (3)
No, Walker, I haven't been giving as much money to, because they're just.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They really tell me. Every week, and I forget because I'm just like, they should be doing it better. Um, do we have any other lead vendor sources on the radar that we can be reaching out to?
00:41:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I haven't come across a new vendor. Period. I'm going to add for them. Like nobody. I'm sitting in vendor and I'll spend a minute in a lot of recycled people.
00:41:29 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Um, so they rebrand themselves like how it's legal now or something.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's so sad. Um, it is.
00:41:45 - mark sweet (3)
mean, that's just three. I thought it just is. I'm talking to Tom with California marketing group. Um, when I get back from my trip, sometimes. See what they might be able to do. Yeah, if monkey hadn't dropped their volume they did, you would still probably be a little bit behind, but not as bad.
00:42:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:42:17 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, even still, I mean, we're still on pace to do about 80 plus.
00:42:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's nice to hear you frame it that way.
00:42:27 - mark sweet (3)
Just is what it is, like, yeah.
00:42:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there anything that we are not fully leveraging or could somehow leverage more in terms of some of the other, like, don't know, doctor referrals, we can't, employer referrals, returning clients, blue still, what, what are the. Deaf blogs. That's news, right?
00:43:02 - mark sweet (3)
They randomly picked up over the last five days. We got a bunch of submission over the last five days and it's been really quiet since before she's in there.
00:43:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where has Google Mona Business been this month?
00:43:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When you met, usually it stays the same. if it looks all, either something broken, is there something broken or right? We don't remember. It's off in which metric, which metric you're talking about.
00:43:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. We normally have some retainers from there and we don't have any this month at all.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the trackings off, right? So either the lead tracking is broken and therefore the retainers aren't going to track back to leads or something else is wrong. So you're saying the retainer metric is the one that you're looking at the throng, but then upstream it sounds like the leads metric is wrong too. So I don't know, we'd have to look after looking at that. That would have that would have appeared on an on track health track dashboard as well.
00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so is that for you, that you won't that Dan?
00:44:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't even know. I imagine it went sideways before right now. We just didn't go to it.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let me look at. July, we had one GMB at the end of the month, August, I mean, generally GMB is not super high volume.
00:45:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, but it's usually good for one to two long. Well, we would really know the average.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We got none in August either. And we had one in July. So letify leads by state by source that cannot possibly be right. Shows four leads.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
I'm wondering if you need your help with, because I know people working on that with Missouri GMB.
00:46:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, so that Isaac is talking about, so they told Isaac, I think on Thursday or Friday, that the Regis office type that you have is not going to get approved. That you need this other level they sent it to him. they said there's something specifically that it's the way. So they're like, it is, this lower office type doesn't get a name on the medallion or whatever the hell it's called downstairs. And you have to have that, and then they have to have a picture of that to send to Google and say, yes, they're out of this address. So Isaac said he was going to work on upgrading, and I think through you, then post upgrade, he was going to try to get someone from Regis to take up the other one and send it to him.
00:47:00 - mark sweet (3)
I did not know that, so that's good for me to know.
00:47:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yeah. Oh, that's why I got died.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Is GMB, what is it called? What's does it have a name code name?
00:47:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just GMB.
00:47:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
But I'm not even talking about it. Did necessarily generate business in Missouri. Obviously want that. But right now you Google.
00:47:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:47:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm glad you're closed. And there's nothing there.
00:47:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:47:36 - mark sweet (3)
So we need to start building out.
00:47:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that's what this, whoever was using against you.
00:47:42 - mark sweet (3)
For sure. And I understand it too. I sign with the firm, I'm googling and I find things in other states, nothing there.
00:47:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can this. So yeah, he's. I don't know if he needs to talk to you or he has whatever, but that's where it was on. There's a lot of it.
00:48:02 - mark sweet (3)
Dan, do we have a Missouri dedicated page on our system?
00:48:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, maybe we can make sure we get one up, and maybe do you see what I see what I did? The doing child can just work.
00:48:18 - mark sweet (3)
I asked America to find some BS awards, and then we'll make it from Missouri, and we'll spend some money on a PR newswire. So we can at least get that out a little bit.
00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can this be right?
00:48:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What?
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what I see for GMB matters all time.
00:48:41 - mark sweet (3)
Probably.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:48:47 - mark sweet (3)
This is never generating some.
00:48:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't realize it was that little, but okay.
00:48:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wait. Oh my god. What is it? What's the total?
00:48:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's What's the the Like nine?
00:49:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that's not right.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll show you.
00:49:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's the most who be in California period.
00:49:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So sources, GMB, all matters, all matters, time. Yeah. But it only has three for California.
00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, that's not right. And then from there. Because when we were doing this before, and I was evaluating that company, I made sure we checked every month. And every month there was one to two. I was like, okay, that works if they get one to two. And we checked that for like months and months. then finally we were like, okay, we don't need to check this anymore. So that's not right.
00:49:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's not working correctly then?
00:49:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I have no idea. Like, because when we were checking it, it was correct. uh and they're all super old right the california when they're all there's no twenty twenty four one in california yeah there's no not in twenty that there's only so i mean we yeah something there's something wrong but i don't know i don't i wouldn't tell you i couldn't tell you what's wrong off hand where typically they get missed typically it's a misattribution right so it's like anytime you see a lot of leads from the website it's wrong or i'm sorry a lot of matters in the website retainers it's wrong because the website doesn't really generate them any leads everything that's happening through the website is typically from gmb or news right so just straight or up until fairly recently i would say So, they've got to be getting, somehow they get reclassed in Lidify, but we go into Leeplo. Leeplo is going to be like GMB retainers, and it'll spread out bunch of names, and then if we go, that one will be correct, because they hit Leeplo first, if they call the GMB phone number, that's where the call goes in, it goes in there, and then we say, hey, this is GMB, and then we go try to update it and Lidify, make sure it says GMB. So it could just be that that's not working the way it's supposed to, but the sort of the source of truth for GMB is more Leeplo-y than Lidify, because they originate in Leeplo-y.
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How would I find them here?
00:51:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You'd have to search for tags. tag being, you have to go to contacts.
00:52:05 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, because I look at total converted since 2021.
00:52:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you got to filters.
00:52:13 - mark sweet (3)
you're just going to need.
00:52:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now we're on the far right.
00:52:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, oh yeah.
00:52:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then it's going to be like tag search for tag. And that search box on top of the filter and tag equals she and me. Oh, it's not going to be that easy. She can't for every location.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't do just sources, Jeremy.
00:52:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That might add my work yet. And then you're going to end a tag. I think it's better.
00:52:52 - mark sweet (3)
I don't live in 10 GMEs on the intake side in 2024.
00:53:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not tag do like I think it's converted. Yeah then I click off the slide out. Oh, and then all right. And converted in here is not so go back to the thing open it and then said retainer do retainer signed on that second one just edit that one don't delete it. Now because I think converted here means that the case is closed. Yeah, this should be. It should pull back way more than that. Just do get rid of the retainer thing and see how many pulls back with that source tag. Yeah, it's not 165, that's still not right, it should be way higher than that, because this goes back to like three years.
00:54:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It only goes back two years ago, here.
00:54:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's not right. So I only know that because we've looked at this endlessly for months. I'm going to have to dig into it and see what's up.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I mean, because lead sources are so, it's everything that's lifeblood. think that we should be doing that and just making sure that 100%.
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, that's why the on track off track, this would have flagged up the minute it started going off. But that's my big question for him is like, hey, can I tell you GMB averages, four leads a month, whatever it is, and then use that average to make something red or green, right? be like, hey, this is looking off, I just don't know the answer to so you can let us know.
00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should have CCD or not emailed to CCD. Okay. Um, D. Did you get proposals for the billboards in New Mexico?
00:55:43 - mark sweet (3)
That's one more one time.
00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:55:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you come up with a catchy tagline for sweet? Because there's something wrong.
00:55:55 - mark sweet (3)
I saw her again. in terms of something more of a rebrand, because we're just going to always have this issue with where you are.
00:56:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sweet James. Yeah.
00:56:11 - mark sweet (3)
if I want to pay a bunch of my input on billboards, I'd rather just be something generic.
00:56:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Such as lawyer.
00:56:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then if you're generic, you're competing with everybody anyway, wouldn't you want to be unique?
00:56:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, generically unique.
00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:35 - mark sweet (3)
Then when I say generic, mean, like, you know, there's the top dog and the hammer and the falcon and the snowman and whatever else it is.
00:56:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm confused. So you want to be generic and not memorable and put money into that?
00:56:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. How about we use Salko because I'm just spitballing here. It's Salko's face and it says dealing with prick called dick.
00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm he'd sign on to that. Oh my gosh.
00:57:16 - mark sweet (3)
So we sure remember we bought Big Check Law, Max Check Law.
00:57:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They are looking for a check.
00:57:27 - mark sweet (3)
Turnings of justice, which we have justice. And we do have the Spanish versions of some of these as well. So again, because of the stupid sweet James thing, he's going to end up going to states at some point.
00:57:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah.
00:57:49 - mark sweet (3)
So, even if he's not there right now. It's just sitting. It's just massively outspending.
00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So would you rebrand your whole burn?
00:58:03 - mark sweet (3)
No, just the advertising side because Works the same reason else seems and almost all this stuff works.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. This is true Why are we need to have a Brainstorm access with that then The biggest thing is having a fun over that someone in our vault and a website that you can Type in really easily Just so you know, I'm very good at that. So we should totally do that next week if you haven't got one by then Um, yeah, okay, let's see And he re is the AI demand writer stuff Is that enough on it?
00:59:00 - mark sweet (3)
I have a way long for 2,500 bucks.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:59:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What was it?
00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cowboy? No.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
It's who wants a cowboy.
00:59:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That was the area.
00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Big dog.
00:59:25 - mark sweet (3)
Where's our top dog?
00:59:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like cowboy though. Cowboy low. What was the question that they had on the line? Oh, yeah. The AI demand writing stuff. Is that conversation tabled for now or what?
00:59:53 - mark sweet (3)
I've sent through two more. They're not good. It's, I've come to the conclusion fairly quickly that they're all relatively the same. They do slightly things differently, but it's, at its heart, summarization. Some have nice chronologies, some donut chronologies. All of it is really just summarization.
01:00:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just go back to the first guys and like, use it from the perspective of, does this save me time? Like, what benefits can you extract from it? Knowing that the leverage that they have to get a different set of metrics, right? That was the problem with them, like, their metrics were not your metrics. They were like, we can write so many demands. And I was like, why, why would you? Also, they lied. Because when they heard how many you were writing, they're like, that's a lot. Like, didn't you guys say you were writing a hundred a month?
01:00:56 - mark sweet (3)
Like, that's more to do. That hadn't more to do with. me and I don't want to say a slight but more dealing with me but they really weren't writing that many um they probably are no because when you said they're like how many do you need you said a hundred fifteen they went whoa that's a lot like you're crushing it it's a slight against me because they have only known me as even kenisys and not many people know exactly who i am like they think i'm just a very small practice oh so you think that they they were surprised that you were getting that many but they probably do right more but i'll say something like they didn't do prelets i'm like how many demands you writing for lip or is that just a requirement you know it's hardly that they're just putting things together for litigation and as you saw they don't really have lawyers yeah yeah so i mean i would use their thing just to see like hey does the do you get good feedback on the chronology?
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
in the link, you know, whatever, like they said. Does it save time, right? So, and then it's just, it's like, hey, does this save any time and money? Yes or no? Do the lawyers look at it as a benefit? Yes or no? And then it would be, is it worth the time and effort to make my own thing, whether or not it ever gets productized? That's irrelevant. It's like, oh, and then, and also the bit about like, I was saying, you know, two weeks ago, whatever, how good, how much can the demand be manipulated to fit your version up, right? Which it seemed like they said they could do that. And then, do you get a better benefit? Like, can you come up with a better demand? Can you save money, get a better demand and get a better result? And it would more than cover the costs. I think you cover the costs just in time. And then it's like, okay, I'm just, I've just improved my system, you know, not based. It's on the benefits that they're saying. It's the benefits that I was able to extract from it. And then you do a video testimonial for them and say, how awesome it is.
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are late for call.
01:03:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

01:03:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
