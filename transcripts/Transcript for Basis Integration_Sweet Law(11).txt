Hello, hey, can you hear me very early turn that volume up really good. How are you?
00:00:36 - mark sweet
I'm still pretty tired for me, but that's okay.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just tired? No, but that's all you're saying. Let's see, 14. Where is that? I paste? I don't
00:01:00 - mark sweet
I don't know Arizona, which is just odd.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, like 14 period, but yeah, that is rare.
00:01:09 - mark sweet
14 period. mean, it's not great. It's not terrible. It's just not great. If we had five more out. So, you know, if those all came in and whatnot, we'd be at 19 and we'd feeling lot better.
00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay, Ish. Well, that was more optimistic than you generally are, though. You've been leaning more that way lately. Yeah. Hello, Daniel.
00:01:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What's up?
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Allergies. I'm gonna mute my phone. not bad. Sorry about that. Do you not disturb? Okay. So, how's your ads going down? Oh, wait, your accounts were shut down.
00:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I got a rap whose name I can't pronounce some feeling very confident about how this is going to go. And I sent them all the screenshots this morning showing them that everything on my end says this should work. And it doesn't, no matter what I do. It looks like four accounts. think they reactivated the car accident one payments don't work. The new one I created for this other project payments don't work. This other project that I've had for years payments don't work. And they're all tied to D&D, which was approved. Whatever verify whatever this 's called over two years ago. And work looks like the last time it worked was between August and March. But I just I'm in like this loop. keep going around in a loop. I'm like, I don't need, and I even resubmitted everything, still didn't do anything. We'll see what Mogemchi or whatever their name is. It's very interesting. Mode mode, can't even say it. M-O-D-U-B-E. I feel like it's a dupe, M-O-D-U-B-E.
00:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody else in Arizona had their GMB just shut down for no reason with all, that's where all their leads came from, reviews on that account.
00:03:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just nuke.
00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it was the thing that the business hasn't been built on the last like three or four years, primarily. So, yeah, that is the whole point of on your race course, but you can't really.
00:04:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's not your, you know, it's not your race course.
00:04:03 - mark sweet
What do you race courses built upon Google's lens?
00:04:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the thing is everybody's is built upon other people's stuff like if your vendors shut down. We're done, but that's the thing about diversification and why we have to do it because you can't actually own it. It's everybody else's platforms and eyeballs that we pay to get access to and they could just say, we don't want your money anymore, and that is the nature of the beast. Okay.
00:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you'll keep us posted then on what happened? Mode two?
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'll keep you up to Mode two.
00:04:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mode two. Because like I can't even it's, so this is now it's applying to two different accounts. So both of them are, I don't, so I'm like, I don't know why they're both two different credit cards to like both same thing. Luckily, I don't have anything. Yeah, it's it's only affecting accounts that are associated with my payment methods. Other accounts that I managed, I didn't pay methods, unaffected. I don't know. I don't know if that's the issue, then. Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what it is. It doesn't, it shouldn't be happening. But it is.
00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we'll see. are good.
00:05:38 - mark sweet
Yeah, but especially someone that's pretty easy to do.
00:05:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, you won't see it's they don't have like credit cards anymore, right? So you have, I mean, they do, right? So you have a payment profile. So can I don't? I don't think I have access. don't know if I can access someone else's payment profile, but. So yeah, in theory, you could. attached a different payment profile. I think if I made you the admin, you might your profile might command. We could try that. I just don't want to up your profile. don't want it to be like, it's happened to both of my profiles in the same account. So I'm like, I don't want to bring in another profile. I'm like, is there something they don't like about these accounts? That's why I'm like, but I will admit, I did use Ninja to get to this person. So I was like, oh, what I really have is a problem over here. Because they can see that I am associated with Ninja, but not my profile. That's Jeff's profile. We'll see. mean, I literally just gotten touch of them this morning. So.
00:06:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We just need Mark to go ahead and with mail nor. Right. Yeah. Just writing Google. Fix it. Um, Tom, California marketing group, what up with that?
00:07:07 - mark sweet
I didn't connect with them.
00:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just, it's just made a smart . I know you were really, really, really busy. was just, um, mode activated. There you go. Back out when you're working. Oh, yeah. I need to send a shout out message. Um, how about there?
00:07:33 - mark sweet
Yeah. I'm so allergic to this place.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's like the right side of my face. That's it. But it's like needles stabbing in my eye, my nose, my ears, my throat. And I just wound up. I'm at aggressive. Everything's fine. Okay. And with the good. Oh, was there a mixer with it? Um, how? Let's see. Working to ask about how these are fine. Oh, yeah, how did that go?
00:08:04 - mark sweet
I have no idea what you just said.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any expert?
00:08:08 - mark sweet
There's been so many mixers. Um, and everything was good. It's, you know, look, we have to do these things. Because, especially in the other states, just put a face to a name. So not just, you know, the California firm or what have you. So, you know, they're good to do.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Well, do you feel like you made some connections? Because you keep getting your cases taken away.
00:08:34 - mark sweet
That's why attorney is not my doctor's.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but, um, yeah, I guess that's it.
00:08:43 - mark sweet
So it's more just getting other doctors so that way they start sending us referrals rather than to the local guy that they use.
00:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still feel like there's a secondary cause and effect in the background there. Like the framing of them sending it to you. you probably has something to do with the solidity of the just the case and whether not it could be referred out to like why would they go somebody else.
00:09:14 - mark sweet
But what do people tell you someone they've worked with? So, you know, yeah, that takes time and energy, of course.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's all of it been people they've worked with before?
00:09:25 - mark sweet
I mean, it's generally who you're gonna send it. Sorry. When you're talking about a doctor referring to case, right? That's what we're talking about.
00:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, your cases that you've lost, what reasons did it give you for going to the other attorneys?
00:09:39 - mark sweet
So, we don't we can't talk to them, right? Yeah. So, some of it's conjecture to some level, which is, you know, I want to be able to walk into a place or I don't want to go to a lawyer or we can't find anything online about this person. So, I know we kind of talked about building up a little more of a Missouri. in in Washington. Washington's got some profile at least, but at least New Mexico, Colorado, and Missouri to start just getting something out there. And that's one thing that we haven't pushed forward too hard with. And I get that if you're a client and you're looking up and all you see is California stuff in your Missouri, you're like, do they know what they're doing?
00:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so what does that look like? Is that just a website that says that you're in that state?
00:10:36 - mark sweet
couple of pages usually on our website and then putting some sort of a CO juice behind it, because it's not a heavy search for a term, right? Like, sweet lawyers, St. Louis or St. Louis, it's not going to be that hard to get on page one. So we're trying to be like St. Louis' car accident or anywhere that's going to be really, really Have those pages been commissioned yet? I don't think so.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who would make that happen?
00:11:02 - mark sweet
I don't know.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the boss.
00:11:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, I honestly don't know.
00:11:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And then Isaac submits the ticket.
00:11:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't for it. Hold on. Just make this really clear. If you don't specifically ask for something to get done and commission it, it does not get done. That's clear, right? You can't allude to it. I don't know. For you and like for your goals, not, not actually being the jerk that I sound like I'm being.
00:11:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You know that, right? Well, mode was activated.
00:11:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think we all heard that.
00:11:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't feel like it got deactivated.
00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
didn't hear the.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But intention is still advocating for you to get. the results that you want to unless you say like we nobody can do that unless you say I want to do that I'm paying for that whatever that's how that works so you need are they separate domains or separate pages on the existing domain can we just like separate pages on our existing like we don't need to launch entire new domains for these things so I just want to be very clear so the page so you know the scope of the work needs to be clear so that it can be accomplished um so what's your suite law.com right okay um about us would there be anything on the about us page also no you need
00:13:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It just a standalone page to try to rank for the one keyword. So like if you go down and is it linked from a menu or is it just? Well, there is a page that already exists, but it's not ranking. It could be because the keyword, well, it could be because it's new. I don't know how new it is. It's like you want right we assume it's sweet love, sorry. Oh, well, the problem is we can't really do this because we're not in Missouri. Yeah, we got to do it. I forget how to do it, but there's a way to do it in Google Chrome where you have to go in and appear like you're in Missouri because we're not going to get the right results searching from here. But the page. is based its Missouri personal injuries basically sort of the keyword it's targeting. We could, which is actually not a keyword, but I think it's just based off of the pages that already existed. Well, we could make those, the foreign one should be foreign. The out of state one should be probably like Mark saying, targeting the city name or the state name, and then the brand. So it's wheat law Phoenix, sweet law, Spokane, sweet law, Missouri, we law New Mexico. You say Spokane?
00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Spokane, Spokane, I don't know if anybody says, okay. It does actually look like that, but I've never heard anybody say it's okay now it's again.
00:14:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sweet law, Tuxon, there you go.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For each city, there you go. exist. All right.
00:15:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, all these pages exist. So that we, this was something that I asked them last week. So they, I went to the SEO people. So all the pages are there. I'm now saying we should probably change the target keyword on these pages to be brand location instead of location personal injury attorney, which is basically what it is now. Yeah, except for California, California will do something we would treat differently. Because I don't think people are, it's obviously said California, but they did purposefully link the GMB's in the one area, and then the internal linking to the location pages are the links in the footer. that's, that's all on purpose. So they confirm that for me.
00:15:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, but do we have one for Missouri? Yep. Okay. So then the issue is just that it's not being bound, it's not ranking high enough?
00:16:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't know the answer to that because I can't search from Missouri at the moment, but that would be the next step as to whatever spoof myself or spoof that you're in Missouri and see where it ranks.
00:16:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then let me figure out this a little bit. So if we already have the assignment and have completed that there are pages on the process.
00:16:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
don't know where that came from. I don't know how these pages got built. I'm assuming it's Isaac, but we never talked about it on this call, but somehow there's... No, not to the point. I didn't think this page existed until right now, because I didn't scroll all the way down, of course, right, I scroll to the bottom. So I asked the people, hey, are we supposed to? And then they're like, you already have, they're already there. And I said, oh , you're right. I didn't even scroll down that part. I don't know when this Missouri page got created. I don't know if America did it when the office got, like, I'm assuming it was done probably in some sort of coordinated effort with the launch of the office, because it's definitely not new probably had to also do it with the GMB to show the address because a lot of the states need that. So the only issue I see is that they just duplicated a page and changed everything, and therefore they, there was no real target keyword, your key jury, until this fall right now when Mark was like, oh, we should probably make it bleep law, whatever not here. Okay, yeah. But we can go change, I would change that on all of these outside California pages.
00:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did you get a Google rep?
00:17:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They emailed me.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:17:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I knew that they emailed me and I searched my email and I was like, three, so I reached out to the most recent one. Yeah, to get there and talk.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow.
00:18:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, so then do we need the mark to do anything or do, is this, no, this is more like a Stacy through the SEO people, like we should just go, Hey, we want these outside state pages to rank to switch them to ranked or brand location. And then what do we need to do, right? So, and the they did have not worked on these pages at all. These are definitely carry over from whenever, whenever these pages were originally created, you know, six years ago.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so what, whatever pages that we have that are external, I like that our location specific need to be ranking. And we don't even know how many or what they are right now.
00:18:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no, it's one for everyone.
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
location.
00:19:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But I wouldn't do California, just outside California locations. And we want them to rank for brand locations.
00:19:09 - mark sweet
Not necessarily meant to generate cases, maybe those fantastic. It's more just to prevent people from thinking that we have.
00:19:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's their research to be like, okay, they're because that one's not approved. Isaac is still, but they're not going to approve according to the B&B people. They're going back forth with Isaac. Like Isaac couldn't get Regis to put the name outside on the monument or whatever it's called, listing and the lobby. And they're like, we literally, for whatever reason, they said it's Missouri. Like, we're going to have to provide photo. the evidence that you have a physical office. So now Isaac is looking to rent a different place for that purpose.
00:20:07 - mark sweet
Yeah, like do we need an actual storefront like we do not need actual storefront?
00:20:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it's like you just need something that you can put your name on and go here you go. There's the sweet lot of us.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the states that we now are we doing the state specific or city specific?
00:20:26 - mark sweet
Well, let's start with first because there's a lot of cities.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I want to be clear for some creating a task.
00:20:33 - mark sweet
New Mexico, Colorado, Missouri, Washington, Arizona, Texas, So, yeah.
00:20:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, Texas. No, no, no.
00:20:41 - mark sweet
No, no, no.
00:20:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why I had a question mark with Nevada.
00:20:45 - mark sweet
was like, do we even want to draw attention?
00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Okay, what about Texas?
00:20:49 - mark sweet
I don't know. That's on the site. You check this alone.
00:20:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't mess with Texas.
00:20:57 - mark sweet
I don't really want Texas cases right now. Yeah. I'll take them if it comes through like the new sources, but I'm not trying to generate that California. We're like pretty solid with it. don't really need to do a lot more. Okay, so New Mexico, Colorado, Missouri, Washington and Arizona. Yeah, and we already have the two Arizona addresses. So really the primary one is going to be New Mexico, Colorado and Missouri. We can pick the two or three largest cities in those states. like Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis. So these show we've got things in those cities. In New Mexico would be Albuquerque and Santa Fe. And Colorado, we can just do Denver to begin with.
00:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, hold on second. Mexico, Santa Fe and what?
00:21:51 - mark sweet
Albuquerque. Good luck trying to spell it out.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, and then Missouri, what would be the St.
00:22:06 - mark sweet
Louis in Kansas City?
00:22:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was in Missouri for a little while. The biggest fog I'd ever seen in my life, where you literally could not see your hand on your face.
00:22:26 - mark sweet
Yes, that's for the audience crazy.
00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, um, let me show you one note. That's what triggers the task. Okay, um, all right, so we will work on that, which should be helpful and average and long play. Ah, let's get these news. What is. Oh, valiant. No valiant this month yet. Are any of retainers that are not used to rocker one, let's say. And it's this seven that we've only had. I don't know, that seems kind of odd. Maybe not. Not to him at all.
00:23:32 - mark sweet
Uh, yeah. Everything looks okay, I'm not increasing it, should we get it?
00:23:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And Felipe has got three and none of them, the ones that are out of them, have you had to chat with them?
00:23:52 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know why I always laugh because it's pretty much the same every
00:24:00 - mark sweet
I know like they it's in seven days like we need more money. I'm like the you do like you we're not producing where we should know here's the leads in the cost keeps going up, which just doesn't make you make a lot of sense, but we need some of the cases for the moment.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, do you know, I'm going to send the email to Stacy, but do you know where we're at with the Josh reports, Dan.
00:24:30 - mark sweet
Because there were 1800 a lead and they're charging per person, not per incident. So we need to be like 50% sign up rate and like we've signed. One, two, two incidences, technically three people off of one, two, four, five, six, seven leads. So they're not that far off, they're just. Really expensive for what they are. Um, they said how many leads and you've had three three out of seven, which is close to the 50% but two in the same car. And like, even still, it's high.
00:25:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, we really need to do the numbers because, like, you were having eight and $10,000, which we have to get this report. Do you know anything about it, Dan?
00:25:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I have no idea what you're talking about because there's a bunch going on.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just said, well, who Josh is. I don't know. First source.
00:25:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't have enough data. I don't know where he's at. I know that you, you sent a bunch of stuff to Stacy. And then she wrote you back asking you a bunch of questions about your questions. And I don't know if you've responded to that. And then she's gonna send that over to Josh. But I think your stuff has to do with matters, not the cost per lead stuff. So yeah, no, I never talked to him. Last time I talked to him was with Mark. But he said he was busy and he wouldn't have it to us till the beginning of October and that's the beginning of October.
00:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Okay.
00:26:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I can get him up.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that? Oh, what is the 40% in reference to? Okay. So 40% is reference to policy limits. Max policy.
00:26:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Wait, 40% is in reference to policy limits?
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:48 - mark sweet
We're getting paid our full, no, not policy, it was 40% No.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. How do I answer this question then? What is the 40% Or in the reply. I can't hear you, Mark.
00:27:05 - mark sweet
Oh, I said with the riddle.
00:27:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the.
00:27:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, feet.
00:27:13 - mark sweet
Trying to make you laugh a little bit.
00:27:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah, but I'm trying to not.
00:27:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Is that what you want? You want to know the full fee or do you want to know something about policy limits?
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the question. Well, that's part of it.
00:27:27 - mark sweet
So we did have the checkbox. Remember where they can check policy limits now.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was new.
00:27:33 - mark sweet
Because it's not always just based on number, unfortunately.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So effective 40% by team. Okay. So then policy limits isn't even in this report. That's what I thought that 40% was, but I get it.
00:27:48 - mark sweet
Because it does say fee. Because like sometimes we have. Eight people is hard. It's not.
00:27:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Maybe not go. That's the attorney fee, um, target that year. Is that in little five mark 40% like how we're getting you. It's in our current report right now. So 40% of the total settlement, right? want 40%. Yes, Thank Oh, so this was something I put in because so I was talking to Patrick and Lorenz about their follow-up and sometimes they'll send several texts and they'll get no replies and I'm like well is it because they don't want a text and they don't want calls and Lorenz said that he thinks that most people in Arizona want phone calls not text messages and what I was wondering is if during either well probably the introduction call if they could find out what their preference is like do they prefer text email phone calls whatever so that we know like if we're not hearing from them on one particular path that maybe we prefer text let's go for text but we don't hear from them then we know and we can we can try their preferred method Is that something that you'd be okay with us? First of all, trying to set up and mark that and let it apply, which I think that they said they already do, but it's not something that is easily searchable and also not something that we can kind of collect any data on and go, what percentage of people say that prefer phone calls, whatever, just so that we can create our systems around and actually, I don't know, because sometimes people say things and then they act differently, so there's that. anyway, I was trying to figure out how we could get more consistent conversations, because some cases just, you don't get replies from people and your team is following up with them, but they're not responding back. And they're not always trying other methods to get a hold of them. Like, they could just be. be sending a bunch of text messages and get no reply, but they didn't or like one example. And this was Dom and I caught Lorenz with it and he was like, I should have caught my team and noticed this. But one client had said that they were getting their phone shut down and they kept sending them text messages and calling but getting no response. And he's like, we should have emailed them on like, yep.
00:31:27 - mark sweet
We're called our emergency contact, which also does happen with Ryan's team today here. that client was MIA, probably emergency contact. Actually, Jose, from the day called the emergency contact who picked up and said, yeah, his phone's not working.
00:31:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so just taking that next step. Anyway, what do you think about making that part of the process of asking people what their preferred method of contact is?
00:31:57 - mark sweet
That makes sense to me.
00:31:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. then. So then. In Yeah. I mean, definitely not that many. would think because it's if each of the widgets of the block. that's eight and if you're looking at two there of course and potentially 10, 11, 12.
00:33:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I think each one is a widget or yeah, I think that's the word. But yeah, and that's just for you, just so you're aware, right? when you're looking at these things, it's like, okay, some might need to get broken up somewhere.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I sent that to Stacy. All right, so what is it?
00:34:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We also need to do value of retainers by source is what I was thinking over the weekend. I don't know if we actually have that in there, but, and we should also add. We have this either. So I also thinking about this. It should be like dropouts and subouts should be part of that report. So like the cost is the cost based on retainers, but then in that same view, we could see like a monkey this month had 12 retainers that cost off. And then you just have the other method of and then this many subouts percentage rate. This many drops percentage rate, which have no value. whatever cost and or value say that again sorry I was the we probably want to see like what's the dropout and sub-out rate per source per state same thing and then I don't think we're doing this but I just did this for that certainly well I didn't I did the cost per for that certainly oh and the other one would be because this is from uncertainty like how many although this is not done yet but it will be according to Isaac we also wanted to have for each source the referred out how many were referred out and then a rate because with that certainly it's like hey they were like almost one for one but the referred outs aren't real so I still can't know I there's still no way for me to truly get a row as on them because okay well if five will refer it out they are going to turn into revenue but if none will refer heard out right? Isaac is still working with Lidify. He updated Eric and Thursday or Friday. He's waiting for something from them.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I forget what it is. But I'm just glad you found Josh because that question has come up. I've asked it myself. Probably once or twice a year over the last few years. And it's all just kind of convoluted to be able to get it. So we can have somebody driving that and actually get to those numbers. That's great. And I also feel like it helps slightly give Mark a little bit of an edge in the conversations with the vendors, because here's what they should take that as a signal. If any of the attorneys are able to track that data to that level, then eventually more of the attorneys are going to be able to track that to that level and start to want to negotiate with them better results.
00:36:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no, that's never going to happen. But I love the idea.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, trust me, not going to happen. All right.
00:37:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Which opens up my bigger conversation. I was driving, thinking about Mark's business conversation. So I mean, it dawned on me that right now, everything we do is built around like a target cost per retainer. That I assume, and I believe this is true, but I don't actually know the exact parameters or whatever. But it's like that cost per retainer is sort of like built into the model. Like, I need it to be this cost per retainer because of this, this, this, this, this, You know, the overhead cost of this and not everything. Whatever that is, right? profit margin. So A, what is that? Exactly formula. I would, we should know it. It's pretty straightforward. And then it's like, well, why is it that? Is that is your cost? us per retainer. So if you think about the constraints in the business that we've talked about before, like a constraint or perceived constraint was like, oh, pods, we need more pods. That's a constraint. We're being constrained by lack of pods. Another constraint was intake. Oh, we need, we'll go to this outside intake. We do more intake because there's a constraint in intake. As it turned out, there really wasn't a constraint in intake, right? went out, worked, whatever, but now we've bundled more of those leads back in almost all of them. So it's like, that constraint wasn't necessarily real. But the thought behind it was like, yeah, I mean, there could be a constraint there. Is the constraint in the business? And this is a constraint. If you're fixed on, if there's a fixed cost that you can pay for a retainer and you cannot go higher than that, that's the ultimate constraint. I can't acquire customers because why? Because it's going to cut into my profit margin, because my overhead is too high. I don't No, right. But if that is no longer constrained, right, see who can pay the most for a retainer wins. So it's like, well, what if the model was built around, I can pay $8,000 for a retainer? Like, there's an example, right? So then you're going out there and you're like, I'm just going to buy retainers and make the model work around my cost of retainers high grade. It doesn't matter because it works in this model. But then it comes back to, well, what is that model, right? And then there's also the idea of if retainers equal outliers, are you then increasing your outlier math? I mean, and at the core, yes, you are. If more retainers therefore more outliers, if that sort of thing holds true, then you'd realize that over time. So then the question is like, What is that? What could that number be? I don't know. But like, if you can go and if you can go acquire a customer that someone else can. And that might be part of the constraint of what's happening right now. like, Steve can pay $10,000 for a retainer. Well, that's hard to compete with. But what if you're, what if you can do that too? And then what does the model look like in that scenario, right? yeah, maybe your profit margin goes down, right? But what is a lot? What is allowable there? I don't know. But then also you look at the long tail, there's two long tails. One long tail is this outlier possibility. The other long tail is, okay, well, we already know that X amount of past retainers turns into this amount of referral business. Well, then you're also feeding that as well. I'm going to get more retainers. Therefore, I'm going to my increase in referred cases. cases and return cases is also going to go up. But I know that that is a five year horizon. It takes place over five years. I'd say if the business has been open for six years right now, mean, we could probably actually go back and sort of figure that out and go, when did referrals start? What is the arc of referrals and then repeat business, right? That data is in there. So you whatever that looks like now, it's probably gotten to a point and it's probably pretty static and it might just stay there. But it's like if you change the ends, then you're going to change the outs. If you get more retainers now, then that number will slightly bump up a little more slightly. But it's like, it's this whole Dan Kennedy thing. Dan Kennedy's one of his things is like whoever can pay the most for the customer wins. It's true. But as soon as can you do it?
00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and you can you go without another Porsche? Well, well, can you do that and you the kind of side model of sweet lot that we were talking about which is run the business differently where they're getting a different incentive program and you can still do that too. Yeah, totally, but it's also like, but I think that that's it's not a two.
00:42:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's a together thing. Well, yeah, I mean, it can be a you've run it around car models for sure.
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can pay more for the case to obtain the case if you're not paying as much to have the case fulfilled, right?
00:42:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But it's like, what could could you just change it now and not like it's the only change where, hey, you know what, I'm going to lower my profit margin. Like, I don't know how much money. arc lives on above what we're right. So obviously part of it's that I don't need to know that, right? It's just like, this is from Mark, but it's like, if let's say that Mark, like mine's all passed through, right? Like I have a salary and then I get just a bunch of pass through money. The mark price is the same thing or not. And so it's like, okay, well, I'm going to limit my pass through because that money is going to get spent getting retainers. I just need to know that. I need to know, hey, my income's now going to go down by whatever, because I'm reducing my pass through, because it's no longer going to pass through. It's going to get spent in the business. Obviously there's tax implications, right? going save money because you're not going to make it, but whatever. It's just really about what, how do you like, it's reinvesting in the business, but it also has to be like, you want the business to still be profitable. You know, you don't want to, it all falls on. Mark in the scenario, right?
00:44:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the end of the day, but he's the one that I'm giving.
00:44:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, but he'd be the one that's getting that money, granted it's his money. And it's you're pumping it back into the business. But it's like, what, what does that look like?
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
considering?
00:44:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no idea.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark, did you know how many of these cases referred out? And is this accurate? I can't hear Mark when you speak down.
00:44:33 - mark sweet
What'd you say, Mark? We try to refer out whatever we possibly can. Yeah. number that actually gets signed up from referred out is very small. Because I would be these, right? Necessarily, that just means we tried to refer it out.
00:44:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do we track the ones that actually can't bark to you getting paid something?
00:45:00 - mark sweet
Yeah. So, okay. Well, that's a two fact, not a two factor, a two step question. Um, one is someone has to accept it and work on it. Step two is that actually needs to settle.
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's a long time.
00:45:13 - mark sweet
Just because someone signs it up doesn't mean they actually like settle it all the way. Um, because there's a reason we're taking, uh, I won't say a fly around. There's reason we're saying no, right?
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:45:25 - mark sweet
Um, the first question is how many of these refer to actually getting signed up and. It's less than 10%. It's not a huge percentage. And that's okay. Again, I'd rather at least try, then, you know, just say, yeah, screw it, forget it. Right. And it does generate, you know, decent revenue as the year goes on.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea what that is? Because how do you quantify it decent? it a line? Not among P and L's.
00:46:01 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Can you go look at one real quick and tell me what that was for a quarter this year?
00:46:11 - mark sweet
So, well, let me let me take out 2.2 million because I think that will that kind of screws things up a little bit.
00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, was it a big case I got referred out?
00:46:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, that was a panic case. That was one. Yeah, I don't think it works for 166,000 dollars, though it's not a small sum.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, do you get an outlier case once a year roughly?
00:46:44 - mark sweet
So how many how often do want to call it an outlier case because this case is we choose to send to like a partner firm. Okay. you know, as our litigation internally gets better, we should be doing less than less. That's about meaning keep them instead instead of giving up 50% of the fee.
00:47:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So the punish how much of the 2.2 million did you get? Or was that it?
00:47:11 - mark sweet
That's what I got.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the total okay, the attorney was 4.4. So I realized that these things are outlier. Well, whatever you want to call them, they're not they're not the usual thing. But this is part of the business model. And at the end of the day, it doesn't impact your gross profit margin, your net profit margin, net profits, your margin, your margin, my brain. Okay. Geez. Anyway. yeah. But your P and L's don't track anything by like sources and states and stuff like that. It's just overall retainers and expenses, right? Not like attorney fees and expenses.
00:48:01 - mark sweet
As far as revenue goes, so I've never been out by state. Yeah, but not by, I mean, I can pull from case, obviously, but I like going to a quick books and pulling out every single case.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But there you don't, it doesn't tell you like quick books doesn't have a report by state, right?
00:48:22 - mark sweet
I mean, that source.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, your source. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
00:48:28 - mark sweet
And I mean, part of this is one source. We don't necessarily know what we're setting up a case if it's going to be a huge case or a small case with limited exceptions. And so I understand what you're like hinting at, right? Okay, if this source in general, we get higher quality cases from how we grow that source, right?
00:48:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, not necessarily. What I want to know is like, who should we, like, because sometimes you're like, well, I'm not sure I'm even going to give any more money to them. you never really have. enough map to know that for sure. And when you throttle them, then you don't have the cases. And there's a whole lot of start, stop, whole lot of start, stop, like just, that doesn't help. You grow the business consistently. So we need a really consistent source of accurate data and numbers to understand what our true average cost per retainer is by source, and then stop doing the start, stop, and pay. But I'm not paying you because I don't think that this like, I don't know where you're getting your numbers for sure.
00:49:38 - mark sweet
I've seen a big case come from a fully fake.
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have the biggest cases have come from month. Okay, but your business lives off of the fact that all the vendors bring you cases. If it wasn't for all of those, that diversification and you'd be screwed many times over but you start stop start stop with them and I think that's that that's hurting you.
00:50:08 - mark sweet
We haven't stopped any of them.
00:50:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well but throttled for sure.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Yeah definitely throttle walker here and there because they're seeing the expensive.
00:50:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Based on what?
00:50:22 - mark sweet
We can look what their sign up is at the end of each month.
00:50:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay we don't talk about that like we don't talk about like how many leads you get. I think we need to start having that conversation so I can understand that better. Okay. I mean it's never perfect because we pre-paying. Yeah but still let's let's I mean each month we have a pretty darn good idea of what it costs. It's a significant part of the conversation that we have here and it's not we're not talking about that but it it should be part of the conversation because it's relevant. which is the conversion rate, which is something that we've been talking about. How much of a pain in the butt would it be? And maybe there's a little bit of report we can just look at instead in real time. Two on Mondays when you tell us what the retainers are by source by state.
00:51:46 - mark sweet
Also, how many leads we've had by source by state. That would mean seeing the family. I feel like Josh is working on that.
00:51:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The second part. what we're asking for. just don't know when we're going to get it. So it's it's fine. Another thing, so I've brought this up several times and I've looked into it. There are companies that can help train this, but I think all of your people would benefit from call control skills. It's more than just sales calls and like Chris Voss never split the difference like all that stuff negotiating. It's specifically handling because because that is that tactic is really only best applied for the negotiation part of the conversation where your people seem to get caught up the most and this is second second hand information basically about all the rest of the team that not talking to is People are lonely, they've gone through hard things, and you've got these kind-hearted people that just don't know how to handle the call, and they think that the best way to serve the people is by giving them more pheasies, and I'm trying explain to Patrick and Lorenz who can then go explain to the rest of team, that what those people actually want most is to get their case resolved and get the money that they need to to take care of their issues. That's, and that's what Sweet Law is doing for them, and your people get as human beings do, not just because it's your people. Distracted, and they get caught up in the emotion, and they need help, learning how to kind of disconnect from that emotion, and focus on the actual outcome, and the actual service that that the client needs rendered to them and I think until you get some actual training on that for intake as well as everyone case managers attorneys and assistants anyone that talks to clients really should have this you do not have optimal conversations happening and it is a massive lever you could save hundreds of hours throughout the year across all the pods if you train them how to their conversations better you have a recommendation I can't you know I do not have a recommendation I can do research but this is not typical kind of stuff this is this is things that call centers know to do this is the things sells floors know how to do but this would be innovation and an turning situation. So you would have to be willing to do some research and experiment. But if you're going to innovate, which the kind of model that you want to have, the kind of leverage that you want to have, the kind of freedom that you want to have, that's innovation because that's not standard for an attorney office. I can do some research and say, these are the ones I think you should consider.
00:55:25 - mark sweet
I'd be happy to do that. If you got two or three, mean, might run through their basis, but it makes sense.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I will do that. Let me send myself a note real quick. Because I've had this for over year and would like to see it happen. If it helps and you'll just try something, I will go do some thorough research for us in that one of them.
00:55:55 - mark sweet
Most training is good. Most training is good. more skills are always better.
00:56:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I will do some research and I wouldn't make any recommendation to you that I wouldn't be willing to put my own money on. Oh geez, I'm bad at word, I need to do this. Dan, do you have any updates or anything to share about the pivot table that Stacy was working on with the Turndown Reasons, Month, Turndown Reason, Percentage, et cetera?
00:56:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's tough, weeks and weeks ago.
00:56:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where is it?
00:56:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was for Isaac, so I sent it to Isaac and he updated all the Turndown, he came up with implementation, because I didn't know that that's live.
00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I feel like that would be something we could look at and get some insight from Nope, because it's not that accurate, right?
00:57:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They were just the pivot table was on all the stuff that they were Classifying other right so they were just using the same words Really be a thing But then I came up with new categories and gave them to Isaac and then he implemented them and litify Going forward it will be going forward. It should be that when we go look at other. There's very few others Right, so it was other and then hundreds upon hundreds of variations of whatever Right, so I ended up coming up with some new categories with mark. Like I said send remark. It's a Sometimes, and then I gave it to Isaac and then he told me that he basically kept the old ones and then you put do not use next to them. So if you look at old data, you'll see those are selected with a do not use, but they're hopefully not using them going forward. So if we run a report, it should be none of the do not uses are from whatever, we don't get the data implemented every But now going forward, it's they're more specific. So it's there were lots of stuff like like different ways of saying that there wasn't enough insurance. And now there's just a category for that. There were different ways of saying that there wasn't enough treatment or a gap in treatment. Now there's a category just for that. So it should be going forward when you look at the turn down reason, like it's a more legitimate representation of that. And then you could start to look at that. herb and herb, is what I just did with adswordly. I showed those guys, I did this manually, but I showed them, hey, leads break down like this across five states. So your top two categories are, I might get this wrong, but it was something like this, no injury and gap in treatment. And I said, therefore, my theory that your people are signing bad cases is true because they have to be signing them from some chunk or those chunks, because that's the most likely place that they would sign them from. So whereas we don't sign them, we send you back the data that this is why we're not signing it, because 15% of your cases have no injuries. So now you could be able to run an important future on monkey and say, show me the breakdown reasons monkey generate and it will be interesting to see how these vendors go across compared to each other and It was very consistent, like across states, there's slight shifts, but for the most part, the same sort of hierarchy remained across states.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't have any other questions. We have to get to another call, but first, Mark, did you have anything else?
01:00:20 - mark sweet
Have we started on the go-high level for Chona?
01:00:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Not really. And do we want to just start building it out?
01:00:31 - mark sweet
Is that what we want to do? Yeah, or at least I know she can use as a basic scheduler because.
01:00:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is she in the office now?
01:00:38 - mark sweet
She's currently in the office. She's been there for about 30 days and their office is about as much of a show as you can imagine.
01:00:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, are the docs that you sent over from the office that she works in or that that was some other places?
01:00:53 - mark sweet
That's from other places. But right now what she needs to most help with is scheduling in follow-up. Mm-hmm. And then I know. Okay, let's get you on the calendar and, like, basically here's the open dates because it does a really good job.
01:01:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So what I've, Eric and I have been, are building like, uh, I did a shitload of this last week, so it'll apply to this. I went and started building out like the things that we reuse over and over and over. So I swipe stuff from your account that we build and swipe stuff from other accounts, like a follow up sequence, but we're implementing that in a, in a, a, just like another site that we're going to turn into a snapshot. Um, so it's not done, but it's close to done. But if she tells us, I just need to communicate with her and be like, what are you doing exactly? Cause yeah, we have like a calendar thing and a reminder thing. The first is like just a straight book or call, we'll call it, then yeah, there's one built for that. And then you just sort of use it for the, for the business of me being. And then she needs to, well, she doesn't have to be on. a Google work thing, but it's better if they are. We can dig into that.
01:02:04 - mark sweet
And they use Outlook before they have, but I can set her. I can fill the website for her and do a Google account, so it'll just be clear.
01:02:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it might work with Outlook. I don't know. I've never used Outlook there, but it might.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, we're still late though, but I'm going to send an email. I'll CC down and mark so that we can just get this conversation going. And that can be a reminder of either setting up a conversation with Chona, or if you can give me some of what you need, then I'll ask her because I'm talking to her anyway.
01:02:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like do we want to get the leads into high level would be my first thing. So like where are they coming from now?
01:02:45 - mark sweet
How will we do that? Right now, it's from the doctors directly. The biggest thing that she needs help with and that their problem is the following up with the patients who like don't show up or don't have reminders or like don't know where to call her. That's their most immediate issue that needs to be solved.
01:03:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, but how does the doctor get to lead?
01:03:11 - mark sweet
From a different doctor, usually from a chiropractor or from a law firm.
01:03:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
