Hello? Are you muted? It looks like you're muted. Can you hear me? You can chat if you can hear me.
00:00:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hey, good morning.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you are. Hi. How are you?
00:00:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We got a lot going on this morning. I was just talking with the feeding time.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so yes, you have lot going on this morning. Babies are always a lot.
00:01:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
are you?
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am good. Yeah, there's a lot going on here also too. It's very busy day. But it's good, it's good. Let me go back. So, okay, so the lizard stuff that you send does not send me any macros. It just tells me what you ate. So, because the whole point that the one thing I want to know most is how much protein did you eat at night? So, we'll just, we're not going to spend a ton of time on sleep stuff today.
00:01:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is the second, I sent you two sets in the second set and didn't do it.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I opened every, oh, there it is. The second set definitely did okay. That was actually the first one. Never mind. Okay.
00:01:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm wondering because like there is a separate one for the dinner.
00:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, no. Did you report? Did it? That's Well, so I can see it for the whole day 34. Hold on a second. That's good. Yeah, when you send the dinner thing, that's when I just see the dinner, like the food, but I don't see the protein. So hold on a second.
00:02:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Oh, nothing right.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I see protein intake for the day.
00:02:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, the other just when I when I have that dinner one, okay, I'll just have to probably use a screenshot because yeah, it's interesting when I see the dinner, if it has the macro, but I guess it doesn't send that.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just sends the food list to you. Yeah. Yeah, and if it opens it, what it does is shares it so somebody else could put that in their app. So like if we had the same meal, then I would just be able to add it to mine. So I want to go look at just real quick. So one day, August 8th, what day? It was August 8.
00:03:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, and then my sleep tracker is not accurate. I spent like four hours, not four hours. put a file like an hour, but I couldn't figure out how to transfer the image files this time. So that the sleep files are not, I have them on my computer, but these sleep files are not the ones from this week. OK. I did. Yeah, it was just driving me bonkers. For some reason, it wasn't copying. Yeah, I don't know. It's still not doing it. I can't figure out to get the sleep files in there anymore.
00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh.
00:03:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did it like the past two weeks, and then I don't know how I copy-pasted it. But I have the, like, I could take a copy.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's just go over it real quick. I can ask you some questions. Because what I'm really interested in.
00:04:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
to see is um so let me start with this first of all how's your youtube habit then this week oh no it's not bad i've been very busy so it's good no no did you have any okay so on august 8th you only had 34 grams of protein how did you speak that that night august eh uh that's the that's the four that's the first day um first day night is that the eighth this is the first one i probably better just look at my phone wait so do i look at the night to look at the night of the eighth yeah yeah so i look at august 9th right yeah
00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you not pay for the premium app?
00:05:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you rather spend time watching ads?
00:05:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, usually it doesn't show me ads like this, but I guess it's funny.
00:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will pay you to not take you in 30 seconds or 10 seconds of my life with ads. How did you sleep last night?
00:05:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, so a lot. It's August 9th. What am I looking at?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How did you say?
00:06:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Why I slept for six hours. Why did I do that? Oh, yeah, I had meetings in the morning. So I slept. It looks like it was fairly restful based on the. Oh, it was only six hours.
00:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And then or ring one.
00:06:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right. So the night of the eighth. Or ring says that I slept. Yeah, five and a half hours. And that. I had really good sleep efficiency. It was only a bed five hours and 53 minutes. That's good.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
were exhausted.
00:06:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
that's what that tells me. of that 46 minutes was deep sleep.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, how about on August 10th? So the report for August 11th.
00:07:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that was okay. So I got eight hours in bed, seven and a half hours of sleep. My efficiency was 90 percent. Deep sleep was 49 minutes. Deep sleep was 49 minutes. Rough sleep was two hours.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the reason I'm asking about that one is because you had 158 grams of protein the day before and what day is this? August 5th. the sleep report for August 6th.
00:08:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sleep report for August 6. So that was Monday night, okay. I got seven hours of total sleep, 63% restful sleep based on sleep drive around.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And the night before because you had the same amount of protein that day and they were both good amounts.
00:08:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That would have been Monday, August 5th, which would have been Sunday night. That time I got 10 hours of sleep and five and a half hours of restful sleep, 55%. Is that the one that you're looking at the restful point?
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do want to know that. I want to know total sleep. What I would also like you to track is just how you felt that day in terms of restfulness. a sleep watch. If you allow it to, we'll ask you what's your level of fatigue or how rested you feel today. And then you can just track a target so it won't add a whole lot of steps. It'll just be one thing that you do each day. It'll ask you and then it'll show up in your screenshot report of how rested you go because that would be good to know. Nothing in your journal looked. I didn't see anything that said you just felt exhausted. What it looks like to me is that maybe and it can be just by virtue of mindfulness and intention and having yourself look at your sleep and somebody else looking at it with you that you're getting better. But again, we only had a little bit of time before we started doing this.
00:09:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So how do you feel about your sleep? you feel like it's improving at all? Hard to say I just so many times and getting woken up. Yeah, you know every three hours we're getting out It's hard to say Well, do you feel yourself just barely able to get through the day sometimes was something you were talking about? just really dragging Yeah, I mean, it's yeah It's still it's still a fight. think on the the nights. I do get more sleep. It's better Obviously, I think like on that night where we just looked at like Sunday night or I guess it was Monday But it was Sunday night but Monday like I got like eight hours of sleep that night I mean even though it was disjointed. You're right. felt really good.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah That's the thing though to notice is that it doesn't have to be consecutive So if you learn how much sleep your body needs on average and it won't be the same all the time There'll be some things like the quality of sleep will make you need a little bit less sometimes And also the level of exertion during the day will make you need a little bit more to recover So if you learn to a few things because we talked about napping last week if you learn to pay attention to the signals So like if you're taking longer to complete a thought you know Then you're probably just not fully rested and a nap will be you can feel sometimes fatigue like You know what it feels like when you know that there's lactic acid in your muscles like there are different signals that you get Like a little aches little tingles sometimes just like there's little signs that our body gives us And you'll you can recognize when you start paying attention to it, which ones are improved by rest So Whether or not you get it all at night doesn't matter if you can manage to take a few naps throughout the week And make up that deficit. It's not an hour deficit. It's a quality of sleep plus quantity of sleep that is unique to you that is optimal based up again, all the things. So, but one of the things seems to be protein. It may be fat. I wasn't looking at fat at all, but protein does make a big difference on it. We could start looking at fat a little bit intake and see if that's a helpful thing, but the types of fat make difference too. And that's something you can kind of dial into a little bit. So, your YouTube stuff, you said you were just basically too busy to do it.
00:12:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I really didn't. I don't think I did a whole lot this week. I went to a wedding in Hawaii, so on Thursday night, I flew out and Friday was just, yeah, we did activities and Saturdays activities. Yes, it was all activities, so it was just it wasn't really any time.
00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, um, that's bad to be with the kid for that day, those days. That's something to take into account too. And, um, yeah. Okay, so we talked about trying to shoot for roughly a minimum of three naps on average a week just because we we found that science that's like, uh, just it's especially for mental. It was incredible. The difference that it made overall, and then just kind of thinking about, um, you could do to create a situation where napping can happen, can happen quickly, you know, allowing for that unwind and that comfort to get into that zone.
00:13:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Was that anything you had a chance to think about this week? I did it. I had to nap on Friday, um, because I knew we're going to celebrate the wedding. party on Friday night. So I took a nap Friday. And then I think that was going when I took this week.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did that work out for you?
00:14:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That was good.
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:14:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. But also that night, I think I on my sleep, I did get a lot of sleep that night too, just in general.
00:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How long did it take you to get to sleep? How long did you sleep? How long did it take you to wake up? Do you remember?
00:14:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So that was, oh, you mean after I took that nap? Yeah. So that would have been Friday. That would have been August 10th, so Friday night. Yeah. My efficiency was 90. I got eight hours of sleep. Um, 48 minutes of deep sleep, one hour, 43 of run sleep. Yeah, overall. mean, well, obviously, there's no baby yet in Hawaii. So yeah, I got a good night.
00:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got, yeah, seven hours and 55 minutes of sleep. No, I'm just asking about the napp by itself like oh the napp itself. I Quickly did you wake up? Well like how do you know as soon as I hit the bed? was asleep. Yeah, so you're right Okay.
00:15:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, so the hotel room is completely dark. So I Alright, so that's just some other input for us to just kind of think about so really trying to aim for some naps throughout the week Where you can get them?
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Noticing that just overall sleep is the bigger thing that it being fluid all together It being disjointed is not the major issue is the point it is a little bit because there's the recovery period There's the getting to sleep and the waking up. So there's time invested in that whole sleep process that you know is more but the trade-off is That if you get enough of it even though you lose some of that time in the going to sleep in the waking up having to do it multiple times. The quality of the day and and your health, which is really important, should be higher. So whatever you can do to get to the point where you feel rested and just being mindful of that. And like I said last week, it can be either, okay, you're going to plan for an app or when you recognize like I am so exhausted, I'm really struggling to get to thoughts like my body, everything is dragging slow. I know that this is the ideal point for a power nap. 20 minutes to 90 depending on what your time is available and how much of a deficit you have, how much sleep you'll be able to get that night. So you kind of do some calculations to figure out what's the ideal thing. And yeah, so we'll move on past that. But I think just kind of getting a little bit more insight. then paying attention to the protein. So like that day that you had 34 grams of protein, you had to wake up early, you had meetings. So I can't really take that into account. But you didn't get a lot of sleep that night. It might be that it took you longer to get to sleep that night or that you were a little bit too restless to even go to bed because you hadn't had enough protein. We don't know. But that's the pattern you want to kind of inspect and look at. But because that was something that definitely popped out a few weeks ago, looking at your journal, like the best night of sleep you had, you had a lot of protein the night before. So let's see if that was just an anomaly or a good thing. But actually, there's a lot of data that suggests that that's that really was what it was. That was protein. Okay. So I realized I forgot to send you follow up notes last week because I have Mark's call right after this.
00:17:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I read them.
00:17:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did send me that.
00:18:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I did. Yeah.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was like a housewife. Yeah. looked through it.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Good. So we had. We had a few action items.
00:18:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
There's called testing. Oh, wait.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's in the week before. Yeah. were sending them.
00:18:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:18:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because we had a few tasks and I looked to them and going, I don't think I sent this.
00:18:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July 29th.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, was a week before.
00:18:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I was, I'm still working on the things that we before.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time flies. know. There's a lot to do and you've got a lot to do and you've got this baby. And then there was a wedding and all the work. Yeah. And that's why the, the pace can't be the dictator. It has to be the values. It has to be the life, the things that you're doing. So. One of the things that we talked about is having Esther. manager get the monthly report for the lottery so that we can see and start tracking like how many doctors are in the areas that you're in and how many injuries are happening and then asking her to sign an NDA just to create that environment of we don't talk about this don't tell everybody don't tell anybody kind of thing about the report and let's see let's see and then I also wanted to see what data you had because you just had a really rough week I actually remembered that and then I didn't talk about it with her because we didn't talk about any work this this week and she was just very busy since I left and then yeah so sure nights have been destroyed just a few more weeks until the help comes go just a few more weeks so the other thing that we talked about too is um what can you do and obviously last week had some stuff going on and maybe this week where you can is there a day this week that you can give her a break like just a nap all day yeah yeah today is actually going to be the day she's eating right now and then after this call she's going to go take a nap again so nice she's already yes well as you have learned for yourself that catch up time where you just get a break because somebody gave it to you is really really powerful and um if if you can look at your calendar and look at the next day that you can do that for her so that she can look forward to it that's what we were talking about last week is giving her something to mentally attached to and just be like I just have to get through here and then get a break because when you don't know that a break is coming that's what wears on you more than anything it's that unknown so have you ever heard of the study of the drowning rats so They put rats into water and after about 15 seconds they would stop trying to swim and they would sink or was it 15 minutes? Anyway, I'll tell you what the difference is. 15 seconds 15 minutes, either way the discrepancy between the choices are insane. whenever they decided that they were going to quit fighting, it was 15 seconds or 15 minutes they gave up and they would just die. But if a human reached in at the last second to rescue them, they would start swimming for like another day and a half. They would tread water. That is what the difference is when you know there's hope for a break.
00:21:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's cool.
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now if you, I know it's terrible and I think oh my gosh but Yeah, but where would we be without the information that we have? And I don't know. It's I'm I'm proled.
00:22:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
very cool. Yeah, that makes sense.
00:22:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that's what I'm asking you to be mindful of of being able to give the Esther and just feel like because like you just don't know if you don't know that there's any help coming or if it's not coming till September, like it's basically a crapshoot. Then I don't know if I can make it through the shoot. But if I know that in four days, food is going to be home and I'm going to get to nap for hours and my husband's going to be there and my kids are going to be there. Everybody's going to be under one roof, but I get to sleep, I can hold on for that.
00:22:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Know what I mean?
00:22:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're giving her a psychology, a psychological boost that nothing else can't like there's nothing else that would compare to knowing that you're you're going to do that. Now the one thing you can do though is take it away. That would undermine it very, very quickly. If that happened once, okay, if that happened twice, then she can't come on it anymore. And she's just like, I'm basically on our own because that's what strong woman do there. yeah, I can't count on you. And it doesn't mean that you didn't intend to that. It just means it loses the power of the gift that you were trying to get by planning. Does that make sense?
00:23:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:23:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, that's something that both of you can do because if she ended up being rested and also just not feeling fatigued and overwhelmed, know, mom and dad's energy are so potent in the family.
00:23:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. step two of the spreadsheet, ranking the energy, the skill, the training stuff.
00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
didn't look at that. Did you do that? I did. Yeah. I did it on the plane.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, it doesn't matter where it got done. make it done. So let's see, energizes you more often than patient report and approve. Okay, it's selling the flashcards.
00:24:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, but they're already done. That's why I said that. It's just like, it's very simple. When a sale comes through, I just, I approve it to give it to them. That's what I mean. Yeah, because it's very simple.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, the report writing. So the report writing, what is SIBTF writing?
00:24:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What does that mean? It's a subset of the QME report. So the general, like 90% of the QME reports are just bread and they're very simple. did this person get hurt at work or not? And I have a very good grasp on them. SIBTF, I've been doing it for about a year and a half, and they are a much more comprehensive report, like I have to report on every joint in their body, comprehensive, like I have to write a custom paragraph for each, like neck, right shoulder, left shoulder, right elbow, left elbow, right wrist, left wrist, hand, left hand, et cetera. So it's a growing report, and it is custom tailored to every attorney, which is different. In QME, in the normal QME, I just do the same report. So I have templates, but SIF, each report has to be written to each attorney, and it's a very small subset of the reports that I do.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be possible? Do you ever use AI, like chat GPT?
00:25:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, actually, well, no.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use it all the time. what I'm wondering is, if you If you have a call recording, and I don't know, you'd have to know it doesn't follow under HIPAA, so that wouldn't be an issue either. also, your account is supposed to be private as much as any other software that you would be using. what you could do is you could create... So, chat GBT has memory, and you could say that these are the requirements for this particular firm. They need this, this, this, and this. And then you upload a transcript of the call that you do, or so if you record it a patient live, the conversation, then you could use the transcription service that's also AI for the majority. Like this would save you a ton of time, you'd still have to go over it yourself and make sure it's accurate and make any adjustments, because there will be a margin of error.
00:26:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But... think it's actually more the... My wife does that already. have a historian take the... those notes. So I get those, I get what the patient says. It's converting that into the opinions.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so this is what I'm getting to though. You can train the AI very, very well now. And again, there will be a margin of error, but the best part of it to me is it does the grunt work, it does the first two levels basically of work, and then you go in improvement. So the brain fatigue fatigue is drastically reduced. So and it's very good at logic, although sometimes I think they make updates and then I have to go through and go wait a minute, you used to have no problem doing this and now you have a problem doing it. So you do have to pay attention to output because it is software, because it is valuable, all those things. But you can give it the logic and say, okay, we are running a report for this particular law firm. These are the things that matter most to it. These are the examples. So you'll have examples of how these responses need to be written. Okay. Um, and then you give it the transcript and then you have it say, okay, push out the report to me. And then whatever it reports back, okay, say you failed to acknowledge this, you failed to write this, you wrote this in this particular way, I gave you this example, I need you to write it more like this example.
00:28:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So you spend a little time training, but I think your brain would love it. So the same prop you're saying, like in the same thread, you just keep doing that.
00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's actually called a chat thread, the threads just just as we get on the same verbiage if we're going to talk about this more. And what the new version of chat GPT does now is it has memory that stays in the bank across all threads. So you could create a new thread for every patient so that it's documented separately. And we could go through this as an example, we could spend one call, like if you go through and you had a call recording and set parameter. First, we could do one call, spend our whole call for the most part, just doing that, and I could try you how to use it. And then, but I really think that it could probably save, like, even if it cut your time only 25%, that would be helpful. But I bet it could cut it more. And the technology has evolved so fast in the last 18 months, that it's only going to get better and better. think the memory will increase. So there's a limit to how much you can remember. Worst case scenario, though, each you would pay for a premium subscription, which is $20 a month. So worst case scenario, let's say you had to have one subscription for- Oh yeah, I already paid for it. Yeah, but let's say the memory wasn't enough and you didn't want to keep typing things. So there's one or two things. Like, you could either update the- like, you could have a document with all of your problems. Oh, I can't see it, but I see that there's a fuzzy baby. I just wanted to say hi to Pina. Hi! Oh, you look so amazing.
00:30:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you.
00:30:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't like a beautiful baby. Oh, my gosh. Hi, Maddie. Oh, she's so precious.
00:30:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how you managed to do this four times.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:30:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
just wanted to say hi.
00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. Hi.
00:30:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm so glad. Thank you.
00:30:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here.
00:30:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, my gosh. Go ahead and carry on.
00:30:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just wanted to say hi since he's been here. Oh, you just made my day.
00:30:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I mean, like Fuji, but, you know, babies are better.
00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Babies and Esther.
00:30:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Esther's pretty awesome.

Even Mark says how awesome you are.
00:30:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, thank you.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the seat of him. You're special. Oh, bless you.
00:30:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. See you guys soon. Bye. Oh, it's so beautiful. Okay, so anyway, you could, there's a couple of different ways to go about it. You can have a couple of different accounts, so you can have sufficient memory so that you're not having to copy and paste things constantly if you ended up running out, or you could create a prompt document for each firm that has different rules. So, basically, you preemptively, you know, you've written everything out, you've written out the structure, you've written out all the examples and everything, and one thing, which you can then just copy and paste into it, and then give it the text. I am very sure that we could reduce the amount of time you have to spend writing significantly. Okay. I didn't really even notice these things, yeah, there's a, you could do create a GPT. or you do a customized chat GPT?
00:32:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'll play around with it this week.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:32:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Makes sense.
00:32:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's, it's fun to me, especially just watching the iterations between reports and my brain works for it perfectly because I already speak very clearly step by step. And that is the best way to make chat GPT work really well is you have to give it very clear parameters back to the whole expectations things. You get in, you get, you get out what you put in. So the more clear that you are with the logic and the reasoning explaining why you're doing things. And then again, just be patient. Like if you get bad output, spend time training it. there's a few little tricks that you can get to do it. you can say, you're not taking a sufficient amount of time. to reason this out logically. You're not paying attention to the details. I need you to think like a particular person, maybe if there's a historian or something that you know that writes a particular way or has deducted reasoning, Sherlock Holmes, like whatever. There are different references that you can give it to invoke a certain type of behavior and process. I don't know why it's not consistent. I feel like it probably chooses an algorithm to follow based off of some instructions, but you can teach it to think better just by telling it to. Imagine that its processes have a certain set amount of resources and it's like I'm going to give you 5% of my resources unless you tell me that that's not doing the job and I need to go get more. I'm going to give you the minimum buyable amount of resources and save the rest for everybody else unless you if you tell me I need to perform at higher level. I would imagine that there's some kind of reasoning like that, that, you know, so that it manages its resource as well. Anyway, okay, QME report approvals. So do your people write reports for you?
00:34:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I should differentiate that. So I so Esther's team does what's called the history. That's the collecting, the how the injury happened, what happened after their injury, like their medical history, their surgery history. So Esther writes all that for me. I do the other two parts, which is, and then also Esther's team summarizes the notes for me. So people will bring in. all the medical records and then she'll summarize that. She does the summary of the past and then she takes the history for me. So she does those two big things and then I do the physical examination in the room with them face to face and then I write the report in the or I write the opinions while I'm in the room with them. So my approval process is once we put all four pieces together, the history, the medical records summary, my physical and my opinions, we make that into the final report.
00:35:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I approve. Okay, how long does that take you?
00:35:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it can be like a minute or it could be like 10, I never know.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's possible, too, that we could train and maybe even create a car costume.
00:36:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I have a human, I actually have a human that looks at, it's called a report, like he's like a quality control person, so he looks, he's chiropractor, like a doctor, chiropractic medicine, but he looks at the final report and it gives his thoughts to me in an email and that's what takes me one to ten minutes. If he says, this looks great, submit, then I just, I submit it to Esther, then he says, there's a lot of problems here, I don't agree with this logic that he used, then it takes me ten minutes to rewrite it. Got you. That's why, but he is, he is doing that, that pass of like the quality.
00:36:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's possible, now, now when that happens, You're not, you're just changing the way you wrote things. Is that correct before you send it back to him?
00:37:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, it's frustrating for me because he doesn't do the edits, right, and he's not allowed to technically. He tells me what he thinks, but he doesn't do them. So like the edit could be, he, hey, I noticed you wrote, you wrote this, like you wrote the wrong name or something. like it could be just a simple like typo. And I have to, what I have to do is I have to download the final report in a Word document. Because I edit in Google, you all my edits in Google, but then on the final report, obviously it's one document. So I have to download it, and then I have to go into Microsoft Word and change it. And that's why it can take up to like 10 minutes. It's not like my reasoning is quick, but. but it's the like the actual going into Microsoft Word and editing it. That takes me a couple of minutes, which is why it's frustrating for me.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still think that's potentially something that we could leverage and not necessarily automate, but semi-automate and delegate. Potentially, if you have the right people, it's also, it's not a significant amount of time, so it might just be something that's just, it needs to be yours and you do it for quality. But let's just talk about it for a second and say that what you could do potentially, and I don't know, maybe if it's Esther's manager or person on your team.
00:38:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, this is the piece where I have to actually do, because when I go to trial, they ask me, did I do the final?
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's like, yeah, this is like, that's why I like the idea of a custom GPT.
00:39:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
for the SIVTF, because that first pass, you can have people do it. That's completely illegal. But the final pass I have to do. So yeah, it's frustrating.
00:39:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if we improve the first pass, maybe that will help with the output a little bit more and you can change it and just say, you know, make sure that name spelling is consistent across the board and make sure like whatever little things that you notice crop up, you create in the prompts to try to mitigate how often that happens. So you then diminish the likelihood of having to have those feedback and adjustments of something that takes you 10 minutes. May or may not possible, but it's something to look at.
00:39:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
interesting like creating a prompt when I'm writing the report, maybe, because if I do it in that process, then it would get caught. Otherwise, I'd have to have like one of the staff. Yeah, so it would have to be when I'm doing, yeah, I can, yeah, I think if I, I didn't know about, honestly I didn't know that these the custom GPTs you can make. I didn't even look at that part. So, yeah, that's interesting. Maybe I'll try it with the SIF first, see how it goes. And then if that works okay, I could do it for the general reports to when I'm writing up, like in the moment.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because the thing that we're looking for is if there's something that you have to do that drains your energy, we want to modify that as much as possible to either reduce, well, not either or, but both reduce the amount of time that you have to spend on it and reduce the amount of energy that it drains from you so that your higher level activities have more time and have more of your energy and your higher profitability activities have more time or energy. Obviously that activity is an impact on profitability because if you don't get those done and they don't get done correctly, you don't have that income. So I would say that that's one of those things that definitely is income impacting because there is no job without that, right? There is no revenue if you don't perform that task.
00:41:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's interesting the SIF. I have like 12 of them in backlog. Each of those reports is probably worth like $15,000. So I have like $150,000 of AR that's not out for billing because I haven't written them yet.
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's what I'm going to say. Me showing you how to use chat GPT finish those is going to pay for our coaching for the next year or two.
00:41:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's the AR moving.
00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the math and the logic. No, because then is the compounding effect kicks in. And you'll take on more because you're going to stop dragging your feet around. So, and you're going to go get your watch because you're going to, okay, so remember how I told you with BJJ, you need to just consider your paying for access and then that's just shifted your paradigm. When you want to get into making and keeping much more money, these are the kind of equations that you need to make. Instead of looking at what does it cost you, you need to look at what it makes you. So, going to Jiu Jitsu gives you more energy, gives you a better mood, you sleep better. That's $200 is chump change for what you get out of it, right? The same thing with like, and you don't just pay money that you spend an hour a week with me, so that's an investment that's too, you know, that you have to work your schedule around. this, helping you hire better for your assistant at home and your chef, the impact that's going to make on your life. And then just these little things like this is how you need to look at the coaching that you're investing in But but also like chat GPT all these little things We have gone through studying goals. That's something that you want to do for July medical and we're still not quite there yet But this right here, and this is what I want to show you too about leverage is because this was a small exercise You went through and you filled some things out. We had one conversation about it. I guarantee you That is going to save you tons of money or some tons of time tons of energy But the bigger thing is it's going to unlock the revenue that you're dragging your feet on because you don't want to do it True, but but there's something else that happened. So you with their consciously or subconsciously and I'm going to say that it's both Get annoyed with yourself for not doing what you know. need to do Get annoyed with the process that it has to be done um you know there are things that we we go through in our head and that drains us even more because then we add resentment either to ourselves to the process to the job and it builds until it releases so generally it will only release when you've done the thing or you get paid okay but the other piece of that is one of the lawyers the 12 reports that I have in backlog are all one lawyer all the other ones that put up oh so he's a pain in the he's a pain in the yeah so like every time I send him my final um he comes back and says oh I need you to do these things um okay so you what you're going to do when you train chat GPT is you're going to give as many conversations as you can to it to train it you mean like the documents like the pdfs yes i have it in word word but also So his emails, also your conversation, everything. So you're going to say, I did this, he said this, I did this, he said this, I did this, he said this, okay, I need you to psychologically profile this person. First of all, is he consistent? what he's asking for? Because he really pisses me off. You can tell it that because it's not a real person, but it, but it will take the logic into account and it will take that psychological profiling into account and say, what do I need to do to ensure that I don't hear back from him, that what I give to him is, is perfect, flawless, going to trigger any kind of additional request. Okay, I need you to, so what it gives you is something you're going to add to your future prompts every time you ask it to help you write a report for him. And then what you're going to do is when he gives you feedback again, you're going to say, okay, we worked on this. together, we profiled him. This is what we determined we need to do. He still complained. This is what we said. What do you see that we did that we could have improved to mitigate this? Or do you feel like his request is unreasonable? So that way you get a little bit more understanding and you can know, is it you? Is it not? And if he's unreasonable, but it's still money, you just deal with it. But you deal with it faster because now you have something else to to go through and process it logically.
00:46:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So how do I upload my whole report? Because each report is like, you know, 80 to 200 pages in a PDF in a I'm sorry, not PDF. It's in a Microsoft Word document.
00:46:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can export as PDF.
00:46:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so chat GPT likes PDFs.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, PDFs generally are probably smaller than Word Docs. And you can check, so you can save it as a Word doc, and you can export as a PDF, and you can look at it. I haven't ran yet into a PDF that was too big for UPT-40.
00:47:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Have you ever tried it with documents, Microsoft Word? Have you tried it with Microsoft Word documents?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I always export as a PDF and have it any way for consistency and formatting and generally they're just they're smaller. Also, I sort of hate Word, so Microsoft is bloated. Yeah, no, but I have uploaded Google Docs, I've uploaded spreadsheets, I've uploaded Excel documents, and Microsoft documents, but they're so much less than the other formats that I couldn't tell you.
00:47:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, all right, I'll try it with what I have and see. Okay, this actually sense. It's kind of exciting to try to tackle these reports again. Yes.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Try this. This is what I was hoping you would say.
00:48:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm tricking my mind to try it again.
00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is the thing I was about to say when you were sharing something though is that you like building things, you're a little nerdy, you're competitive. What I want you to do is think about you gamifying the system.
00:48:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, Q&A, if you can gamify this system where you're not spending a whole lot of time, but you're making a whole lot of money, that's fun. Also if you know that you're using technology to smash your competition, like they're driving themselves nuts, working, being tedious, and you're over here like, chad TVT what up, bro? You know, it's a whole different, it's a whole different mindset, but so. We weren't tracking time. We have nothing to compare to how long these things took. But if you use the technology to optimize it and you just know like I'm not having to deal with him as much and my cases are getting done faster and they're not building up in a backlog. The energy from the victory over the process that becomes huge and that does excite you. So it's two things. It's removing the tediousness of it and it's replacing it with the energy of victory like I got you. This is nothing fully defeated.
00:49:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
me my money. That's interesting. Do you know if there's a way I can upload multiple because I have about a thousand, probably about 2,000 reports I've done over my career. Is there a way to bulk upload all those reports?
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can upload a zip file. Let me just ask Jeff to be here.
00:50:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have a thousand, I have two thousand reports in PDF format. They're all the same report. Can I upload them so it could help train you?
00:50:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, upload the zip file to the code interpreter. Yeah, so you might have to Google it, but it looks like you can.
00:50:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, yeah, I'll actually ask chat GPT.
00:50:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, I use it for so many things, including like just finding supplements that have this don't have that do this don't do that like the logic reasoning that you can't do in Google, you know. Yeah, so and then if you have any questions, you can ask me, but I'm pretty sure that you'll have Googled it and you to did and finished it by the time that it. We talk next week. So I'm going to set a new goal for you this week is I would like to see you knock out at least 50% of those reports by next week.
00:51:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sounds good.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's fair.
00:51:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
At least I'll draft them to the attorney because my final drafts are never good enough for him. So I will draft at least 50% to him.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you committing to that? Because now it's going to fall under the rule of this is a homework assignment with the due date.
00:51:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I'll do five.
00:51:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that.
00:51:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I don't know exactly. I think it's 12, but I'll just say five.
00:51:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You will draft.
00:51:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What's his name? I actually drafted all of them to him. My first draft. I did all of them before the baby came and then he was like, oh yeah, we got to talk about him. I'll wait till after you're done with the baby. So yeah, I actually did send him a pass already. But yeah, I'll I'll go get back on and you'll. Like, what are your comments about, give me all your comments and let's go.
00:52:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we, can he have an identifier, like a first name or I can just call him. Frank, Frank, Frank sounds like a pain.
00:52:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And honestly, like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't take this business except that each report, it's only, it's 40, it's the same amount of pace. And it's 40 minutes, 30 minutes face to face with their client. And it's, it's just a matter of getting the report. And I know that if I can get the reports, it's each report is worth about $15,000 to me. Sometimes like 30. Um, and so that's why I know that if I can get just, if I can just get better at it, it's going to work.
00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, okay, there is no way you're not going to get better at this. So here's what I want you to remember, even if it's only a 10% improvement, I want it to be higher. But even if it was a 10% improvement, that would be significant. I'm almost positive that you can at least cut the pain in the level down by 50%. If you train it well. and get the fish in the mouth. So again, this is one of those things where we do what I call front loading. So you do a lot of work in the beginning, setting the system up, and then you let the system do the work for you perpetually infinite, what that would just, infinitesim, that's correct. Um, that, so really take the time to understand how, and you can ask me questions, I do think that you have the ability to not meet me and that a YouTuber will probably be a better use for you to show you how to do the things that you want to do, but you totally ask me questions. Um, figuring out, so first how to train it on the process, give all the information about Frank and his interactions very specifically based off of here's what I did, here's what he said, here's what I did, here's what he said, that kind of stuff.
00:53:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
On those quick question on that piece, is that are you copying his emails into this?
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yes, and as much as so imagine like you were giving it to a person. How would you do it? You would say, here's what I did. And then you give them the exact example copy paste and quote. Okay. And now here was his response and quote. You know, here's my draft. Here's what he said.
00:54:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
He's breaking draft.
00:54:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what he said. Exactly. Label all of it. And so it happens when you submit something to chat TVT as it wants to process immediately. So all you do is press the stop button and continue to feed your information. Continue to press the stop button. If you need to and say, okay, now I want you to review everything that I've sent you in this entire conversation before you respond to me. Here are my questions. Do you have any questions to help me? Do you have any questions before you give me an answer that would make sure that you have everything that you need to do this? And it's an iterative process. The one thing I would have you reach out to me is if you're getting just crap back, if it's not doing the right thing, you can share the whole conversation with me, there's a share thing, and then I can go and review it and go, okay, here's what I would tweak about your prompting. But if you think of it as a person who can't get offended, but a person who absolutely needs all the relevant data, and you just give it extra information so that it's very, very clear, you're going to get good output, and it will save you some time immediately.
00:55:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I actually automated a lot of my processes for July with chat TPT writing code for me. So I'm fairly familiar, but I hadn't thought of it or hadn't, I just hadn't done it for the report writing, but I like this. I think I could, I think I could, I think I could do it.
00:55:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sounds fun. Oh, I'm positive you can. Okay, I got Oh, one minute before I have to go talk to Mark, get to go talk to Mark is what I mean. Um, let's see, he's not E.R.
00:56:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
anymore. Well, he did just lose. So now he's sad about that. then he lost his father, not even a year ago on that.
00:56:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's E.R. from now. I know he's not.
00:56:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I am shocked, at least not on the meetings. Like, yeah, I don't think he is. I've never, I, I guess when I first met him, I did kind of, I was like, I guess that he's kind of good. But yeah, recently he hasn't, I mean, it's he's been through a lot, but he's still very positive. So yes.
00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What that's, that's how I know that he has grown so much because between his dad and Dolte, I would have thought that he just took a week and a half off. And I got a message like Mark's off the rails and like, so I checked in on him and he wasn't, he just took a little time. And then he went to the office and he brought Ronan to the office and, and he sounded, Okay, he's got friends like you. He's doing things and yeah, he's not our E or anymore. He's good. Okay, so I gotta go. I know. Okay, bye have a great week.
