00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, Tina. Hey, guys. How are you?
00:00:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good. are you?
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am pretty good. trying to take care of my sissy long distance. She lives like five hours away from me and she's got pneumonia and I'm into the carning her, all the herbs. Oh, Yeah, it's not good.
00:00:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let's see. I guess it's her turn. It was you last week, man.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
your turn, huh? Yeah. Yes. It's crazy how sick people are getting this year. Let's see. There's my right tab. I did not get notifications again this week either. Did you guys have looked at it? And I know I remember saying, Hey, just shoot me a message if you did up to date. So I know. Did we update the journal?
00:00:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we both.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good we added you yeah it is not working it should be what's today is the 12th to do 10 22 sweet attorney tell me right that's not the right one let's not the right one that's not the right one there we go i'm just gonna drag this over here you know when did you guys update it i updated this morning i was waiting for my uh my one-on-ones how about you patrick this morning this morning um all right let me go review this to do um points of pushback for call training clients pushing back on why we are taking off 8% fee. Oh, okay. Though clients signed retainer for that amount, declining injections or treatment that will increase the value of the case. When we have to go through other parties' insurance for a vehicle repairs payment, which takes a while, especially if multiple vehicles are involved, how can we shift clients' focus to getting medical treatment while the vehicle portion gets resolved. Clients hyper focus on the car and want to focus on treatment later. This is definitely a skill with an area of allowance. Skill for the percentage that we can influence and appear as space of allowance for those that we can't. There are going to be people you just can't convince and persuade, that's not going to be the majority of them. Roughly, 80%. will be able to be persuaded to do the thing that we want them to do as long as we have the skill to persuade efficiently and effectively. Okay, so Lorenz, everybody's finally back from break. Karen will be working with Jess and Mike in order to get them back up to speed on cases. Need to keep a close eye on Jonathan and make sure he doesn't get along with me baby and working from home, blocking out some time to just focus on elements, had one on ones last week. He blocking out, are you blocking out?
00:03:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm blocking out.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm going to need differentiators when we're talking for one person to switch in a U. Meet that enough from both of you. So Lorenz that's some time to just focus on elements, had one on ones last week. Everyone is filling a little tired from all the absences and rules. lifting. Hopefully, now that everyone is done with time off, we can get back on track and gain our momentum back. Interesting, because it's also holiday season. Let's see how that goes. Options from clients only concerned with PD and want to stop treatment is very similar, Patrick. Because it takes too much time away from work, mean money right now, regardless of cases true value. Intake never mentioned the 40%, only said 33.3%. So I need to highlight this. I need to take these notes that you guys both gave me today to mark. Everybody okay with that? Because he needs to hire a firm that can help us train that. But also, if that's an issue with intake not representing properly, that expectation is going to have a huge impact throughout the whole case. So, Um, yeah, it needs to happen there, but it also needs to happen in your interview call like your your first. I don't remember what you guys call it.
00:05:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's not intake, but it was a call.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, intro. So you need to make sure your team is covering that with a view. Okay. Okay.
00:05:22 - patrick
I think Mark does it on purpose.
00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:26 - patrick
So that's why we kind of just when we get the case, we just kind of throw them into treatment and do our part, especially in the beginning because I know if we mentioned it, and they'll probably go somewhere else type of thing.
00:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I mean, that's up to Mark how he wants to do it. Yeah, that's. And we spend a lot of money on the leads that we get.
00:05:50 - patrick
technically it's their job to meet the full retainer. Yeah. It's job, you know, so I don't know. It's like a gray area. I try not to believe.
00:06:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
touch on it at the end of the case I go through the retainer with the client if they want but at that point like the case is already done so yeah so they you came back out of it yeah right yeah I think I've discussed this with Mark before and his response kind of makes sense to me is he says like I don't mind reducing if we have to reduce at the end of 33% that's fine that costs us less than losing cases that costs less than losing cases and for everyone we reduce we get eight or nine that we we get 40% out of okay so we need a not enough perfect you know once in a while someone falls through the cracks and we you know I review the case and it looks It's like, client has been out of the loop for a month or two, and so I correct the web where I call the client myself. But more often than not, rather than that being the case, it's client that has unreasonable expectations as to how often you should be communicated with. So we have oftentimes it's Spanish speaking clients, but it does happen once in a while with English speaking clients where they feel like they should be updated every couple days, and not a text or an email, but a full 30-minute phone call every time. And so it's on me, when that happens, I kind of have to step in and be like, we set expectations with them and be like, stop yelling at my assistants. They're doing their job. you know, if we speak to you every two days, if we do that with every client, the case will never get settled.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, and this comes to positioning too, is you have a right to expect that we handle the case and we get the full amount for you and we get you the best settlement possible. How we do that? You don't, you don't get to dictate. We do the best we can for you. We've got a system for it, but but again, setting the expectations in the beginning, this is the schedule that you should hear from. You will hear from us at least once a week. If something needs to be addressed more frequently than that, then you will hear from us. But there is a necessity and by the nature of the process, a lot of waiting and And if we have to spend more time than necessary providing updates that really don't say anything or phone calls that don't actually accomplish anything but make you feel better about it, then we're not actually doing the thing that you need to be done. The job that we're here to do is to get the settlement not necessarily make them feel better. So you have to take that on a case-by-case basis and one of the things that we can work on is what are different ways we can say that without being offensive. That's even something we can use AI for and have some suggestions like this is what I need to communicate. Give me five examples of non-offensive ways. Let's go talk to Claude real quick.
00:10:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm not a out of a peacemaker. like, you know, talking to people and listening to their concerns, but some people need some tough love sometimes.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be tough, but if you focus on the word love, then the tough is irrelevant. know, it's just, yeah, some people can be, and we all can be at times are worse enemies. So, um, I. Or from someone I'm doing. And, um, Moved out, proctoring a script for. And then certain. Thanks for watching. It's completely different database, different, and it's doing better currently than GPT 4.0 or 4.0, not 4.0. It's logic is better, but keep going like this. pulls out in front of the other. So, I use them both. For example, sometimes clients want to hear from us every couple of days and have a 30-minute phone call and feel like we are not taking proper care of them if that doesn't happen. However, the nature of have the case with such that sometimes there is nothing to report within that time frame and a thirty minute call and multiply across all cases we can't be product not not something we can tell the clients obviously a diplomatic response that helps them feel like we are aware of them on the top of their case and never letting it all through the cracks so it's just me but we're efficient with our time actually helps us serve them better and reduce their I give impact to them let's see ask if you have any What is your firm's current standard communication protocol? They will hear from us no less frequently than once a week. They will hear from us. is the process?
00:14:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Either text, email, phone call.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You That is so long. Um, let's adjust for More Maybe like, um, I'll tell client in the respectful way that.
00:15:54 - patrick
We'll call him when there's an update.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Oh, and it did give us phrases for different situations. don't know if you noticed that I didn't like I'm Tina and I passed through things really fast I like this So this thing That can end up so in call control clean edge One of the things they'll teach you is don't open a can. This is opening a can, right? Is there any specific thing you're concerned with that I can address right now? They're going to tell you if there is. The complainers will complain. So I would not do this. And that might be something that your people are doing that they should not do. Don't ask open-ended questions. Ask close-ended questions unless open-ended is required for discovery. Does that make sense? That is a huge topic adjustment that can make a big difference. listen to your people and see what you notice how often they're asking open-ended questions. Changes to the time that calls take immediately when you very specifically go from open-ended to close-ended, cuts it off robust. We're anxious clients, let's see, from every week you'll hear from us and any significant developments trigger an immediate update when something needs detailed discussion, we'll call you directly. love that specificity right there. For timeline focused clients, while legal processes have their timelines, you'll always know exactly where we stand. You'll hear from us weekly and immediately when there's movement in your case. So if you have people who are just like, give me the bottom line, I don't want to be on the phone with you. The opposite, don't want to be on the phone with you, what do I need to do to get offered to you and get this done? So, something that we can do while we're waiting for call control training is actually work through some of these specific things ourselves and come up with our own scripts that you guys think might work for you. Do you feel like just off of the calls that you've heard? are more open-ended questions than probably there needs to be?
00:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think sometimes the texting, I don't know about calls, but I think sometimes the texting leaves and that's, you know, I like texting because it's quick. It makes a record of our communication and there's several advantages, but I think something that it does, it opens up cans of worms. And that leads to a longer call than we would have to have if we just give them a five-minute call explaining what's going on.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you give me an example? Because some of it might be phrasing.
00:19:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can give you a general example. example, when we tell a client, you know, your case has settled for policy limits of $25,000, we'll send you documents to sign in the next hour agreeing to settle for the policy limits. So oftentimes my CMs will do that, and I know, I feel like a profit, because I know in the next 10 minutes of that that that text is being sent, I'm going to get somewhat confused at best and at worst upset client with a million questions about why did we settle his case without his permission? Why does policy limits mean? does he get out of that? What does he and million questions I didn't see?
00:20:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, so there's a couple ways to handle it is just automatically assume you're going to tag team a text for the record purpose with a phone call or and this would be something we'd have to talk to about Mark and whether or not like it it could be done. Can we send out an email that explains all of these things? What is policy limits? What are the frequently asked questions? Why did we settle without your permission? You know, this is what we do is your representative, this is whatever. It's not like civil law or you know what I mean, family court, that type of, they're different types of things. So what answer would you give or why did you settle without my permission?
00:21:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Because there's no additional money that can be obtained from the insurance company. The policy limit is exactly what that is. It's the limit that the insured is covered for.
00:22:00 - patrick
That's the maximum amount available, so Yeah, I would My windows zoom get out of the runs on that one I don't tell them that we settled it I'd say to put the insurance was offered, you know the maximum the document we're sending is You know once you sign it, then we officially agree to There's not maybe a better way to go about it. I need to talk to my people about that Yeah, because I used to get the same thing. It's like well, didn't agree to this so yeah I'm like hey, this is what they offer, know this it's the maximum what we sent you is the official agreement You know to accept because technically it's true unless they sign the release you haven't really accepted the Mm-hmm.
00:22:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So Actually, where's the homework? Yeah. Now it's just a week of 11, 12, four. I like that a lot, Patrick. I really like that we're doing this together because I think there's a lot of, you know, we all have different personalities and sites, but sometimes it's not necessarily you or you, but your team, you discovered it because one person on your team handles it a particular way and you're like, that works really well. That's awesome, you know. So in terms of basically settlement, text, updates, triggering calls of confusion and frustration. Let's try pre-empting that response with pre-empting, whatever, with, I don't know, language that handles the objections before spoken. For example, not resettled the case, but what did you say, Patrick?
00:24:39 - patrick
This is what the insurance company does offer. If it's policy limits, explain that's the maximum. If it's like a final offer, just explain that.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, explain that max we can get out of the case. Um, let's just be thorough. Um, we'll. I think that period kind of like full stop and not necessarily explain why because that almost probably opens another camp, but what if, but what if, but what if period that is the max that can happen period move on. What was the next thing you were going to say?
00:25:46 - patrick
If it's a non policy limit, like the MacPOP offer.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. He said final offer or whatever.
00:25:56 - patrick
Yeah.
00:25:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we're.
00:26:00 - patrick
I'm saying explain to them why it's a fair amount based on the case, the facts of the case.
00:26:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that potentially gives room for an argument. How would you put an argument?
00:26:22 - patrick
So I like to give kind of like general, you know, if this X amount of treatment is done typically to the offer will range from, you know, to this. I try to do that when I send out the demand, that conversation. You hey, we send out a demand. This is what I'm expecting based on the treatment you got. This is typically what insurance will offer. If the insurance offers more, then we look like, you know, we're a hero. If not, if it's like a lower offer, we explain to them, you know, we need to still negotiate it.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I want to kind of create this in a, like, I didn't capture everything, so I'm still typing and you're talking. And I want to be able to have enough that Lorenz, you can go kind of chew on this a little bit and figure out, okay, this is what I'm going to bring to my team and this is what will improve on. And then, as always, I think that there'll be some more evolution, right? Somebody will come back to you, say, well, yeah, but this scenario pops up and how do I handle this? And that's where this is, this is really a great refining process. And honestly, and I'll remind you too, every week we will find a little something else, little something else, and it's got that compounding effect that we just get better, which, again, less for less stress, happier team, end up doing better for the clients also. So, you said a little bit more after this. Is there something I didn't capture that?
00:28:29 - patrick
No, I missed pretty much that. They're not happy with the amount. You kind of just, you know, reiterate. If I truly think that it's a fair offer, I'll be like, look, in all honesty, based on what you have, they probably should have offered, you know, But, you know, thankfully, you know, we were able to go back and forth with them. We were able to end up here.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it's like, sorry, we have to this real quick. If there's a situation where we got more than we. it normally would or expect point that out that this is actually a above average settlements and I don't know, period. I think one of the things we do want to make sure our people get in the habit of is full stop. Just period. Just stop. Say what needs to be said and then you become a broken record. If everything's said that needs to be said, who likes talking to a broken record? Who likes talking to somebody who repeats themselves repeatedly? What are they going to do? If you hang up like okay but you're done but generally they're going to get the point. Especially if the way that you repeat it is I understand. We are very like you know I know that you want more. This is the range, we exceeded what's the average and, you know, I think we have to figure out a way to say this is a good job and we're pleased with it, even if they're not, you know, but and they can take how they want to and that's something also that can be good here. So like we can have every week, we can take one particular objection or phrase and go through cloud or chat to whatever AR we're using at the time just kind of get some ideas about how we would phrase it. The thing I feel like we got out of that today that was good is open-ended versus closed-ended. So let's make sure that when we ask questions, they are closed and did whenever possible. It should almost always be possible. Except possibly during discovery when you have to ask somebody to describe something, right. But was it this or that? Yes or no, this type of thing, right? Yes or no, or that type of question. Yeah, just shortens call length and keeps powerful guardrails for having people stay on topic. And so another skill is tactical interrupting. So I have to interrupt people a lot, unfortunately, because my brain, my job is to help people. So the priority has to be, my brain has to be working for them. So if somebody starts telling me too much. And I can't even mentally process it. I'm not going to be able to help them very well. They're wasting their time talking because I got caught somewhere and I can't make my brain be better or operate different. So I'll say, hang on, hang on, I'm sorry. I have to interrupt you for a second or I'm going to lose focus on what I'm trying to do to help you here. So I need you to pause just one second please and can we go back to this? Or let me just ask you this one question. And I'll do that as many times as necessary. But I'm apologizing, I'm explaining, I'm doing it very quickly and then I'm moving right into my question. And what happens is the question's been posed. So what happens in their brain? Their brain starts to answer the question and they're not thinking about their objection. They're feeling their objection, potentially still, They're annoyance and irritation. But their brain is trying to move along with me in the conversation and answer. the question. This is why people ask those, if you have social media and you read a question, and 10,000 people and their dogs had answered it. If you're like question, let me answer. It's just this weird like psychological reflex. Pause the question, people's brains try to answer it, and generally their mouths follow suit. So, um, interrupting with, I'm so sorry, I need to, like, I missed something and I really want to get this for you. I really want to make sure I take care of this for you. I really want to make sure I understand this right, so I'm helping you the best that I can, right? It's all about them. Here's the question again. Close-ended. Okay, and then they want to go, oh, oh yeah, okay, before you go there, I have one more question. How about this? So you didn't say, I don't want to hear from you. don't need to know that. Shut up. You're talking to us You said wait before you go there. Also, what happens as soon as you go like this like they're not seeing you But there's a if you say wait if you use it or if you go They can tell or about to ask a question there are so many nuances and so many little tactics that you can use that Actually come pretty naturally, but you can be strategic about it with some people and It makes a difference it makes a difference in the energy of the call when they're not feeling like You're being controlled with annoyance and impatience and shortness and sharpness but instead with breaths Apologies Questions things like that, you know what I mean? They accomplish the same thing, but they feel differently and that can be really helpful. these are things that we can take back to the team before, I mean, it is call control training. I'm telling you is call control training. Maybe we get somebody else that, you know, comes and takes care of the whole thing. in the meantime, we've got the ability to make an impact on how things get handled and so let's be working on that. Let's see, someone I'm just doesn't understand how segregation lanes work, didn't know medical bills. Is that a person or clients? That's a person, didn't know that the medical bills would come out of a settlement. And I have no idea what segregation lanes are.
00:35:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and this is kind of a complicated concept. you know, the first time I heard it, I was a young attorney. I was very confused and so I can understand. people get confused about it. But essentially, you know, if you treat through your health insurance, your health insurance has a right to assert a lean against your settlement. And but clients understand that they treat through Medicaid or Medicare and they understand what a lean is. Right. so we go through that several times with them, but you know, when they get their distribution, they feel like they shouldn't have to pay anything for medical. And, you know, Medicare is free. Medicaid is free. Why should they have to pay a lean for treatment that they received?
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Medicated Medicare are different things, right?
00:37:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, Medicaid is for, Medicare is for old people, Medicaid is for this, anyone can't afford healthcare.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I guess I know. I guess I'm not that old yet. know that. Also being self-employed for 22 years, I'm like, what's insurance? I don't know, I just pay out the pocket for everything. Okay, so I wonder if maybe we can create an infographic that kind of just helps explain how this works. Now, you're still going to have arguments, but if we do a good enough job on this, we can create something that is almost like, and if this, then that, and like a closed loop, we have no control over this. Nobody has control over this. other firm has control over this, right? It doesn't matter where you go. This is the system that we work in. And so anytime there's a very complex thought or idea, visuals can be really helpful. And so the whole reason infographics exists and why they were made is because they're understand a logical process, something that's complex, and understand the relationship. So there's a relationship to the costs, the policies, the amount of money that's coming from insurance from somebody else's insurance, whatever, right? So that relationship is part of what they don't understand. They don't understand the entity and the rules that regulate. They just understand, something happened to me, I should be getting paid to take care of it, this should be covered, right? So it's a very ambiguous and vague concept that they have, whereas it isn't just you got her, somebody else has to pay. Who was paying, what are the laws that govern how it gets paid? Do the laws that govern and operate differently based on the entities involved? Yes, not all insurance is equal, right? Medicare and Medicaid insurance, private insurance, government insurance, naturally government insurance is going to operate differently than private insurance, right? So what would be great is if you guys could write that down for me, I'll either make it or have somebody make one for me. Um, and we'll give it some mark and see what he thinks and, um, I, I think that that could be really helpful. Now you're still going to have people want to like it, totally understand broken record. I understand broken record, I understand, wish we could do something better. I understand. But the other thing that you can do with the broken record is redirect with another question. So, um, okay, so that's everything that we thought of. Um, and so it's a close ended question. Um, just want to make sure this is the number I can reach you at next week, right? You're going to be around next week, right? You're going to be looking forward to my message next week, right? This call is over. You'll hear from me next week. And, but I posed it as a question. So what just happened to your brain? You had to answer it. You went where I wanted you to go, even if you didn't want to. So, there's, it's, and it's not, and it's serving them because they're getting in their own way by taking more time, getting themselves worked up and frustrated. Is it going to change anything? Nope. Is being angry and getting increasingly angry going to help them? Nope. It's not going to help you, it's going to have an impact on the rest of the people that you have to talk to for the rest of the day, you have to process this anxiety, you, your people, especially any sensitive people that you might have. So, getting better at these conversations and dealing with objections, frustrations and things like that, learning how to massage these conversations will have a huge impact. From top to bottom and left to right and in ways that are kind of difficult to measure because it's also affecting energy and mood all day long by reducing friction. Can you like just thinking about that? Do you see how that can be that effective and helpful?
00:42:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it looks like you're thinking, what are you thinking? Well, I'm just thinking if the response differs from client to client because, you know, I touched on earlier, there's clients where they just want to vent, so you just kind of, you know, you just have to listen to them for a few minutes and then they feel better. But there's clients that, you know, like I have a military guy right now and the way I talk to him is I have to be like super blunt. I have to say that's not going to happen. Gary, like, you're not getting that much money because you haven't been doing this. Okay. And he's, when I say, when I talk to him like that, he's super grateful. He appreciates it. You know, he, he thanks me, he tells me how much, how grateful he is for my honesty. But if I talk to the, to my, to other clients like that, you know, they'll sub me out within the week. So I think there's a, you had it, it can be so scripted that you can't allow for, you know, a little bit of emotional intelligence to, that's why you can't script everything.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's why different examples are good. But what if we did this? Now, of course, there's going to be exceptions, right? So we can, Pareto's principle, 80 20, roughly 80% of it, know, we can have impact on 20% of it is going to be out of our control, but 80% of the good we do is going to come from 20% of our efforts. So what if we created multiple client avatars and this would be great to do in a meeting exercise and maybe you guys even team up so you can brainstorm and really get like these are like this is the person I get you know a few times a week I talked to a person like this. This is their personality this is how they communicate this is what they say and this is they have how they handle this type of situation and I have learned that if I talk to them like this I get the best results and if you get a me to me to me to a few times even whatever right then you got kind of an avatar there that you guys have defined and how to handle them however within that you know group knowing somebody's going to have Even more detail to add to it in terms of like what they look like and even more understanding as to what they need to hear Why they need to hear it, but how you can do that efficiently and wrap it up. So let's create the military guy avatar or you know the no nonsense type a like This would be this way period end of story logical, you know intelligence probably to their own detriment because They they're good at solving problems and getting their way They don't understand that there is a very finite amount of space that you can move within this process And they are used to plowing through things and getting their way and you know, I get it. That doesn't work here So you really have to tell them on repeat that that's the situation and you know commend them like I love that your problem solver It's not gonna work here, you know, and what are the ones who are just like Lonely and i've got 30 cats and nobody's talking to me and you're saying like a nice young man The work knows yes, so I like the military guys Yeah, um, we just went polar opposite right there, right? so um, you know Really let's and and you guys can wait and we can work on that next week and and draw out avatars together But regardless it should get done What do you think do you think that this would be useful to have these kinds of Things for your team to to look at go? Oh, yeah, know who that person is and I know how to recognize them because this this and this So I want to get into this mode with them and maybe you'll help them get there faster We think Yeah, I think it would save time We can make this an infographic too. And here's the reason I like imagery. It stays in your head. I can, being in school, I only take one class of terms. I don't go really fast, but I've really noticed there are different, so different books. some of the books, there's this company called Pearson and they have just fully engineered learning. And everything is visual and it's short and it's chunky and it's bite-size, but the psychology behind it too is that because it's clear, because it's concise, it gets into that long-term memory. what that means is they're not asking you same question next week, two weeks later, three weeks later, whether it's your clients or your team. So using some really clear imagery that gets in their minds and it just creates clarity. and something that they can pull out of their memory very quickly. So would you guys like to think about this? you think like having a meeting with your team would help you? I think that would be the best approach. That's what I would like to see. You guys do is have a meeting and say, hey, let's come up with three minimum, but three to seven probably avatars that you have of client personality types, how they behave, how they show up, how you can identify them, and then what is the things that you've learned that work the best in handling them period? How do you communicate? type of language do you use? Do you have phone calls? If you have phone calls, what do you need to do? What is your preemptive mode? If you have one, what is your reaction? of mode if you have one just I think that that would be the great a great jumping off point and then what I think is if you did that and you brought it back here we tweak a little bit and then take the second version of your team like okay what do you guys think about this then we can turn it into just a graphic that you can keep for future training or just a reminder so sometimes especially if you get again highly sensitive people or let's say somebody's having a bad day being really emotional and their brain fog for whatever reason just struggling mentally and then they're looking at this piece of paper that's colorful on their desk and they're like your dad dude I know what to do with you so even if their brain's like I can't I'll be like oh yeah typecast you know it you know we don't we don't we don't want to be scripted we don't want to take the humanity out of what we want to do is um just be aware of what we know and use that and manage it, know, that's all it is.

you guys think? Great, I think, and especially right now, where as the holidays, the clients are going to be stressed out, you know, my principal objective for the next couple of months is to make sure that my my team doesn't follow that stress and they can't keep their space and are able to be a calming influence on all the stress that's going to come at them. If that makes any sense.
00:50:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, absolutely. So just being aware of energy is the first start and the fact that we are entering a period of volatile energy. First of all, this time of year around there's there's two times in the year. don't know if you guys know. you probably do, where heart attacks and suicides both increase and they are right after the time change, which doesn't happen in Arizona, bless you, or curse you, I don't really know. And the winter solstice, so the shortest amount of sunshine in the year, highest suicide rates and highest heart attack rates around those times of year. So those are natural rhythms. We can't have any control over that. Well, we can, but the government's stupid, so we can't fix that part, but winter solstice, you can't control. And then there's holiday seasons and there's illness and all these other things. So just reminding your team to be aware that this stuff is out there and it's coming and, you know, what can we do to make sure our energy levels are high and good. One of the things is celebrating wins and maybe you start doing it every day and just saying, hey, great job on this. kudos, maybe you just every day find something to appreciate about each of your people, might take you a little bit more time, probably going to have a high rate of returns for you. Also might have a catching effect where they kind of pass it on and say, you know, you express gratitude to them and find out that they start expressing gratitude to each other or pass it on. You can make it a social experiment, but there is a real thing in winter, probably even in California because there is less sun throughout the day. So anyway, that's something to think about. So this is the assignment when, and why aren't you guys to think about what's coming up? When could you schedule a meeting and go through this with your teams?
00:52:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have a meeting. three days a week with them, so I can do it during any of those meetings.
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is probably if it's going to be effective a roughly hour long conversation. If you're doing it right, there's going to be a lot of back and forth. And if we're getting four to seven avatars, I'd like you to plan for about an hour or you can do it across multiple calls. But I would say that it would be more effective staying in the zone for the entire duration. So roughly 60 minutes.
00:53:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
schedule something Friday morning.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you start when could you get this in without, and I need you to take timing into account because I want, and you can let them know how the time that might help them, you know, to prepare for it. as you need them and I would tell them this. I need you to show up open-minded and willing to contribute to this for it to be effective. don't want to waste anybody's time but this is going to help us. Everybody's got different skills and strengths and everybody's got different weaknesses. This is going to help us extract from the strengths and support the weaknesses. Use your own language but you need to let them know a lot of time and you will get the best results if you prepare them. So, let's say this is due within the next couple of weeks. We think about that. Hold on because we got Thanksgiving coming up too and I don't know what your guys' schedule is. So, is there any issue with our Tuesday call on November 26th for either of you?
00:54:58 - patrick
Oh, I might have, Jerry, dude.
00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
00:55:03 - patrick
No, it's my first time. I've been, like, putting this my whole life.
00:55:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Why? This is fun.
00:55:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're an attorney. No, probably already for that.
00:55:14 - patrick
Yeah, I'm hoping so.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've never, I've got so much only twice, but because I've been the primary caregiver for children, they just dismissed me. So, like, I didn't have to go up. just like, don't qualify.
00:55:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've never been called. I'm so envious.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, but do you either do you have vacation time or anything that day otherwise? No, Tuesday, November 26th. Tuesday Thanksgiving.
00:55:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I don't think vacation.
00:55:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what's that?
00:55:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Vacation is for people that love spending two weeks catching up afterwards.
00:56:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does your wife feel about that one, right?
00:56:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not great. See, I let go of my firm so I could have a better work-life balance. And I'm.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not accomplishing that.
00:56:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's not something I'm very good at. I don't think I'll ever be good at it.
00:56:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think, you know, Well, it's a myth. There is no work-life balance. there is is things get out of balance and you make intentional trade-offs. And then you pay the price for them. But if you do that intentionally, then the reward is you get more of what matters to you. And you pay a bigger price for it. But it's because it mattered more to you.
00:56:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I still got to pay my mortgage. Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's have more conversations about that. Future will help you out. I got to look out for Carrie and the future and the future Mrs. should be heard in how do I say it very very and there may not be No, I mean I view it You could be so low forever. Oh Such a crime to do that it is it's it's a while, but I Have to have hopes because I just think that you would be a great husband great young man Make a great family and we need more of you and fatherhood's awesome, right friends.
00:57:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
If you're not the target Yeah, it's it's it's it's great and it sucks all at once It's oh my gosh.
00:57:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is the worst classroom and the best classroom at the same time Yeah, our kids like if you think you're one kind of person your kids are mirrors and they will be like yeah That's not you you're this this is this like you see it I will tell you the one of the biggest things that changed my trajectory for how I did business and who I did business with. I was not happy. I was getting my bills paid. was paying the mortgage Lorenz and I was doing what I had to do to pay the mortgage and dealing with jerks almost said and bad word. ruined my energy so I came out and my girls had just been being children which was loud and noisy and I snapped at one. I watched that energy bounce around the house through them. That one snapped it. That one snapped it. That one snapped it. That one snapped it. I was like, that's my fault. I'm like, it's not. It's that jerks fault because I was in a good mood before and I don't normally talk to them but every time I talk to this client, it's like that. I had no income for several months and I ended up having to get welfare because I that you can do and things that you can do to grow and help serve these people. So I hope you guys like that part of your job.
01:00:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you? Yeah, learning a lot. Never managed a great great deal of people and maybe like one or two at a time. So this has been a learning curve for me for sure. And I like it though. I enjoy it. I enjoy taking care of my people.
01:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that comes out in both of you.
01:00:33 - patrick
What about you Patrick? Yeah, I mean, I did stuff like leadership stuff in college, but not with females. was going to get a huge difference.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I feel the same way Patrick. We are definitely different. It's fascinating to me too. whole toxic culture, like what I or there are some nasty women, there are some nasty men. But for the most part, our diversity actually is really complementary. the things that annoy us about each other are the things that help us about each other. Because you guys can compartmentalize and check out. We're like, what the hell is wrong with you? Why can't you pay attention to this and think about this? But the fact that you don't allows you to not be obsessed by it, not to be dragged down by it and be able to handle it. But sometimes a man's, maybe lack of attention to details, remembering birthdays, teachers, all those things that we know, like our ability to do that helps you look at things that you're missing. And you're like, oh yeah. But we need to not be thinking all the things are behaving all the way all the time. Anyway, so I'm glad that you guys have mixed company. It really helps develop. And if you can find ways to appreciate those differences, it's all the better. And you'll be smarter yourself. and maybe a little bit more peaceful when you understand and just be like, okay, that's not all bad, okay? Okay, you guys are awesome. Thank you for making your notes. Originally, though I did ask if you're thinking about pondering things, I would rather not be just day of the call. I feel like we could we could do a little bit more although I'm pretty pleased with our progress. If you're thinking about this and giving updates throughout the week, so I'm just going to keep asking you guys to think about that. Maybe that's not the way it works, but I would like you to think about what we're doing all the time, just maybe for a few minutes, like, did I notice anything? What have I captured? Your responses will probably be more thorough, which means the work that we do can be a little bit more thorough, so ponder on that for me a little bit, okay, this week.
01:03:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That was good.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that was good talking to you guys. Have a good week and yeah, be healthy people. Keep being awesome. Bye guys. Where's my end button? There it is.
