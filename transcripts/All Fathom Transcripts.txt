How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversations, but, and this is one of the other reasons why I wanted to be so inexpensive. said, I hate showing up. So I did group coaching where people paid a lot of money, but even they didn't show up the calls. Part of it was because I gave them so much work and and so much stuff to do that they didn't need to show up on the call. They knew what to do and they were doing it. So I need to vog you because somebody needs to show up and have questions. Somebody needs to show up and want to talk, otherwise there's no point in having the call. And it's just, you know, depressing to show up and be like, there's nobody here. Like, what am I doing? 00:31:32 - Dan Ryan (3) You know what I mean? 00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So if it's lower priced, you can have much more volume, but then it's also, if I'm doing a long-term strategy, I could be teaching hundreds or thousands of people how to, and I don't really care. But I write if I can help, then I'll help. And it's not like Glenn, I want to be in everybody's homes. I don't really care. 00:31:52 - Dan Ryan (3) But if I can help you, I want to help you. 00:31:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He doesn't, but yes. But, um, so, you know, and the special actually this thing that I've been doing like spent all Saturday shooting videos, whatever, just just teaching this stuff. But if I can teach people the fundamentals, and it takes them a few years, but they become, you know, more sovereign, more independent, more self-reliant, all these things, then I'm really happy about it. And in the course of it, for sure, somebody's going to be like, hey, go hire this girl, whatever, because that's how my business has been from the beginning. Somebody said, hey, go hire her, or they saw post or whatever. So the secondary consequence will be somehow, even if I don't have a funnel built specifically for it, though I will, higher level clients will come. And I don't want a lot of them, I can't have a lot of them because it's a high level interaction for me, high level like, um, yeah, person type of thing. So anyway, I just want to be able to have enough of the simple thing, things that the people want and to fulfill them and but some of my brain goes into gamification and all these other things which do get better retention and engagement but I have to start from the beginning with just getting the content filled and all that stuff. For you though because there's so many complex things and because your angle is so tactical like for me I just need people to consume the stuff and then go do it. Yeah the other factor for me people who and created people are different beasts though like you really have to you have to make it tiny little pieces of actionable actionable actionable pieces that they go and do or there's no value for them because if they don't do it they're not publishing their content they're not making money they're not succeeding then they're not going to keep paying you and That's really important. 00:34:02 - Dan Ryan (3) Anyway, sorry to go ahead. Yeah, no, the other factor that is in my mind is I'm looking at fan flow in mom strictly from an acquisition perspective. So I'm like, I need to think about, so when I sell this, what do I want to be selling people, right? So I look at, I'm like, okay, circle might be the right thing, because I can just say it's built on circle. So you don't, you don't write, oh yeah, here you go. And the same thing could happen with high level, right? So that was what my original thing was like, oh, it's built on high level. It's all in fan flow. But if their community thing is not going to cut it, then I can go, oh yeah, you're buying our white labels as here and you're buying our circle community here, not a Facebook community. So it's like, they're both assets, as opposed to, because my original plan was, hey, I'm going to build it in buddy boss, which I could still do with the buddy ball circle at this API, I I don't know. I think I would need to do it for that. So then I can remove that because that, to me, and I have the same thought in mind with another 71, like, that's sort of like, oh, yeah, no, you can't just take this over, right? I can't tell you how often the body of a sight breaks, right? 00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like the woo integration or whatever. 00:35:22 - Dan Ryan (3) If you remove, if I can remove some of that, which I can never remove from Ninja, like, we're too far into it. Actually, I guess I could think about it. If we've migrated all the subscriptions to Stripe, which could be done, you could, in theory, sell someone through woo, then populate them into a circle. I just don't know if I want do that. And it will never work without an Instagram. But for mom, I'm like, okay, I want these to be sellable assets that I can just hand over and not. Oh, yeah, no, you're gonna need some WordPress developers to maintain this community. it's not fun. I just want to be able to walk away. So that is a factor that is totally good in my mind when I'm looking at like, so I'm doing very much what you were just talking about earlier. It's like, I'm looking at like, I'm trying to look at the construction, like, how do I want this constructed for these like, what does Mark want features wise? What does Dan want acquisition wise? Those are sort of the two factors. Yeah, I have, I don't care what the functionality is from a community this aspect because I don't even go to the community that I own. 00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:36:39 - Dan Ryan (3) And I won't go in this one. 00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I do think I did like circle. There was something I didn't like about it that it didn't do, but I don't remember. 00:36:54 - Dan Ryan (3) not really an LRM at all, which I didn't think it was, but it definitely is not. 00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) L. R. 00:37:01 - Dan Ryan (3) M. Learning relationship manager, right? So I don't know. We didn't really get into like building the course, but I think it's, I don't, I didn't see anything that was like learned dash or like, or like what it's, it's community forward. So it's community with courses, whereas I think school and high level because I was taking school is flippity flopped. It's courses with community, but I would say is the big difference. I can't even ask him that. He's my, he's my content, Jacob. 00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. um, that I'm trying to remember, but I feel like being giffic had a community that went with that as well. 00:37:51 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, I don't like them. 00:37:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like you. Yeah. Well, uh, no, didn't like this one. Hmm. so yeah, just like if you could get a bullet point list just for clarity, right? So that you're just going off of the list of functionality features and ask Mark, what does he want, but also why do you want it and rank it like? And I also think that it's preemptive of any kind of issues that you probably will have with them down the road, which is, Oh, I don't like this. And I want to move or I want this or I want that kind of thing and just in that discussion be like, okay, so we can't have everything that we want, no matter what, we cannot make wave a magic wand. What are the most important things that need to happen? And really the feature should be as a request of what are the things that need to happen for the people we sell to, for our artists. 00:39:01 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, there's, yeah, for sure. Mark definitely is like, I've always imagined a lot of my bro. 00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that would be cool, if. 00:39:09 - Dan Ryan (3) Yep. I'm like, dude, now, like, what, it's, you're going to give them what they need, right? They don't need that, so what do we need, not what would be cool? Right. Because he's always like, oh, yeah, if we could build the button, we could build them at it. Like, I mean, I still don't think he totally understands it like, you know, we would be nowhere right now. We weren't white, we didn't buy that over. If we had to build an app that did all the core function there, we'd be, we'd be nowhere though. In the, in the seven months we've been doing this, we'd be absolutely nowhere. 00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 00:39:51 - Dan Ryan (3) Right. it's, you're, one of your favorites, it's like, we have to leverage these things, but you have to leverage them intelligently. That's our ties too. Sorry, what do you need right the intelligence comes in? 00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What do you mean? Yes, that is going to be the the name that I decided that I'm going to use I love Dexter loves my freedom systems He's always like thought I should build around that and I think that I will but I think that might be like a free content source Later, whatever, but I'm gonna call it leverage systems because Leverage is first of all lots of people talking about it now, which is good Not necessarily in terms of like systems, but it's just a word because when you go to the site, right? You see the word I wanted to be a word that people are thinking of often They need to be thinking about it often and outside of business or People who are having that conversation. It's not something that comes up for the average person Period the average person is not leveraging anything not optimizing not leveraging and not system demonetizing. But those things are the path to freedom and less trust, no matter what you're talking about. House management, know, meal planning, health management, it doesn't matter what it is. It's getting the most out of the least. And those are the those are the ways to get it. But for Mark, one one like, so I have three questions that you could ask him that probably should be things that you repeat constantly. Every time he or Sean or anybody else starts to veer off tracks so that you can veer it like so you can get it back on track. For your artists, well, it's kind of four things. What are the most important things that need to happen for your artists? First one, why isn't that happening for them right now? You could talk about all the behaviors, right? But what isn't happening for them right now? Why is it not happening? And then how does your solution? make it happen for them. How does it change that? So there's, number one, that makes sure that you build the solution correctly and simply, but it also gives you all the selling points that you need because, um, and that kind of goes into like Jean Schwartz's level of awareness, right? So, is somebody coming to you that has no idea about what should happen for them? Or why? I just, I like creating music. That's all I know, right? And somebody else knows that it's because I don't know how to publish music often or I don't have a label or whatever. Like, so there's different levels of awareness all the way through. part of your path should be being able to ascend people from level zero to level. I think there's like eight levels of awareness seven, something like that. Yeah. But also known. at what level do the greatest amount of conversion happen? And at that level, what do they need to hear? But basically, what is the message for every level so that they get to the next level next level until they become a customer? And then making sure that whatever you have promised is what you can fulfill. So, I mean, that's all obvious, but a lot of times we don't approach it with that type of specificity. And I think that it would help the guys be able to do their parts best if they could think about it like that. 00:43:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, they don't think about it like that they think. I know. Especially Mark. Like Mark's just thinking. 00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it's just an existential conversation, Sean. Tina? Yeah, exactly. 00:43:58 - Dan Ryan (3) So that's, I mean, that's where they They have these things and then they, I mean, this is a good thing about Mark now is like he has these things and he then he'll filter them through me and he'll go, I want to do this and I go, okay, and then ask some qualifying questions and go, okay, let me think about that one. me think about that. For example, yesterday, literally email text me, he goes, Dan, if you, if you had a hundred million dollars, and you needed to 10x, 10x it in five years, what type of business would you build? And I said, why would I want a hundred million dollars? And then he's like, oh, no, you have to, you have to use a hundred million dollars. I go, okay, no, I don't, I don't want a hundred million dollars. But I said, okay, well, so then you're, you're saying, how would I build a billion dollar company, right? I said, market's the same. It's the same point as an idea money execution, but now what you're telling me is money is not the problem. Money's taking care for real, like it totally didn't do. Okay, then that then execution, don't it up. Period. You've got a hundred million dollars you're responsible for. So then that leaves you an idea. So you're asking me what is a billion dollar idea that I could come up with and then scale 10x in five years. And then I went to the good old buddy chat GPT and started doing some research and I showed him. No company has done that in the last decade. That's a current billion dollar company. They did it in six. They did it in 12. The only one that actually did it was Instagram, which is an acquisition. And they did it in two years. And it was like, like, dude, you're talking about a sparkly unicorn among the unicorns. And then when I did this analysis, I said, if you look at these companies. Then the and look at the models the model would be a subscription based business Because you can alex that all a our honor right now ten eight, but I'm like What subscription based business would you would what I build like I don't know I? Don't know, but you could you'd have to figure it out. You know, can now go backwards from there and then I said I wouldn't I'm not interested in this. I'm not interested in these shekels Oh DC shackles right to me. It's like a prison. 00:46:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why would I take DC money? Oh, V. 00:46:38 - Dan Ryan (3) C. thought you said Whatever it is I want what I want to do is This is the other thing about the community for this is I want to build a community and then crowds equity crowds I'm through the community community. So equity crowd fund this new way of being an independent musician from independent musicians, but then they're equity crowd funding into the label or whatever it is, whatever this upper level of mom is, it's more than a label. It's this label that has courses and software, and it has distribution money, and it has buying this idea of buying catalogs and revitalizing them, and then it has a label, and label services app side to it. So you have this multi faceted business that has six or seven revenue streams, but they're all related to one thing. It's like, well, that's what we should do. But you have to go build that community and we can build that community for $1 or $2 per person at a time, then go raise $1 million. Then you know, hey, if I had a million dollars and I plugged you into this, like, yeah, you give me a hundred million dollars and I'm plugging it into what, like, you'd have to go figure out that idea and then you cannot screw it up because you're responsible for a hundred million dollars. Like, it's ludicrous, to be totally honest, like, it's completely ludicrous. Why would you need to spend, and then I pointed out, okay, look at these, it was like 11 companies. Now, point out the one that spent a hundred million dollars. You can't because they didn't from, like, and then also I go, whoever this hundred million dollars, tell me the companies on this list that they have money invested in. I'll bet it's not because they've never done this. So they're asking you for an outcome that, hey, doesn't really exist just because you have a hundred million dollars, doesn't mean it's going to work. So it would all rest on the idea and I was like, yeah, no, dude, I'm not 00:49:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's that he's focused on a hundred million. 00:49:08 - Dan Ryan (3) That's exactly that's exactly like whatever percentage he and his mind who thinks he would get of a billion. I'm like dude that is such a again it's the grand slam bottom of the night. It's so it's so him. 00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The priority is the dollar sign without any parameters. No without any without any parameters right. So I mean you can make a lot of money selling your body. 00:49:41 - Dan Ryan (3) You can make a lot of money doing a lot of different things right. 00:49:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have never even seen that last night. I just keep hearing it all time and I I only know a little bit. I'm extra tells me I'm naive a lot but I'll stay that way. That's okay. I mean, I've never thought of myself this night, but then a little bit sometimes, maybe anyway. But yeah, it's anyway, and that's where the questions come in all the time, and that it might be good for you to just have a few taint of questions stuck in your head that you always ask, like, at what cost and what's the trade off? Although, I think that what cost is something that you do bring up, but I don't think necessarily to all the people you talk with, because you're just like, you're being stupid. 00:50:35 - Dan Ryan (3) I'm not even entertaining it, right? So I'm like, I'm focused on how do we get this MVP? How do we get this MVP done? 00:50:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) My point is, I think your life would be so much easier with just a few questions thrown out that just kind of stop people's brains from going down the track, which is they can't not, well, they can, they can ignore the question, but if you say okay we're not continuing the conversation until you answer the question at what cost because what they'll want to do is redirect and they'll ignore the question and they'll carry on which is a waste of time and energy. We're like okay well I'm gonna go do something else let me know when you want to answer the question at what cost you know what's the trade. 00:51:18 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah yeah so here's the thing is that I think unfortunately this is it's like it's it's like a required thing with him because he is like this sales guy right he's sort of determined that before so he loves to go to meetings he says he doesn't but he loves it he loves to he loves to network right he like he was just backstage at like he was hanging out with the lead singer of God smack the other day they will like went to some show and that he was back backstage at some other show the other night and and then he you know I I know he just got off a call where about a hundred million came up and so he wants to jump all over it. So with that there's good and bad right so that that's a bad but I don't want to tell him like dude stop having these conversations because he should be doing it that is what he's good at that is his role and more often than not he there is a benefit from it right so when he was backstage at that first show now he reconnected with someone and that guy's got 300 bands and the guy's like I want to bring every one of my bands on evangelize what yeah and then he met the lead he reconnected with the lead singer of this band seven dust he was like kind of big in the 90s and they're like dude how do we get on fan flow so they're coming on and that that that's that was the connect it was their manager it was like I'll get there. demo, but I've got 300 other bands. And then he now he's going to meet with, I think this is through God's Mac dude, he's going to meet with Dottree and, uh, can't remember their name, this other breaking Benjamin. So like those guys might be start using fan flow. So it's like, okay. And the, all these meetings are in the context of music business. It's just that sometimes they're these loopy, this one. I was like, okay, you know what? He's, he's two for three this last week on these meetings. And like, all right, I guess, I guess it's an acceptable sort of form. I was actually telling Eric the day, like, we're so close. I feel like we need to be in the same room again. Like I did when I went out there before. And I was like, it's almost like we need to do a hackathon and like just, Let's be in the same room. there's just all this little crap floating around. And it's like, I feel like we just need to go to Boston and go there for like five days and just be like, in these five days, we're gonna get all this done. It's gonna get all cleaned up. So that all we're waiting for is Spotify approval and everything else is done. Like that's the only piece that's outside of our control, which it is, and then we could have everything else ready for the MDP. I mean, based on the meetings I had today, those guys are gonna build those two things. We've set to make sure the second piece, I'm not 100% sure, and I have to get a free trial there. So if I get a free trial, tell them to issue it on Monday, and then those guys will go figure that out. And then everything else should be done probably within this month, maybe in October. So I was like, I mean, we could go there in like October. We don't want to go there in November until then. And just bang it all out. It's like, okay, here's the hit list. Strong order sandwiches. 00:55:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's go. 00:55:08 - Dan Ryan (3) And then be ready for like one Spotify, instead of the approval, and then we can start selling this thing. 00:55:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I just realized the time, I need to go. I'm just gonna have to ask next week. 00:55:27 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay. 00:55:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, anyway, it's good. It's good. I feel like there's, I don't know, dialing in a little bit more. I could probably tuck your ear off for about another two hours, asking you questions about stuff that you're working on. Also, we'll not talk, but just ask both the things. Cause that does both the things. So wait, next week, I'm traveling, but not until Friday, I have my call. Yeah. I will bother you next week. I mean, help, I mean, be Tina. No. Enjoy your. perch time and your puppies. Oh wait, when does Abel and go to school? 00:56:05 - Dan Ryan (3) Does she go to school next week? Oh, Saturday. This Saturday? Yeah, we're gonna fly up here and Saturday. It's so whack. Like, so we fly up and Saturday again. And then this time we're gonna stay over because Abel's like, I guess she could stay over. 00:56:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) guess she wants us to stay over. 00:56:24 - Dan Ryan (3) So then Denise is like, are we staying over? go, yeah, I got over time. We're staying over. Um, we're gonna fly up, drive, find out again. And then they sent a notification yesterday, this is the school, with like parents or drop off people, whatever it was. You have 15 minutes to move them in. I'm like, And then like, you have a 15 minute window, you have to leave, leave at the end of the 15. You cannot hang around. And your car needs to be out in that 15 minutes of the next group. I'm like, that's bizarre. That is bizarre. You have to move everything in in 15 minutes, not everything, the bulk of the stuff. you can reconnect with your student later and figure out what's missing or what's thing you're staying over. 00:57:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's wild. 00:57:15 - Dan Ryan (3) We're going to go move her in for 15 minutes and then leave and then and then reconnect with her around dinner, I guess. 00:57:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I'm glad you're saying that because that sounds like a lot of anxiety for a lot of kids. It's and family. 00:57:30 - Dan Ryan (3) don't remember what mine was like, but I don't remember there being a time limit. 00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's wild. All right, well, good luck dad and family this weekend and I will talk to you on Monday. 00:57:45 - Dan Ryan (3) All right, dan@danddcompany.comTina MarieD&D Co & Profit Drivers - Weekly Review
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's weird, it's like grey, hi, hello, how are you, good and well, yeah, deep breath. 00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, today is, this is our, my work week, so it's every day, every day, lots of meetings for me today, but I just came from a saw, so I'm trying to wake back up because she put me out. 00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) awesome. Yes, my lady, she's a Russian and she's been taking care of me for years and I just go like, like, I get baby like little girl taking care of and I'm like, oh, it's the best so. And then I was like, Booty paid for this today. Hey, glad to, glad to accountability. I like felt bad about it for a minute. I'm like, well, you use the one that wants accountability and you needed this. So we just get you to do your stuff without punishment. Then I'll pay for my own. Just happily. And you will have learned the thing. 00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't feel bad at all. I didn't get it. 00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what are you ready to work on this today? 00:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. looks like you are. Yeah, so this is from July. I'm like, you know, like we talked about two weeks ago, we hired the manager. been really good. I've been giving him, you know, little by little bit, giving him some of the tasks that I do, of which, you know, tracking the numbers is one of them. So we expanded this based on what we talked about, I think, two weeks ago. then last week we completed it. And so these are pretty much all of our data as far as we can go back and track. So we opened in April of 2023 and you can see we got 87 people that first month, we didn't really keep track of it then so we just started it the next month but essentially after that we started tracking how many new visits we completed and these are the follow-ups and you can kind of actually see that we were actually doing okay in some of the months like you know some of the ones last month we got 94 so this month we're we're act you know like we talked about we're actively trying to seek out second visits and third visits from from case managers. Awesome. 00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want to process the data but also I have some immediate thoughts. A couple of things are number one I would like to put a formula after column B which is basically the current month divided by the previous month. or, you know, and going up and down so that we're looking at a percentage of change, increase or decrease month to month, just kind of eyeballing the fluctuation on a percentage level. The raw numbers are helpful, but just that other perspective just kind of helps take a look at things. And it also is a faster way of triggering an appropriate level of alarm or yay, you know, celebration when you see those percentages. So we can do that pretty easily. And then I know that we don't know what you get paid per visit. I know that that's a unique thing. But what I would like to do is, and we were starting to calculate just kind of average fee per visit. I know how not accurate that number is. I am aware of that. But it gives us something to look at that does have a real corollary value, you know, to kind of look at how things are going. So as long as we keep that in perspective and don't, you know, and I know you won't, but just, you know, I'm not going to go. That's a real number. That would be something that would be good for us to do as well. Sorry about that. Let's see. It's all of us. It's okay. we're tracking Washington, Arizona, Mexico, familiar state to me. I'm meeting with Jonah and Margaret too. this is, this is my sweet love, oogee day. Good people. I like good people. All of us is completed. I love that that number went up. up even though number of referrals went down. So, let's see, actually, never mind. Okay, so total NP is completed. That's what I actually want to look at. And how many of those were referrals? NPV. What does NPV stand for? It's the first one. 00:05:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's initial new patient visits. 00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, a new patient visits. Okay. I was like, I know, think that that's initial, but I don't know of course. I think she massaged my brain just late. Okay, so that didn't go down that went up. That's awesome. That number had a couple of dips out of curiosity. Do you happen to have any idea what happened in November and December that your numbers went down? could you pinpoint that to anything? Or is that just? July is referrals and so this isn't like Q and me is the one that has a lot of you, right? Yeah, this is July. Okay. Um any idea what that dip was about? 00:06:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, you know, this is actually up in so up in these first six months I did all the marketing myself, meaning I'm calling, you know, was calling case managers like Mark's team and I was just begging them to send me a client and in October I actually stopped and I I bought three different marketing companies. So I put each of them charged me $1500 a month to market for me and I I said, Hey, let's try it. So I I tried three different companies. Only one of them actually did anything and I cut the other two off. But that's what happened in October and November is I stopped doing it myself. And I think you could see like by January like the three marketing companies, they started getting a little traction help me out a little bit. But the first few months that I stopped doing anything on my own, this is what happened. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So are you still doing it? 00:07:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. No, I'm just using one marketing company and yeah. 00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:07:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. And again, like this, you know, this value for a number of referrals is where I always wanted to be was about 400 a month. I thought just 400 referrals a month was good. know, 400 total visits would also be about right. So, you know, if we can get this every month combined with this number of total visits. That's actually kind of where I want to sit. 00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But let's highlight those. 00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. But you know, the other thing that Mark was saying is that, you know, we're worried about the insurance is tracking me and trying to become too big. But I, you know, I hadn't really talked to Mark about what, hey, what if I go after just other states, right? know, and obviously they're tracking me in California, but what if I really try to. higher or do the marketing myself in Arizona and in Mexico, Washington, and really try to grow the volume there. But I haven't really explored that. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, can we make that a task? I didn't mean you make it a point of talking to him before we meet next week. 00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, that'd be fun. Because it's really tough to end. 00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And the sooner we know, the better. I heard that you guys might be having the most epic 24 hours ever. 00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. Well, I just bought a car like I told you. And then last next week, we're buying a $4 million house. yeah, yeah, I will not be participating this year unless it becomes a little bit. 00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think he had quoted like 50,000 a person. 00:08:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, it's like, I don't know about that one. 00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you just had a brownie baby. And that's a little bit on the dangerous side. If I was us or I'd be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, But that's just probably way cooler than me. 00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, she's actually letting me go to my friends for you for a big, it's next month. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) yeah, it's different than like drifting, okay? And just like, oh, that's crazy. I saw that like my heart. 00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. 00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It looked really cool to do. 00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. Father updates on July front to help us meet this volume I actually brought on a fifth provider. It's a physician assistant network like all the four physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are working for me, all like they like working for me. So they're all like, hey, can my friend get a job with you? So I finally picked one that looked good. And so we brought her on. She's actually starting right now. She took a shift from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. So she's seeing patients like right as we speak, this is her first day. So yeah, excited to do that. It'll increase our nighttime. And she's going to help in the evenings. weekends, particularly. 00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that'll help our capacity at those times to accommodate this volume. And what do you pay for that? 00:10:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. I pay $75 a visit, whether it's a new or whether it's a return. And I increase their salary or I increase their pay to $30 after like six weeks. 00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so it's still a good margin for you and let you increase capacity without burning out? 00:10:28 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, on average, we make about what 300 per visit blended between using returns, right? So I'm paying them $30 and then my staffing costs about probably about $30 on the back end for each visit, so. 00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so yeah, that's good. And they're per visit, not per hour. 00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Yeah, totally per visit. I also pay them to if some patients want like a doctor's out to be excused off work. So I pee smell everything. charge, we charge for that. I charge for that to the lawyers. And then I subsequently pay them $12 if they write a work note for someone. And what do you charge for it? I charge $300 and I generally get paid about 50 on that. 00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But $300 for the doctor's note? 00:11:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. For the doctor's. 00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, okay. But you only get 50 out of it because of the way that, okay, got it, got it. 00:11:28 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I mean, I've been about 25%. So yeah, so maybe 60. 00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Awesome. So another formula that I want to have is the percentage of our PVs to NPVs. So that we're looking at. 00:11:50 - Fujinaka, M.D. You know, I feel like we, I was supposed to do this. Do you think you could find the notes from last week? I was just looking real quick. I think we actually talked about. doing these things I just never did them. 00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, and I didn't send a follow-up to actually make it an official task, but we did for sure. 00:12:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I wasn't so familiar. So I'll work on those and get them done. 00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I mean, ultimately, and the faster we do this, the better your results are, right? And my goal is to make sure that you see the value in showing up and doing this work every week. This could be as possible because I want you to keep coming back. was like working with the same people. It's really nice for me. We do, we do. go. And the notes, that tasks. 00:12:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I wanted to show you this one. This is something that you had kind of brought up about how we can track our workers remotely. so I want to the metrics that the manager and I came up with, it was just we look at their call logs like literally how many patients did you call a day right because if we know how many new visits or how many new referrals we got you know so if we got 300 in August that means there should have been there's 20 working days or there's 22 working days so there should have been like what 10, 15 calls a day and so and then obviously if you don't get someone the first day we call them at the second day so like if you can't look at any two days generally about right like they're calling you know most work days they're calling about not so many they're calling 20, 30 people a day something like that now Ollie Ollie actually works part-time she only works four hours and Eric and Carolina were eight hours so it is actually kind of interesting like most of the times it's almost double but there's some days where you see like she does almost as many as my full-timers so it's something the manager and I are going to look at, and this is the blended average so far that we created here. 00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what I would do additionally is actually put in the hours just so you again, there's something that is really powerful, and this is why we use the visuals, and also why we do specific types of formula and put data in a particular kind of way. Because what we want to do is make our brains be able to rapid-fire, get to the most powerful conclusion. So if you were to do that, put hours for each one of them, and then create a formula that were average calls per hour. Okay, we did that. Yeah, so oh there it is. I'm just focused. have tons of I thought it was. and I thought it would be the other way around. Wait, okay. So, when you say Eric slash Carol, how do I say that? 00:15:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, he has wife split a full shift. So he does the morning and she knows you does four hours in the afternoon. 00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, is that column H hours or calls? 00:15:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. This is this column is how many total on average they did for day. 00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so where are you getting the formula for calls for hours? where are you getting hours in your formula? 00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. Or did you just plug it in? Oh, we first we looked at just the total number of months or total number of calls they made in a month right here. And then we divided it by how many hours they work, hundreds in general. 00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I was wondering where the hours came into the equation. Okay, so, because I thought you said that I like got more calls done. 00:16:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, yeah, this is actually wrong. Yeah. She only worked 80. Yeah. that is right. Yeah. that's right. Yeah. That was wrong. 00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Ally is actually working like double speed. Yeah. that is significant. And let's, I mean, if we were gonna have to do even math. mean, that's roughly like 50% more. 00:16:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know how to use percentages. 00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What do you do? in this case, you would divide 1.52 by 2.46 times about 100. No, just divide. You'll get the same thing. 00:16:50 - Fujinaka, M.D. We just move the decimal point. That's all. Yeah, she's doing 61% more. I don't know it. 00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, that doesn't make sense. 00:16:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. She's. Yes, she's doing 61% more. Yeah. 00:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah, because if she was doing 200 percent, we'll see. 00:17:10 - Fujinaka, M.D. she's doing 100 more than that would be 3. 00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Yeah. So she's doing 60% more. 00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Then two people. So either one of them is very slow or both of them are slow. Or maybe she's just super fast and we do have we do get lucky sometimes and get because like Mark Scott, this girl Samantha and she kills everybody. She smokes everybody. She is a massively driven. You can't just go get us a man but you can't. So that might be what but it's worth looking into. It's worth considering. Do we share team numbers? Do we drive internal competition and incentive by saying here's the targets and here's the and maybe we don't want to because like the other issue Mark has is way too much incentive in his program and he's paying too much in payroll for it so we have to do the math before you offer any kind of incentive program but for sure at the very least this is something we need to be contemplating and not just look at and take it and go like okay that's dinner and not do anything we're there to be such a big disparity either you've got a rock star or you've got slackers and if it's a slacker situation then that's something that can potentially be trained potentially be incentivized or potentially you replace them but either way it's something to be thinking about 00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, you want to look at China? 00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see her say hi. Oh, my gosh. 00:19:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. Hi. Hello. Yeah, we were just going to go take a nap and say we're going to say hi to daddy and then go take a nap. 00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, my gosh. I missed the little one so bad. 00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, so beautiful and perfect. 00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's just a perfect blend of the two of you. 00:19:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. Hi. It's hard to tell her right now. I know they're so young. Yeah. Just trying to get to sleep in her own crib so she's not like contact napping all the time. Oh, just like you can't give anything done during the day. 00:19:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I remember that battle and I wish I had leaned into it way more than I did because that goes so fast. 00:19:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. You cannot believe how fast it goes. 00:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I shouldn't try to train her out of it too quickly. So here's the thing. you sleep very well with that Puji? 00:20:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. I sleep better without him. 00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We both agree that we sleep better like separately. Everybody is different but it's been interesting you know because I've got two that are all the way grown. I've got two grandkids and two that are mostly grown plus sisters and siblings and just working with people along that. There's this huge, I don't know, we all listen to different things and feel different things but trying to get kids to sleep alone and and parents get frustrated that they won't do it and those people, most of them don't want to sleep alone can't sleep alone and it's funny that they want really tiny children just to be able to be alone and be comfortable when it's not the natural thing. are cultures that are never away from their children. They pack them onto their backs. They don't mean you see that a lot and co-sleeping is just a lot more common and other cultures around the world. Yeah, so but you know when you're a driven mama and you have an active brain and you want to use your brain That's an important thing to and taking care of you is an important thing, and so it's difficult But the one thing I would say is whatever your heart calls you to do Lean into your heart more than your brain Your brain will get outlets later, but if you hurt your heart that damage can be So long-lasting and that's where the regrets come from not helping your brain I promise you Okay, that's good advice. 00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. I want to take out more of your precious hour with Tina, so Thank you wanted to show you something else that I am working on You want to So, okay, so this is where I really Can you coach to step in over the board? Yes, but yeah, I'll just show you what I am done. 00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yes, the Bing. 00:22:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. Bing background. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I have an online clinic and I have a company. We haven't like we just sort of started, but we market this thing. You get a brain MRI. 00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can you see my screen? I can and you told me a little bit about that. 00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D. So, yeah, so anyway, I just, just kind of, we're just starting. this. And again, the payment structures are fluctuated, but essentially my cost for this brain scan is $1,000 of my cost, and I'm reselling it for $2,500. So each sale makes me roughly $1,500. And yeah, anyway, so that's that. I am just starting it with the founder of this technology. So anyway, I spent all yesterday night making this payment platform and this website and getting the bank account set up. So finally, everything's ready to go. have the business registered, I have the bank now, I have the website. last piece I need to do is just structure the clinic side a little bit better because I'm serving all 50 states. 00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, and where do your customers come from? 00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. Right now, they come from the company itself. So this company BrainKey out of Germany, people email them from the United States and it's like, I want to get your brain scan and since they don't have a US presence, they are sending them to me. 00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And they say, hey, you have the machine that can do it, basically? 00:24:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. Well, we have contracts with the imaging centers. A lot of the same ones Mark uses for his PI cases, actually. I just go to them and get a contract with me. Okay. So that's why it's the $1000. So the $1000 is about 800 of it goes to the MRI center where I send them and then about 200 I send it to BrainKey to analyze the results. 00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So the value is in BrainKey's evaluation and reporting or, okay, you give me a little bit more about the USP, which is the unique selling point of why, why then? 00:25:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, they're the only brain analysis software on the market that can do these volumetric measurements. So if you look on this little screen, they're sectioning out the brain based on what structure it is, and they actually measure how big it is. So we could track over time pretty clearly, like if you're developing Alzheimer's, you're going to see this really specific area of your brain, unfortunately, strength, They show that that part of your brain, the amygdala for alcohol actually shrinks, shrinks, shrinks. And we could see it get bigger when you get better sleep, when you stop drinking alcohol, et cetera. 00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And who's your target market for this? 00:25:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. Do you have an avatar or multiple avatars? Yes. it's usually it's Asian males that make over 150,000 a year, they're single or not single. But it's Asian males over 100, making over 150,000 a year that would be. between the ages of 40 and 50 and, like, 58 to 65-ish. 00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How much of that demographic is within your realm physically? 00:26:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. A lot, because most of them tend to live around the major city centers, where I have the contracts with the centers. 00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And why Asian specifically? 00:26:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know. I think, I don't know. not sure why it's Asian. I mean, obviously, I think the majority is like, they're like, it's 50-50 Asian white male. I'm not sure why. I personally think it's like the midlife crises that these people are dealing with in general. Like, why it's a lot of males and not as many females. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I could give you lots of reasons why it's probably more males and higher earning males, just because what got them to the higher earning was very stressful on their bodies. They overworked. 00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. probably during too much did all the network too much. 00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They did a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do and have gotten to the point where, especially now in this world, we're very aware of the clock ticking but as well the opportunity and the medical technology that can buy us another decade or two. Whereas women, not as competitive, do a lot of things that are better for their hearts, they talk to each other, they've got a network, they're more aware of health in general and probably haven't neglected it to the extent and are also less likely to go and pay and spend this amount of money on themselves for their health or rather they'd go get, you know, breast and butt lifts so they look good for the man because that's not really for them, that's for somebody else kind of thing but the psychology behind it makes perfect sense to me to say it's part does not necessarily make sense to me and it's not really necessary because You don't have to, in the marketing, target anything that would be Asian specific, but the reason I ask about the avatars is because you do want the marketing to speak to them wherever they're at, whatever their values are, and for sure there's a, there's a huge difference, I think, between Asians period because of the collectivist culture with just the standard American, which is the individualistic culture, the values, the reasons, the logic for doing things is different. And so, like if you were going to, and I don't really know how much that applies to Asians living in America as much, but anyway, just the language, right? So are you doing this for yourself versus doing this for your family? And you would probably want to split test some of the messages. We would probably want to have a few different landing pages and keywords research campaigns. based off of what's happening. What I would be interested to know is what they know about marketing that works in other areas and what they would be willing to share with you. 00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, and the only one that does this here. Yeah, so that's what's interesting about this opportunity to me is because brain key right now is only sold through brick and mortar concierge clinics. So the only way they're getting customers is they go to a concierge doctor and says, hey, give this to your clients and those are their salesmen. I'm like the first mass market clinic for them. But yeah, but because of that, you don't really have a good sense of like who they're, you know, who's buying it or why they're buying it because all there's, they see the data, right? They see how old the person is male or female, just from the scan data, but they're not actually talking to their clients, which is really interesting. It's like, yeah. 00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you have any idea what percentage of doctors are Asian in your area or in any of the metro areas? Just wondering because culturalistically, more, let's say any other nationality to Asians, you're going have Asians and like Filipinos, which is a mix between Mexican and Asian, right? There's a huge drive to be doctors. So, I was wondering if the correlation just happens to be that there are more Asian doctors and they're pitching it to Asians because they're like, hey, I think you might like this more than some of these other people that don't, I don't know, like I'm trying to figure out what could that possibly, or could they have got that demographic from? anyway, my brain, I'm always trying to analyze because if you understand the demographic and the true data, then it makes marketing that much easier. 00:31:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. So yeah, I just, yeah, the company, even like the owner, I, and I'm friends with the founder, he's just like, sorry, man, I like, I literally don't know because we don't sell this. It's only the upstairs doctors that sell it to their own clients. And yeah, like, I was like, well, do you have numbers? And he's like, well, not really. 00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is your, when you first thought about this, and up until now, what was your plan of attack for marketing? 00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. Well, I actually talked to Mark a lot about this, and it was really just to run Google ads. our thought was as long as I could make, you know, as long as I can make $100 more than my ad spend, it's very straightforward business, right? Yeah, I'm just, essentially, just reselling this product. I'm like selling online. 00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Has, has Mark ever mentioned Dan to you? 00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. No. 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So Dan is a client that referred Mark to me that we do work together and Dan's very good at Google Ads and also Google Analytics. So especially because this is a new market, we're going to need to make sure that you've got analytics and that we're watching it closely. We're going to want to have a heat map on here. Do you know what a heat map is? 00:32:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. Kind of like where they're looking and clicking. 00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. And we're also going to want to watch the behavior to find out what they're coming from. I think that some YouTube ads would probably be the most leverageable thing and the great thing of course is that combination between YouTube and Google is that you've got all of this data and they do, they're just really good at targeting by the algorithms, know, who might be interested in that. So if they're doing something that's relative like looking up a particular issue whose solution is you need an MRI. Guess who's at they're probably going to start up. Who's running ads for MRIs? Like nobody probably. I don't know. Anyway so creating some YouTube ads would probably be a good idea and a lot of that could probably be done with AI videos now. You know of course we could actually hire some people but most of it could be some either stock videos or a few like videos of the machine of the reports things like that with a voiceover which also could be AI. It could be a voice actor which we could pay very inexpensively off of Upwork something like that. You have a good voice. I think that's so weird but you're not anywhere near the first person to say that. I hated my voice until I was like mid 30s and Now I won't do video because I feel so gross and ugly. mean, I spent all Saturday. I spent my time doing videos for marketing. Can't do it. Anyway, this is life. We've all got our weird things. 00:34:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Anyway. But I was so excited, you know, I feel your excitement in this. And I think the same thing as your keen in on is what makes me excited is because it's really something that if I can get the marketing right, this can make a good, good, like another stream of income for my family, you know, if I could just make, you know, 10 sales a month, , that's, that's an extra, you know, 120,000 a year. 00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I'm really happy with that. You then have a massively targeted list of potential other things that you could offer them. So now you're not going to know what their test results or whatever. 00:34:54 - Fujinaka, M.D. What is that? No, is one of the things that, yeah, I wanted to sell because the one of the. The big things, if people take a test step six months and nine months, if they sleep better, you can easily see their skin improves. 00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that was one of the things I was going to key in on, was like, um, what are we talking about when we first started talking and talked about naps and Steve and all that stuff. 00:35:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. What? 00:35:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah, having like a list of people willing to, willing to pay money to improve their brain. mean, yeah, I think well, a significant amount of money and also there's, there's more to it than that. So you might have people who are willing to pay money and invest in their health, but this avatar is scientifically minded. This avatar is not just about health improvement, but this guaranteed is going to be about life quality and longevity. And that's a whole new level up here. Okay, right? That's not the person who's like maybe trying to cut sugar. out of their diet or be on a diet or whatever. This is the person that is like this is serious, this is important and so I don't know how much you studied marketing but if you were to study direct response there's a guy named Eugene Schwartz and he what's it called breakthrough advertising. You would do really well to study it that book is dense it's owned by one of my clients actually so Jean is referenced so many times. He talks about levels of awareness so you've got the I know nothing about whatever you're selling market all the way up to I know everything I'm just looking for the thing to buy. There's like seven levels of awareness and if you get to the point where somebody has bought this their level of awareness of brain health of what is needed. How do you avoid amyloid plaque and not get Alzheimer's? How do you, like, could you as an affiliate offer have some sort of brain training program and software that you create by yourself that helps prevent Alzheimer's? Like, there's so many different things, and if we're looking at you being in this business and having the compounding effect of additional revenue streams where you're, it's scalable and you're not doing it for your time. This has long tentacles out into the future that, and you can build it, and then somebody would probably go buy it from you for, like, $20, $30 million if you were smart about it because you're disrupting right now, nobody's doing this. 00:37:45 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's fair. Alzheimer's is a great thing. This is actually one of the first campaigns that I wanted to run was actually run a campaign for Alzheimer's. 00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, what if you, so have you heard that ultrasound waves are now able to... to break up amyloid plaque and that is the first thing that they've ever found that can reverse Alzheimer's. Yeah, there's been no way to get rid of amyloid plaque until now ultrasound, which makes sense that that could do that, but that it could safely do it. 00:38:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. Interesting. 00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm also a medical nerd. study a lot. Health and longevity is a huge thing to me, so I like working with you. 00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's good. 00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You can't tell I'm excited in my brain lights up about this, but anyway, if you found a service like that that you could also offer as concierge or make referrals or something like that, you already have the market. Oh, your scan came back with. And so because of HIPAA, you're not going to know anything, but what you can do is say, hey, you know, if you get results like this, here's what you can do. If you get results like this, here's what you can do. Now, HIPAA doesn't allow you to like ask questions per se or whatever or know the information, but they can self-select and I'm interested in this. So you have cause and effect. They select this, therefore, you know, probably assume the correlation and now you start marketing to them this type of thing. And then we get into email hygiene and how much better that makes your inbox, placement and all kinds of other things because you're super segmented and. 00:39:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. And I guess that's why like I and that's the tough thing right now and I wanted to kind of get into too about like, you know, my time balance because, you know, we have we have something good going in July. And, you know, that's why like, you know, much how much my time should I be putting in July to kind of really pump, you know, pump my July business. We have the Q and is, you know, that we're making some changes to be more efficient on, you know, I guess, is this now a, you know, is this a good thing to really go after the delta, you know, I call it delta. 00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'll tell you my overall strategy for everybody. And first of all, business 101, the verification. Your best bet at success is multiple types of things going on. So the first thought that I just had when you went back to July medical is, you know what, that's probably the way to build the funds to, you know, make sure that you've got everything that you need over here to invest in some marketing, to invest in some good advertising. Because if you're not, if you're going to do this, do it, do it right. Yeah. 00:40:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. And it's not a, you mean delta? 00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Okay. Yeah. But the other thing was I was like, well, maybe that just takes off the bumpers off of July medical, and you grow as big as you want to. And then somebody gets attention. and then and pulls you down. You're like, okay, bye done. But the insurance take care of its job of the liabilities and whatever happened to you and be like, okay, pull the plug on that. Moving on, thank you for the signal universe. 00:41:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah, and it's kind of just and you said that too, because we're, you know, I'm looking at the total amount of AR that we have and we just passed $5 million in AR, which is about one point, you know, if we get a 25% return, that's close to that's close to 1.5 million. So I think if we keep even just at this level, we're accumulating AR at about about three million, four million a year, just at this current level. So yeah, it's a good point that, you know, even in five years, if I get pulled down by insurance, I'm going to have accumulated, you know, close to 30 million in AR probably by then. 00:41:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, not only that, you now have some assets, you have doctor referrals, you could pretend actually sell something, have some sort of asset that is sellable, so maybe it's not the entity, but maybe it's the contacts, maybe it's the business relationship, and if you go and tell all these people that are referring to you and you go really vet the person, so somebody buys your business from you, which isn't really a business anymore, right? Because they have to do their own name, whatever. But what they're buying is the insertion into your network, and this person will be so vetted by you that you go make a personal recommendation to all of these people, hey, this person's gonna take care of you, I'm trying them on this, this, this, this, and this, but you actually don't really even need the reputation anymore out of integrity, you would do a good job, but let's say they didn't, let's say you vetted them wrong, if that bridge is burned, you've got all these other things going on anyway. That's a good question. 00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. What? 00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's good point. Yeah. Yeah. and that's the thing that You want, it's not invincibility, but it's, you want to be shielded from whatever can go wrong or if you're making the risk, it's a educated and it's an educated risk where you're, you've got everything coming. So you've got Delta when you've got QME and, well, no, I know, but I'm at July goes. 00:43:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, yeah. 00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, yeah. So, and I'm sure that other things are going to present themselves, um, as you, as you, as you go. 00:43:42 - Fujinaka, M.D. I like that. 00:43:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry, especially with whatever related to, like, if you get into the ultrasound stuff for, for Alzheimer's, first of all, that information needs to be so much more widely spread because it's such a big deal, like we lose people. Um, New, but the knowledge and the science behind it for the most part isn't new. It's just we found the missing piece and nobody knows about it yet. And it needs traction. And the other thing that we know is that government, health care, pharmaceuticals, whatever, we're going to do their best to keep that down because drugs are big money, sick people are big money. So you've got these two different competing markets. You have a great way to to to to I don't serve and leverage in there. 00:45:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, we actually hope that this, you know, this price point, we can actually lower it in the coming years. We think that the MRI bills will be lower next year, you know, just because every year the price seems to come down a little. So hopefully this, you know, we'll start to be able to offer this at like $2,000, for instance, every year. So like you're saying, hopefully this diagnostic piece will get cheaper every year. And then, you know, you pair that with the technology like treatment, like all just sound, that'd be really cool. 00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And can they use like a health savings account for this? 00:46:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. I have to apply through government, but yes, you have to get a tag. 00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the two things I would try to do would be to get that as quickly as possible. Because you want to remove friction from anybody who wants it as much as possible. So they can use, especially because entrepreneurial type people, if they don't have the insurance, we'll have HSA's because this probably wouldn't cover it in most insurance anyway, depending on what kind of diagnosis they had to begin with. And then the other thing is a payment plan. So there are lots of different services that you could sign up for that would give you a payment plan. And those two things right there are going to help remove some friction points right away. And then the other thing about a higher price point is that it allows you to offer like referral discounts. So refer a friend and you know, they say $500 or you say $500 on your next one or that type of thing. And you still preserve solid margins, but you know, that's the whole thing about marketing. They have the feeling that they've saved money. And the fact that they can't go get it anywhere else serves you a very good purpose right there. 00:47:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. I like that. Yeah, I just asked Chat TPT to show me how to register my business to accept HSA after spending, like for Christmas time, that might be a good thing. 00:47:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) of year. Yeah, I love that. And do you have targets? So you should talk to Mark and see if he thinks that you and Dan might be a good match. Dan doesn't just take everybody really what he does is he builds the websites. And the reason for that is because the speed, he needs to control the assets so that we can get really clean data. And that's, he built this whole thing for that purpose because it's really hard to get accurate tracking, but ads don't work very well if you don't have accurate tracking. So, he does that and he just likes puzzles and he, but he's very good at running Google ads in a way that almost nobody does. It's very low cost. So, anyway, it's interesting like when I first told Mark about this business, I actually, because you see how much I can afford to spend on this. 00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. I was actually, I actually went to Mark and said, know, should I hire someone to do my website, hire someone to do my marketing. And I thought Mark was going to say like, yes, yes, and he actually made me think about it a little differently that like, what is your business really? And so this business to me was like, it's really just a marketing play, right? I'm not, I don't own the brain scanner. don't own the game. the report maker, the brain key report maker, I'm just the reseller. And Mark was saying, you know, you should have at least a beginning understanding of how to create a website, create a payment processor, and also how to, you know, run a base Google ads because he's like, he was telling me like, he can't tell me how many millions he's freelessly spent on. That's exactly why right there. And he said, like, once you, you know, once I figure it out, when I run a couple campaigns, then I can go out and hire, you know, really cool people. But he's like, you need to understand the core of your business. And I was like, okay, so yeah, that was actually that was my plan is to actually run, you know, one campaign, maybe put $10,000 in it and run it on Alzheimer's. 00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) so I understand. You know, want to tell that was funny. 00:49:51 - Fujinaka, M.D. No, so that's not even that. 00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that's why I wouldn't recommend anybody but Dan. And he is not the best. at creating the campaigns. He is the smartest when it comes to conserving money. The thing about all advertising agencies are they are, you will bleed out the jugular. 00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's how bad they are. 00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So Mark is right because when you understand the technicality of what's involved and they want to give you a $10,000 a month fee, you're going like for what? For why? No. Now if you want $10,000 and you got me a million dollars. Okay. Right. Or you know what I mean? Or even $100,000. 10% marketing fee is totally accessible. But most of them are just ridiculously priced and you have no concept of it. Most people have no concept of it because they've never done it. So now you have, and Mark would tell you if he thinks it's, I would be curious to know what he thinks. 00:50:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. I haven't run the campaign yet. I'm probably going to try to do that next week. 00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But yes, you should. that everybody that does business for themselves should know a little bit about all the things really should. And the reason I have the business I have is because I did all the things. I've done graphics, I've done web design, I've done programming, I've done building the products, I've taught, I've done all the things. And so when I go with somebody, what's that? 00:51:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, hold on. I was saying, yeah, I think that's a great idea to talk to some of Mark's contacts. Once I run my first campaign to try it, I like it. 00:51:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, we keep kidding. 00:51:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. Like, it keeps coming out and I don't know if it's my internet or yours. Oh, I think I need to stop the share here. There we go. 00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting. 00:56:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, so maybe I'll just target July. So because now for July, I have quarter one and quarter two. I actually wait, are we done with quarter? So two quarters of data. So we can look at that. 00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, we'll be almost done. 00:56:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, so I can get the monthly P&Ls and then you wanted quarterly P&Ls. Yes. Okay, maybe we'll start. 00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want the whole year and then I want quarterly. Well, July, I would like monthly. 00:56:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, so I'll get it since January and then we can go over those next call. 00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That sounds good. So, physician, physician, oh my God. Physician recruitment, why my tongue does not want to work. Um. I want to know, um, let me see how much you've given me already. I want to understand. Entry the exit for your money, like how do you earn the money? You've told me some about it, but I want to know what that if there's any leverage point, if there's anything that you can do to increase that, let me, let me start with that. Do you think that there's anything that you can do to increase that? 00:57:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. 00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We can talk about ester stuff if you want to medical director. I want to understand deeply like, explain what that is and how the money comes to you. And then also we talked about your training. Um, Q and D like test prep, I think is what it was. And, um, we started getting data on that. And what I. I had asked for was, I wanted one spreadsheet that had the overall snapshot kind of data for each of those businesses, which is the revenue month over month, as long as you've been doing that particular business, and that would incite questions for me that I can start asking you, but I really need to be able to see that revenue and know a little bit in terms of like where it comes from. So the assignment and I would like to install the there's a repercussions for not doing it next week, because it would be a waste of our time if you don't have this we're we shouldn't it should have already been done. Is that I want that and I need to make sure that you're clear because I did ask for it before. And you can tell me if you get too busy or something like that, but I want revenue for every type of the business, so you gave me I'll just list them one more time. All right. right. All right. right. All right. All Physician Recruitment, Medical Director, and the licensing exam test prep. I want to know the revenue month over month from each of those, a description in the same spreadsheet of how you make that money. What do you have to do to get it and any kind of information that you can think of as to what you might be able to do to increase it? All of those before we meet next week and I want it, we're meeting Monday. I want to Friday. It's Friday. Wait, wait. It's Thursday. Okay. That's not fair. You're lucky. All right, you can have it by Monday morning and we'll just go into by then because I wanted to go over it, but I'm not going to work on the weekends. I got the girls this weekend, so we'll just do it Monday. So if you're prepared with all of that, then we will have a good day. 01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. call. Oh, sounds great. 01:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 01:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. Should I keep putting time into this delta thing? Or do I need to put that on the back word? 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Does it light you up? 01:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. I really like doing it. But you know, I see the money that I can make with July like we talked about and refinements to the QME. I could be better at that. 01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's the thing about creators and visionaries. We don't usually stay on one thing really well for long without feeling frustrated, annoyed, irritated. You have to have some freedom to go other places. These are existing businesses that you've already defined and chosen. Now, if you want to say you want to go chase something else that isn't even on your plate when you've got all these things going on, like what are you doing? Stop. Focus. But it's already here that you're already doing it. nurturing it would be good. once we get to the activity, that I'm talking about and we have evaluated all of your income strains and then chosen which ones have the most leverage and then made a plan for it. Then you need to try to stay within the bounds that we've created but those boundaries don't exist right now so you know and we don't have any reason or logical placement to put boundaries in so if you've got time and you're not neglecting other duties then then explore it but you should be mindful of you know sleep routine and hygiene and family that's the only thing I would always say no matter what we're talking about. That's fair all right that's good and dirty all right it was awesome talking to you foodie hello Esther I know it's your time but I really like that and makes me happy so thanks for letting us say hi. Yes you're great all right thank you. 01:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay bye have a great night. michaelfujinaka@gmail.comTina MarieFuji/Tina Coaching
00:00:17 - mark sweet You're muted, I couldn't hear anything, and you're still muted. 00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was telling you, you're muted. There she is. was okay. She was coming up. Why? 00:00:40 - Chona Sweet I don't know what's happening. I cannot see it on my, um, email through my laptop now. It's telling me settings, primary camera. So things probably. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's joining from a different place. 00:01:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Okay. There. 00:01:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi. Pretty face. 00:01:17 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So crazy. I printed it. 00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Did you? Aww. I need water. 00:01:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Sorry. How are you? 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm good. It's been a long day. And I usually do not have meetings this late, but I just talked to Fuji. So I've got to play it once night, but. 00:01:38 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So it's the same link that we used last time. 00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:01:42 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Okay. So I'll make sure to. Just my laptop is slow. 00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No problem. Um, Mark should just get to a new computer or Macbook Pro. 00:01:54 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) He said, he said, you haven't earned yet. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm. Hi. aren't it with some ghetto like equipment hello whatever I know this laptop I use this I think this is oh gosh I think it is what I was going to do I think my empty or dog sorry I forgot but it's a while yeah at five years in the tech world no you need a no computer okay don't ask mark your business partner ask mark your husband okay yeah you tell me what you want to know well let me go back oh my notes hold on I need to open my chump by you'll you get your own like set a browser tab and notes and everything Oh, yeah, I'm back. 00:03:03 - mark sweet Hi. 00:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi, you need to get a ton of brand new Mac. 00:03:06 - mark sweet Oh, thank you. Yeah, no, she needs like a Windows that everything runs on Apple that nothing else runs on and just creates more problems and headaches that nothing else. I'm going to hear these things because she's her own business. 00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, you can give your wife some awesome technology as a man, not her partner business. 00:03:26 - mark sweet Go to your goods to cause it and show her the orange boxes of doom. 00:03:31 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Okay, no. 00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What are the orange boxes of doom? need to know now. 00:03:41 - mark sweet Choose. Her mess stuff. 00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, it's better. Well, she took them to get on the call with me that you're paying for because her computer was too ghetto. 00:03:55 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So. 00:03:57 - mark sweet Yeah, no, she can make decisions about how she wants. to spend her friends in different ways. 00:04:02 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) He doesn't like Apple. 00:04:04 - mark sweet He doesn't like MacBooks. I like Apple. I have an iPhone. I just don't like them for computers where everything else is Windows based and it makes everything turn. 00:04:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Hi. 00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's not worth spending the time arguing on, so I probably have an extra laptop somewhere in her office that could magically end up in her hands, but it's not an Apple. It's as long as it's fast. I just care if it's fast and it should have solid state drive and like all the RAM and VRAM and everything else. Huh? 00:04:35 - mark sweet That's fine. 00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Thank you Mark. Thank you very much. I love you. 00:04:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) like you. The doctor, Dr. Rickwood, said he will get me one. I think he already ordered and that's Windows that could be faster. 00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, just at the very least, like if it takes a while to do meaning, then it's inefficient and that's not that that time is no. 00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) I agree. 00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It compounds and it costs too much to wait on technology that's inefficient. So you were, let's just do this because you sent me that message and I've got your notes about I kind of bullet pointed them with question. 00:05:17 - mark sweet You guys want to talk together for a few minutes? Well, I just finished up one more quick thing that I do have to do. Okay, why don't you guys talk for a moment and then I will be back by in 10 minutes. 00:05:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Okay. 00:05:27 - mark sweet Sorry. 00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's fine because that's what I was saying we could do anyway. So, Okay, so the meeting I probably will ask a little bit more questions about but the insecurities, let me mute my phone about the male dominated nature of the meetings in the field. 00:05:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) mean Yeah, that one is that day I just feel less than and 00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But one thing I would say, being a woman in a man's world, that is not the same as doctors. I said, medicine is the oldest and women just weren't even allowed, even consider a woman. It's too delicate, can't handle it, it's its own kind of thing and that is a long indoctrination period that's generational because a lot of doctors have doctors in their family. They're talking Ivy League and indoctrination where, you know, like it's a culture intentionally. So one of the best things that you can do is really listen in the beginning, even if you have good ideas and pay a close attention. So if you're meeting with the same kind of people often, you want to study them, no. who they are, know what their strengths are, know what their weaknesses are, know what their blind thoughts are, and formulate what you have to say before you say it, not reactive, which I'm sure that you're good at doing, but be strategic about it. I don't know how well you'll be able to be heard in something like that. But if the first few times you wait to say something that nobody has bothered to bring up or acknowledged, and you can say it clearly, succinctly, and in the realm of, okay, here is a problem, here's a solution, or here's a problem, and here's what it's costing us and why we need to have a solution, that type of like if you you'll be respected faster and waiting until you can do that will help. So are you going to be in a situation where you're dealing with the same doctor frequently? 00:08:10 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Mm-hmm. 00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So the other thing is having so are there women around at all or just a few of them or none? 00:08:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So I guess in those two specifics and I that I said one is when I was with Dr. E and we go to the three hospitals that I have to go. We're in the doctor's lounge because we got food. We're in the doctor's lounge and I'm the only female there. Okay. became like like if I can like shrink myself I have that feeling like Dr. E though no he's a good person, he always include me like, hey guys, this is my new nurse practitioner, this is Chona, like introduce me and then I said hi. So, what is your body language and your eye contact when you're in that meeting? I guess, well, there's the two settings. The first one is on the doctor's lounge, so it's more relaxed, we're eating. So we're, there's just everyone is in different tables. I think, I know I was able to like hide my feelings of, you know, feeling little, but during the Zoom meeting, I don't have my camera on, but for some reason, I feel more, you know, less than in that particular space because they're talking, all of the panels are male doctors. and lawyers, and there's no women that speak up during that Zoom, and in general, I've attended a couple of them, and there's maybe two or three out of 50 people, so there's, you know, not a lie. But I guess, like you said, I think there's a lot of it being new. Like you said, there's a lot of people. 00:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what's wrong? 00:10:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) As soon as I feel more comfortable and in all aspects, like the main job right now is the one that I'm just, you know, to get the routine. The second and third, I don't know if you remember, like the main job, then the second of the PI and the third is Washington. That's probably going to be a while. I hope not. The second one, I have a new patient today and I was nervous, I think there's some frustrations in a way that I don't have a lot of control on putting the patient to the list, putting the patient on the appointment list. Even that I don't have that capacity and so I have to, there's multiple point people that I have to talk to and that's what frustrates me a little bit. I feel like it's inefficient, I feel there's too many hands and if that's what term but I had my first patient actually, actually it's marks that I am, that referred to us. 00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah, so I'm excited about that one, so there's something to think about is what you can do, like what are some of the things that you could do in order to feel more confident and strong? And I think and I don't know if you would be able to do this and maybe you can do it in breaks and later, but just write down some of the things that you notice. I'm gonna give you a lot of things actually to tell you and these are about mental fortification and strength. Also, do you like reading books at all? 00:12:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) I do read books now on my phone, but I'm still old school. I like to read not I'm locing on fiction, but that's good. 00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, do you like psychology books or the book or persuade 00:13:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Yes. Psychology is always. I think it's everyone's favorite. 00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not. 00:13:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Some people are stupid. I love it. 00:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I do too. 00:13:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) I do too. 00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, I'll give you a list of some books to check out. And if you don't enjoy them, then don't read them. Okay. 00:13:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) I mean, all your books would be good too. 00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you'll like this. So, and I'll tell you why I'm going to recommend them. But they have to do. I think they'll be very useful for you in the dynamic that you're in. Okay. There's a power dynamic always in play. And there's two values out of reading these particular books. that is number one. Know that there are people who are consciously employing these tactics so that you can be aware and observe them with the people around you and know who to write clearly. There's a lot of times as women we have intuition. which we can't validate and we can explain how we feel to some people but they'll be like yeah but whatever so but then if you go read the toxic she'll go they did this this this and this therefore this is who they are and what they're doing right and then it's really hard for people to refute you when you're like this is the problem right so like if you want to tell mark or if if there's somebody else that you're working with you can you can be very specific other than i i feel this way you can say i observe this habit this habit this habit that is um like part and parcel with this type of behavior whatever you know what i mean so you might laugh at the titles and i don't know if mark here's that but um one is called the art of war i think i've heard that before but i haven't read okay um the other one is 48 laws of power okay why robert green who's a psychologist i think And I think it's also 48 laws of human nature. And then he wrote a book called Pre-Swasion, which I think would be good. they cover a lot of similar topics, from different angles and different anecdotes. So the art of war is short. And it's very, the language is more like ancient philosophers. It's by Sun Tzu, an ancient Asian philosopher. But 48 laws of power actually breaks it down a lot and gives a lot of anecdotes and stories and how these tactics were used historically. The reason I think that it's so powerful is because when you start to see the behavior, you're like, oh, I noticed this person does this, and that person does this. And it just increases. So you have a background in psychology, but when you apply this psychology towards a professional dynamic, and you don't have just a professional dynamic, it's a specific dynamic of doctors. Doctors are for the average user unimpeachable, what they say goes for most people, and even if the person disagrees, they will capitulate. That is a powerful dynamic, and it's not questioned or softened, so that's what you're up against as just the foundation of starting. So for sure, there should be a warm-up period where you strategically just staying relatively quiet. Not playing small. I want you to take up space. I want you to lean in. want you to look with your eyes. I want you to make a comment. Like, you know, if something makes sense, you know, I want you to use a big girl voice and project a little bit, but not, you know, trying to be a man, not trying to be masculine, not trying to be hard, just in, in Chona's natural power, like whenever, so think about what you sound like when you are convicted and you feel like you're in a space where you can say exactly how you feel about anything. What does that volume look like? What does that body language look like? What does that stance look like? That is, I want you to be conscious of using that there, but only when you're confident that you know what you're talking about and that you have something valuable to say because this sooner that you make a strong, solid, you know, impression, that the better your opportunity to influence change will be. Speaking of influence change, influencing There's one more book that I would love you to read that hasn't it doesn't have nothing to do with psychology, but it's called switch by chip and then Heath and I can give you a list of these and write them down later and The subject about it is how to make change stick when change is hard and something like that but it It It talks about I don't know basically looking for what are the angles that you have? To use to get the change that you see that needs to be made to that needs to happen and How do you look for? you can leverage right so let's say you want to make a change and the first objection is We don't do it that way. It costs much money. It takes much time I'd have to hire I'd have to train. It's difficult. It's depending the blood mark love blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just swinging. We can't see if he's there, because he's not on video. Anyway. But that's the pushback that you get. So what you do is you basically anticipate proactively all of the objections that you might get, and before they even get a chance to object, you address them. So let's come up with an example of something that's today. 00:19:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) day. Yeah. So that example is with this new patient that Mark says, Oh, I have a being patient. And so he said, you know, he says, you know, you can call the patient at this time. So he set me up to talk to the chiropractor, which is very helpful. And you know, we just discussed a little bit of what he did to the patient so far. And then I hold the team, email them, I said, I need this patient, if you can please add this patient to the list as a telehealth, and as a lean patient, telehealth, under Dr. E. So, in the response, well, I said at a time clock, I didn't write a time frame on when I need the patient to be added. And by the time I need to call the patient, said, can you please add the patient? And then the response was usually with lean patients, we need to see them first in the office. But the thing is with this type of patient, we need to get them when we get them. So, I have to do what I have to do. Dr. does telehealth as a new patient. I guess the pushback was, this is not how we do things. Basically, that's what she's saying. So, I, my response was, it's okay, I spoke with Dr. E about it, but that was, that was my excuse, but yeah, I should have had a better answer and not always anchor in Dr. E as the reasoning or the final say. 00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) so yeah, now, what would be the logic and the reason why it would make more sense to do telehealth? 00:21:29 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Well, it's more of, I guess more, I guess the reasoning would be to get them in our system as soon as we can, because some of these patients are hard to, well, I don't know, I just heard it from our, but some of them are hard to talk to, you have to, you know, so it's just a matter of, like, time we need to get them when we can get them, right? 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So one of the things that you might say is say, well, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, would you want to choose telehealth, and then you'd be quiet and let them answer. if they try to circumvent the question, the question was, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, which by the way, this is the option and you tell them, you know, confidently, would we just not see them at all? Is that what I'm hearing? 00:22:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) And I just want to make sure I understand. Right. And fortunately, the patient is a little bit of a, you know, special that's the term that marks use and she's okay, but finally, she agreed for some reason she agreed to come tomorrow to the office. So then I have to send an email again, can you put them tomorrow on the list? So I I sound redundant. I asked them to add today and then add tomorrow, you know, but to me, I got all 99% of my information that I need, and I just need the patient just wants a lot of hand-holding of the explanation, so it's actually good that she's coming to the office tomorrow, but I feel okay. Sorry, I just need to be okay, not conforming to their system right away, or I don't know if that's the term I'm trying to see. 00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, there's a few different ways you can look at it. Do you need this job? Are you going to be just fine if you didn't have it? 00:23:54 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, especially the extra, I guess this is the second part of the business, I guess. being one, which is what I wanted to make sure that we are good. 00:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) A big part of this power dynamic that people are able to have is that they feel like most people need a job and so they will tolerate certain types of behavior because if you don't, you're gone or you're not life miserable. And if you know inside your heart, we're like, I'm either going to do it my way or I'm not going to do it at all because you don't have to have this job. And it is not the only opportunity for you and Mark to do an arrangement like this. 00:24:37 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) They're like something. 00:24:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If you believe abundantly that there's going to be a place where you can fit without playing small or holding back, that will come out energetically. So, now I have been called a and all kinds of things many times, but I don't use this energy to plow over anybody. I do it because. My best interest is the company's best interest. 00:25:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) want to see everybody win. 00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want to be clear. want to be frank and I need you to know you don't get to plow for me. So either I'm valued and I'm valuable and I'm wanted right because I'm not here just for paycheck. have things to do that are important to me. I care about this company. I care about these patients. If you don't value that. If what you want is a robot, I'm not your person. I am autonomous. I think I have things to value now. Do you have to conform to the system sometimes because the system makes sense? Makes the most sense is leveraged. Fine. Show me how it's leveraged. Show me how it makes the most sense so that I can buy into it and support it and get behind it. If you can't show me how this system makes the most sense and I have a suggestion that is good for the company. company and good for the patient and then I need to know I'm where that's going to be heard. You can't, I wouldn't say you just dive right in there immediately but I would say that you at least try to have that type of conversation because if you come in and play robot and then try to be autonomous that's not going to work very well. Right. So if you have a question, present the question. Now if you have a follow up question or follow up argument then you might think strategically okay is this the time for it or do I kind of progress through the you know the the barriers right a little bit at a time but basically every time somebody pushes back on me I'm just going to say okay but at least once this right you know so that they're aware that you're thinking about the process you're thinking about the value you're thinking about the system and It matters to you. Does that make sense? 00:27:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right. Yes. So Tuesday, I spoke with the manager by myself because I wanted to learn how their process works because Dr. E, you know, he's not interested on the logistics of this. He just he just wants to make money. But at the same time, I know he's a good person. He's a good doctor, but he doesn't want to, you know, diminution of like small things. he went, so he basically just dropped me off to the to the manager of the office and say, you know, you guys figured it out. 00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So if his priority is making the most money though, and let's say, let's say that getting the patient in the sickness is the fastest way to the money, right? 00:27:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) That's why he he agreed because I asked him right away. He said, I have this patient, I get them and get them in. But then, you know, that's why he sent the email. Because he's in the OR today, so he sends the email to the people, the key people, and says, you know, moving forward, China will be included in all PI cases, know, CC her, this and that. And then, you know, I respond to that email, I have a new patient coming in, this is the info, please add it to the list for telehealth today. So that's how I said it, but I know they have a system that, you know, obviously I'm new and I'm still learning their system is something either I will have to conform and maybe adjust based on how I think will be more efficient for us. 00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is a hospital, right? 00:28:52 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So it's a medical group. So this is clinic. So it's private, yes, which Dr. E Owens and he has. of a, okay, I have a, he have a manager, but he's just all over the place. I cannot rely him to just do the, I will have to drive this, because he's just nice and he spread himself to thin. He's just, I won't, I just won't have, he's gonna rely on me, basically. 00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So doctor, I just want to make sure I understand the dynamic theory. 00:29:26 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Doctor E owns this medical clinic, medical, he's the one right, just him. 00:29:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He owes it. 00:29:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) And so, okay. 00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And he hired you. 00:29:35 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) And we did that agreement with Mark and I. 00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And what is the scope of your stewardship? And let's let me break it down that way. Let's start that. What would you say is that you know clearly is the scope of your stewardship. What does he expect out you rather than just taking care of patients because you have a slightly different type of arrangement? 00:30:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So he wants me to basically wear different hats. Yeah. That's why the first two out of the three is with him with his medical group. So the first one, like I said, is the main main job, seeing patients in the hospital and clinic and calling patients is telehealth. That's the main job. And I get paid per patient on that one. Now provided he gave me a doctorate that's all great. So he's very generous on that one. The second part where the lean personal injury cases is where Mark kind of negotiated with me through him and with him with Dr. E that I get half, I get the percent of every patient seen. each visit. So let's say if it's a 500, each visit, I get 250. And every procedure that that patient does, epidurals, or any procedure at all, I get 20% because it's a patient or it's a client that comes from our sources, our meaning marketing, like our sources. But he has his own as well. He has his own personal injury cases as well, but he wants me to basically take over that as well. So, so he wants to urge that, but separate, merge, separate. 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me ask some questions though, because then my brain gets kind of stuck on logistics and then I can't really process anything else because I just like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? so who pushed back and said, you, you have to see patients in person first. 00:32:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) What was the role of that person. So he he's one of basically second to the manager. 00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:32:06 - mark sweet So like Cheryl. 00:32:08 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) No, that is the one who says because I didn't text Cheryl because it's still early. I know she hasn't gone to the office, but I should have texted Cheryl. 00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, your channel command is a little interesting. That's what I want to hear about. 00:32:26 - mark sweet So the easiest way to make an analogy is Dr. E is me and Cheryl is married. 00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, okay. 00:32:35 - mark sweet That's the easiest way. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, but who did you talk to that told you no? 00:32:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) She didn't. She didn't really said no. 00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She kind of like who tried to say no. 00:32:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Reminder that, hey, you know, typically we see the patient in the clinic. She's led. The her name is led. So who's second to Mary Han? Is that Michelle? Yeah. so you know I think maybe again because I'm that person who tried to not bother people that much that's not your job it was nine o'clock ten o'clock and I know that Cheryl the manager doesn't really come then till one because she's a afternoon late type of person she works till 12 one to you know she's a she's that person so I try to be I guess consider let me let me just clarify mm-hmm you can either be the person that Dr. E wants to run things efficiently and make the money or you can be the person that doesn't bother people you can't be right and I email them at 10 a.m. say I have an incoming patient please schedule the telehealth under Dr. E so telehealth there's no specific time needed as long as it's on the list, I can click on it and chart on it. They can schedule at 3 a.m. doesn't matter. But comes 12 o'clock two hours later, it's still not added. And the call is scheduled at 12.30. So I just wanted to ask, can you add the patient? Because I don't know how to, it's on the back end. It's on their end to add the patient on the list. So that's the time when I text because I know she's there in the office already. So that's why that's the whole dynamic on that part. next time, I'll just text Cheryl right away. 00:34:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So something that would be really helpful for me is to be able to see kind of an org chart. Mark, maybe you can help with this. So I can understand what the hierarchy is and roles and responsibilities in relationship to and I will be able to understand your dynamic much faster. 00:34:59 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right. It's really I mean, I talked her multiple times. She is approachable and not really at the same time. I don't know if it's just me feeling inept and, you know, not confident yet because I don't know the whole situation. I don't know the process that they have. still learning all through it, so it's possible that that's, you know, but I sent an email. I sent an email. I have that communication, but I guess, you know, email is not as urgent as text or call, so. 00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so that would be the other thing too, is just learning the chain of command and also the pace. You need things done and learning what gets you, what results, then just kind of observing what are the bottlenecks. if you need something done and it takes x amount of time, then maybe it only takes x amount of time If this person doesn't, and maybe it takes this amount of time, if this person does it, all the details about how things operate, how things operate individually by specific people, as well as by task. So if you have the most money-making opportunity, as well as the ability to feel confident in your own skin and in your role, the more you understand about the organization, even if you're not responsible for managing it, the more that you understand it, the more you will understand how you can, again, even if you're not technically responsible for it, you can have influence over it to make it go a better way for you. 00:36:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right. I just know that Tuesday night, when I talk to Cheryl, the manager who wants to be on the loop for everything, you know, medical to the practice, which of course, she's a manager. And she's very clear that she told me she doesn't want to take another project, which is aka me, because she has a contract that's coming, they have a contract that's coming. There's 300,000 patients rolling in soon. 00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. 00:37:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So she's overwhelmed with that. And they don't have the manpower to like deal with that. And that's up in the air. I mean, it's not up in the air. It's just it's like an upcoming storm that they have to, you know, ready themselves, ready ourselves, because I will have to see those patients too. But then when he talked to Marc, she talked to Marc, I was there for a while. Marc, her tone change, because you know, Marc is very good in talking to people. And you know, Marc is, how can I help you? How can I make it better? You know, I'll float this. 00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think this is a woman that doesn't like working with other women because there are plenty of those. 00:38:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) I'm not sure. I think it's just a power issue that she wants to be in, know, wants to be on the loop. What do you think, hun? 00:38:12 - mark sweet I don't know. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is their structure doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah. pulling in different directions. It's a very, very classic visionary and integrator situation where it's visionary. Listen to me, know, listen to me. This is how we actually do it. And frustration that obviously boils over between the two, just somewhat naturally, if you use the word naturally, but you know what I mean. so the issue for Chona is she's got to kind of navigate a tight rope. Sorry, not tight line. Tight rope between these two different people who are pulling her in different directions, partially because her, the CEO doesn't deal with anything financial. So she really doesn't have any visibility in terms of payroll or who's getting paid what or what happens. That's all Dr. E, which makes all this even more confusing because we're just trying to suppose to go to. she's trying to serve two masters at the same time without taking any one off. My advice would just be have a group chat with both E and Cheryl, that way everyone's on the same page and sees the exact same thing, so there's no issue or problem, or E, Cheryl and Cass or whatever it is while we're getting to figure this out, because I can promise you whatever they're doing now is not going be what you're going to be doing in six months. Because there is no structure, and so he's looking at us to come in and help those structure put processes in place, but we can't just go and do that rough shot because Cheryl is really upset. So we have to involve her in the process, slowly make the tweaks so she can see how much better everything is. E starts seeing some money come through, so he's happy and then the process evolves. 00:39:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) But I just remember when we talked to her. 00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that we're not doing it right now and then now here comes a patient today so I don't know if she's not happy about that you know this this is a thing like I think like I like oh my god and she's probably not happy with this but it's only one patient so it's fine it'll be okay the biggest issue and this is always been my experience and I know Tina will talk about this when an integrator doesn't feel like they're involved and they're on the outside that's when they get really upset so this goes back to I'm gonna I'm gonna take this here Jonah because the fastest path path to liaising between those two roles when you're not even that is structure understanding the structure so I get that you don't have all the numbers but what you're going to want to do and mark you help figure out how we can do this as best as possible and it's probably conversation with Cheryl and with Dr. E and my Maybe with you. I don't know how how this dynamic works. This is you, but hold on, but so Somebody needs to frame and and chona you're new to this. So if this is not necessarily I'm saying do this right away. Okay, I'm talking about this will be the game plan and it will be understanding as much as you can about the system and how it operates what is fluid and what is friction. What that does in terms of revenue, right? Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the bottlenecks in terms of getting something accomplished in a timely manner and having consistent patients coming in and revenue and then also how is this stopping all of these things. if you are going to come in and make the most value, you would have to understand everything about the organization. That's going to take time, especially if you're not in a position where anybody would expect you to ask those questions and even when you're expected to ask those questions, in case in point somebody I'm talking to on the other side, the sign right here is they don't always want to have give you the information or they don't have it or don't know where to go get it or it's a pain. But to make the most change with the least amount of friction and problems with the least amount of disruption to the current piece, you're gonna want to understand the ins and outs of everything and everyone as best as you can. So whatever you can do to understand that asking questions, taking notes and then bringing it back here, bringing it back to Mark hopefully with the three of us, then we'll start to get some insight into, okay so for example when I'm working with people, the first thing I want to do is make their lives easier. So you would want to not just make Dr. E's life easier, that's but you were hired for it, but you want to make Cheryl's life easier and you need to understand what bothers her, what stresses her out from a position of, that's my goal, Cheryl, how can I serve you? 00:43:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) what can I do to help you? 00:43:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. then when she gives you a little bit of information, if you have formulated a follow up question, ask the follow up question. And if she's not approachable, then just say, Hey, is there a time when I can ask you some questions? 00:43:28 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) just really want to understand this because knowing that you run all of this, I feel like the best way for me to support him is to support you. 00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that would be sincere. That would be the truth that that's that's her role in dynamic. And eventually, if you do it really well, and she doesn't feel threatened or anything by that, then you can have number one, a good ally that is just enjoyable to work with, but to actually getting good results. Right. you're new, there's a lot to navigate, but the fastest way to navigate it safely is to figure out the topography ASAP. 00:44:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right, so that's why I've been spending, because I know she's an afternoon night person, I would spend some time doing four hours with her, just talking, we talk about a lot of things, we talk about our dog, we talk about like, I'm trying to understand, you I wanted to understand her as a person, and I wanted to understand. It marked, you know, he talked to you too, and right? Yeah, and she helped with something. She asked me, because I asked questions, and I wanted to learn, and that's what I did the other the past couple of times, I've been seeing hers, like I wanted to understand not just the lean part, but the main job part, where in, you know, I can, I'm sure I will have more questions. It's what I told her, but I'm kind of like cementing that relationship between the two of us, because she is going to be that person, guys. 00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So if you capture any of that in email or text, I would love you to share that here so I can help you. But maybe if she's open to it, if you're having a conversation, say, do you mind if I just record this so I can go take some notes on it later? You probably. 00:45:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. Probably know. 00:45:36 - mark sweet Knowing how she is, she probably won't respond well to that. 00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, And she's super paranoid about all of this stuff. Yeah. 00:45:45 - mark sweet What they do like is a lot of Medicare and grievances and all sorts of other things. Okay. So I totally get what you're saying, because you just don't want to have to try to remember things and write it down later. 00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can you take notes while you're talking? 00:45:58 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right. Right. I can already. 00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You want me to take notes on what she told me about specifically on the number two, the lean patients that do. the thing you want to keep in mind is that as you're learning everything, your ability to manage and remember it all perfectly is probably not going to be great. When you capture it, then we can start to kind of categorize the data and formulate what you want to do with it, but being able to see it visually, taking it out of your brain first of all makes it accessible to us. Right. That we can help you. But second of all, it helps you sift through instead of having to, wait, what did she say about this? That's mental effort. That's exhausting when you add that to a 10 hour day, nine hour day, whatever is on top of that. Now you're trying to go be strategic after hours. The more that you write down and organize that data, the less your brain has to work. You've already got a lot. to do. So you want to manage your mental resources and your energy resources. So getting copious notes or at least very well organized main thoughts, you know, captured. 00:47:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So yeah, I mean, I can tell you what she told me based on the what they do because I asked her what did they come in from different sources, right? They have a big one, which is the now, Dr. Gannal Manau Gannam, but it's a big chiropractor group that brings them patients. So the moment it comes in, they create an email chain between cast, share deal, Dr. E, they put the patient's name there and the birthday. And then they will say this is a new referral from this attorney's office, and these are the medical records, please, you know, schedule the patient. And once the patient is seen, by that time, hopefully, we had the MRI because we're supposed to be this specialist. So they should have gone through the conservative therapy of chiropractic treatment and or physical therapy. So they have an MRI. So by the time we see them, they said that that's the decision-making of let's do an epidural or not. We can recommend a procedure, however, we can't do it right away until we okay it with the lawyers. So what they do is they email the law firm. So this is the other steps, like email the law firm telling, attaching the notes, which Mark said it's a no-no, but anyways, I'm telling you how they do it. And then they will respond either the lawyer, the case manager of the case, will respond says go ahead. you can do the the drill. So once that's done and they schedule the patient for an epidural or for any procedure, which emailing notes like that is not HIPAA compliant, right? Right, that's how they do it. 00:49:16 - mark sweet It's not HIPAA compliant, it's discoverable in litigation, so it looks at the lawyers driving the care, so there's a lot of things that are right. 00:49:24 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) This is I'm telling you like what they do and how they do it. 00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was just okay, that's good to know. 00:49:30 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) This is how they do it right now. 00:49:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) One of the things that does though is it speaks to priorities and it also speaks to business understanding and just overall health of it and so that's what I'm curious about is we do it because we do it because this is how we do it. We do it because it's easier and faster to do it that way. 00:49:56 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Oh yeah, I need to do it that way, but yeah, you're paper trail, which Mark talked to them. That's not, you know, that's not, that's how it should not be done. 00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But anyway, so that's how they do it. 00:50:09 - mark sweet Sorry, can we just talk about this just a teeny teeny bit more. So part of the issue that they have and why they want paper trail is some of the loaders they work with are not great to put it mildly. so Bill, the loaders say, yeah, do it, do it, do it, whatever that is, whether it's injections or surgery or what have you, but there's not enough money to get that done. And then at the end, they will say, well, no, we didn't mean that we don't have enough money in this way. In Cheryl's eyes, hey, we have a paper chair, we said, do it. This is your problem. You better cut your feed to make sure I'm paid because you said do it. So I understand why she wants to say it's not like she's just trying to be lazy or problematic. Like there's a very valid reason for it. 00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I mean, is it solvable by having a secure portal? It's just that email cannot be secure. So it's not the communication itself that is illegal or unethical, right? 00:51:12 - mark sweet No, no, no, no, this is the issue because if you're sending to the lawyer saying I need your authorization, that makes it look like the lawyer is trying care and that's why it's bad. 00:51:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, okay, let me just understand this real quick. The lawyer is going to say yes in policy limits, right? Right. Okay, so can we not make this correct by talking to the insurance companies and knowing what the limits are or getting those those limits like having the lawyer send a report on here's what's available left like is what is the way can't do this because two reasons one the insurance company doesn't tell you. 00:52:01 - mark sweet Two, if that was sent to the doctor's office, then it would look like the doctor's office is only treating based on insurance, not over what the patient actually needs. I understand these are all things with stupid distinctions because the reality is what happens is the doctor will just call our office and ask, hey, do I have authority to do this, that, or the other thing? because it's a telephone call, it's not discoverable. 00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:52:24 - mark sweet Okay. So it's, it just is what it is. I, I, I'm just trying to understand it all, really. 00:52:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Question. 00:52:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) It's possible then that we can just have internally among us, like I spoke with, oh, that's discoverable too. 00:52:41 - mark sweet Like I spoke. it's all discoverable to some level. 00:52:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) No, not see seeing the lawyer, not sending them anything, but whoever called that lawyer will have our own discussion, our own email chain saying this attorney, okay, to do this procedure for this. 00:53:00 - mark sweet So when you get subpoenaed in litigation, they ask you for your entire medical record. If that is part of the medical record, you turn it over. So it's part of your medical records. 00:53:13 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Email is part of medical records, no. 00:53:19 - mark sweet Email communications are part of your records. 00:53:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Okay. not the records, yes. So I don't know then, how would we have a trail? 00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What you can do is you could, and I might be wrong, but I'm looking for this. if the process is called the attorney and get permission, then what you can have is some way of selecting or just saying we don't write this thing down until we have that conversation. So if we've written this down, that means we've already contacted the attorneys and they've approved it. And one thing could be, Dr. recommends X. I'm conferring with patient or whatever and really what that means is I'm calling the attorney to find out if that can happen Attorney said yes. 00:54:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) So patient is scheduled so how is the documentation is being done now is that We recommend patient will benefit from this and this Injection costing we say approximation of the cost And you know how many treatments needed or and or if it fails, you know This other procedure can be done with quotation of the quotes and it marks that it's okay to put that on the medical records So like something that you could do is that you put that And then maybe there's an indicator that somebody acknowledge it and is working on it and it could just be as simple as Noted receive something like that that internally. 00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Everybody knows that doesn't go there until you've reached out to the attorney If the attorney says yes, you can do it then the next notation is Scheduling um or recommendation accepted and then you schedule it. So the language is not decipherable by anybody that I called an attorney and got permission. You just know that that happened. There's no record of it. But internally you would have to know don't do this until that. 00:55:19 - mark sweet Cheryl's concern and it's a valid concern is it's great we have a phone call. 00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Where's the proof? Yeah yeah yeah. 00:55:26 - mark sweet And that's going to be a problem. So they may decide that they would rather just run the risk of looking like idiots in litigation. 00:55:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's straight off. You have to pick a off. Yeah. 00:55:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Which what they've been doing in the practice they've been doing it for a while now. They actually have a lot of their own lean patients. This is how they've always done it. And now I'm learning through Dr. through Mark that this is not the right way to do it. Now I'm coming in trying to change the structure while Oh, not in the guys, but it's the truth is to make it more efficient and kind of offload that pressure from Cheryl as well. So that's where I'm coming in. 00:56:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And yeah. So the questions that I would be asking are, what is the most expensive? So if you get litigated, somebody suges you because that's what happened. Number one, the company has insurance that can help with that. So what is the potential risk and what is the likelihood of that? Not that anybody knows that I'm for sure, but you could ballpark it. 00:56:34 - mark sweet So it's not them getting sued so much. It's when you have a car accident case, right, between Mr. and Mr. Jones. And so Mr. Jones's attorney's only job is to make Mr. look like he's not really hurt that all this should have been resolved very quickly and chiropractic care would have resolved. And that Mr. Smith's attorneys are the ones who are driving this because Mr. Jones has a large. policy. He didn't really need these injections and surgery and everything else. And then so when defense counsel of Mr. has emails showing that Mr. doctor asked for the lawyers' permission to do a medical procedure, it falls into the defense's narrative of they didn't really need this. They're just doing this for the money. So my question is, but it's more difficult. 00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my question is, what is more detrimental to the business? Having attorneys not paid for something that they authorized, so this is frequency and amount, how much is that up to or the cost of litigation for such a scenario is that? Which one gets more expensive? 00:57:48 - mark sweet My guess is going to be it's more expensive by not having a paper trail because the attorney is that he works with it. 00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Then that's why. the systems in place and they're making an educated risk or at least a intentional, like, conscious risk. But- That's right. That's frustrating as that is. Yes, but I mean, but that's business, you have to make trade-offs. So, and if it's the nature of it, and that's what's more expensive to them, or potentially risky. So, will Chona bear any, could she bear any liability personally for any of that? 00:58:33 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) No, because everything's being signed by- Okay. 00:58:38 - mark sweet So, it's not going to be tied to her per se unless there was some sort of investigation or the FBI came and raided it. 00:58:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so it's not compliant. We know it. doing it anyway. All right, so we'll move on past that topic, yeah? 00:58:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:58:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, probably- prep so it's late and I will have to find a quick wrapping up thing so I gotta take my daughter again this is in the beginning there's just a lot of discovery and figuring out I would love okay let me think about if I were gonna have you read one of those books first which one it would be the 48 laws of power okay um it's it's dense but I think once you start getting into it you'll see what I'm talking about about the application and the second one would be switch um but I do think that you would enjoy some of the other ones and I'll all write them down but we've got a lot going on so yeah maybe she right now is trying to figure out how to navigate some of these interpersonal issues that's why I'm recommending these two books have you read 48 laws of power mark yes please 01:00:07 - mark sweet I'm sorry. 01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) didn't hear anything you would say. Have you read the book 48 laws of power? 01:00:12 - mark sweet Yeah. 01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. that's what I'm recommending that she read even though it's dense because understanding that dynamic and all the different people. I just think it's a good book overall. But I know what I was explaining to her is watching how you might notice some people applying particular types of tactics and be able to recognize and identify specific behaviors and mannerisms and know who you're dealing with a little bit better because you'll recognize those patterns anyway. Okay, as well as how to navigate it. But also just some insight into like what to pay attention to and kind of choose your strategy for how you want to insight change as well. as how you communicate your reasons and logic behind the change that you want to make. So it's all strategy but the on a personal note and just being able to enjoy the place that you work understanding people, understanding how to serve them while understanding their motives, understanding how you can help them accomplish their motives as long as they're good. you know and be of support of those around you and knowing that all of that enables you to serve two main missions which is helping the client, patient, get what they need but also having your own success, personal success in leadership but also monetarily so you can earn that money which allows you to do whatever other things that you want by your life. So it's um It's not a fast, simple thing. really have to be conscious, mentally. The more notes that you take, like I said with everything, just even thoughts that you might have. 01:02:11 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) you gave me that voice message today, and I transcribed it and put it in my notes so that I could save it for later. 01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll do that in the future because everything that you notice is probably useful and it just kind of helps you get your bearings. Like I said, topography. Once you understand where you're at and who you're dealing with, then you can understand how to navigate it better. 01:02:36 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Right. 01:02:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 01:02:38 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) Makes sense?

00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi. Sorry. It's having weird issues with Zoom today. 00:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, I'll get it. 00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The worst time calls for me to like 11, because it takes me so much longer on Mondays off the weekend to like get my brain going. I'm not in work mode. I take all of Sunday off, but you've got this schedule and only Monday warnings work for you. 00:00:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. You know, we could do a because I because I've shifted my schedule to free this. could. We could do afternoon. So let me let me text. Maybe I'll text you later after this and take a And then early it's that I like being at optimal. 00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) on mental level for that because I feel like I provide the best service that way and in the so like there's an acceleration to my morning but also to the week and so first thing Monday morning I'm not giving the best but also you have a habit of sending me stuff at the last minute like Sundays and I am not I won't see it until right before our meeting which isn't enough time what did you send me you sent me oh I just put in the chat box but um we're gonna go over the nighting you you emailed me something and I was trying to find same thing it's the same thing I love doing it too I created a share folder so now we can we can all look actually I should put all this in the same folder but um but yeah I'm excited to look honestly I've had my bookkeeper doing this so the last like since I started the business I was like okay I'm gonna get a bookkeeper so I keep track and uh 00:02:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. I really don't look at this stuff other than to look at like the total profit for the month, which is basically you know right now, but Yeah, it's time to go through it You say it's no old right now? Very little, no Or for which business for July? Yeah, it's very low. 00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why? 00:02:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. Now it's just a lot of it's getting rolled back. Well, it's not, you know, it's like 40,000 But a lot of it was getting rolled back into the world back into the company Okay, well, there's a big difference between nothing and 40,000 just you know But rolling it back into the company is something and you'll see So where do you want to start? Oh, let's start just January. Oh, we'll just go through it. 00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) want to just do January Yeah, and do you want to screen share or me square screen share or just both? 00:02:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, why don't you do it because I guess I want to look at how you're looking at it and 00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Let me change my name. Now. Why is this open with. 00:03:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh my God, wait. I'm sorry. They say it's empty. Wait, my, my bytes say zero. There's, there's. So the file is not right. I'm sorry. Hold on. Oh my God. Only one of them work just August. Can you see if you can open the one that says August? 00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me try. I think I have to click the link again because it's like, um, very frustrating and confused. what it is. Okay. 00:04:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. there's. Okay, that's what happened. Okay, let me get the rest. about this. And check that. 00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, cool. So you also have your to date there. So service income. 00:04:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, we're ready. can look at January. No, sorry. 00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No worries, no worries. Can't do this kind of work and be impatient like stuff has to happen. It's all across us. That's interesting. No, looks very different from August. 00:04:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. I didn't have the year to date yet. 00:04:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. That makes sense. Okay, service income, cross-profit expenses, advertising and marketing and contractors. 00:04:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, by the way, I come up with all of these headings. all the headings that you see on the list. the left are my categorizations for expenses. So I can categorize things even more finally, or like more detailed, but as you'll see, these are the ones I chose to group them. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is good. So what I would do, generally speaking, I would look at this in correlation with the one that had the calls on it. 00:05:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, interesting. 00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is it, right? 00:05:34 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yes. 00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, and then I would probably put nets like gross and net, even though the payment comes like a year and a half on average later, however long that is. to go over the data and look at the trends, and then those particular things do have a correlation to what's happening in real time in terms of like your staff, marketing, you go in accounting services, advertising and marketing, that's the same. 00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, so before this point I was using another company, I had funds left over from a different business, so I was paying those advertising expenses for February and March through a different company, just to create expenses on it, but that's This is actually that this was the true advertising market and expense I was paying. Okay, or closer to it, I should say. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, and Elizabeth is going up a lot. So what was Yeah, so around this point, Elizabeth, she's my only clinician that's being Spanish and she's licensed in all the states that we operate. 00:08:28 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I increased her salary to like 30, I think it was like 35 a visit up from 30. 00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so she's paid for visit. 00:08:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. But she also does the most volume in our clinic, like she almost she works full time basically with us. The others only do like a day a week. Is she happy with you? Loves it like she was in Africa for three months and working from Africa and, you know, doing this from Africa. 00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. if you have somebody that you're that reliant upon, you definitely want them to be happy and well taken care of. So it's April, Elizabeth, not so much as March and was not down in April. How come she worked? Like, did she work less in April and why? 00:09:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's possible. Again, I don't actually get to choose their working schedule. 00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) get to pick their own. It's not about choosing. It's about understanding what the rhythm is, like why it's happening and what impact it makes. And these are the questions I'm looking at is because that's an anomaly. That's an inconsistency and I'm wondering why. 00:09:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's a really good point. Well, I'll read you the much data when you pull it up. So for April, there was 349 visits completed. Yeah, that's interesting. That dollar value actually should correlate like this total visits completed should correlate with the amount I spend on clinician. 00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:10:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. And just saying that it kind of doesn't. 00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, well, so thousand for this month, but the month before which had less calls significantly or less appointments. 00:10:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, you know what, though, also they bill me at the end of each month. Wait, would that make sense? So they bill me bi-monthly so every two weeks. I don't know, should still show up. I don't know. Maybe their last payment is coming on May 1st. 00:10:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's possible. 00:10:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. Something like that. 00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I just don't know what just February. 00:10:51 - Fujinaka, M.D. May 1st. 00:10:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 16th. Yeah, that's just but those are very two very different types of things um yeah office expenses software okay and june is big but we're a number to come up that was a lot more this year that's just a definitely not a super consistent um in terms of and maybe it is the day that you get build and pay people out uh that would make sense if the payment for me went out in june because me was heavier yeah and also this invoice i paid my contract my not not contract i paid my staff 00:13:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. late so I paid them into in July so like there's zero for the staffing fee on this month right on July I think I've yeah I paid them in July yeah see the staffing fee went up here and the staffing is double there and there was zero in this month for staffing okay so what's the difference between staffing and clinicians clinicians are the doctor like the nurse practitioners and the staffing is my admin okay yeah I wasn't even noticing Guatemala they're all Guatemalans got it I'm stopping January February almost nothing and then March was really big That's why I don't know, like in March, I think I paid a couple of them late. I was there like their second month or first month starting, so it pushed over to the next month. 00:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That was our first month. Okay, so there's still just a lot of getting going in this. 00:14:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, very manual. Now I've given the payroll over to my manager, like the one guy that I'm paying a lot more, so it should be really consistent. think it should be more consistent. So August, this is pretty representative because I cut off all marketing, as I mentioned. The staffing was paid on time, the clinicians were paid on time. This should be pretty close. 00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And the accounting, I assume most of this is accounting as well. 00:14:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know, that's a huge number. Now that I've pointed out, I want to take a look. So I have this, a detailed statement here. 00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the month before it was 9500. So And that does not correlate to any other month. I don't know, except for February, maybe they're catching up and doing stuff. okay. yeah, my bookkeeping costs $300 a month. So yeah, that stuff is actually because your today, your $19,880. 00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, I just uploaded something else into my Google drive that I shared with you. It's called the detailed profit and loss. This has like every check that I received, every deposit I've made. Okay. Where is that category? Oh, there it is. Yeah, so I included, I included my bookkeeping. I'm sorry, I included my accountant into that one. 00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so one is but keeping the one as accountants. 00:16:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I just looked it all together. 00:16:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I mean for the P&L that is right. 00:16:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. There's no, yeah, there's no legal, legal fees. Okay, and so that looks correct to you for the cost of your account. Yeah, unfortunately. 00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, would you want to do that? Although it still seems pretty high for what you do. What's your accountant's hourly rate? 00:16:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. How are you billed? have no idea. He just they just invoiced me at the end of every year. 00:16:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, you know. How do you get stolen from very easily have no idea? 00:17:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's a good point. 00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I think you should get a detailed invoice for everything and go or with the find to call. I'm happy to do it with you. want to call if you just don't want to do it, but I'm pretty sure you can get a really good accountant for less than that. I mean, potentially you've got a lot of records and it takes a lot of time, but I think a good person would be able to do better than that. But at the very least, we want to take a look at it. And anytime you're spending thousands of dollars on anybody, the answer to what are you paying for should never be. 00:17:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. I have no idea. That's a really good point. I will start asking. I'm actually looking at the invoice that they sent me right now and it doesn't really, it doesn't really say much. 00:17:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) When you take your eyes off your money, somebody else will have their eyes on it and their hands on. 00:18:01 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's a good colloquialism. Sorry, yeah, I will, it's a really good point. I will ask them why is this money, this money? 00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's go back to the calls. 00:18:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. Astronaut, so just Tina on that note too, before I had these accountants called Markum, I had another really quote unquote aggressive accountant. And we feel that the aggressive accountant saved us money, but it was driving us bonkers that he would get it to us like on the day of, or he would text us on the day of and be like, oh, hey, send in your taxes right now, send in your payment right now, to days today. And we did that for two years with them, we're like, we can't keep doing this. So we turned it over to a kind of a more of a corporate accountant called Markum. They're like a big box accountant. And, you know, they give us like reminders, they tell us how much we're going to owe. It's all very like clean, minus the invoicing, which I'll ask. 00:19:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) long as you're making a conscious tradeoff and that money is worth the convenience, that's okay. I pay convenience fees. had two storage units. Nothing I have in there is worth paying a storage fee. I don't have to deal with processing, memories, things that belong to my girls and my house. And so it's a convenience fee, you know, but I'm consciously choosing to spend my money on the convenience fee of delaying having to deal with it because it's not my priority. And I have the money to do it. 00:19:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. And I, you know what I mean? 00:19:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, if you are happy with your investment for whatever reason, but you consciously wasn't the reason. And I'm saying this again, because I want it, you apply it to everything. Some things, some people, some emotions, some experiences are worth the resource. In case I'm going back to paying the access fee for, for, yes. So, but you just do need to know, never, especially when somebody's job is money, say I have no idea. Account is a classic for embezzlement. 00:20:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. I see it. No, it's, uh, thank you. That's what, you know, it's just one of the unexpected things I got out of this coaching with you is there's things that I sort of feel are I sort of felt bad about? Like one of the things is counting. I'm like, God, you know, I really should find a better accountant that's more aggressive. But yeah, thank you. I appreciate you saying that because you're right, it has been a conscious effort when everything else was kind of like going to, going crazy in our life. 00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This accountant was just very consistent and you know and Esther and I have always sucked like hey we are going to find a more aggressive one in the future but we need to stabilize our right now and that's why we're okay so I'm not thank you for saying that I do appreciate that but yeah on the flip side I do need to have I do need itemized invoices from this dude absolutely okay and always be aware of the trade-offs so like I don't do anything really aggressively anymore and I am type a Virgo perfectionist like all these things but the trade-off for my peace of mind it is that well it's priceless and one of the things that I realized a long time ago and it started with learning about the parade of principal so the 80-20 role but do you know the history of him as an economist and how he discovered it So he was an Italian economist and what he discovered was that 80% of the property in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. 00:22:10 - Fujinaka, M.D. How interesting. 00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And so then he did some further studies but the correlation has been that roughly 80% of our results comes from 20% of our efforts. Obviously there's outliers and all these different types of things but when it comes to delegation. So I really like things done my way. I get really annoyed and frustrated when they're not my way but I have taught myself to let that go and just be glad that that thing is done because I didn't have to deal with it. And so sometimes the degradation of quality could be 5 to even 10% let's say if somebody else does it. It's less if I train them and qualify them. But the opportunities that are available to. me to experience of any type personally or professionally are increased and much more in alignment with my joy and my area of expertise when I'm not bogged down by the other things. So whatever it costs me, I'm more than make up because I'm putting my time in my most leverage which also tend to be my most profitable activities which also tend to be my most enjoyable activities. And so quality suffers in some areas but overall life quality and business quality increased. So I don't know what you mean by saying you need to have a more aggressive accountant. But this piece of mine or at least the systemization of the reminders and all these other types of things, that is something I would highly recommend for any of my visionary type clients because you're never going to want to deal with it. 00:24:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. And they do that really well. Yeah, no, and I meant, I meant I think there are other ways we can cut taxes a little bit like legally. Oh, okay. That they're just not pushing hard on. 00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you want a wealth manager in addition to an accountant, an accountant's job, some of them are going to look for tax breaks and to a certain extent. But a wealth manager, somebody who understands trust laws and tax countries and all these other types of things, accountants aren't taught that lawyers aren't taught that because those are institutions. Those and institutions are meant to serve the institution being the government. So they're not going to be taught the loopholes. They're not going to be taught all of that. And they don't want to get in trouble. They don't want to have it in their business. So you want somebody whose primary focus is on maintaining and preserving wealth. that is not an accountant. 00:25:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds right. 00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So have those conversations with Mark. Maybe he has some referrals for you. I bet he would. But it is definitely separate. keeping as much keeping more of the money that you make. Separate then totally come different conversation than accounting. 00:25:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yes. I appreciate you saying that. I need to be reminded. I know that. I do. I really do know that. But I just have to be reminded about that sometimes. 00:25:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, remember all of these things when you when you think about when the bill comes in November and be like, oh, yeah, that's why I'm paying Tina. 00:25:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, we're good. We're doing this for a year. 00:25:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm gonna we're gonna make this work. You're gonna I if we get to stick with it for a year, you would you'll be like everybody else and not want to quit. Because it helps to have somebody else doing the thinking with you. You can't think all the things. 00:25:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. None of us can. 00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) None of us can. I've got I've got people in my corner too, and I'm like, oh, I don't know what I would never have thought that thing Thank you. 00:26:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. We are we are doing this for a year. 00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want I want to I want to do it for a year at least Good. That's a good commitment. Okay, so Um, let's look at this So I'm looking at the calls and we're looking Nothing really stands out other than the fact that you don't know about Some things so I want you to know those things and I'm going to Make that an assignment for you to get back to me next week Just either that you have sent out the request like to your accountants You so you want to atomize Invoice from him For month over month, right? Yep. 00:26:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. Um, I'm just gonna call her Two people, but yeah, I'll just say hey, know, I'm trying to be more diligent send me And it's always good to talk to them so they know there's a real person. 00:27:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, and that person is paying attention and not asleep. Always good to know that the people watching your money know you're watching your money too. And so I would really like to see stopping hours so we can correlate this and just take a look at it. So if you have a staffing report that tells you hours worked over these months, do you? 00:27:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, no, I mean, they're all, you know, just full time from Guatemala. I have, I mean, I could just tell you the number of full time staffers. It's five. think. 00:27:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, so how when they invoice you, what do you just get a dollar amount? 00:27:51 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, because everyone's working essentially 40 hours a week. I have a couple that are offset like one goes from nine to five. another one goes from like 10 to 6. 00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Are they salary? 00:28:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I want me it's it's whatever I decide. 00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm trying to figure out okay um are we talking about clinicians or other staff? 00:28:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh it's a staffing I consider my administrators is what I'm And they're their salary? 00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah just the okay that's fine um but for your clinicians I would really like to see some sort of reports okay because their numbers vary quite bit okay and not necessarily in correlation with the volume and it may just be like you said that you pay on a different date but I would like you to inspect that okay so we go back to clinic volume the ml data um I can put a column well I could put one for like Elizabeth patient scene you know like right here I could put one 00:29:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. that says like Elizabeth, patient seeing, that would be great. They just something simple. And I could just literally put in how many she built me for it because she builds me by how many patients she saw. And then that's it. That's how I'm ambitious. 00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That would be great because, I mean, again, the more data we look at, the more you'll notice particular patterns, whether they're good or bad. But also, you just want to make sure you're not being taken advantage of like you, that's a base level of information you need to have, if somebody is sending you an invoice. Kids, sometimes even good people can be tempted when they think nobody's looking. 00:29:45 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, I'll do that, thanks. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:29:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. I'll just do it for the other ones too. 00:29:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, yes, yes, you should do it for everyone for sure. 00:29:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Thank you. But here's the other thing is, so I like tracking time as much as possible because these are your resources that your people's hours are your inventory, basically, right? It's you can only fulfill what your staff can fulfill or you and your staff can fulfill. So if you did decide that you know what, you're going to go just out out for a couple of years to acquire, like, grow your revenue so that you have more money to invest in other things and not worry about whether not you become a target or, let's say, just two or three year window, you're just going to go and tell something happens, grow and grow and grow. You need to know what your scalability is, what the capacity is of your clinicians and your staff to handle things and these numbers will give you the best indicator. But they'll also help you know, okay, so everyone Everybody fulfills a different amount of calls, patients, and what is the quality difference? So it helps to inform your hiring in the future as well. Pattern more after this person, pattern more after this person that we are actually a good blend if we have these, that type of thing. Again, the more data that you have, the better you are at scaling. So you want it for everything so that so can I show you my schedule? 00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yes. 00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) want to see all the things. It's all helpful. Oh, stop sharing. 00:31:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. There you go. I think you'll be, I don't know, you might be very amused at this. I'll just show it to you. So this is our Google calendar that schedule. So each clinician has the ability to add their own time slots. for Tuesday September 24 tomorrow, you'll see Elizabeth wants to work from seven to 10. It doesn't mean we're going to fill them with patients because obviously you don't have enough, but you can see she already has one. And then today we're going be trying to fill up her schedule today. But the limiting factor isn't necessarily you know, I guess how much they're working. It's how many patients we can get a hold of and schedule. And it's always a challenge on telehealth. People don't answer their phones. Do like tomorrow, everyone wants to work. Like three of the clinicians, Elizabeth wants to work at seven. She wants to work again at 12. Then Sherby wants to work a short shift in the afternoon from three to five. And then Angelina wants to work a short shift in the evening from five to seven. So, you know, we all want to. 00:32:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That is very useful because it makes me want to say If you're willing to play the game and take a risk, and I'm not advising you to do that. I cannot. I don't know the extent of the cost of having somebody breathing down your neck, inspecting you and auditing you. So that's a real stress, and I tend to put a moat around my family for potential stress. Depending on what it is, some things I'll literally die for, but you have to decide what it is and also how you feel about it. I believe a lot in intuition and in addition to the logic and the analytics. what I would do out of just a curious exercise would be look at the average amount of time slots that your team wants to fill each week and look at how much you can see. like could you open another location and get another 400 people with your existing staff who wants to be working more and I might run those numbers and go you know what let's do that. 00:34:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. I did my homework that you wanted me to talk to Mark about this question because before I had asked him what if I just expand you know he said you know don't I so I kind of dug into him more about like what's the reason and he said ultimately my name is on every note because I'm supervising all these so he said you unknowingly are already on every insurance's radar probably because they're looking at which doctors doing volume and so what he said is what he's seen is the sweet spot is about 400 a month and why is it 400 he said because if you take 20 working days a month where there's usually 19 or 20 working days a month and each doctor can see 20 patients a day insurance companies figure that each doctor can see roughly 400 hundred patients a month. And he said, if you start to show your name more than that, that's when you're going to get flagged. And they're going to say that is impossible for you to see that many, you must be cutting corners and they're going to investigate you. So he said, you could probably go up to 500 and say you're just a badass and you work on weekends. But he said, the more you stick out past that 400, the more chance you're going to get. And that was his answer. So I was like, okay, yeah, that makes sense. 00:35:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I said, the other way is you can go ahead. 00:35:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. The other way is you can look at expanding is you partner with a doctor, wipe your name off of it. Like you have to start his a clinic for him or her. You'd have to, you know, run his practice. They would have to pay you secretly, not secretly, but like pay you as a different company. You could do it that way. he said, know, in that way you would avoid your name getting on all these insurances, as long as you were just literally their manager or something. 00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) consultant. 00:36:01 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, like a consultant. So I mean, I've thought about doing that. We actually tried, Mark and I actually tried to do this for Arizona for a nurse practitioner. But when we were going through it, there was a lot of issues with how I was going to get paid as her manager that I just didn't feel safe about. And Mark was like, yeah, this is, this is no point out. 00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, what if you did it as a consultant or like an equity partner in a business that I don't know how you could do that as a, you know, is if the doctor can be a business and like a corporation, I have no idea how that would work. But I would ask and I would probably be somebody around tax law, a tax attorney that you might, sorry, oh wait, I got to change that time because I A tax attorney to corporate tax attorney, actually, because structure would be important. And then probably a contract law attorney to figure out what is the best way to protect your money and make sure you get paid. 00:37:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. It was actually, I actually have a malpractice attorney and it was actually a kickback issue with the payment. Not so much corporate because Mark and I could figure that part out, but it was the, it was getting around the kickback law for physician providers. We couldn't transfer that money to me. 00:37:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's why I'm talking about talking to a corporate attorney because the structure will make all the difference. Now, being in medicine, I don't know what structures are available to you, but if you're not, the doctor, if you're just a structural advisor, right, you're saying this is how to set up your business, this is how to run it, this is how to market, this is how to all these things, right? If you're just advising, but you're basically like, I've got the cookie cutter plan, I can't go expand this, why don't you do this and I'll guide you through it. But for a fee, and that way, you avoid learning all the things that I had to learn and whatever. 00:38:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. so it's kind of like, oh, it was that fee, what you just said, that was it. But yeah, I mean, I could take a look again, it was that it was that exactly that fee, because to make it worth it, I was trying to get a certain dollar amount. And to my malpractice attorney, that was like, if anyone looks like this, this is an absolute kickback. And I was like, yeah, I don't know. 00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, because you're a doctor, they're maybe no way around that. 00:39:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, so anyway, that was that simple. The simplest way, Mark, and I thought we could expand this. just it became not simple with the fee structure we had to set up. But yeah, I mean, maybe looking at asking like a different question about like if it's about the corporate structure. But at the day, it came back to how am I getting paid. How is the how is that company getting paid as a fee? And the line was really blurred about. 00:39:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If you are a marketer, if you had a company and it was a medical marketing agency per site, and your role is marketing technically on paper, but it's a little bit more advising than that. I mean, they can play they can pay a marketing agency. You can And, you know, your agreement could be, here's our invoice, whatever. I don't know, you'd have, but I would, I would talk to somebody creative about structure, who knows the law, especially for you as a doctor, because you have different rules you have to play by. 00:40:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. Well, you know, next meeting, I'll bring back what my malpractice attorney said, and I guess we could take look at what that would look like, because it's not about, to me, it's not about the structure. It's about what's safe for my license and getting paid the fee. So I could show you what the malpractice attorney said, like we're safe structures. And from there, we could see if it's worth exploring the structure, maybe. 00:40:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, because I didn't even know he gave you ideas about what were safe structures. 00:40:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. Well, it wasn't structures. was about how we can arrange the fees. Like, how am I going to get money from the. the doctor. Yeah, back to me because I'm not doing this for free and I'm not going to. 00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we did the effective hourly rate calculations, right? And your time for QME was between 25 and 36. No, it was one on the second. Where were those numbers? I feel like there's like, what is that document? What was it? I did it, right? Did we put it in your time sheet homework? 00:41:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. Do you have cough? 00:41:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll find it. Because I remember that July ended up being more than you thought it was and more than five hundred and I think that was Q&E and I think July ended up being like three thousand sixty six or something like that. 00:42:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah that's probably based on my our estimates though on the real numbers right now I don't think it's making any more close to that. 00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah I would agree the more that I've seen. Gosh dang it where is that? Let see if it's in my notes here. Just scroll down. It is not in those notes. Where the heck did we... Put it, I wonder if it was in one of your docs, like that you own, not in these. 00:43:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. We just did an app calculation. don't know if we actually wrote it. 00:43:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) might be an units, the phantom notes, though. Adam, yeah. Um, I'll go find that. So, but let's say your effective hourly rate, we'll just call it 2000 for right now. If you got a $2,000 an hour, roughly. Um, on a second, let's just do more paper napkin math, 2000 times 20 times four. I was saying, like, if you were 20 hours a week in $20,000 to be $160,000. Which. It's not going to get us where we want to go. So that's the kind of reverse engineering that we want to do, too. I don't want to. 00:44:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. Someday, July. hope July Medical will be that, right? I mean, I don't even work 20 hours, but someday I hope that that's what July makes. 00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's about 160 a month. But how, well, okay, never mind, because we just haven't gotten to the payouts yet. So that's a big part of it while you do that. So what I would like to see, I do want to have gross and net revenue in this clinic's volume for the month, even though it's not corollary to that particular month, we're just watching everything grow over time, if that makes sense. So because you only started in April and we're looking at roughly 12 to 18 months for payouts. So, just seeing how that number stacks up over time while we're looking at this, knowing you've almost hit the ceiling for how many referrals, right? 00:45:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's 400 referrals a month, right? Probably more the visit, the visit count. 00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That makes sense. Okay, so total visits. High for visits. 00:45:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, Mark said I could probably push to 500, but he said I'd be careful any higher than that. Why is it 400? careful and higher than 400. 00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, again, we're right around the threshold. 00:45:41 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, we're right there. 00:45:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, let's just do it now. Let's do this. I'm going to. 00:45:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. This was part of the reason Mark was like, you know, you can pick and cherry pick the cases that pay you more, right? I stopped taking dog bites. I stopped taking dog I slipped in fall cases where people fell in Walmart, know, and now I'm just taking car collisions because I can, which is... 00:46:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why? Oh, comments only. I can't edit this. 00:46:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, I can take that off. Okay. Oh, the reason I didn't want to put the money on here was because this is shared with my manager at all. And I don't want him to see how much we're making. But what I could do is I could just mirror this chart onto a separate one for just you and I, and then we can consolidate all the data. 00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's do that. 00:46:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. Let's just duplicate it. Okay, I'll do that. Can you send me a reminder email about my homework? 00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I didn't get one last week, so I was talking about what I needed to do. Yep, I will. 00:46:51 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, because I remember last week I asked you what you remember and I didn't send it to you, but I will do that because it... 00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's just go ahead and do this. you mind if I make it? No, you make the copy because then you're the owner and then share it with me. 00:47:12 - Fujinaka, M.D. Let's go ahead and put this number in real quick. 00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because we've only got 10 minutes left yet anyway. And really, like I said, the next few weeks, it's going to be all about the numbers. 00:47:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. All right. Oh, and then while I'm making this, if you want to look at that. The homework sheet on the tab. I put in my recruitment fees. It's the Google sheet where you had me make a tab for each of my business streams of income. 00:47:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:48:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I put in all the amounts of money that comes in. 00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. So what I had asked for that also is a description. And I know that this is what you're talking about wanting to email a description of how that money comes in. Like where does it come from? What do you have to do for it? 00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. I put it. I put a little bit on the top. 00:48:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know how to do that? Oh, it's down at the bottom. Hold on. Let me scroll. This company. You said what you need to do and what you can do, but not really how it came to you. 00:48:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Yeah. Okay. 00:48:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So this is what I'm going to do here. 00:49:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. That I literally don't do anything for. It just pops into my bank account. 00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How? I put a little box in there for you. To populate. Okay. Did you. Duplicate that and share it. 00:50:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I'm right now. 00:50:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I won't talk to me to rule them all. 00:50:24 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, import range. That's what it is. OK. 00:50:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know you could have just made a copy. 00:50:34 - Fujinaka, M.D. No, I want it to when I want my manager to update this clinic volume ML data and then have it real time update. 00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, you mean Mark's farm. 00:50:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. Good job. 00:51:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because what we're going to be doing, and I know I've explained it, but is figuring out, so I'm going to create a tab that's going to have a calculation from all of these, from QME, July, test prep, medical company, physical recruitment, then a little formula that's like, so here was last year's gross revenue, and that revenue, because we want to at least not decrease the profit margins, right? But what we're going to do is figure out, Throughout what percentage of increase across each of these will get us to 2x without significantly impacting time. And so it'll be a bunch of like playing with different numbers for a while and seeing which one gets us there the fastest and which one gets us there the easiest and then kind of finding a blend between the two. My path is always whatever the fastest path the cache is where it intersects with the fastest path of freedom which means less work, right? That's where you have the most leveraged and optimized opportunity. So all of these numbers is what helps us pinpoint that spot that like it map out our navigational system. This is where we're going and why because it's the safest like easiest. Most leverage route. 00:53:12 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, that's about anyone with like this. Oh . Well, play around with it. I don't remember how I did it last time. goes. Okay. All right. So on this, I will consolidate all the financials so we can see it prettily. 00:53:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. 00:53:51 - Fujinaka, M.D. All right. 00:53:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I will take a few minutes to just go back over the notes from. Last week and this week and summarize that and put that in an email for you to make sure that we're on track, but, but this is it really organizing the data across the boards so that we can analyze the data across the board very quickly and simply. So that we can go look for the most leveraged opportunities and then take action. 00:54:24 - Fujinaka, M.D. That was a good. 00:54:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, do you have any other questions, thoughts, things? Nope. Okay. 00:54:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. Ready to do it. 00:54:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's do it. All right. Do you have a great week is great talking to you always. Thanks. you Bye. Bye. michaelfujinaka@gmail.comTina MarieFuji/Tina Coaching
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm trying to get myself this, stabilized real quick. Sorry. Sorry. How do you say? 00:00:32 - mark sweet (3) Dan, how was college? 00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:00:36 - mark sweet (3) You're about college. 00:00:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well, wasn't great. I mean, wasn't until that final moment. 00:00:47 - mark sweet (3) Oh. 00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And then Denise completely, which she was doing so good. And then at the last moment, she just lost her ship. And Denise is like her friend. It's very very empathetic. 00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're like, oh God. She's wearing it all over her face So and like so she's hugging Evelyn. 00:01:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) She backs up. It's all over her face Then she just totally just starts bawling and Evelyn she broke Evelyn Evelyn starts crying like and I was like, oh God now I'm gonna start right like I thought I was gonna get out clean And then Evelyn was like do you need another hug and then they hug again and then Denise was like sobbing at that point I'm like, oh Jesus Christ I Then we go we get in the car and she's like Just breaking down in the car. Like in the passenger seat saying all kinds of I'm like, I'm not gonna repeat some of it, but I'm like, okay Like all right, but one of the lines was like so that's it You do all this work and then she thrust her hands out here. You just hand them over and I'm like, oh boy Like I'm not sure that's exactly I can what's happening here, but I guess in a way, it's what's happening. And then now we're in the aftermath. There's already been one episode today where she comes in crying and she goes, it's fall. I go, okay, I'm not sure where this is headed. It's fall. She'll never get to eat pumpkin pancakes. 00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm like, what? 00:02:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Like, oh, you're pumpkin pancakes. This is true. I'm like, okay. And then that whole thing. So I'm like, oh, boy, I talked to some of friends that just did this. And they're like, oh, you're going to get a month at least. Okay. 00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, it's going to be all year. It's going to be all the things that you did traditionally. And they're not the same. 00:02:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well, apparently this hard core, like just random crying and what like, and they're like, it sort of dissipates in that. But yeah, then it's going to be the thing. Yeah, it's going to be Halloween and it's going to be whatever. And then Evelyn's like, she's no help. 00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Here's the thing. No. 00:03:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) She's very much like me. And when my parents dropped me off to college and they were driving away, I guess, I think my mom was upset, right? And she turned to my dad and said, you know he's never coming home again. And my dad's like, what are you talking about? She's like, he's never going to come home again. And I never did. So she knew, whereas with my brother and sister, she did not say that. And she's like, you, I knew, I knew you weren't coming back. And I never moved home again. Evelyn's already talking like that. Like in Evelyn's mind, she's not coming home next time, or in Denise's like, what are you talking about? Of course you're coming over the summer. I like, oh, not everyone does. Just enough why I was that kid. Were you the oldest? 00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I went through that during the pandemic and perimenopause, and I got COVID the first time. Before we knew what that was. That was fun, that was fun. 00:04:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm still not better yet. But I'm sure this is just a flon, and make a frickin' hot flash. 00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I know. Now I get to live with someone with that too, so it's... 00:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Enjoy it, Dan. 00:04:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) it. Not new to me. 00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) to Mark, maybe. 00:04:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Mark's got like 10 years, probably, for what happens, but, cuz I don't Yeah. 00:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So, leads. Yeah, I wanted to look at LiveFi, actually. Did you talk to Monkey? 00:05:01 - mark sweet (3) That's it. Everyone. 00:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And. 00:05:04 - mark sweet (3) They're all working on it. But generally speaking, when I get on them, something happens. 00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I'm not just that. Arizona is. of helping us a lot for sure. 00:05:23 - mark sweet (3) I needed to because last month it was down. 00:05:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. Okay. And then you just, oh, there it is. 63 and we're at. The 23rd. 00:05:34 - mark sweet (3) Yeah. So last week kind of just. Felt apart little bit. 00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And. Anything else standing out to you. So. So. You. Avoid this. Let me talk about it a lot, paying attention more to intake, oh I swear, I could just turn on the air conditioning, like over power, just drop the temperature of 15 degrees, it's not even hot, it's 5 degrees cooler than it normally is, I'm freaking dying, you're lucky you're meant, that's all I'm saying. Anyway, that was the first time I'd ever thought about like dispersing the burden across the attorneys, but I also think that the insight, even though I'm sure they'll be annoyed, some people more than others, but having them randomly listen to five, and maybe not randomly, maybe strategically if we identify them first, but listen to intake calls so that we can get some other feedback about how they're doing and what they might be doing better. It's not about picking on intake, it's leveraging intake. It's that they are the front line of the entire business and they get very little attention on what they're doing. We should be listening to intake calls. 00:07:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It shouldn't be random. It should be five calls, five person, five random calls per person. 00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, and we should be having the attorneys help with that. So they listen to five across the board and maybe we rotate it. Maybe one attorney listens to one person on intake one month another the next month and they're all assigned different people so that they're all getting feedback from each of the attorneys every month and it isn't so much about the intake person but the intake process. process. The framing is going to matter about, you know, how offended or egotistical people get. The framing matters. But instead of you being the one to do all of it, and you should be doing some of it, we really should be inspecting the intake process much more. It's just too important. And we've been talking about it for so long. There's so little that you can fix for sure. But if we're using multiple different brains as well as time, to look at it, we have the better likelihood of coming across something where we're like, oh, no, but I notice this happens rather consistently or fairly inconsistently, this should be changed. 00:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh, not to be a dick, but the attorneys would be useless in this arena. Um, it'd be like a total waste of their time. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How? 00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) As you listen to the intake calls, it's the the factor of intake to me is going to just be purely are they following the script? Because if they aren't, that's the problem, right? And so the attorneys can't, they have nothing to offer, right? the goal of intake is to extract the right information to say this needs to move towards a retainer. And that's like a checklist. And it's like, were you in an accident? Yes, were you at fault? Yes, call over, like for the most part, right? That's where you're in accident. 00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Fixing the script. So if they notice that the call is going a particular way, and they're going, okay, well, I would have needed to know this or needed to know that, then they can help them for the script. 00:09:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) The attorneys don't get to choose what they get to know, right? It's like a fact pattern. 00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The present or not? about some of the cases that they're dealing with. And I don't know, I don't know, damn, this is that. 00:10:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well, tell me what, tell me what your, I don't know why you're saying this, right? 00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) you have a question about some of the cases that they've got and some of the cases that they lost and they got subbed out on, they're like, we shouldn't ever have this case to begin with. So I don't know how often that comes up, but it's enough that I've heard it a few times and I wonder what could have been done to prevent taking that case in the first place. It came through intake. Was there anything in the process that could have been identified? So I, knowing that we don't know what we don't know and wondering what kind of insight would we get if they spent just five calls a month each one for a year, what would we learn? I can't see how we don't learn anything valuable. 00:10:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I would say go back to the subouts in the process. the these case go identify these cases and be like oh whatever these are the suburbs what was the reason these are the ones that we lost whatever lost means right now obviously not lost the case because these don't over trial but and then what was the reason and then are there patterns in those reasons if there are it's fixable but if they just happen to be and they could be because I don't know the volume of sub-ops and the volumes of this other category but if they just happen they just be these one-off scenarios like and to be honest I could back me up here or not most of the reason the bad cases get through is because they've been lied to and then it's like oh that turned out to not be true you I mean I see the intake notes then you find out after the fact oh no they were actually at fault and they were deemed at fault by the police but in the intake they don't say and then when it goes to the right before they sign the retainer also the comes out. Oh, yeah, no, the cops did show up. I was at fault. And it's like, okay, so you just wasted our time. So some get caught in advance. And I think some leak through. And it's because the people are, I think some are lying. And I think some are just not totally, you know, no one's ever been in a car accident. So they're not communicating things correctly. And you see it also with the leads, right? So many leads come in and say, do you have an attorney? No, not only did they have an attorney, they already said or settled their case. The intake is doing calls where it's like the case is settled. So what how does that because they lie in the form? They think that they can get a better result. They think that they can sue again. Like, I don't know, but now they can like, it's, I feel like you should dedicate someone to. like not mark, like get someone, I don't know if you can hire someone outside to do this, but to like just put themselves on this and say, hey, I want you to make sure this is your only job. I want you to make sure that they're following the script, and this is how you're going to do it, you're going to listen to these calls. I mean, in theory, you could listen to the calls, transcribe them, run them to through chat GPT, have chat GPT know what the script is, and be like, is what was wrong with this, whatever, but just because it's about introducing consistency. I guarantee you, they're not consistent with these in the script. I guarantee you, because to get people to adopt those, they fall into old habits, right? The old habit is sweet love, how can I help you? And then instead of just being like thing bang boom. 00:13:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, also you can put something. 00:13:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right, that was, I was going to say that you're on Pepsi. 00:13:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So who's the best place now? 00:14:03 - mark sweet (3) It's split between two people, Mia and Maria. So Mia is doing the, do we take this case, not take this case, Maria is making sure the file is correct before it gets converted over the goods. 00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I think you could put something in the script that says, just so you know, I want to make sure that that you're aware, if the case has already been blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever, that will be discovered and we will not be able to help you like just make a disclaimer, just basically let them know you're wasting your time if you're lying about this, this or this, but you don't say it that way. You just say, just so you know, this happens. This is how it gets discovered. Nothing can be happened and you may be receive a bill for our time that whatever just skirts up. You can't. 00:14:59 - mark sweet (3) No. We really. 00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) really can't because of how we're built because of contingency fee I completely totally get what we're saying because right now there's zero repercussions that I'm just glad I'm lying to us but that's unfortunate part of our business okay and I completely agree with you I would love to sense these people who waste our time about them well at the very least for sure we should be listen look any call center with their whole job and their business is calls which yours is still this call will record it for quality assurance and people are actually listening to the calls evaluating them and then coaching them we don't do that it needs to happen that needs to happen that's what it should be someone that does that well it's not going to happen unless Martin makes it happen 00:16:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I'm like, I'm wondering if you can hire someone to do this, someone probably does this. Yeah. Look into it. 00:16:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But is it not more cost-effective to train somebody in-house to do it? 00:16:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, because they don't know how to do it. It's like you get them on the script and then you hand it over to someone in-house, right? you get to the expert, like, hey, help me get to some place. 00:16:27 - mark sweet (3) The ones for this, because the attorneys want everything perfect when it comes in. So they would say no to several of these cases that turn out to be just fine, because not everything is perfect, because they're not. I'm going say salespeople for lack of better term. Okay. would be some of the worst ones to do this. 00:16:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) The other bit is we need this thing that I'm sending to Stacy, because as I'm doing it now, I'm going to fill in like 12 more records and then send it to her. But it's this absurdly analysis. So I wanted to see, like, I want to go back. to them and say, okay, here's what happened from our purview or our perspective. Is that so they're unable to contact, right? For whatever reason, that's one of our things. So our contact rate, if it's unable to contact it, that means we never were able to get in touch with them. So they're like, this is our, so our contact rate is everything other than that. Well, it's whatever it is, 80% and whatever. How does that compare with your other problems? And then we're the only ones giving them turn-down reasons. In my argument to them is, hey, turn down for no injury. That's not, that was never a lead. If there's no injury, there's no lead. So your no injuries are this percent, your no insurance are this percent, your already have an attorney, which they got those, or this percent. And give them that breakdown and say, this is why, so, and it will hopefully reveal math, For us it says this is how this would work you would need to give us Less of these and more of those whatever they are and like maybe they can modify their form I don't know. I don't know what they can or cannot do or it's just that The their business is predicated on their customers not really knowing their numbers, which is what I believe is true But well of math on that then it would be then this math will break down or whatever you want to do it Can then be applied to monkey which I want to do I want to do a side-by-side between them ago This is our number one vendor and either their numbers are gonna be their numbers are gonna have to be different I just don't know in what way. I don't know if they were theirs are gonna be have higher contact rate I don't know where they're gonna differ, but they're gonna differ and then we get this side-by-side view But then you could use this as part of like an early warning system, right? could then see hey Here and I don't know I could send you a little to Josh about this this. I would love it if I could build something solidify and be like, hey, dude, if this is off trend, make it red. If this is on trend, make it green. I don't know if it has that capability, or it'll just be a matter of knowing the numbers. But you would look at monkey and say, okay, monkey for the month is that X amount of leaves, that's on point, right? on track. But then you can look at the breakdown of the turn down reasons and be like, okay, that's off. This number is already, whatever it is, this number is already starting to look wrong. Their contact rate is wrong. So if the contact rate is wrong, then you could go look at intake potentially. If the attorney already represented is higher, then that's a lead quality issue. And you can point that out to them or whatever. And then conceivably, you just build this on track lead dashboard that gives you this insight into each vendor on those. So on that sort of for the top level and then sub-level. And then hopefully Josh can go back. Because then you would, like, would you have seen last week coming? 00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know, Mark? 00:20:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Like, that is the question about last week. What went wrong? Right? Well, I don't know if it was intake. I don't know, was it just lead volume? Was it another internal metric inside of lead, like this is what I was just talking about? We don't really know. 00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, Mark. 00:20:49 - mark sweet (3) No, I'm here. I'm just looking at the lead volume, because it doesn't look like the volume dropped off. 00:20:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right. Right, not them. 00:20:58 - mark sweet (3) Right. 00:21:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's like, I was looking at something for someone else today, just randomly, and I looked at one thing and I said something's broken, and it's not something that we track, but I just looked at this one thing, I looked at the sort of the brief history that I had. I was like, hmm, this should have happened more times than it has since that last time. Like we need to look into this because something is broken somewhere, but it's not a metric we track. It's not something that doesn't really matter matter, but it was like, oh, we could have been alerted to this because it broke in March, as far as I can tell. Six months later, we're realizing something might be broken. 00:21:52 - mark sweet (3) No, I mean, when I'm looking through it, know, Walker's based on pay his website is just more what it's at. Life's is the one that's just 00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Massively different which is no they're done. They're not paying them right now. 00:22:04 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, so yeah That's a huge difference volume wise, but it wasn't like you were signing up a lot from them. Yeah The monkeys the only other glaring number along with fully bay who's 16 off but 16 off with another week in apt to go is not Take us per se Blue steel seems to be pretty much exactly where they're supposed to be. So really the only gigantic difference is monkey But it's not volume it's gotta be it's something Looks to be relatively the only thing that's different because comparing in three weeks versus four plus weeks Yeah, right so that's my point right there. 00:22:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's like oh, it's something Internal it's something within those leads if not volume there for some sub level So it's going to be re-type or contact grade or something. 00:23:11 - mark sweet (3) And then for whatever reason, he's going back through a lot of what I don't know why I just ran away. So he used to use way back in the day to do leads. 00:23:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They're sending into a long way? 00:23:31 - mark sweet (3) Getting notifications that there's a new lead. So take through a lot of what I learned. 00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Are you really far from your mind? Because you're so quiet. And if I turn it up any louder again, it's going to blast my hair down. 00:23:49 - mark sweet (3) But I don't think it's him. No, it's me. 00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because I have a sore throat. I'm trying not to yell. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'll trade you my hot flash for a sore throat. I'm I use my song. Okay, anyway, so what I mean. Is there an issue with them doing that? what what is the is there a concern with them doing that? 00:24:24 - mark sweet (3) Oh, yeah clients getting texted on multiple You know numbers emails whatever. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, so when did you notice that? Have you addressed it? 00:24:36 - mark sweet (3) Uh, it just happened starting Friday, so it's still brand new so I'm trying to figure out why. Okay Okay I have a feeling because they just had a quote unquote AI to what they do 00:25:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Of course, I could hold it. 00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Dan, Josh's report, because we're at the end of the month now for, I think it was cost of lead by source by state. 00:25:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You'd have to ask Stacy. 00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Gosh, okay. Email Stacy. Stacy. Oops, that's all caps. I'm not yelling at Stacy. 00:25:37 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, it's not y'all Stacy. 00:25:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. This is awesome. Thank you. Okay, emailed Stacy, I wanted to look at I'm trying to remember through the devil, I'm just going to back a monkey. Why? 00:26:29 - mark sweet (3) Because we have another bar that came on board, so we're trying to scale should be back to normal next month. 00:26:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) What? What? How does that mean going to law reward? 00:26:41 - mark sweet (3) No, no, no. Why the monkey leads are low. 00:26:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, so we got new business, so screw you, you have to wait. 00:26:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, they're probably, yeah, they're probably siphoning off leaves to the other dude to keep him happy. and sorry Mark yeah so we're gonna screw our long-term customer that sounds like business forward like forward whatever you're getting to Eric and we'll see if he can he's not breaking he can but I don't understand why they go to her lower lower again yeah I have a feeling it's a law ruler as she was I want to is it your law ruler it's theirs right no mine okay do we have access to that I don't even know I don't think we're do in class here We can probably kill it then. 00:28:03 - mark sweet (3) Uh, yeah, my guess is. The sweet monkey email is the reason why. 00:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) All right, we'll get rid of. 00:28:23 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, because we've got that sweet monkey. Yeah, provide that. 00:28:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, that's, uh, is that. 00:28:30 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, but if we can just kill that going to. 00:28:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You. 00:28:37 - mark sweet (3) I think we're really, but yeah. 00:28:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. Yeah, because I I'm texting Eric right now. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 00:29:00 - mark sweet (3) Well, unfortunately that explains that, but that does suck for us. 00:29:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:29:10 - mark sweet (3) So again, another reason why we can't build things around only one or two or three. 00:29:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And you haven't. It would be a totally different story. This was in back in the day. 00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:29:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You'd be like devastated. 00:29:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Eight cases in Missouri. Eight returns to Missouri that we're not set down on. So far. Well. And goodness for that so far. Anyway, how. So we have one doctor source there. Is that right? Right. Like referral partner. 00:29:58 - mark sweet (3) Sorry. Sorry. 00:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm a. Yeah. I'm Oh, I'm not getting done to referrals. Right. That you're just getting leads from who? 00:30:10 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, paying a crap ton of money for leads and not getting anything back from doctors. 00:30:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Okay. Okay. And do we know what the cost of the leads are from Missouri. Not the leads, the retainers. 00:30:28 - mark sweet (3) A lot. I'll tell you the exact amount in a second, but it's more than I would like. 00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, it's always more than you would like. just want to know how bad it is. 00:30:39 - mark sweet (3) Yeah. Let's look at what it is for the year. 00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, you look that up. 00:30:58 - mark sweet (3) I am gonna go get a drink. ours on Missouri lead so far. 00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many of your chairs have we got? I'm actually in here. can get that really quick. Um, Missouri. Run. No, I can't be right. No, that's Arizona. must want to clear to Arizona. Exactly right. 00:31:31 - mark sweet (3) Wanting to. 00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. Well, I mean, that's average. 4500. 00:31:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And if those sub-outs didn't happen, it actually would have been pretty good, right? 00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:31:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And the sub-out issue, we believe, has been resolved thanks to moving off of the queue with those. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many were we said that wrong? 00:32:07 - mark sweet (3) Sorry. Can you repeat this one more time? 00:32:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Repeat which one more time? Either you or Dan, there were two different. So I asked how many were we said that on in Missouri? 00:32:32 - mark sweet (3) I might keep dropped and summed up this. 00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm going to say it was six. 00:32:44 - mark sweet (3) Sound inaccurate. 00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, the total records are twenty eight and you said we have twenty two. 00:32:51 - mark sweet (3) Six. 00:32:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So if we hadn't been subbed out, then the retainer costs, yeah, would be. 35, 35, 35. So that everything is more than you want to pay, but that's within that realm of acceptable costs. And it's less expensive than some other states, depending on what lead it is, what lead source. 00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right. It's it's fair with in a blended capacity. And then in a place where we don't know the average value of Missouri, which it could be like a Washington or right in Arizona. But blended 3500s in the strike zone. 00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I'll say again, why we want to know these numbers rather than how we feel it is, because your feelings about particular things tend to be the where that comes in mind is pessimistic. But and not that that's necessary bad. but to the point where you get frustrated and you think that it's not the thing to be growing or nurturing or potentially wanting to pull back from, but there's nothing that indicates that I can see right now that Missouri is anything but helpful at the moment, even though it may simultaneously be a pain in the . 00:34:19 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, I apologize, that number is low. 00:34:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's more than anything. I was waiting for this. 00:34:27 - mark sweet (3) Nice. Just Walker. part of the problem is when we do, like, lose steel and just pay 10 grand and they just give us the leads. So yeah, that was lose steel was like two or three of them. I'm confused. Sorry, lose steel's quantified. All right, I get that but what what I'm saying is in the $3,000 numbers low Because all of them you mean it's not right Like it's lower than what it really is Like Valiant which signed up six of these we just get a bill at the end of the month. It's not broken down. 00:35:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, okay I spent $93,000 on 11 cases Okay, well, that's very different Very very very different. That's twice as expensive two Rolex ones I Don't exactly know we spent up three Valiant ones we got pulled into everything else This is where the Josh Dab That becomes a play right yeah, because everything needs to be untangled so we can measure it accurately Otherwise, there's no point in measuring it at all not doing any good so um well let's see yeah so yeah okay we'll wait for Stacy to get back to us and let us know how that goes because we definitely need to have that information um three hundred or well nine grand i guess um is not great no it's terrible um but it's also not even the most expensive like there was a point a couple few months ago i don't remember what it was but one source one state was roughly ten thousand dollars and it was terrible so i feel like it was walker somewhere but i don't remember where it was Arizona that's why you could do that them i don't remember You know what, I mix things up together sometimes. Oh, let's see. Oh, okay Dan, so where's your valent replication effort going? 00:37:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They would not, we're still in my accounts. don't know what black hole that went into, but the black hole is deep. I literally, I think they removed them. I can no longer find the accounts. I was like, wait a minute. I purposefully, these were here the other day, now I cannot find them in any of my accounts. all gone. So I had two, well there were two, they're gone. So I'm going to just open a new account today, and hopefully they'll, I don't think they tie things to domains. I think they used to. But they weren't. Well, we'll find out. I should be, oh well, I'll use the domain I've never used. And then I can run ads on the domains. So I have car accident settlement quote which is the one I really want to use so opening account based on that name and then I'll run ads for car accident settlement whatever the other one is I'll run ads for both actually so I'm just opening into the company today and just running the ads there we take a two-minute break yeah I will get a drink you 00:40:09 - mark sweet (3) Okay, sorry, I'm back because it's not, it's just really, really, really got to be, amen. 00:40:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, had to get a drink, so, okay. Um, where are we at? Oh, okay, so you're going to get a new domain, get the ads going. It takes so long. But I'm glad that we at least have that going by. So, Walker 13. Did you talk to Walker at all? 00:40:52 - mark sweet (3) No, Walker, I haven't been giving as much money to, because they're just. 00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They really tell me. Every week, and I forget because I'm just like, they should be doing it better. Um, do we have any other lead vendor sources on the radar that we can be reaching out to? 00:41:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I haven't come across a new vendor. Period. I'm going to add for them. Like nobody. I'm sitting in vendor and I'll spend a minute in a lot of recycled people. 00:41:29 - mark sweet (3) Yeah. Um, so they rebrand themselves like how it's legal now or something. 00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's so sad. Um, it is. 00:41:45 - mark sweet (3) mean, that's just three. I thought it just is. I'm talking to Tom with California marketing group. Um, when I get back from my trip, sometimes. See what they might be able to do. Yeah, if monkey hadn't dropped their volume they did, you would still probably be a little bit behind, but not as bad. 00:42:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:42:17 - mark sweet (3) I mean, even still, I mean, we're still on pace to do about 80 plus. 00:42:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, it's nice to hear you frame it that way. 00:42:27 - mark sweet (3) Just is what it is, like, yeah. 00:42:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is there anything that we are not fully leveraging or could somehow leverage more in terms of some of the other, like, don't know, doctor referrals, we can't, employer referrals, returning clients, blue still, what, what are the. Deaf blogs. That's news, right? 00:43:02 - mark sweet (3) They randomly picked up over the last five days. We got a bunch of submission over the last five days and it's been really quiet since before she's in there. 00:43:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So where has Google Mona Business been this month? 00:43:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) When you met, usually it stays the same. if it looks all, either something broken, is there something broken or right? We don't remember. It's off in which metric, which metric you're talking about. 00:43:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know. We normally have some retainers from there and we don't have any this month at all. 00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So the trackings off, right? So either the lead tracking is broken and therefore the retainers aren't going to track back to leads or something else is wrong. So you're saying the retainer metric is the one that you're looking at the throng, but then upstream it sounds like the leads metric is wrong too. So I don't know, we'd have to look after looking at that. That would have that would have appeared on an on track health track dashboard as well. 00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so is that for you, that you won't that Dan? 00:44:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I mean, I don't even know. I imagine it went sideways before right now. We just didn't go to it. 00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, let me look at. July, we had one GMB at the end of the month, August, I mean, generally GMB is not super high volume. 00:45:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, no, but it's usually good for one to two long. Well, we would really know the average. 00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We got none in August either. And we had one in July. So letify leads by state by source that cannot possibly be right. Shows four leads. 00:46:00 - mark sweet (3) I'm wondering if you need your help with, because I know people working on that with Missouri GMB. 00:46:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yes, so that Isaac is talking about, so they told Isaac, I think on Thursday or Friday, that the Regis office type that you have is not going to get approved. That you need this other level they sent it to him. they said there's something specifically that it's the way. So they're like, it is, this lower office type doesn't get a name on the medallion or whatever the hell it's called downstairs. And you have to have that, and then they have to have a picture of that to send to Google and say, yes, they're out of this address. So Isaac said he was going to work on upgrading, and I think through you, then post upgrade, he was going to try to get someone from Regis to take up the other one and send it to him. 00:47:00 - mark sweet (3) I did not know that, so that's good for me to know. 00:47:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yep. Yeah. Oh, that's why I got died. 00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry. Is GMB, what is it called? What's does it have a name code name? 00:47:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No. 00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's just GMB. 00:47:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:47:17 - mark sweet (3) But I'm not even talking about it. Did necessarily generate business in Missouri. Obviously want that. But right now you Google. 00:47:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:47:27 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, I'm glad you're closed. And there's nothing there. 00:47:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:47:36 - mark sweet (3) So we need to start building out. 00:47:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And that's what this, whoever was using against you. 00:47:42 - mark sweet (3) For sure. And I understand it too. I sign with the firm, I'm googling and I find things in other states, nothing there. 00:47:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Can this. So yeah, he's. I don't know if he needs to talk to you or he has whatever, but that's where it was on. There's a lot of it. 00:48:02 - mark sweet (3) Dan, do we have a Missouri dedicated page on our system? 00:48:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Um, maybe we can make sure we get one up, and maybe do you see what I see what I did? The doing child can just work. 00:48:18 - mark sweet (3) I asked America to find some BS awards, and then we'll make it from Missouri, and we'll spend some money on a PR newswire. So we can at least get that out a little bit. 00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can this be right? 00:48:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) What? 00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is what I see for GMB matters all time. 00:48:41 - mark sweet (3) Probably. 00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:48:47 - mark sweet (3) This is never generating some. 00:48:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I didn't realize it was that little, but okay. 00:48:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Wait. Oh my god. What is it? What's the total? 00:48:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What's What's the the Like nine? 00:49:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, that's not right. 00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll show you. 00:49:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) There's the most who be in California period. 00:49:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So sources, GMB, all matters, all matters, time. Yeah. But it only has three for California. 00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. No, that's not right. And then from there. Because when we were doing this before, and I was evaluating that company, I made sure we checked every month. And every month there was one to two. I was like, okay, that works if they get one to two. And we checked that for like months and months. then finally we were like, okay, we don't need to check this anymore. So that's not right. 00:49:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what's not working correctly then? 00:49:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I have no idea. Like, because when we were checking it, it was correct. uh and they're all super old right the california when they're all there's no twenty twenty four one in california yeah there's no not in twenty that there's only so i mean we yeah something there's something wrong but i don't know i don't i wouldn't tell you i couldn't tell you what's wrong off hand where typically they get missed typically it's a misattribution right so it's like anytime you see a lot of leads from the website it's wrong or i'm sorry a lot of matters in the website retainers it's wrong because the website doesn't really generate them any leads everything that's happening through the website is typically from gmb or news right so just straight or up until fairly recently i would say So, they've got to be getting, somehow they get reclassed in Lidify, but we go into Leeplo. Leeplo is going to be like GMB retainers, and it'll spread out bunch of names, and then if we go, that one will be correct, because they hit Leeplo first, if they call the GMB phone number, that's where the call goes in, it goes in there, and then we say, hey, this is GMB, and then we go try to update it and Lidify, make sure it says GMB. So it could just be that that's not working the way it's supposed to, but the sort of the source of truth for GMB is more Leeplo-y than Lidify, because they originate in Leeplo-y. 00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How would I find them here? 00:51:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You'd have to search for tags. tag being, you have to go to contacts. 00:52:05 - mark sweet (3) Yeah, because I look at total converted since 2021. 00:52:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And you got to filters. 00:52:13 - mark sweet (3) you're just going to need. 00:52:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Now we're on the far right. 00:52:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh, oh yeah. 00:52:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, and then it's going to be like tag search for tag. And that search box on top of the filter and tag equals she and me. Oh, it's not going to be that easy. She can't for every location. 00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You can't do just sources, Jeremy. 00:52:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) That might add my work yet. And then you're going to end a tag. I think it's better. 00:52:52 - mark sweet (3) I don't live in 10 GMEs on the intake side in 2024. 00:53:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Not tag do like I think it's converted. Yeah then I click off the slide out. Oh, and then all right. And converted in here is not so go back to the thing open it and then said retainer do retainer signed on that second one just edit that one don't delete it. Now because I think converted here means that the case is closed. Yeah, this should be. It should pull back way more than that. Just do get rid of the retainer thing and see how many pulls back with that source tag. Yeah, it's not 165, that's still not right, it should be way higher than that, because this goes back to like three years. 00:54:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It only goes back two years ago, here. 00:54:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's not right. So I only know that because we've looked at this endlessly for months. I'm going to have to dig into it and see what's up. 00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Well, I mean, because lead sources are so, it's everything that's lifeblood. think that we should be doing that and just making sure that 100%. 00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Like, that's why the on track off track, this would have flagged up the minute it started going off. But that's my big question for him is like, hey, can I tell you GMB averages, four leads a month, whatever it is, and then use that average to make something red or green, right? be like, hey, this is looking off, I just don't know the answer to so you can let us know. 00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I should have CCD or not emailed to CCD. Okay. Um, D. Did you get proposals for the billboards in New Mexico? 00:55:43 - mark sweet (3) That's one more one time. 00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, okay. 00:55:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Did you come up with a catchy tagline for sweet? Because there's something wrong. 00:55:55 - mark sweet (3) I saw her again. in terms of something more of a rebrand, because we're just going to always have this issue with where you are. 00:56:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sweet James. Yeah. 00:56:11 - mark sweet (3) if I want to pay a bunch of my input on billboards, I'd rather just be something generic. 00:56:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Such as lawyer. 00:56:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, then if you're generic, you're competing with everybody anyway, wouldn't you want to be unique? 00:56:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, generically unique. 00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:56:35 - mark sweet (3) Then when I say generic, mean, like, you know, there's the top dog and the hammer and the falcon and the snowman and whatever else it is. 00:56:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm confused. So you want to be generic and not memorable and put money into that? 00:56:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. How about we use Salko because I'm just spitballing here. It's Salko's face and it says dealing with prick called dick. 00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm he'd sign on to that. Oh my gosh. 00:57:16 - mark sweet (3) So we sure remember we bought Big Check Law, Max Check Law. 00:57:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They are looking for a check. 00:57:27 - mark sweet (3) Turnings of justice, which we have justice. And we do have the Spanish versions of some of these as well. So again, because of the stupid sweet James thing, he's going to end up going to states at some point. 00:57:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh yeah. 00:57:49 - mark sweet (3) So, even if he's not there right now. It's just sitting. It's just massively outspending. 00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So would you rebrand your whole burn? 00:58:03 - mark sweet (3) No, just the advertising side because Works the same reason else seems and almost all this stuff works. 00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mm-hmm. This is true Why are we need to have a Brainstorm access with that then The biggest thing is having a fun over that someone in our vault and a website that you can Type in really easily Just so you know, I'm very good at that. So we should totally do that next week if you haven't got one by then Um, yeah, okay, let's see And he re is the AI demand writer stuff Is that enough on it? 00:59:00 - mark sweet (3) I have a way long for 2,500 bucks. 00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What's that? 00:59:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) What was it? 00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Cowboy? No. 00:59:18 - mark sweet (3) It's who wants a cowboy. 00:59:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) That was the area. 00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Big dog. 00:59:25 - mark sweet (3) Where's our top dog? 00:59:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like cowboy though. Cowboy low. What was the question that they had on the line? Oh, yeah. The AI demand writing stuff. Is that conversation tabled for now or what? 00:59:53 - mark sweet (3) I've sent through two more. They're not good. It's, I've come to the conclusion fairly quickly that they're all relatively the same. They do slightly things differently, but it's, at its heart, summarization. Some have nice chronologies, some donut chronologies. All of it is really just summarization. 01:00:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Just go back to the first guys and like, use it from the perspective of, does this save me time? Like, what benefits can you extract from it? Knowing that the leverage that they have to get a different set of metrics, right? That was the problem with them, like, their metrics were not your metrics. They were like, we can write so many demands. And I was like, why, why would you? Also, they lied. Because when they heard how many you were writing, they're like, that's a lot. Like, didn't you guys say you were writing a hundred a month? 01:00:56 - mark sweet (3) Like, that's more to do. That hadn't more to do with. me and I don't want to say a slight but more dealing with me but they really weren't writing that many um they probably are no because when you said they're like how many do you need you said a hundred fifteen they went whoa that's a lot like you're crushing it it's a slight against me because they have only known me as even kenisys and not many people know exactly who i am like they think i'm just a very small practice oh so you think that they they were surprised that you were getting that many but they probably do right more but i'll say something like they didn't do prelets i'm like how many demands you writing for lip or is that just a requirement you know it's hardly that they're just putting things together for litigation and as you saw they don't really have lawyers yeah yeah so i mean i would use their thing just to see like hey does the do you get good feedback on the chronology? 01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) in the link, you know, whatever, like they said. Does it save time, right? So, and then it's just, it's like, hey, does this save any time and money? Yes or no? Do the lawyers look at it as a benefit? Yes or no? And then it would be, is it worth the time and effort to make my own thing, whether or not it ever gets productized? That's irrelevant. It's like, oh, and then, and also the bit about like, I was saying, you know, two weeks ago, whatever, how good, how much can the demand be manipulated to fit your version up, right? Which it seemed like they said they could do that. And then, do you get a better benefit? Like, can you come up with a better demand? Can you save money, get a better demand and get a better result? And it would more than cover the costs. I think you cover the costs just in time. And then it's like, okay, I'm just, I've just improved my system, you know, not based. It's on the benefits that they're saying. It's the benefits that I was able to extract from it. And then you do a video testimonial for them and say, how awesome it is. 01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We are late for call. 01:03:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) forgot. Okay. Oh, . 01:03:15 - mark sweet (3) We are by. 01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry.

00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi, this is going to say good morning, it's not morning, though. How are you? 00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch Pretty good. How are you? 00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. Got you Patrick in here. 00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Hello. 00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you have your chicken breast for lunch today? 00:00:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I did eat the chicken first today. 00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's the whole thing. 00:00:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) wasn't. It's a bar, so it helps. 00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're Lauren's one of the meetings that was just me and Patrick were talking about having to do one of the exercises that I recommend. And I was like, is there any habit that you have that you do just because you know it's good for you? you really hate it and he's like yeah eating chicken breast and I was like yeah I get that. 00:01:07 - Lorenz Schuerch There's only so many ways you can make chicken breast look taste good and none of them are healthy so. 00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right and then you defeat the purpose of having chicken breast and you're like but spices man learning how to use spices will change the game and the type of cooking that you I've learned that. I also don't have the energy for that so I can't be bothered. All right let's see let me get open my notes. So I have this combined. I do need to have a separate one for you guys. I got way too many times going on. How's your guys this week Ben? 00:01:59 - Lorenz Schuerch Very good. Yeah. Pretty busy. 00:02:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, have we had any contemplation about schedule and organization and goals and since we last spoke? 00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch I mean, yeah, I kind of know I want to organize the teams when I have those absences coming up, come up. But yeah, having one less team member every month, you know, that stresses everyone out. So there's things that are that could have a potential for falling through the cracks. So that's a little stressful, but we're making it happen. 00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK. so trying to think, oh, you sent me. Let me go open your email. Last week it was just you and me, right, Lawrence? 00:03:09 - Lorenz Schuerch Not as you, Patrick. 00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Me and Patrick, okay. I'm just going to tell you right now. I'm still dealing with this early morning seminary and it is not working for me. The opposite is happening. It's not that I just can't get up. I'm waking up at three o'clock in the morning randomly and can't go back to sleep with the crap. I can't. Hey, sorry. 00:03:32 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, my kids go to school on the other side of town. So I have to get up at 5.30, so I feel your pain. 00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Oh my gosh. Wait, this is ridiculous. Okay, open this. So intake. I'm gonna. Dang it. You guys in this Microsoft stuff. Friends, can you please copy the document that you sent me? Anatomy of the case and just put it into an email. And I can. And copy and paste it and put it into a spreadsheet. Because I don't want to deal with trying to log into Microsoft. Actually, I probably can do this. I don't And that was finished with the last time. 00:04:14 - Lorenz Schuerch So you should have next couple of seconds here. 00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Thank you. And where's the one that I was working with Patrick? I have so many sweet ones for the cheese. Surveys. Oh my gosh, I forgot to put the door and those birds are going bonkers. Can you hear that? 00:04:47 - Lorenz Schuerch Yes. 00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) My child has got these two parakeets and they're quiet except for when she's gone. They're like, yeah, we're going to fight. So it's nobody here to tell us to behave. right, waiting for that to come back through again. There we go. All right. the heck did I put the one that you and I were working on? Patrick. I'm going to move over this here. Oh, I forgot how that pastes. We spent the whole time doing that last time through our progress budget. Patrick team tasks. That's what it was. I'm going to paste Lorenz's stuff on a new tab. Actually, let me go look and let it fire real quick. I did it. I have to set a reminder because we have one person that creates these reports for us. I figured out what I can get for you guys as a report that you can look at, but it has to be created. I All right. All right. We'll get everybody set real quick. Okay. Those are so quiet. 00:06:45 - Lorenz Schuerch We're the literally the two quietest guys in the hole for. 00:06:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You were with the light chatty is chatter box ever and then you're just quiet and Mike. I like talking, but I don't. only talking to myself or necessarily listening to myself. I'm just like, feel like I'm monologuing over here. I am monologuing over here. Do you need another teens? Okay, let's take a look at this. What? 30 days, refreshed. I'm 24. So somebody has already looked at this today. Um, dropouts and subouts by team. How many cases do you have right now, Patrick? Because you've got a lot moved over. 00:07:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) 165. 00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, it's about same as I was last week, I think. Um, record count. Let's see. Drop down, set down, total list. I want to look at it by let's see, I know what I'm not supposed to show and that is not in this room. 00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch Why are you not supposed to That's not in your business. 00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, what is it? it to you, why are you asking me? Don't play me like nice stupid geez. You're gonna get one by me. I don't think so! How you met Ronan? 00:08:50 - Lorenz Schuerch The dog? dog? well I've seen him on camera. 00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's so cute. I randomly get Ronan pictures sometimes. It's just probably awesome. Let's see. Where's the report report? That was after that. Now I'm Okay, this is good. I can do this. I can share screen. Okay, so this is just the last 30 days, which we know is a terrible type of snapshot. That's longer. So we're gonna go look at the last 90 days. That would be We. And also, Patrick is still new and it doesn't even have an average case load, normal case load. Okay, average resolution speed by team over the last 90 days, that gap is closing pretty good. So it's a roughly a 15-day gap between you and Samantha Lorenz. I know how Tyler's is faster. I guess he's better than I think that he is. I don't know. 00:10:30 - Lorenz Schuerch I have to work him up as much. 00:10:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, is that necessarily a good thing if it's that? 00:10:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I'm not trying to stir the pop because I just all like things sometimes, but I'm not that good at thinking about things. just blurt. 00:10:49 - Lorenz Schuerch No, but I do agree that faster is one thing if you're getting full policy limits on them, but let's look at that. 00:10:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think closing that on a week. 00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, he's pretty high on that too, but this average fee per attorney, that is much lower and not an issue. Nate doesn't count because he's litigation. Yeah, and then cases closed while again we're going with speed rather than quality. This is really probably the bigger indicator. I mean, this is pretty big getting. I wonder how that even happens if that's just look at the draw, but I don't. This doesn't seem like an accurate correlation. I need to. Let's think, you know, I don't know where my snuffing notes are. I'll just send her an email. The blue is less than 40%, right? 00:12:13 - Lorenz Schuerch My blue is 40%. 00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh! I have the brain. You're right. Good job. Good call. eyes. Good looking out. Okay. Way better. So he's less than that. Okay. That seems more right. Do you guys know how hard it is to find attorneys to hire? It's hard. This is a very long time. Just something to put under your cap. Should you ever need that information that you didn't hear from me? 00:12:52 - Lorenz Schuerch Okay. 00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got a problem on people's. Okay. So anyway. Um. Okay. Um. We will get a version of the report that for sure you can look at and it really should have all of these things just that some things are connected to other things. And, uh, you know, it's an entire business and running a business has different level of responsibility and that information is important. So to the point of like, what is it? Don't worry about it. You want that responsibility. You can open your own practice. It's a lot. It's a lot to run the business. I'll tell you. All right, I'll put some subouts by team. So I wish that this was separated. I really need dropout and subouts because they're very different, right? 00:13:45 - Lorenz Schuerch Right. don't want to hang on to cases for too long, right? If they're not, if you find out that they're not viable. 00:13:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so drop out and then subout means to be separated. And then also validate, you know, it's probably the right correlation for the twice between. Oh, actually, I want, let's see. I need a number. For. Below. 3% and. Above 40% or 4% higher. Save. Okay. Okay. 00:14:52 - Lorenz Schuerch What's other. 00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't know. That's what I need. Wait, where's the other. Oh. Oh. Okay, I don't, I don't know, um, dropouts. And so dropouts, as you got rid of the case, right? You just like, I referred it out, referred out, right? 00:15:17 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah. 00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And stuff out is they went somewhere else. So maybe other is like, it shouldn't have been a retainer in the first place, because they already had an attorney, or the case was closed and it already been settled, and they came in and they were trying to like, do it again to see if they could get better results, because I've heard that that happens, or that they know, because that would be, yeah, is so if they had waited too long, didn't have any insurance, Like, are there different qualifications where you wouldn't refer it out, you just need to go, this is not a viable case? 00:16:07 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, that's when we drop it, you know, like there's no insurance to go after, or there's... 00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, then maybe other is referred out. 00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch Okay. 00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think that those are the three categories, either it's just, it's not a viable case. They went somewhere out, or we referred them out. And we want to track them, because referred out is still some source of revenue, dropped things. wasted time and we wasted money. And so we need to track that, because that's potentially an intake issue. So anyway, which is something that we're also working on. Intake is really, it's a whole different process. And I've been working really hard to try to get more attention onto the intake. Process, because it's not super effective. And I'm saying that because... As you can tell, all of us have work to do. All of us could do things better. We could all be more optimized, like we show up and we get a job done. But the job can always be done better without necessarily like brow beating and trying to be a perfectionist. all the things that we're doing are not really perfectionism type stuff, right? It's not about never make this mistake, never do that, never do this. It's more about sorting the tasks and using the time better and paying attention to specific types of things, prioritizing, valuing, things like that, versus always do this, never do that, blah, that type of thing. So anyway, but if we can improve the intake process, and a good portion of that is the way people show up on the calls, like the clients themselves. So some of them are liars. I don't know a portion of them, some of them liars, but most of them have never been in a car accident before. Don't what to do. So this is a new experience. They don't know you. They don't trust you necessarily, right? And they don't know what they need to communicate to you. So if the questions aren't asked at all, or if they're not asked clearly, you know, there's, there's so much nuance to that. And we've talked about call control, even on the attorney level, when you're dealing with the clients, trying to figure out how to keep a person who's not good at communicating, or not articulate, not focused, not willing. Like your people have to be able to extract specific types of information from people who it may be just really difficult to extract from them because they lack the vocabulary, lack the coherence, they lack the the interest, all of these types of things. So it's not as simple as here's a script, follow this script, and it's going to be perfect every time, because you're like, have you, I mean, I know you have Lorenz, but has anybody ever tried to put clothes on, baby? 00:19:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, it's really hard. 00:19:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's really hard. The baby will do what the baby wants to do. It's not just like, hey, get dressed. let me put your arm in here, put your legs in here. like, no, I don't want to do that. Yeah, it's, it can be like that probably talking to clients like, look, I'm just trying to help you. And they're like, oh, no, don't want to do that. Anyway, yeah. So that's what we're dealing with is we don't have this perfect hygienic, hygienic, what's the word, like, pristine, there's a goal. Yes, something like that, you know. like like Intel has this it's pristine like but that's not the word I'm looking for environment where they make the um the processors but anyway that's just like this this perfect environment that is that works the same every single time so you get the same kind of output every single time that's not what you're dealing with you're dealing with people people at every point a different person at the insurance agency a different doctor a different um client a different person on intake who took the report like there are so many different things that and that can affect how it goes and like you guys we're different people every day so um you've experienced many different versions of Tina so far it's like tired cranky hungry wait that's me all the time maybe I'm gonna say anyway um but but if people are run down if their brains aren't working and optimized there's all kinds of different things go into here. So it doesn't make any sense to say, this is the way to do it every single time, just do this, and you'll get perfect results. you have to do, first of all, is teach everybody to be able to think critically, who you're talking to, what are you dealing with, what do you recognize about the situation that you've come into contact with before, what are the treatments that you can apply, so like if you've got somebody who is hesitant, resistant to share information with you, then one of the things that you want to do is remind them why they're calling in the first place, why you're talking to them in the first place. They've been in a car accident, there's been some injury, and they want to get the help and they don't want to pay for it. The only way they're going to get that outcome is to be able to work with you, and the only way that you can be successful in helping them accomplish that outcome is by telling you what you need to know. But I guarantee you most of the time that conversation isn't had so explicitly. So those are the types of things that we want to be aware of is what are the different ways that we can communicate and operate to get us the best outcome no matter who we're talking to and what the situation is. And in order for you all to learn how to do that and for your teams to learn how to do that through you, you have to be able to learn to evaluate all these moving parts because all of these moving parts have an impact in the overall outcome, which is what your client is interested in, right? So anyway, so now we're looking at these types of things. Let's go ahead and get to zoom on my way. I think it's, it is not that one, it's this one. Okay, so we're on I'm going to show you what Patrick and I were done before we get to your stuff that you shared with me. So, you know what I forgot to do is get a drink. There's nobody in my house to go fetch it for me, food, whatever. Okay, so these are the breakdowns of the types of tasks that Patrick could identify in the case process, which will go and compare to yours. And then I asked him to tell me who does it, and then what we did was we looked at the different stages that these things are in and which things can be done simultaneously, meaning not necessarily like one person doing it, but you don't it's not contingent upon another thing to be accomplished. So, if we're waiting for one thing, we can be working on the other thing. So the introduction call confirming the coverages and liability, liability that over there. Order initial documents such as police reports, hospital records, health insurance liens, sending defendant insurance inquiries, requests for D&B insurance search requests, order policy limits. I'm just going to keep going. Oh, I got to move that. Continuing client medical referrals, whatever, can read the rest of it. So what we found here, so obviously introduction call happens first, right? There's a chronological order to some of these things and a dependency upon previous tasks in some of these. So you can't have this stage, right, until you've had the introduction call. You can't order the initial documents, you're not going to do that until you've confirmed the coverages and liability. And then sending And the defendant, the insurance inquiry request DMV, obviously there's there's some dependencies here. So now what we have here and down here set up for treatment is this whole group of activities that can be done without having to just wait for this to happen or wait for that to happen. So that's good to know because when we're looking at the timeline and we're reviewing the cases and looking at what can be moved forward. Let's say this isn't done or this is done and this is done and this is done, but this isn't. We can be working on these things. So what Patrick and I did last week also is we went into Lidify and looked at just all of the cases that he had open. Now, we only got like two cases in and there was one that hadn't been touched for. Three months and one that hadn't been touched for two months. And so one of them was clearly that person was in treatment and the other one was probably that, but there was a little, there was a question mark about it. But here's the thing, even if we know that they're in treatment, you've got, and this is something I explained to Patrick, you've got a person on the other end who their experience, and this is going to come out in their reviews, and this is going to also impact how they feel when you get to do the distributions conversation. You've got this person depending upon their attorney, and they want to feel like they're cared about, that they're known, that they're remembered, and that they matter, that they're not just a paycheck. So if I don't hear from somebody for six months, three months, you know, I'm like, what's going on with my case? Even if they told me that these are all the things that have to happen, there's something that clicks if somebody's just like, hey, just want to check in on you, want to make sure that your treatments are going well, see if you have any questions, and just let you know just a reminder this is where we're at with the case. There's nothing that we can do until you treatment. And so there's really no need for you to do anything, but just want to let you know that and just want to make sure that everything's okay. Can you imagine what that feels like when your attorney's office calls you like that. Now imagine you're like a lonely old lady that got in a car wreck or a cranky old dude and nobody's cared about you because you grew up hard and there's you know what I mean? Like there's a there's a lot to be said for nurture and concern, and you're already in the habit of talking to people very frequently. That's not a lot of time, especially. If you don't really actually have to ask them anything you and you could pick somebody on your team who's really good at this both of you have people that well I don't know about you so much Patrick I don't but I would assume so have people that your clients like talking to we don't want to spend too much time with this but you do you know like you could you can kind of deputize somebody on the team to do these follow ups that really aren't only just to let them know we haven't forgotten you. So I don't think anybody should go longer than a month without being followed up with even if we're in treatment and we know that the treatment is going to take six months because there's this whole long thing of they're supposed to go to 20 chiropractors visits and it's going to take however long you know what I mean. Even if you do the math and you know there's no way they're going to be done in a month. Checking on them within a month just let them know hey we're going to follow up with you check on you see how you're doing and then actually do it. There's this whole psychological thing. that happens with people. That's like, first of all, you set an expectation. Second of all, you met that expectation. I'm going to feel like when you tell me you're going to do something, I can count on that. And also, when we get to the distributions conversation, I'm like, I feel a little bit differently because you reached out to me, you checked on me. And honestly, like, I felt like I was just kind of going through this alone. I'm stuck in the middle of this. My back is hurting. My neck is hurting. I'm not going to get paid for a while. I have to go through this stuff and nobody cares. But my turn is called and checked on me. That was like, I was good. I needed that. Not even a tiny little thing. So the other thing that we talked about Lorenz is doing a top to bottom file review once a week, all of your cases. But I'm not talking about going into every type of detail that you guys do. I think as a team, all we did was open up the cases. Um, just looked at the conversation and the notes to see how long it had been since anybody had contacted them. And if there was a very apparent somebody should have said something either because of the time that had gone by it exceeded, you know, a month or something like that, or there was a lack of clarity in the update in the notes and the conversation, right? Somebody said, I'm going to do this, but there's no clear evidence that it was done or that it's being done or that there's any issue or any success, you know what I mean? So it would take you, you know, with the amount of cases, you have how many open cases do you have, you know, uh, two, forty, three, I think. Yeah. So you probably have about a hundred and more. Wait, what did you tell me Patrick? I have I know your volume changed. 00:31:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) 165. Yeah, so that's my total. don't know what's open. 00:31:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh, wait a minute. Total meaning all the cases you've ever done or ever currently have on my list, but I think open means like not settled, I think. Oh, okay. 00:31:23 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, I consider a settled cases until they're closed to be active because there's still work to be done on me. 00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 00:31:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Me too. So it could be done. 00:31:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) have some 165. Yeah. So to me, uh, yeah, when I stay open, that's what I mean is that it hasn't been, you haven't received payment. Basically when you receive payment, it's that's done, but I might be incorrect on the verbiage. 00:31:51 - Lorenz Schuerch So I'm down to 230 now. 00:31:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:31:57 - Lorenz Schuerch Isn't it? the two, Hank. 00:31:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh, Probably some of it, but also leads have dropped tremendously this month. It has slowed way down. We are about 65% of volume from last month, so there's that. But there have been some cases gone to Hank, but not. I mean, I actually know. I don't even think he's in this report. So yeah, yes. Those only resolutions. I'd have to go on, I don't know if I need to share, I'm sure. guess that would probably be okay. But just because I don't know what the report will show up, I will look at that later and see how many he's got. Anyway, was I up? 00:32:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Going through the file reviews. 00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, yeah, thank you for being a teacher, Patrick, good job. So anyway, Lorenz, what I was asking Patrick to do and I would like you to do this as well is just that. Just take and it will go much faster as you do it every week. But just open them and see when was the last time that that client has heard from somebody from Sweetlaw and unless you get distracted and turn it into something else, it shouldn't take probably more than a couple of hours. And once you do it the next week, there will be some of them and maybe you have a way of marking them where you can just go, I sure don't need to check that because number one, I know they're in treatment and number two, it's only been a week since somebody checked on them so I don't have to look at that. But is that something that you would be willing to do? 00:33:55 - Lorenz Schuerch Well, yeah, I thought it was something that I thought the... Can you click on your matters that already voted that last call? Yeah. 00:34:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So if you click on that, um, can you, could you share your screen and show me what you look at? 00:34:24 - Lorenz Schuerch Okay, go. can you see my cursor? 00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yep. 00:34:40 - Lorenz Schuerch Right here. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh. Okay. Now, let's see how many cases you let's, let's just go scroll all the way through, but okay. So, okay, let's pause. All right, so, what I want you to do is validate this, can we just pick a couple of cases randomly, two, whatever, and look at that and make sure that that is correct? 00:35:22 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, so this one's supposed be 9-3 for the last so I'm to mute this last one, September 3, like that, we love the call, the client, by the client list, we all 00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hold on, so was there anything that was supposed to happen after that? So here's what I want to know. Because we're trying to improve the overall length of time to resolve a case, right? if you ask a person to do something, statistically, how often are people going to do most of those things? Most people going to do those things quickly. 00:36:35 - Lorenz Schuerch That's your experience? Oh, I don't know, Tina, couple of months I've had people gone for two weeks at a time, so it's everyone's been a little bit swamped. I kind of get, I have to use my dad voice with John this morning for letting a few things fall through the cracks, but honestly, he's been handling the caseload without Barry for three weeks now. 00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So now I was just trying to imagine Lawrence's dad voice to apply the model. So most people, I think, if you ask them to do something, unless it's urgent for them, they're not necessarily going to do that quickly. 00:37:31 - Lorenz Schuerch So So how often do you follow up with them without like being this type of thing? 00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If it's a move something forward, I'd do it weekly. And I would just do a quick text message. You're like, Hey, just wanted to check and make sure that you did that. And how's it going? Or were there any issues, whatever, you get a response back and they're like, Oh, just be like, okay, just wanted to check. Because we definitely want to get that check to you, know, something like that, or you're just kind of nudging matter of fact. There's a great book. That's right. I don't remember who I thought I can do for a minute. It's called nudge. Um, but it's basically that we all need nudges. We all need nudges for different reasons, but a lot of times it's simply because something isn't top of mind. But not being top of mind doesn't mean not important and not a priority. It just means it's not top of mind, especially these days with all of the different things that we have going. And here's what I want you to think about. And we're going back to just kind of when we get down to distributions. Distributions are going to be impacted by how I feel about you. I don't know there's different people, right? Not everybody is going to feel this way, but a lot of people. There's this there's this law of reciprocity that is if you take care of me. I don't want to do bad things to you, right? So if you were helpful to me, I am not going to get upset about you earning your fee. There are different ways that we can improve the perception of our value in service towards us. Most of it is going to have to do with their sense of feeling about how we care, as well as efficiency. And there are a few little things that we can do that don't take a lot of time and requirements and energy from us, but require us to be consistent in doing that. One of them is a nudge. It's hate, just a reminder. know you're busy. You probably just want to make sure that you've got this done and that everything's going OK and see if you need any help. Now, what they don't know is that the whole reason that you're doing it is that I don't know what percentage of the case is slowed down by. clients not doing their part, but it's going to be significant. You can only control how fast you can go. You cannot control how fast the insurance company goes, but you can influence it to a degree by your tenacity and follow-up, right? You'll have even a greater impact at improving the and influencing the pace of the client doing their steps to move through it with little nudges, just wanted to check, make sure everything's okay, and then when we get down to the case, and they're kind of reviewing in the back of their mind how this experience went, man, they were always there like helping me get through the process, making sure I didn't forget anything, seeing if I was okay. You don't have to increase a lot of your time and effort to do that because most of and do you guys happen to? to mark or signify and type away when your client has a preference between text and calls. 00:41:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We usually just write it on that left side. 00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so you, it is something that you guys consider. 00:41:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I've only had like two that are like, call me, don't text me. 00:41:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. That doesn't necessarily answer my question. 00:41:30 - Lorenz Schuerch So your question is, is there a system? Does a system have a way to differentiate between contact through text or contact through calling? 00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Not only does system in terms of litify, but does system in terms of your team and your operations style? 00:41:53 - Lorenz Schuerch Well, I think Mark's made it pretty clear that he prefers texts. 00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I did not know that. 00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch it's good. And the problem is my experience in Arizona, clients definitely do not prefer text. There's a heavy lean towards phone calls, especially for Hispanic clients and our older population, which is a lot of Arizona rises. 00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. So that's something I want to work on a little bit. But let's just assume that we can accomplish most of these nudges through text. So I'll give you the promise of the book. And it's basically a lot of the books are... Anecdotes reports stories that support the claim and basically it's that psychologically most of us need nudges. There comes up some type of resistance for different reasons and it could just be number one it's not on my mind and that happens frequently because we have so many things distracting us. Number two it could be I'm not in the mood for that. Number three it could be I don't have that number available to me at this particular moment. All kinds of different things. So a nudge could be number one it serves as a reminder. Number two the energy of the nudge right the reminder message could be such that it's encouraging and hey just wanted to check on you all they care about me out. I want to do my part I want to make sure that this case gets done I'm gonna go do it again it's not gonna work like that with everybody but The point of all the things that we're doing isn't to perfect everything, it's to improve what can be improved, right? And then to get the compounding effect of those improvements. So coming into something like this, if you look at your case and the last note that was there was, I asked the client to do something three weeks ago and there's no update. Does it matter, do we want to know that they've even gotten into a body shop and a repair we do? Because like in my area, so I got the wreck because the lady just ran it to me, sorry Jesus, it took six weeks, my car was in the shop for six weeks. And I wasn't even being neglected, I live in a small town, I was a dude from high school, you 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) who's giving any text messages and updates. 00:45:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We just don't have enough people to get the jobs done quickly and efficiently. So if we spend three weeks waiting, I'm going wait for Patrick for a minute. 00:45:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I haven't met Mary yet. 00:45:45 - Lorenz Schuerch Sorry. 00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) haven't never met Mary yet. Anyway, okay, so. Or is that okay so if it takes like I was saying from. my car took six weeks for them to get done in the body shop. If we're waiting three weeks for them just to even make that phone call and choose a shop, you know, three weeks there, then six weeks, like we can't wrap this case up. That's a big bottleneck. So we want to at least every week be trying to make sure, hey, did you remember to call that and get between drivability? They maybe hesitant to get that done, but you are held to metrics and stats, right? Sweet law doesn't get paid until the case gets closed. It is on you to get the case closed. So to me, there's no reason if something is in the hands of someone else, for you to not be nudging it ever week going, can we move this along? Obviously not with that tone. Like, hey, just want to do. Remind you can't remove this a lot. You know, that's what's really happening. Anyway, so this is what I would like you guys to be doing and you can deputize people on your team. You can use your resources, but at the end of the day, do not do not abdicate this. So it's your job to make sure it's getting done. If you want to assign somebody to check on it and make sure that everything is being touched, do that, but then you come in and you do an audit. So you you check, you know, maybe 20% of your cases and make sure that everything that you look at is falling under the expectations that you have set, which is nobody is not getting responded to within a month. So if you know they're in treatment, there is nothing else that can be accomplished other than them completing treatment. We're just checking them once a month just so that they know we haven't forgotten them. We want to make sure everything's okay. Anything else, if we're waiting for anybody to be doing anything, we're not doing it whether it's the clients or the insurance company or whatever to make sure that that's getting done no less than once a week. Which means like because Lorenz you had gotten to a thorough file review but it took you about three weeks to get through all of your files. What I'm telling you that is that if you this process alone and you should have enough understanding of the base off of the improvement that you got when you changed your file review process. If you go through everything at the bottom once a week, not necessarily quite as thoroughly as you have been doing right with all the team but just looking at it and making sure that the movement is happening, I pretty much guarantee you that your days to close is going to decrease. Significantly and fairly quickly meaning if we go look at it weeks like a month from now There should be a few days shaved off of Maybe it's not quite that fast. I don't know because you are still impacted by other people's timing outside of your team And you can only manage your team But for sure, there's going to be an improvement so that's what I would like you guys both to do and I just want to keep having these conversations as you come back and say What did you notice like what is the frequency? How many cases did you come across and I would love you to take a little note so that we can look at how it is now and Then maybe look at it 90 days from now and go Okay, I'm coming across a lot less that weren't actually getting touched and it seems like things are going faster I'd also be very interested to know and I would love for you guys to kind of note this too Does there seem to be any type of feeling change in your team? And in their experience with Pete as they turn into somebody who's not just, okay, I've got a case to close, but a person who now nudges, and nudges a gentle work, right? It's not a push and shove and coerce. It's a, you know, you think of nudging, nudging is kind of a close, intimate thing. Like I could shove somebody, I don't like, I don't have to get, like that contact is different. You nudge somebody, you don't, you don't nudge somebody you don't like, you like, or don't know, generally. You're nudging somebody you know a little bit, you're close to like, hey, just want to get you going where you got to go, right? 00:50:42 - Lorenz Schuerch Yes, no. You're alive, I love you. I'm just trying to picture in my head how, because I'm a, I can nudge, but sometimes I'm not that gentle, so I'm trying to. 00:50:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What are you to? you even know? I know you, I understand that. So, it takes practice. I mean, I got Portuguese, I got African, I got all kinds of angry people in me that like to drink alcohol and fight, and I'm a Virgo, and I'm a firstborn girl. They'd soccer for 11 years, coached it for five years. I'm telling you, I understand these things. But, you can learn how, and it really is a great thing to learn how to do, to nudge. So, the way to do it is to know what matters to the person you're trying to nudge. What is their value? And that's the conversation we've had, right? Their value is, I want to be done with this. I don't want to hurt anymore. You can't control that, that you can help them, make sure they get a provider, and they are getting taken care of, and that their insurance policy is covering it. So, you can help with that. And, they want to get, make sure that the payment comes through, so that stuff is taken care of. They don't have to worry about the financial burden and they probably don't want to spend any of their time doing this, which means as soon as the case gets closer, sooner they can stop thinking about it. So rather than it being about, we need to get this done and I want you to get this done, it's just a reminder. I know you want this case done, of course they do, right, even if they didn't tell you. I know you don't want to be dealing with this. I know you've got better things to do and I know that you want to make sure that you get as much help as you can and that's what your insurance is for, right? So I'm here for that. So the best way to make this happen is to keep it going and keep the momentum as much as we can. So here's what I need you to do. Now, that feels like a lot of words. There's a reason I talk as much as I do. Well, there's a couple of them, number one, I'm just that way. But too, is that I've actually learns and it's one of the reasons I talk fast because nobody wants to hear all of it, but they need to. I can, I know what people need to hear and so I make sure they hear it quickly in and out. This is what you need to know to do the thing that you need to do. You will understand it like if you think about it, the majority of our conversation is why you should do what you need to do. This much of it is here's what you need to do and this much of it is how you need to do what you do. Most of it is spent on why you need to do what you need to do and the reason is if people are not bought into that recommendation, right? They don't do it. You're not, they're hand holding you're they're watching them. They're not going to do it. Even if they called you because they've got this case to solve in the first place. For example, how many people know that in order to feel better, they need to eat better and they need to exercise. Everybody knows that, right? How many people want to feel better? Everybody, probably. How many people do the thing that they could do right there in their own house to feel better? Make that much, maybe? That's my point. So you got to remember that you're talking to people who know what they need to do and probably aren't going to do it in a timely manner. On your team, the clients, the insurance companies, and that is in your way of your goals all the time. What you want to show them is how it's in the way of their own goals. Also, does that make sense? So, first you increase their awareness. You continue to keep them aware nudges and then you just support them and encourage them and direct them and small little steps. Okay. This is this is your one job. Go call the auto body shop. I'll check in with you next week. By the way, that's another thing that you can do set an expectation. I'm going to check in with you next week. Guess what you just did. I don't want to talk to this dude again. I better get it done. There are a lot of people who are just trained because the institutions of school and work create us to be this way that if somebody tells us to do something and they telling us that they're going to check up on us, I'm going to do the thing. That is most people. Most people are the institutional people. So you can tap into that knowledge and that psychology by setting the expectation. to know here's what we're going to do. I need you to buy in right? This is you want to get this case done. Okay, so now you're accountable to me and to you because I'm going to follow up with you next week. And now I've implied that I'm going to spend more time on you making sure that this is getting done and thanks to I guess the institution. We expect them to comply into the job. So there's a benefit to understanding a little bit about psychology and and using it to your benefit. Now it does increase I don't think it actually increases the workload. I'll tell you why. I think that when you realize that, okay, so there's there's different types of work that we have to do, right? There's mental work, there's energetic work, there's physical work. Um, and all of those are loads on us. So let's say I talk talk to a really terrible person for two minutes, physically, time-wise, that's not a heavy load. Energetically, that could mess me up for the whole day, right? Now, let's say I talk to a really nice person, but they yap my ear off for an hour. That's a lot of time that has an impact energetically as well, because at some point I'm going, I'm not able to get to the rest of my work. A really nice person still impacted me in a negative way, because I didn't manage the time well, and you know what I mean? So there's all kinds of different ways that this can happen. So what you want to do is look at all the potential friction points and bottlenecks that can keep you from getting to your goal and understand how to prevent them by a particular type of handling or massaging in this situation. So one of them is frequent touches, which means, for example, let's say I don't talk to somebody for six weeks and the place that I left them was they're supposed to get a hold of the body shop. Well, six weeks later I found out they've called three or six different body shops in town. Nobody can get to them for like six months and really what they needed to hear was making an appointment anyway because now you're six weeks down the road and you're still six weeks further. You're 12 weeks away from getting it done because you didn't get the job done because you were annoyed by the fact that you have to wait longer than you want to wait and all they needed was somebody to remind them like it's futile just do the thing. Like have you ever just been in a situation where you needed somebody to tell you it's not going to get better just do it? I do. I know it. I know there are things that I just know and I just want it to be a different way because it's so stupid and then somebody's like just do it because you can't process. This is leadership, you know, it's it's stewardship, it's understanding the nuance of everything in the job, including the psychology, like the mental processes of your clients, of your team, potentially even of the insurance companies that you're dealing with, although those people are just like brick wall sometimes brick wall robots are like, this is our proudest thing. This is what we have to do. I'm not annoyed by people. But sometimes you can crack a hole and those like hard people. You can just talk in the depth, guess how I know that. Yeah, okay, still the runs. Did I? I want to share this with you because I'm going to make it you do this. Hi. Share, share, share, um, with, and, and, okay, so what I want you to do around, and I'm gonna, yes, and hold on, share anyway, let me show my screen, do, I know we're over time, sorry. Okay, so what I would like you to do is kind of format your data into something like what I did over here. This wasn't what Patrick did, this is what I set up, and I think Patrick, I gave you an assignment, but I didn't share this with you, so you couldn't have accomplished it, which is see if you can fill this section out, phases and time estimated to complete. Now, a range, this is gonna be a range of time, obviously, right, um, there, there's not gonna be a set. This should definitely be done in this amount of time, but, but give us a range to the best of ability and Lorenz, I want you to so I'm thinking that you Should really have similar stuff. 01:02:17 - Lorenz Schuerch You do not need to change your language, but ultimately we want to have kind of Patricks Yeah, if that works for you, you totally can I mean I It seems like it would save a lot of time. I can just edit As I see fit, but I can just use Patrick as a base and change the names and Yeah, so you can um, I'm gonna make this pad right Seems like it's pretty similar to what I came up with So I'm gonna do this. 01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it does seem very similar. I'm gonna Don't don't whoa. What the heck that is not how that works It's so weird, you know what, if I go like this, let's try that one more time. If you go crazy on me, okay, so we'll call this Lorenz. And then that out, you can, we're gonna take this off, you can go look at a reference. I would like this info on your team too. And then, so both of you, so Patrick, fill out these things the best that you can feel free to collaborate with each other. will do that anyway as we work together. And then, let's see, if there is, let's see, if there's an action to be performed, the case should be the client, I guess, will be contacted less. that once a week, okay? Thoughts, comments, concerns? Annoyances, completes? 01:04:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Well, Lorenzo, if there's like extra stuff that you added, try and keep it in because I also want to see, or maybe I could just look at what you said there. 01:04:24 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, and notice you have more, you're more detailed on the case opening stuff. I might have added more items like... 01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is what Lorenzo had, information gathering, get RA, get signed RA intake, attorney intro, like there are some more nuance to what you shared. 01:04:51 - Lorenz Schuerch I'll be doing a treatment of that too. 01:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so and you guys can work on that together, we can do that on our next call. So next... next week as a you and me Lorenz case that time. Or if you guys do you guys want it to be both of you every week? 01:05:09 - Lorenz Schuerch I don't mind. If the Patrick's cool with that. 01:05:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) don't mind either. I don't know if you have a certain like if you were supposed to do certain normal ones, but I don't. 01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm a boss and I can do whatever I want to get in trouble with the market. Have we met? I look like the subservient tied to you? I got into this business so I could be the boss all the time. Okay. Anyway, no. I mean it's whatever works best and I feel like so I wasn't sure I felt like someone one time might be better, but actually I feel like there's there's enough similarities and I think we probably have more productive calls with the two of you together. But I want to leave room if there was, I wanted to, and I don't think that there is any need for it, leave room in case there was anything that was maybe of a sensitive nature on the team, or you didn't want to talk about it in front of anybody else, but it doesn't seem like there's any of that, you guys are both pretty open, your teams, you know, you can talk about them a little bit, and the individual. It's not like we're talking very personally or anything, so that shouldn't be an issue, but I wanted to make sure that there was space in case that did work better, but I do think that we would have the best conversations if we did it all together every time. 01:06:38 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah, I think so too. 01:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so it's slightly, it's one more call a month for you guys, and if there's a need to reschedule, we can do that. 01:06:50 - Lorenz Schuerch It's nice to be able to have like the same time every week as much as possible, but some things, sometimes something will come up, so just there might be, so Two weeks, my wife and I is anniversary is this weekend, but we have a soccer tournament. So it's not happening. So in two weeks, I'm going to try to take her camping and it might fall on Tuesday. 01:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So if that's the case, then Patrick will just have to deal with me by himself, or we can reschedule. We can do either one, depending on how much time that you're gone. 01:07:24 - Lorenz Schuerch Okay. 01:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So sorry, Patrick, but all right, you guys, I will let you go. I feel like I feel like it's going good. I do know how this organizational stuff ends up and it generally just it creates a level of peace and certainty because things are so structured. You just know what you're doing. You know why you're doing it. Your team knows what they're doing. They know why that they're doing it. And so what we're doing is removing a lot of the mental. friction. And that is what can create a lot of drag throughout the day. And over time, it's like, okay, I'll give you this analogy, then we'll go. Do you remember what it was like when you first learned how to drive? 01:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch Yeah. 01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you remember like being at an intersection for the first time and you're trying to process all this stuff about your blinker and the light and do they go or do you go put gas and like break and like all of the, and especially if you're driving stick, that's a whole another amount of calculations that you're putting in there. learned a mistake. So you have to mentally process every single thing that happens simultaneously. And if you're wrong, you die. No pressure. But eat and listen to the music and have a conversation. And then I'm not stressed out and driving is peaceful. Like, when did that happen? I don't know when that happened. But somewhere along the line, this thing that I have to process and just almost shut me down every time turned into something I enjoy in a super easy. That's what this does. We take the complicated things and turn it into a process that we practice over and over again to where you just show up and you do it. not only is it easy, but you're good at it. You're not one of those drivers that's running people off the road. You're one of those ones that's like, I see you crazy person. I'm going to give you a little bit more space, so we're not going to have a wreck. I don't carry out my merry little way. So that's what this does. That's how it kind of brings the pieces that you just get super clear on what needs to happen, and why it needs to happen. you can make multiple kind of difficult decisions without really thinking. about it because you understand the nuance of all of it and how to anticipate and how to react instantaneously. Make sense? Yeah. All right. Y'all need to calm down. Just lay off the caffeine, the coke, whatever it is that you're doing. That's keeping you so hyper. Just chill out. Have a good day. 01:10:23 - Lorenz Schuerch crazy. 01:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You lorenz@sweetlaw.com,patrick@sweetlaw.comTina MarieLorenz/Patrick
00:00:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, I'm just going to move on Yeah, I can hear you now. I'm just going to move down to my family room to sit on a more comfortable chair. I was in my other room office, but I got a nice chair here to sit on. Oh, yeah, yeah. I decided not to do anything with my hair or change it to a fancy shirt for any videos, even though I just did a little free coaching call to my school community. And I just think. Yeah. Totally relaxing. get my nails done at 4.15, so I can't wait for that. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I'm going to do my this now, but up again. is literally what I slept in, and this is my sleepy hair with a little bit of blushing. Yeah, let me get one, my little laptop thing that you put in your lap. 00:01:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, you buy those at Staples or whatever, of course. 00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I've got a couple of them. 00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, good to do. Get there. 00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, good Lord. 00:01:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So you've had really bizarre sleep patterns, huh? 00:01:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, this week has been nuts. I don't know like what's up with my body. 00:01:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's actually like it's a good thing. Like I have more energy because I'm not wiped out all day long. 00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but yeah, it's a little weird. 00:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I like your voice message. 00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was fun. You must have just woke up. You sound very sleepy. Oh yeah. 00:02:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was still in bed. Cool. 00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That is how that was. mean, hi, browser. 00:02:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hey, how's that YouTube video going or YouTube out going for you? 00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Getting nothing. But Dan said, well, like you said it's not clickable. And I just left it there. It's gotten views, but not a good ad. 00:02:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I think it has to be over a minute because I see it end up becoming a short, like when you send it to me. Yeah. I think that's why it's not clickable. 00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I don't care. 00:02:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I thought you did it. 00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, no, Yeah. That was the whole point. And it was not like not telling you like, I don't care. It's that. I actually care leaving it up causes me more discomfort and it's a good thing because it's need to do that. So I am in the practice of doing things that stretch me. Yeah. So that is the primary purpose of that. is this going? don't even know what this program is. trying to close. I don't even know what the app is. So I can't like, oh, that's CapCut. 00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, for a quick CapCut. 00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Goodbye. Thoughts you are going to block me. I don't think so. Okay. Now the app store is blocking me. None of my are dragging me nuts though. 00:03:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Mmm. Yeah. had to take some Claritin the last two days in a row actually. 00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would not be able to breathe without it. I have really bad asthma and L.R.G.'s. Okay. So one thing is, can we move this call half an hour later? 00:04:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. It could be later than half an hour, too, if you want. 00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. when I said it, I'm like, I'm going to be up, but I'm not even getting back from taking my daughter to school until almost 8, Not exercise eaten, and let me go look at my calendar real quick and see. Okay, so on Wednesdays, I've got missionary training. That's why I wanted it early on Wednesdays. Yeah, if we could do it at like 10, 30 or 11, which is two hours later or two and to all. all. at at not Let's see, let's this for next week. I'll put that there with this and all following events. Didn't move, it's not move, hold on. And then Tuesday. That will be amazing. That will be way better. Because I really want to be able to show up. But you were three hours ahead of me and you seem to be an early bird. 00:05:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was like, ah, but I am an early bird. So in your nighttime, I'm like, I shouldn't turn my phone off at six or try not to that on weekends. I'm usually not on or if I am on it's more, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, just creative spurt. 00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I've always been like that and my girls are like that so I can train myself to do whatever Yeah, to an extent. I definitely I'm physically affected by the moon the Sun the bar a barometric pressure Significantly I ache even if I don't know that the weather has changed. I feel it in my house in my bed. It's um, but I Teenagers and they don't want to talk into like midnight They're gonna be gone soon. So I want to be available and I'm like Yeah, so that's happened a few times to this week at them early and Yeah, this is this is the season that I'm in and I Oh, I'm not gonna get emotional, but because it's almost over. 00:06:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm just here for all of Okay, so you 00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I got to find a Google Doc. I want to talk about all the things. There's so many things that are being things that you're working on, things that I'm working on. My most exciting thing that I want to talk to you about is what we can do together, but I do think that it's an exploratory process. So, and I want to put a priority, top, top priority on how do we get Maria incoming money right away? 00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Because Maria always does that for everybody else, I want to put that script in. Well, and also in a smart way that like, I, you know, I could, you know, put up a thing in analytics thing to do some stuff. It's just I don't want to be then tied up for the next month, doing done for you work at the cost of my stuff. So, so there's a happy medium. But I do know that I got pretty energized when I saw that YouTube video this morning about those guys that made it two million to nine months. I'm like, what? But yeah, I mean, there's, there's, and I have some, like, like one gal just paid me 500 this morning just to do a VSL script for her, which I know should be more, but I figure if it only takes me two solid hours to do it, I could just leverage that and sell maybe a few more in Ellen's group, because I just mentioned to her all, I was thinking of doing this, and she said, okay, I'll pay you. The licensing of the funnel that I've built, I'm in talks with this one guy that might want to buy it. So, but I've never done it before licensed on actual funnels, so I don't know what the details, so we'll see if that goes anywhere. But that basically, I would transfer the funnel, my ad copy, the actual ebook I created into his thing. But, There's some nuances to it though because it wasn't a profitable funnel. It's a break even funnel Which is still amazing for look take a funnel that was meant to sell People to kreena's and mine like you know now it's for just one cape product program and book a call to her 4800 things So that's the only thing and part of me was like if I have money just sitting in the bank account I could just run out to it in a new account and find a really good ecom Academy ecom course to Be an affiliate for and use the funnel cuz it was 20% conversion rate like for this $3 thing So I'm like man But that's the issue just missing a back end So I don't know if this guy would want it without a back end and I'm not going to that's kreena's intellectual property like how to Build a drop ship store and I don't want to go create a course without I don't want to sell it to him Without him knowing all of the details like I never want that because he could be someone to be the future that would buy other funnels that I'm make or something he knows. 00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right? So I mean, as long as you're up front about what he gets and what he doesn't get, then let him design. 00:10:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, that's what I've done. I've sent him everything. All the Facebook ads cost the screenshots of all the funnel stats, everything. So from the get go, this is really built for someone who already has a mid ticket or high ticket 1000 or more ecom kind of course and then it's perfect for them. But it's interesting. was I'm learning this because then he's like, let's say a ClickFunnels platform. said, well, no, I wouldn't get my ClickFunnels account. Like, so all these things, I guess some people who are into buying and selling funnels, it's a really interesting, you know, I guess they're used to you just giving them everything. So I think, like, if I were to do it again, I would put it into System IO and be like a separate account, right? Because like, that's it. And then here, here's just this my account and the email I set up for this funnel like that. 00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah, you could duplicate eight. So, and this is what I was talking to Seth about doing, too, is because he's got that breakthrough challenge. And in Ontoport, you can just shove it into somebody else's Ontoport account. You can do that in high level. It's called Snapshot. And if you did that in System.io, but what if you duplicated that in these other things, and you said, oh, if you got System.io, it's already built for you. Here you go. Here's the cost of, so it's not even really a licensing fee. It's a, you know, how we had those, like, templates for VSLs and things like that. You could get infusion socks, campaigns, where they had it. It was, it was basically a part of infusion soft. wasn't a show they do it now. It's not even called that anymore. Now it's like a keep or something, right? Anyway, but you could either do it yourself. It probably wouldn't take too long as long as you were familiar. with it. But if it's basically so you've got landing pages, sales page, checkout pages, unless they're all in one, order bumps, fulfillment. Well, thank you pages, right? And then whatever the sequences are, all of the platforms are relatively similar. As long as you can navigate to it, you just create it and create the automations. It will probably only take you a few hours. And now you've got it in multiple platforms, and you can tell it to people on the platform that they're on. As long as the platform allows you to share it, like high level does, on-trip port does, and you'd have to have an on-trip port account, which is way too expensive for that, but high level. 00:12:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. And system IO would be just copying the funnel or if I just create a separate account. Yeah. I'm still here. level for that too, to an extent. so yeah, so, so it is, we'll just see where that goes. And because yeah, I just had that brainstorm yesterday morning, I'm like, wait a minute. There's one on that basically, I created some tip to tail and it's like, what the ? Like, I should be compensated for this, you know? So, but it did make me think of all my other stuff, too. Like, I have micro for magic. I've got high ticket toolkit. 00:13:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you have, like, a document, a library of what what offers you have and what you sold them for? 00:13:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, up to date current one, but yes. 00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I would probably just need an hour to make it up to date with stuff. 00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Well, what if, what if you did that and we brainstorm together and figure out maybe there's a different type of stock that you could offer or you offer this and then upsell down to all the type of thing. just to generate some cash for you without bogging you down timeways and done for you type stuff. 00:14:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if I crack the core on how to sell, like you mean like sell the funnel to other people, like to like. 00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, well, so like, yeah, the micro offer magic, like itself, if it's a course, like what I wanna see, what is your library of things that you have that you've sold that you could sell again, maybe with a couple of tweaks, maybe you need to update a checkout page, maybe you need to connect to people. I don't know, like what is everything that you have that is still relative, where you could put together an offer and say, you know, here's all the things, pick one, choose one, or pay this price and get everything, that type of thing. 00:14:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, like to the consumer to buy. Yeah, than like sell the actual pay, this is a converting funnel, I want this. Yeah, yeah, I can do that. 00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because, so you said you need $3,000 a month, is your, like, light's on cost? 00:15:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Uh, yeah, $3,000 a month, doesn't it? was really $5,000 a month? 00:15:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. if we could figure out, um, just, so I like to do hybrid things so that we reduce the burden, um, it's the done with you done for you stuff that has higher ticket and you can sell easier, but it comes with a bigger burden. So you want to kind of offset that with another type of offer, if you can, which doesn't increase the burden so much, but also gives you a little bit more income and then potentially has, you can sell other things affiliate offers, your own offers, whatever. But, um, so in order for us to sell, like, a 6k package, we don't have to do anything other than. Write an offer get some eyeballs on it. I'm thinking and You I mean if we sell two of those you're good We're right and and if if we can sell to you we can sell two more we can sell two more like Not all the ones right, but build up the queue for it. feel like that is the simplest way to Put some money into your need account and then siphon off the tiny for whatever We might be building and meanwhile give us a little time. 00:16:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Give you some breathing space So that we can build something that's scalable and build some con together So wait, so let's just repeat that last part like if I brain just zoned out for a second but to me like If you and I create a 6k offer Sales page for or even a Google Doc with what's including right here's we get here's the problem is here's what you get That might be a faster path to cash in the next two weeks. 00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's exactly what I'm saying. 00:17:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So yeah, that's what I thought. And I agree. That's sort of why I've held off. was going to send out 30 looms a day to all my people saying, hey, I've got this 100 days to 1k days. You know, thinking of, you know, launching this and book a call for me if you're interested. then I was going to sell whoever gets on the call, but I know it's not a. I wanted to wait until we kind of strategize because yeah, because I'd rather have something we build together. 00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) if I'm going to do looms, I'd rather do looms than to that. 00:17:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that's the most lovers thing because there's no overhead cost to that. So we can just split it 50 50. I can pay for ads if you're strapped right now and we just figure all of that later. So. And or I just paid for it and like you're doing some of the looms like that's the thing we can figure out how to split like I don't. there's a lot of things I don't like to do that you love to do. So if we figure out a good balance where you're happy with what you're doing, I'm happy with what we're doing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm sure that we can find those things really well. And of course, I'm a grown woman, I can do things I don't want to do and will do things I don't want to do. And likewise, but I think that's the fastest easiest thing to not bog us down to also establish a little bit of a brand awareness with us operating together. A kind of a mutual audience, which is going to have a different vibe than just Maria or Justina. And then when you have the money and you're reading, you're not like, how do I hustle up some money? Now we can talk about structure more frequently and really build out what's our long term thing, build our maybe individual courses, not individual, like a combined course, serve in the way that we're talking about, you know, we could and calls and co-working all of that stuff that we were discussing, but I think it's not, we can't even have that conversation until we've got money coming in for you if you don't have to worry about it. 00:19:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm supposed to get started for us working together, right? So now it's time to pull the trigger. 00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it'd be so great to fulfill that for somebody. You can't get a quality, that. I don't even know anywhere where you could go get somebody who's going to give you the business structure that I would give them and the marketing that you would give them. For that price and for the level of service that we would give them, the handholding that just we've got you and not talking down to you. 00:19:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's so much condescension in this world. 00:19:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. You know, like, and I was talking to my love last night and he is so glad that I'm working. with no years and doctors and things like that. he's like, you just, he goes, I'm glad you're done with the internet marketing world. 00:20:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I said, I'm not, I'm never going to be, but here's why. 00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) People need me. Like, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't have this experience if it wasn't for my path through here. Well, there are so many of us who, people just, they go here because the marketers are marketing. All they know is I need to make money and I need to do it from home because I've got kids or I'm taking care of my parents. Like I can't leave, but I need to change my life and the opportunities available to me aren't working. So they go online about business, the people that are the loudest are internet marketers. So that's who they're going to hear. said, I have to be there to teach them there is real business to be learned and taught and available to them in where they're at. They're in the internet marketing world. I'm going to be here being a voice of reason and logic and real systems. Real service, real values, real KPIs, you know, and not just how can I get money out of people as fast as I can and launch the next thing before they catch on to what I'm doing. 00:21:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:21:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, Oh, this is reaction. 00:21:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He said, yeah, you're right. I know you have a call. just say it like that, but. Yeah, but it's been a long time trying to get him. Because he just hates that. He just knows how many of these people that and some of them look like. Christian choir boys and they're in the back rooms like bankrupting people and getting them to sell their houses and mortgage them to buy this mastermind coaching thing. And then these people aren't qualified. They just got sold and they lose their houses and they lose their, you know, they get divorced. They just, it destroys them. people suicide, like it's. Yeah, really. 00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) horrible thing and they're out here like I'm the greatest thing in the world and people are literally worshiping them and It's really disgusting So yeah, that's why I have my pros and cons because there's a bit of a bro culture, you know Alex from Ozzie and who he attracts, right? 00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I don't want anything to do with it I almost even don't study it because I look at it and then as soon as I hear like The things that he has said he's like, yeah I was willing first of all he lied and he admitted to lying and he was like whatever it takes to make the money and He said different things I'm like you told me enough to know that you have no integrity that Selling is the bottom line and that you can't be trusted Why would I listen to you that that makes no sense? want nothing to do with pretty much everybody in this world Or they're all about and hub and yeah, just go park it over here And I'm just like I there is a group of people that you know, and it's not the super religion disorienting, but it's the conservative. Like, I want to make money. I do love marketing. It's exciting. But I don't want to be slimy about it. And I don't want to be condescending. And I don't want to sell a grandma out of her home or a dad out of his retirement or, you know, all that kind of thing. And there's particular language that's used in a particular vibe, energy. And I'm in that world, but I'm not of that world. 00:23:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you know what mean? Yeah, exactly. No, I'm the same. Yeah. What do you want to do? 00:23:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) you want to open up a Google Doc and start mapping out? Yes. So you now is the thing that you were looking at today, the YouTube stuff relative to what what we were doing. Does it have any bearing in terms of like creating an offer or structure? 00:23:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) we'll open up the Google Doc. think you started one, right? It might as far as The initial part of the YouTube video was kind of interesting how they just decided to throw up a 5K offer that really wasn't really created yet, but they were always one week ahead, right, and but they made sure they treated the customer like gold so they got what they want. So, it probably was your typical thing of they, I mean, it was all in German, right, so I don't know what the inside of the school program is, but it was probably definitely all about having a good offer building an audience, you know, having accountability. That was one thing that was intriguing. They offered a weekly accountability person or no daily, I think, so we could have Sally check in on them every day if we wanted to, you know. But yeah, yes, so I mean I can take a look at this off. 00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I've got Stephanie Stephanie's $30 an hour and that's mostly because it's partially benevolent and she needed and I believe in a button so I don't do that but she could help with that too. 00:25:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, and, and, or even down the road have a I be that person right that yeah, I'm trying to get my documents alone. 00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:25:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sure. Yeah. 00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mama, I'm a bear marketing that one. Okay. Let me share. Okay. That's weird. You just said participants can now see your application, which I've never. It's never said that before. 00:25:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) just. Yeah. Oh, yes. 00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't really have. Um, the offer, I put it, it was in, I think I just set it in box or my bad. Hold on. I don't want this. 00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You gonna buy another backup? 00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't know. I think I might just pin a room like I really don't even want to do any video period, but I'm like, do you think this is upstairs? 00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Two of our bedrooms are that dark blue color actually that you have. 00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I, I like these just, um, when I, when I look at, like the contrast and the energy of the light in, in some videos, I also like there was, they have this like bright yellow and I just think the energy of the bright yellow is really nice. Um, and I, I think about energy and I think about the color psychology, uh, a lot yellow is calming and trust, blue is trust also. anyway, um, see, here's your Google doc. I'm not open to that. And then also, I think it was just a voice message that I left you about what we could do or maybe we just talked about it. 00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I don't know. I love it in the voice. 00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Did I put it in a Google Doc? About the offer? Let me look at the amount of shared stuff that you shared with me. Okay. I think it was in a voice message to be honest. 00:27:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, I just put a path for making $50k a month. There it is. It's a different doc. Oh, Tina Partnership. Yeah. I've been almost manic this week, but yeah, so I went there like SL, $6,000, a written custom business, ops slash system slash team plan, and a custom marketing plan. We'll create it together on a two hour call with them. We do not fulfill it. it's created, right? We don't build anything. just tell them how to do it. But then what we could do is upsell them into a group coaching where they get support or it could just not be group coaching if we don't want to have like a group offer with them and anything. But the follow up is, you know, 200 or $400 a month and I would go more with like 400 a month for ongoing support through voxer and email. So like they could ask a question and be like, I don't know what to do about this or I'm stuck. got a row of blocks. So maybe they need some brainstorming. Maybe they need us to build a formula for them to do some calculations because they can't put the things together. But what I'm thinking here is before, so we can sell it to anybody, but we'll give them some criteria for us. have to have this, right? So anything that basically spells out, you know how to make money and you're not going to risk losing your home or not beating your kids in order to make this payment and investment with us. We could do some financing offer as well, but I still would want to put this in here. And I do think we should offer financing because I think that people that we want to help most might need that kind of help. So then what we do is we have them fill out a very thorough thing form and it will help us understand what their assets are. 00:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What do you have that you have sold before? 00:29:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many times did you sell it? How much did you make over what period of time? How did you get leads and eyeballs on it? Do you currently have, you know, a flow of eyeballs, even if it's five a month on your offer? Do you have a social media following? Do you post blogs? you have a group like all of the potential ways that you have organic traffic coming to your offer? Do you You have money for an ad budget. If so, what is it? You know, we want to be able to spend at least a couple dollars a day because we could do something with that little bit, even if it's on YouTube. Are you comfortable with making videos? Have you made videos? you have a video editor? All of these types of things, right? OK. We're going to tell them $6,000 plus. You should set aside roughly $1,000 budget for contractors and ads. So we're going to minimize everything. But I think that we could get, if we needed graphics or video editing, we could get that done. And we could give them a decent ad budget with an extra $1,000 that they spend. And so part of our marketing plan would be taking stock of what they already have and who they have, right? 00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And what their products are and say, OK, and we would do the same thing for them that we would do for us, which is not the best. Sorry, Chin, you want me to start writing this? 00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) in there because I'm not as much an auditory person like I can do whatever you like yes I do have badminton recording so um okay from there too okay okay I lost my train of thought and it's totally okay it's just the way my brain works um so so my thinking was that if we do a really um thorough written intake so if they can't express to us in writing what they have if they can't answer the intake form well we already know we're gonna have issues being successful with them okay okay um but but if they have something so we're we're going to say okay here is the most leveraged offer that we see and I would do for everybody a hard-brid thing so I would say I would um now we would do this together right and and and come to some sort of agreement kind of riff a little bit before we talk to them but I think our target should always always be help them find kind of the tier thing which is done for you done with you and DIY type of version meaning there's either a product that you buy yourself and maybe it's not done anything you don't have to do anything maybe it's just a product that you purchase but we want to figure out a value stack where there is a scaling because we want them to get their money back ASAP right and we know that the higher value things generally tend to be a bigger investment and if they were already good at packaging these things together then they wouldn't be reaching out to us so that's my premise is that they're going to need help figure out that option so then what we have to look at and is go okay what would it take to fulfill this what kind of support do you need are you going to need somebody to help you create some graphics for social media or for ads are you going to You need a video editor, know, did you because YouTube ads are going to be the least expensive if you're willing to do it and probably get you the best results in terms of getting leads. Can you write it? Do you need to go hire some copywriting help? you like some AI prompts to help you write stuff because we can help you with that? Well, um, so I think that if somebody, so what we would want to do is figure out what is the baseline of what somebody's doing like, can they, are they already generating or have they ever generated even $2,000 on selling something, selling a service or product? Maybe that number needs to be like for my clients, it's a minimum of your earning $50,000 a month and that's minimum because Even at that point generally their profit margin suck and they're not managing money. Well, it's just this weird Growth period generally it's not super optimized They hustled to get there and they're like I can't get out of this thing Whereas it's lower they're more conservative with the expenses because they need everything to count so Yes, so I thinking about what the parameters are and giving some really clear examples So a person who fits it can look at it and go yeah, that's me. 00:34:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's totally me. 00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh That makes sense and then so We would do a profit calculator Well Okay, so I have different versions of this and I just plug in people's numbers and There are formulas that you can do change. So I'm going to duplicate this. This was actually something I had been thinking about for myself. Um, so let's say, um, Maria, Tina, um, joint business plan, um, and offer creation. And it's 6,000. And if we sold three a month, um, then we come over here. There's no attrition. So that's just how much it would make us. But then let's say that we upsell them to, um, private access, and it's monthly and it's $400. It's those same people. So, um, oh, sorry. Yeah, sold is three. And it's price annually, price monthly, 400. And so then that would come over, I'm thinking it was wrong with that one. Yeah, price annual, price quarterly. Yeah, anyway, we'll just do it this way, 1,200. It'll go populated like it's supposed to. It's not there's something wrong with my formula. But anyway, fix the formula. But we could do something like this with them and show them, OK, here's all you have to do. And so you play around with prices a little bit until you get a number over here that matches what they needed to be. And the first target is going to be how much money they need to make. And the second target is going to be how do they see how their investment in us has returned to them. At the very least, they should make their money back. But, you know, we'd like to at least double their return on investment and that shouldn't be hard if we're selecting the right people and just giving them the value is the clarity and the confidence. So most of the time people have stuff and they're like, yeah, but I don't, should I do this? Should I do that? And so they're not clear. And when they make a decision, they're still, I don't know if I should do this. I'm picking something. And so they hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, they don't pull the trigger, they do it and they're like two days later, it's not working and they abandon ship and they go do something else. They don't have confidence, but you can't abandon ship. It takes weeks most of time to get an offer to convert, get the ads to work well, to dial the audience in that type of thing and start actually making money. It can be different, it depends on where you're running ads, depends on how good your ad is, depends on your offer, it depends on your pricing. along all of these different things. But on average, I would say roughly around six weeks before you really get some kind of traction. So anyway, and so we can look at the different things that they offer and say, okay, so here's where people come in, and maybe it's a $5 offer. How many people do you need to make X? And if that conversion rate percentage is 2% up to the next offer, then at this price point, how much does that make? That type of thing. I've seen you do those types of numbers in your posts, but this would be something where we clear it and we'd make all the formulas correct and make sure that they're working. And so like lead magnet here, leads per month, let's say it's 500 eyeballs on there, cost per lead is, we'll say it's $2, convert to product, we'll say it's, so if you did a $3 offer, you got like 50% right? 00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Conversion was 20%. Well, it's 29%. 00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 29%. Price of product was $3. And so average cost probably, why not? I definitely average value per lead. Oh, yeah. So if they upsell, but then you had a $25 offering and more converted to that, right? 00:39:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Well, the average order value one day or value was about $30 as well. But then within 30 days, like they're on a thing to buy a $1,000 or $4,800 thing, but we've never ran it long enough to calculate, you know, what the conversions were on that. 00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So there are some things missing in here because I was doing it as an exercise and then I stopped, but we could create something like this where we screen share and we walk them through and we would populate it with information from their intake form. They already told us about their products and they already and we would have gone and looked at them So we'll do a little research before getting on the call so that we can make that two hours and be done We're done. 00:40:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah Well, I walk people through on today's it's okay if I share screen. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, me stop. I'm sure what I got I walked through and maybe we make an amalgamation of stuff But I walk people through today like a customer journey map, right? Like and actually was giving examples one was even yours PTM Maximizer and say you offered a six and six score of six figures six months. Okay, whatever free school please example and I share with them my you know journey map here, but then it goes into a Like this is rated live on the call with one of the people today So then it goes into a value ladder like this kind of a high-ticket ascension thing from low ticket So yeah, so her case it wasn't free. This is this was your micro offer So basically, where's your micro offers? hers was Facebook ads for financial advisors, let's say it's 1440, and then what's your order bump? 27, it doesn't have to be in order but this could just be upsell or whatever. So maybe that's better if I just say upsell, upsell one. And then I'll just, just for the remedy, I'll just take up 100 deals, pack of the safe proven, Facebook and IG proven templates. And then I asked her what does she want next, her lifestyle? Cause she does have a hot done for you stuff, like, but she said, I'd like to select her 1000 of course, that's more passive. So yeah, let's create the 100K scale fast systems on nine seven. So then it fills all this, populates this out, right? So did you build this? Yeah. Nice. So yeah, and also I have a whole ad challenge calculator, all that stuff too. then here if we work backwards so let's work backwards how much do we really want to make and she said she wants to make 15 grand a month so okay so we weren't just played to the numbers everything in blue is what you change so well let's say um you want seven sales of a thousand and and that's almost 7,000 here right let's just for easier number let's change just a thousand so i'm a graphical person right so i like seeing graphically what it is uh oops i love that so step 300k skills this is so so say we got seven sales that's seven grand and then okay well how what's the agreement going to be of the people that bought up cell one um it could be of people who just bought the micro carbon can skip step two but i like to have it up so on yeah so so this is five percent so so so in order to make 7,000 here we need 140 people here right the five percent and then that's um you know total revenue here would be 380 because the Facebook and IG templates was 27. could always change that price point and that changes this too. And it's like, okay, what's the conversion rate, people for $27, people who bought the $14, you know, Facebook ads for financial buyers, what's the conversion rate needed? An order of $1 should convert at 30 to 50% or else you're bad, you know, and an upsell should convert at about 30%, especially since it's only $27. So, 40% is very, very conservative. That's going to bring in this money and then how many, you know, sales of this micro-off you need 350 sales. So, that's a 10% conversion rate because it's only $14. Again, this could change drastically if it's like 3%. So, that's for $15,000. So, how many page visits do you need? $3,500. I have a whole ad calculator. Basically, if you're paying, say, this could be all organic, first of all, or joint ventures, know, people have your email. I'll give you a 50% commission on the front end or whatever, or it could be, hey, you're paying a dollar or $2 per click, then you can figure out your ad spend as well. So still good. If you're paying $2 per click, $7000 to double your money when it's almost passive. That's cool. So that's what we have. then like when we do it list, so moving is something pretty like this. I did your PT maximizer, say, okay, you have a school. So, so, uh, 100 days to 10k. So no less up that one. Is it here? Yeah. So I was like, okay, your value ladder was you had a school group, and you have a private time energy maximizer, 20 bucks, and then you've got 6,000, you know, 6,000 a third course and that 6,000. So wherever the course name is, right? So, so two sales, you know, that's that's 12 grand, say 5% of the people to buy profit time energy maximizer. buy it. So the thing that's wrong with this is that you could skip this middle one and just have two steps. Like, so 5% of these people, 267 people buy it, right? But anyway, say you have a 15% of your free school community buy your $20 thing, then you only need 267 people in your free school community to produce 12,800 a month, sort of. Anyway, so yeah. Yeah. 00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love that. Yeah. Video came back and I'm like, oh, I just moped. 00:45:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. But I guess the biggest thing is, so what's the promise? 00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, always work backwards. 00:45:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like, we're going to learn each other how we each work. But what's the ultimate promise? We're giving them like, for these guys, they're promises like five figure months, right? So in a six week course, they gave them all the tools to create test optimized. They had a community. Coaching forward to our calls a week, which is a lot. I wish they had accountability. Again, accountability partner who supports you on a daily basis, support by the community and chat. But there was no done for you stuff there either. And if we come back to, there's. 00:46:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, there's two articles one on one or group group. 00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) was the price? Yeah, group. 00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:46:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. 00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. What was the promise? 00:46:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You. They, they kind of are promising. So here they're levels. They have the free community. They have this mission five, six weeks. A self-employed person, you can grow your monthly sales in a relaxed manner to five digit figures. So they're promising five figures a month, whether it's 1000. Wait, no, is that 10,000? so 10,000. Yeah, they're promising 10k months then. Actually, their YouTube video was called YouTube. They had a YouTube. to video. I think it had the word 10k in it. Yeah, become part of the school revolution, learn how to easily make 10 to 15k a month with one hour day. That's, that was their promise. 00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so I think that the promise is that we cut your time to actually launching your products like by 80 or 90 percent and actually make sure you do it with clarity and confidence. Because if you're trying to come up with a business plan yourself and figure out the offer, the offer is one of the hardest things for people to figure out, to figure out the price points. We could offer, so not only the offer but the hook, right? Because it's going to happen in our heads where we're going, this is why somebody would want to buy this. So the hook for the coffee is going to come out. The USP is going to come out. 00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) We will help you define your USP. 00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We will help you define, so in your offer, that's going to be the price points, the potential order bump, upsell one, upsell two, so an entire value stack, as well as a way to create where possible. We have to put a caveat, a recurring subscription revenue, MRR for you. There is no, we can't guarantee you're going to make sales. Now we can also offer to create an ad set for them, just some really basic stuff. You've got Canva skills, I've got Canva skills, we've got people, when you put the hook, like we have some kind of templated meaning, I mean, there's just a really basic thing, there's the kind of glory shot, there's a picture of whatever the product is, or a screenshot of the result, or it depends. and all of the product is by far, right? And then a headline and then a call to action. We could do that in our sleep. So we could just go ahead and create it. We could have some different Canva templates or get a low cost person to do this for us and build that in, right? So we're gonna invest maybe bucks having so many creative graphics. But ultimately we should have somebody who's working for us build a library of ad graphics that we can use and just rotate through, changing up the color scheme, dimensions, things like that, depending on the platform. We would also give them channel marketing, channel advice, right? Here's how you put this up to Instagram. Here's and we would tell them, so like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and then Twitter, potentially LinkedIn, depending on who it is. And, basically say, okay, here's the version of the content that you use for this, this, this, and this, give them advice. And that's it. We're structuring everything for you, but also, so a lot of times, people are like, oh, I can't. I don't have anybody to help with this. I don't know how to we'll write a copy for you. You and I can rip copy out, but it is correct. We can recommend copywriters to you so you get access to our Rolodex, right? We'll introduce you to somebody to hire for copy for graphics, for video editing, for any of the things that you need. So you get our our service provider, Rolodex. And then, like, so now you have of a plan by two marketing and business mavens with a combined nearly 60 years worth of experience in business and a top level experience, making a lot of money and in a sustainable way and integrity. Right? So we've seen we've both generated millions for others tens of millions of hundreds millions from over a million for myself personally while barely working really and taking care of my kids. So what we're doing is in the matter of two hours taking all the stuff that they've had and they've been thinking about and will create multiple versions of the offer, right? Because you're The document, the calculator that you just had did that, mine does it where you can kind of mix and match, like here's the different things that you can offer. Some people will take this, people will take that type of thing, so a different kind of offer stack. We could help them define their avatar so they know who they're marketing to so that they can dial in their messaging and get really clear on their messaging. It's probably too expensive for us to pay for a similar web, if we have a few people buying this, I would love to have an account of similar web and look at their competitors and figure out how they could stand up there. 00:52:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let me ask you a question, why do you like similar web so much versus just doing like a typical, like, like, I And I'm just riffing with you here because you can see where they're paying for ads that you can't necessarily see in a Google search. 00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so like there might be a place that they're running ads and spending a lot of money that you can't tell on a Google search, which means your buyers are there and you know that because because I tell them to do a abundance analysis right where you just competitive analysis, basically, where they I line competitors, what their headline headline benefits are, but I get what you're saying, so they know that that's great too. And it's probably better for somebody who's got a lot more money to spend and who can go, you know, spend money in these areas where it, but it's basically just a potential pools of customers that you can't identify. 00:53:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So it's not just who your competitors are and what their offer is, but it's true. 00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) are they getting their customers from? 00:53:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yep, yep. 00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's really just market research, but yes, yeah, so and we would do that ahead of time and bring that to them to the call We wouldn't spend our time doing research on the call what we would do is show them everything that we came up with and Spend all the time making sure that they're really clear on what we figured out Hmm, I think we could do that in an hour of our own time before the calm. Yeah so They're coming away with like I can do this and then though so We would recommend and say 90% of people are going to want the follow-up because you're going to have questions and You know, this is a this is the plan, right? is $6,000 is plan It's not the support, but the support is only $400 a month and you get access to us through water If you want another call, could have all a cart kind of price for getting on a call with us. That needs to fall within our effective hourly rate of time that we're willing to do. Because the difference with the call is now I have to block off time on my calendar and we have to coordinate, whereas with Boxer I don't have to do that. So that is why Boxer can be so inexpensive. But they get the same quality really. You don't get the feeling of they've got us on a call and we've locked up our time. We have to tell them we can't make a promise that you're going to get your money back. You can make a promise that you're going to have experience that is worth the money. Because everything that we're going to teach you about your own stuff, about the offer, about how to launch it, about how to pay for support. who, who to get support, we can even make that connection, we're going to save you more than $6,000 worth of time. So let's say your effective hourly rate, theirs, so let's say $6,000, is divided by $50,000. would be 120 hours. And if you think about that, you know, somebody's, how many months do people generally spend before, like, while trying to think about product and put it together. If they actually even launch it, could Karina have launched the stuff that she did without you? right, okay. yes, we're going to show that, but we're also going to show what are the odds of and the statistics of my daughter. Also, I just realized I am missing, I just missed a train. Oh, no, did you go to it? No, I need to do this. But. I can't see the doc now so I lost my train of time. 00:57:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm going to reach, reach, get, get, go. 00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, yeah. statistically, most people will. Hum and ha about trying to create an offer and it can take them years. To launch something. So they generally make their money. Just kind of hustling. And it's not a well thought out offer. It's not scalable. It's not evergreen. So they're constantly launching thing after thing hustle after hustle. They end up taking clients that they don't like just to be able to get by. And they're doing it alone. And they don't have the feeling of experts have given you validation for your offer. And I helped you structure it. Like where else are you going to get to like time tested experts who. Like, my clients pay me $1,000 an hour, they're getting two hours, but they're also getting a very specific plan and your time, and we're going to spend time doing our research and preparing for what we ever get to the call, so it's not just two hours of our time, you know, we get on a call. 00:58:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, get it. 00:58:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, yeah, so. 00:58:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It sort of reminds me a little bit of, um, do you remember, did you want redend Kennedy's books ever and stuff? 00:58:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, no, I hear about them all the time. It's not audio, so I can't say, but I can't read anymore very long. 00:58:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) God, yeah, he was like, who I learned marketing. 00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) from ages ago, probably 25 years ago. 00:59:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) he used to have, and I doubt if he doesn't anymore, because he's like, yeah, he's probably tired now, practically. 00:59:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But he's all his stuff. 00:59:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) They worked together. You didn't know that? Yeah, yeah. No, you bought his stuff. 00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But like, I don't think he's like working every day anymore stuff. 00:59:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like he was like, his peak was 20 years back to him by now. That's right. That's right. Yeah. His peak was 20 hours, 20 years ago. Sorry, but yeah, he would have a diagnostic day where he charged 18,000 for a client to come in and spend the whole day with him. And he would map out their entire plan. if he wanted Dan or his team to build it, then that would be another fee, but he would reduce that fee by 19,000 that you paid. 00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, so maybe then we build in the voxel support, because again, it gives us some freedom and maybe it's for 90 days. if you want more time after that, that way the support is built in. 00:59:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's not a sticker shock price kind of thing. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's okay so and it kind of stacks in the value right so it's more of our time um And it shouldn't be more of a commitment and I would want to make sure that they're being successful and And getting through it and maybe after we do a few of them we can figure out how to restructure it um I don't know. 01:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What are your thoughts? I like it because you're right you you this is something you hit nail on the head If I were to share the screen, but I know you better go soon, right? 01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) many more minutes do we have until till 10? 01:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) already missed this training, but I'll I can watch the recording. Okay, so um They are constantly launching thing after thing because they're hustling and taking clients just to get by And they are feeling alone like that. think Is the most emotional aspect of it because that is probably so many people there and that's me too You know, um It's why I spent two thousand dollars in a micro after thing. And I'm very good at this. 01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I need help that much. Then I'm just like, no brainer, take my money. You know, there are other people. And so, yeah. 01:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, and it's bespoke. Like we can kind of make it bespoke because we're not saying, well, correct me if I'm wrong, you're not thinking of the path that we're building a micro off of them, right? Like it's whatever fits their needs, right? So it's bespoke because it could be a via self funnel. It could be just a YouTube video. Like, I don't think I shared with you, but one of my friends, Carrie's doing the most amazing thing. Well, is it it's okay if I digress to another avenue, but it's just good data point for what we're teaching. So, Carrie is a guy that paid 15 grand to Ravi Abubala to scale his company. He teaches a clean business opportunity, which is meaning he teaches people how to start a remote cleaning business and he's the real McCoy. So I was this customer services manager at where Avi's company, this is a few years back. And Kari asked for a refund. He's pissed off because he's just like, you guys just want to throw Facebook ads at this to be self on it. But I'm telling you, organic LinkedIn is what worked for me. How come you're not teaching really much? He's like, the only person that ever added value here in this company was Maria. You know, so we kept in touch, right? We're good friends. And also he's, he's, he, he of went down a dark hole after that and just took a off and just, you know, he's very Christian as well. So he, that's why we stay in touch. And he was, anyway, it was all good. But to make a long story short, he just continued his organic thing and he goes, we're out. So six months ago, I'm just going to do TikTok and I can't believe in 30 days. I actually made more money than the last six months. He just went live every day on TikTok, just talking about, yeah. 01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) me tell you what I'm wrong. 01:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think we should do that. I think so too. And then with that, well, this is where it gets interesting. With that confidence that he built and probably got boy in bed, Messer, he then went. to YouTube but not post every day or maybe not even every week but he created the most amazing YouTube organic funnel I've ever seen and he shared it with me. It's a like hour-long training but it's not like a webinar like traditional five-step webinar this is what you do the bold prompt of a lot. It was pure teaching but this is where his magic comes in. He shows his face and he's talking the video, hey look this works for me. I'm doing this is how much money making. I've all these other testimonials people doing really well with it so let me just walk you through how to start your own remote cleaning company. He goes and he opens up a Google Doc and he's got all the steps and the words to it everything so it's like a business plan of how to start a remote cleaning company and he goes listen I'd love to share this follow-along document with you underneath this YouTube video in the description just click on it all you have to do is enter your email and you will get this like he gives away the document right and then of course he's under on the thank you page giving the document click here for the Google Doc. Actually, it's a notion template underneath it. He says, if you'd like to call for me to help you with this, you know, we do have a course for this. So it was a very, very pure value, so many comments on that video saying you're the first person that's done a YouTube video or a webinar that's actually given value, this is so valuable, I can go off and do this on my own even without you, but, and then people go with him. So he's now selling a $10,000 a day to 5k packages a day through this organic funnel. Now he's going to add more fuel to it by doing Instagram lead ads or Facebook lead ads that take him to that YouTube video, but it's that YouTube video. It's different than anybody else in the marketplace is doing. He's basically given so much away. 01:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. There's a lot of, I mean, Bob Berg talks about go giving, right, the go-giver stuff, and, the thing, and that's why I've thought about, you know, I would just give away the profit time and do max. because it teaches people what to do, but if they know that I can do that for them in an hour for free, why wouldn't they spend money with me if they've got money to spend it? Yeah. So we could do that exercise, you know, make it a video where we take somebody through it live and, you know, make it a real-time thing and offer it to somebody in the group, say, hey, this is what we want to do. want to make this a video. It's going to be on YouTube. you know, you're, you have to be willing to answer these questions. You can look at it in advance to know if you're okay with that, but this is what we want to do. And then the other thing that we could do is we could do one of these offers, free offer reasons, and do that with somebody. You know, somebody who can will take that and just like, thanks, I'll just go do it myself. Great. We don't need everybody. We don't like to force it. Well, the month, you know, so let's say 200 people see it and 196 of them do it themselves. 01:06:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And four people say, I need Tina and Maria to do it for me. 01:06:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know what I mean? So that's the power of abundance. And I do think that that's actually a much better model. I think that you get higher quality followers and bands that way. Yeah, I think that you they tell more people about you. And I think that's where, and also when there's this is what I know about people that have a lot of money, there's no barrier to entry and they can see everything that you know. They'll just reach out to you and they'll just say, look, I they'll offer you money. They'll say, I want to work with you. Here's a whole lot of money. Can I get some of your time because they already know, you know, and you didn't just give this away for free. Yeah. Yeah. And we, I really do think though that TikTok is the thing. I think, I think it's a fresh audience. think that are a lot of people who don't know anything about anything. So I don't think they're brainwashed. Um, internet marketers in Facebook and Instagram is the same because it's not the same. It's definitely different audience, the different people. But meta knowing what meta knows about everybody kind of puts people in this echo chamber of similarity. And TikTok is different. It's a completely separate algorithm with different data points of different, well, different algorithm. And then YouTube. So I would want to create the lives on on TikTok. And then so YouTube doesn't care about consistency. TikTok does and frequency. Very, very much. algorithms are about going live very frequently and when people are on and interacting with them. YouTube cares about how long people watch your content so quality because when they're serving up and it's just like you know SEO with Google like if you're bouncing up their pages they're not going to rank you high it doesn't matter if you stuff all the keywords in there if people aren't saying page then obviously they're not happy with what YouTube has served up and people won't stay on YouTube if they go search for something and YouTube gives them a video that's boring they don't like it whatever so they care about that you create it does not matter how consistent it just matters that the content is good yeah yeah so if we create that offer and so two videos that we could do is walk through the PTE maximizer with somebody and just gift it to somebody who has Sunday thing, leverageable, where they're like, because they're already making money. Maria, like anybody else is like, I've been doing this a while, I make money. But I don't feel like I've just like, I'm crystal clear on somebody like, I get up and I know what I'm working on every day. I don't stress about it. The money is there, money easily, even when I don't know what I'm doing, I don't spend my will too much. Because I know what my most leveraged things are. And I get to it. Because once I've learned it, I always learn it. You're not going to stop forgetting that. most people aren't that way. So that's the gift that we give somebody, but they have to have something that is clear, like a real estate agent showing houses versus making phone calls. They needed to have somebody else make the phone calls. They should be showing houses. That's like a sales call. So a salesperson doing sales calls versus writing copies. Somebody else should be writing the copy. 01:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) They should be on the call because that's where the magic is. 01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. That's everything. For some people, it might just be creating videos, creating YouTube videos, creating TikTok videos. So your guy that you just talked about, his thing would be teaching and making sure that people actually know what they need to know so that they want to come and buy the things for them. So it's basically just informing his audience and that goes to people through the level of awareness by teaching them in different things about their business. So anyway, so we could create a really quality video walking somebody through that exercise and we can deal it a few times. So you've got a few different versions of the video. We can break that up into little shorts that we put on TikTok. We could break it up. We could make it a long, you know, whole-contained video on YouTube with some shorts also. And we could put it out too. We could put the bits, know, to the other platforms. I think if we focused on TikTok for live engagement, YouTube for low-cost leads, low-cost, high quality, targeted leads, think it's been very little money and do very well if we've got a great offer, and if we're demonstrating our value through the videos. 01:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, which, yeah, I always believe like the Eve Hutton thing, like when I open my mouth, they listen to me. I always know that, right? But it's just getting visible, right? Still about getting visible. So, TikTok for live interaction or engagement, as it is. Yeah. YouTube. Long-term growth. didn't even say those exact words, but something like that. 01:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) TikTok is so for low-cost. high quality leads targeted, but the content that we put there would be longer and higher value in that it's a complete picture, like girl trainings. 01:12:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, so now Kari, here's his channel, Boring Business Growth Hub and Boring Business. I love that. Yeah, yeah, he's really funny. You'll love him. He's a really cool guy. Um, so yeah, so anyways, like he's he keeps pumping stuff out, but here's build, build a tent. In this video, we will overview the process of obtaining a trial. That is an ad. Hold on. A version of REX. All right, you guys. So in this video, we are going to be talking about building a. So he looks like a nice guy. He is. He created a four part series. And then if you haven't watched part one of this training, make sure you do go here. Like, so it's like a flywheel. Welcome to my YouTube channel, we show you how to build a remote cleaning business. It's just so good. his promise is $10,000 a week, by the way. don't think he has a guarantee on it anything, but he certainly has people who achieve it. But again, he goes follow along, so he goes, share the resources you will need, grab every single one of them. So he's got a follow along document here. you click here, and it comes over here, get you copy the follow along document, get my document. So we could totally create this kind of, I call it a mouse trap too. 01:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is our cheese. And I've been seeing that too, like that exactly, that's the model. And what I love about TikTok, and you can do it with YouTube too, is that we can join each other. So you can go live with another person. Because my biggest thing is I don't want to talk to myself. I don't want to talk to you, the ethers. I love to talk to Maria, and I think that we would riff so good. There might be other people that we might want to do additional conversations with them, so one great thing about TikTok is you're doing that type of thing with other people, so you get their audience, they get your audience, so if we're strategic about it and we're not overlapping the exact type of stuff, or just having abundance mindset know that it doesn't matter if we're not overlapping, because some of their people will like us better, some gave them all the gifts by letting them see that there's something else available. 01:14:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, and he's making money, he says he's making about 4,000 a month now recurring, just because people are, this is his go-high level version that you know, say even if you don't buy my course, here's the booking software mandatory. cannot automate your business without it. We will use the software during the training 14-day free trial, and this is his go-high level snapshot for a cleaning business. 01:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love that, and that is the other thing I want to do like I hate spending money where it's not making me money but I think that there is a lot um available in I mean go high level will pay for itself very quickly if we create our own snapshot and sell it as low cost so um I've got a girl that could help build that honestly we could probably build some of ourselves but uh and I don't know what they would be but like your micro offer whatever we come up with for these people um maybe we could say for the first um 10 people who buy this will build the automations for you in high level and if you we can put it in your own high level account don't have one get it through us yeah now we've got some people um buying it and uh so we could spend a little bit of money but we'd have the money coming in where we could spend that little bit and I've got a great girl that we could do it I have the ability to build some stuff too we can go with Dan so Anyway, we could make some money quickly with that, I think. 01:16:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think so. This could easily become, if we wanted to, 25K product, this is better than any masked maniac. I still have my friend, a frickin Russell Brunson, 25 grand for their inner circle mastermind, whatever. all they just taught them how to do a challenge, here's your challenge course, and you could get on group coaching calls, that's it. 01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that's all they provided. said to me, what the hell? Which they ripped off of Seth. What? Which they ripped off of Seth, from Seth. 01:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, no, wasn't that kind of challenge. No, it was like a live, five day challenge, like I used to teach and stuff. Oh, okay. 01:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because Pedro Adao taught Russell Brunson how to do stuff, but Pedro got it from Seth. 01:16:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Pedro, well, Pedro teaches live challenges, like Pedro got it from Jason Flatt, and he got it from me. Because back 12 years ago, and. And Jason said it, Maria, you're the OG of doing challenges. 01:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You had 30,000 people go through your page. Girl, how did I never hear about you? 01:17:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I know, because like I didn't continue with one thing. Like I just shot an object. 01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) did so many different things. 01:17:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) that's how. And so Jason created Pedro, because that was when I was doing stuff with Jason about eight years ago still. And Jason's like, Maria, I just got to tell you something. said, I'm going to help Pedro break out into the big group space, because I hate how it's all close knit group and stuff. He's done a few live challenges like you, but I know you're the OG, but he's kind of using a new modern way of Facebook groups and stuff. go, Jason, I'm using Facebook groups now too. Like when we used to do it eight years ago, yeah, we used just go to webinar. And that's it, because Facebook groups didn't exist back then. But I was, oh, I didn't realize that. But Peter had already paid Jason like 25 grand to get coached on it. So Jason then introduced him to all the other people. So I'm like, oh my God. So that's how Pedro got all the big name clients. 01:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) initially to and then that success breeds success right so we had this first few wins big name points and yeah yeah so there is and and to me this is not a shiny object again I like multiple options first of all because I do so it satisfies the shiny object by having different things I could bounce to but they're all within the same room so we could do a challenge around an offer like your marketing offer and we could teach people to do what we're going to do for somebody else right so if you want to put your own brain power in it but if you've got enough money that you would rather us do it so that you're really confident you did it right yeah and you want that one-on-one time because I would do that I don't I don't want to be in the group I don't want to have the group conversation not when I have money buy of money I just want to get it done fast right so some people don't have the money but they need the path and and that would be you are kind of give back thing. We put them through a challenge, sell it cheaper, but it's the same thing we're doing. So we're not jumping around from type of offer to type of offer. It's all about get started, get clear, and leverage and optimize your offer for a sustainable business that you keep running. It's an evergreen offer. So back to the fundamentals, like we're not here if you want to do launch after launch after launch after launch. You have to have something of value that has lasting quality and value. If you want to do the launch fine but we're not talking to you about that, we're not suggesting it because that's rework, then you're building yourself into a job of having to come up with the next thing. We don't advise that. That's hustle and grind mentality that will take a toll on your health, mentally, physically, emotionally on your relationships, and we don't. on anything to do with that. best of luck to you. Bye. Yeah. Um, now, if you would like to build a business that can support you, that can allow you to fill your purpose in life and serve the people that you feel called to serve, but be able to make money where you're not stressing about it and worrying about it. And then build something that has a compounding benefit where you're earning more month over month, year over year. Let's talk. Here's the system for that. Here's what you need to know, figuring out how to make it work takes a while. So, you need emotional support. That's what the group is for. You need structural support. That's what our plan is for. And then you just need to keep on keeping on until it works. And we've got the experience to show you what happens if you get stuck in a pitfall and you can come to us for help. That's what your money goes for. 01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You just create, you just take that part of the recording. 01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's the manifesto. 01:21:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I love it. It's awesome. I loved what you said when you feel called to serve. So I love it. That's a good way to end this call. know you got to go. 01:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So okay. So I get you supposed to so happy. I feel like our calls are so productive and we get a little bit clearer, but I also feel like we're going to give so much to people anyway. 01:21:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So what are the next steps? you want me to put together like a small offer dock and then you just go at your magic and just revise it and stuff? 01:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That would be the best thing for me. if we were to like this, that would be great. 01:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So it comes out of me verbally, very quickly and pretty clearly. 01:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Putting it onto a document for whatever reason, generally I will pause. But if somebody starts the document, then I'm like, oh no, this, I did this. And then the structure gets really clear, really fast. And then we pick steps, tasks, assignments, due dates, execute, and then voila. 01:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. So I'll do that this afternoon. I'm just going to go and pick up my dog. And then I got my nails appointment and uh no I love it because because then we literally probably could launch this early next week like um I mean if we get it done earlier Friday Saturday we could but I think I'm traveling this weekend I'm going go see my sweetheart and he's taken to me to a football game so I'm I'm being out of pocket for a few days or not see your sweetheart what he doesn't live where you live where does he live no he's in Arizona Vegas he's got a few different houses but generally Arizona Vegas gotcha gotcha I used to have a house in Arizona Vegas in my real estate days when I was flipping luxury homes um so okay so is Monday feasible if you want to do what's um Monday's always kind of rough for me anyway because I have a lot and I'm not getting in until like one o'clock in the morning so let's do Tuesday okay that's cool and what we can do uh yeah so I'll start on the google doc and we'll just refine it refine it and uh this will be some gosh I'm even thinking maybe I think, well, so a lot. We got to maybe limit it so we make sure that it's good. 01:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) As we get clear on it, once you set an intention and you get really clear on it, people magically and it's not magically, it's synergistic, and I think it's God. But it's asking you shall receive, and you can call it lot of attraction, doesn't matter, once you get clear on it, things just start happening. So if somebody comes along and you're like, I have this perfect offer for you, and you're want to sell it, just sell it, and then we'll fulfill it and we'll figure out the details. I'm just saying, in that amount of time, knowing you and the conversations that you have and because we got clear, there may come an opportunity where you're just like, I could sell this to this person right now, sell it, get paid, we'll fulfill it, we'll deal with money up later. 01:23:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Got it. Yeah. And then also just go back to the thing about Seth and this counseling, yeah, like I know my friend Cindy Mulcaney, she loves Seth and I I remember she thought Seth's thing, that's why I bought it. And she said she was going to see that's an interesting person for me to reach out to. She never launched it. Like, she wanted to launch the thing like Seth. And she's doing other stuff, don't be wrong. She's making money and doing good stuff. But I just got a feeling it's like her, that would be a perfect client, too, because it's like, I mean, it launched it. Like, you said you're going to do it. You bought one Seth thing, all excited about it. And instead, she went all down the path of the AI, which is still good. And she's offering some kind of AI coaching offer, and a go high level affiliate. But still, it's sort of like, you know, she believed in something and then she never launched it. So what happened? we're here to go in for helping people in between that. 01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, I think that's the issue. So people have been Yes, it is. It's doubt and it's too much work, and I need help. I don't know how to hire people. Seth can't hire people. Seth cannot manage a business. 01:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He can't. He will never happen. 01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm not talking bad about him. His genius is just he cannot, will not do it. He will jump to all kinds of other things in order to avoid actually structuring things. And he doesn't even know where to start. And so literally saving him. And we don't, we see people like that and we don't know because we see their strengths. But that's the truth is that most people are thinking and so beneath their potential because they need support of some sort. So here's, we could do $10,000 done for you. And here's why I think that would be a good thing. We could take that money, put it into getting support in a person building an automation. But then we're building a snapshot at the same time that we own. So we give them their version of it and then we keep a generic version of it. Doesn't have their copy, doesn't have their anything. But, so I don't think we build too much work for ourselves if we do that for you, because we can whip out, like I can write copy, we could just literally talk about an offer, the copy will come out of my mouth. 01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm pretty sure you could do the same thing if we do some research. 01:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we would literally just have to transcribe it and then go have it edited into it, it'd be so easy. We could do the same thing with the email follow-up sequences, like we could spend maybe 10 hours for $10,000, you and I would both be well paid. You'd have enough money for a couple of months, comfortably, well, if you got it all, if you didn't, we have it one month and we could sell anyway. So I'm just telling you, those are some options to think about, because I know you know people, and I think God is going to give you, I think he's going to show you who you need to talk to and who you can help. So, you're not allowed own. You're not doing all the work. You're not going to be overburdened. If the person that you know needs this is available, sell it, take the money, get paid, know that you're taking terms, we will fulfill it very quickly. 01:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Thank you. Okay, let's go. So, send me the recording when it's ready, when I have time, that'd be great. So I could take a look at the notes and I'll create the Google Doc. I'll have that done by the end of the day today for sure. Okay. have to craft it, not like done done. 01:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I will go to do that right now and then launch my missionary meeting because this is devotional so I want the prayers and all that goodness. 01:27:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Nice. All right, all right, talk to you later. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey. 00:00:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Hey. 00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How are you? 00:00:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Oh, I'm good. I'm good. a little bit of running around today, this morning. Yeah, your ends up kind of stuff. But I've finished up a quiz automation in those building or updating for 10 and get that over to him to review before I publish it. 00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Awesome. How's that going with him? 00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) mean, it's going well as far as I can. As far as I can tell, you know, we his Facebook group has like 7,800 members and it's hard to get good engagement, good response or get steady responses on the post. So the ones that do best or when it's like, hey, I've got this cool thing I use in my gym, who wants that kind of thing. And I did a post like that last week and said I need get like 50 comments to share the ads that Tim runs to bring in new leads and appointments and that's up to 77 comments now. Oh, Yeah, so that was good. So I think I'm just going to start doing more of those. And then we're. I'm just doing a Black Friday promotion. Well, it's not his Black Friday promotion. It's a webinar, where we're selling a done for you Black Friday promotion for Jim. So that's happening in the middle of October that I'm teaching that. So I've written a lot of the, most of the promo copy leading up to that and then just updating some language on the registration page. 00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How long did it take you to get 50 comments? 00:02:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) We got to 50 like in three days. 00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. And what kind of budget did you have for that? 00:02:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) It's all organic. That's awesome. 00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it's in this group. So how's the conversation going around your working arrangement? And how are you feeling about it? 00:03:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) I own my follow-up back to a gross summit So sending is before gross summit. send an outline of of how how it would work with me earning a percentage and at the same time I updated my recurring charge to the three grand And So I didn't even just follow up on that email and and ask him if If he's had a chance to review it He took I guess he's got a cabin somewhere up in North, Arizona and he was there for 10 days or so Available but I've taken some time after the event, but he's back in this week. 00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. So what are you thinking about your conversation? how would you? 00:04:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) How are you framing it in your mind? Well, I later all out in the email. So it's, I want him to respond to that either via email or getting on a call and in the hammering. You know, just talking through the details, but it's like, you know, I want to be, I want to be at 5k or 5k a month for the work that I do outside of, of Titans. And the way I frame it is like, you know, I'll be incentivized because to make that, I've I've got to basically to make an extra 5k a month for, or I'm sorry, to make an extra 2k a month on top of what he's paying me. have to, for the year, I have to sell 400 grand for him. And that would, that would generate 24k for me. 00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:05:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. That's how I talked about it in the, in the email to him. 00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Can I see that? Would you like screen share real quick? 00:05:39 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) I'd love to see what you put together. Yeah, let me find that. Thank you. Can you read that? 00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That sounds awesome. You'd have to be just so greedy and stingy. Thank you. know that. 00:07:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah, I mean, I think it's a it's a good deal. 00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Heck yeah, it is. And so well, I love the way I you did such a good job, like you covered all the points. So you did the simple math, you wrote down the caveat to you wrote down, you know, what applies to what and what doesn't. You like you framed it so simple, so clear. No brainer. I know people are dumb enough to say no to stuff like this. It wouldn't make zero sense. So but then you know what you need to know. If somebody can say no to this, you know all you need to know about them. There's it's not they're not rational. They don't value you. and the work that you do, because by definition, you'd have to have earned it. 00:08:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. So, yeah, exactly. mean, I think that, you know, there's a possibility for somebody to say, another possibility someone would say, no, is that it feels like they're not confident that that we'll be able to get an accurate... No, that's not what I'm saying. Like, for example, this Black Friday promotion that's coming up, you know, Tim's created that webinar. My job is to get people to the webinar. He then sells them on the webinar. And then we've also got, you know, email follow-ups to people who attend and don't buy. And so... And as I'm talking this out and maybe this goes to your point of stinginess, maybe the nicer way I would frame it in my mind is, yeah maybe it is stinginess, it could also be like him thinking, you know, I created the webinar, I'm selling them, and he's just running the promotion. So maybe like a not not valuing, not not seeing the value and the work and effort that gets gets people onto the webinar, I'm totally making this up, this is not anything you said. I'm just trying to like, I mean, some of it comes down, could come down to just like some laziness too, like not wanting to have to think about how much percentage does Chris get, which which I mean I guess to your point would tell would be an important data point for me as well and I mean basically if he may come back and say well there are some more deals I'd want to exclude from this and I'm open to that because I don't know everything about his business I know a good bit but I'm open to the idea that you know I've got a blind spot and I'm a reasonable guy but so we have a conversation if he thinks things other than the gross summit should be excluded and at that point like if we can do a deal then I know I've got a ceiling here with him a 3k a month and and that's sort of like the clock ticking on you know But with me to get me where I want to be. But yeah, I think it's a no-brainer for him. 00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I mean, so right there, highlight it. 24,000 is what you get if you generate 480,000. Yeah, he did all the work or whatever. That's Trump change really for what it is. And like I said, if you want two things or both, stingy or doesn't see how you're that valuable. But getting butts in seat and qualified butts in seats is a real value proposition. You could have the greatest product in the world. You could have the greatest pitch in the world. If there's nobody there to see it, doesn't do any good. If the right people aren't there to see it, doesn't do any good. So that's what you're doing. Yeah. know, it's it's it's brick and mortar business. 00:11:57 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) It's location, location, location, right? 00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Offer in the world greatest pet you greatest from mama pro promotion and you're out in the boonies Nobody's ever gonna see it. Nobody's ever gonna buy it. Okay, so that's what a digital offer is until You have somebody writing the copy and doing the ads you're doing both Two things copy on its own no good without ads and people seeing it Add on its own. Oh good. It's not good copy good offer. So You know, yeah, that is all that is a it's two major services you're offering That in and of themselves That that fee Yeah, anyway, yeah, it is great So yeah, I'll just reply to this email and The just do one more thing in the example so that there's no like sticker shock So when you go 5% of 27,000 he's not doing that much like $1,300 or something like that. 00:13:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) It's like almost all right. 00:13:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we if you look at that and be like, okay, I'm still not even paying you $5,000 if I make $30,000. 00:13:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Right. 00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I would put that number there because you look at it and goes, Oh, you generated $30,000 and I'm still not even paying you that $5,000. 00:13:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) was paying you before. 00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know, yeah, that's a good way to put in parentheses. 00:13:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) $1,300. 00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I would put which brings my total to $4,300. And I think it's like, it's probably probably $13.50. Let me go do this. So what the heck? $27,000 times 0.05, $13.50. So that would be $43.50. And I would put that total there in the example and go, which is still less than the five. 00:14:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) a thousand you were originally paying me monthly. Yeah. 00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's the framing of that. That makes it go. Okay. Like honestly, he should feel crappy because you got downgraded, but you are upgrading everything that you're giving to him. 00:14:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah, he's and he's tossing like more, more, more my way. 00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So are you doing your effective hourly rate calculations when you're doing this work with him? 00:14:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. Well, I know that I want to keep it to five to six hours a week. And like today, I worked, I did two hours working on this infusion self automation and so I knew that tomorrow I won't spend as much time on his stuff. So I calculate your real time. No, I don't have a time chakra, I know, because my morning is my time that I do this kind of work. It's like, I've got my Tim and my Titans buckets. And I usually just write for an hour for Tim. But today, I don't know, because I need to actually build this automation, which I'm, and I documented it for him on a one-pager so that he could just see, because there's a lot of stuff in this automation. And he should see that and recognize what else I can do. What else I can do? Like it's a beast. Yeah, that's also an asset that he owned forever more and also that he could replicate and sell like Yeah Yeah, like this so they had done They had the bones of this built because they've got a they got a quiz they built this quiz Which which like so they they had like this This This built what I went in and did is I created a Nurture sequence to bring people into the quiz And then I'm pulling them out if they've already gone through the nurture sequence and then the big thing they want to sell is called business accelerator and Yeah, and accelerator I know I know and I'm saying be a and I'm in my character advertising, so it's like But Then these people here, if you score in one of these tags in the quiz, then they were putting them into a business accelerator. These were the emails that they had up there and they weren't really ready. I created this sequence here from the promotion that I wrote for them in June or May or June and it's pretty nice. set it up so it runs on specific days so that this promotion is always ending on Monday when people go in and then when they finish it, there is a tag that completed and then I'm giving them a soft docked out here so like not interested in getting my help to hit 30k. a click here or move from this promotion. So they can click that instead of unsubscribing. Right. Takes them to this page. And I even link to the promotion so they can look at it. And when that happens, they get tagged here, soft opt out. And then I'm looping them back into this hold. And inside of this hold, it just holds them for five months. And then kicks them out and then checks to see are they a business accelerator customer. So they go here, if they're not, then I'm going to put them back into the nurture sequence. And then anybody on the list that is not, so I created this check to see if they've been through the nurture sequence. So you can. Not anybody into that and then it'll go and see arcade have they been through the sequence before If they haven't then they're going to go straight into it if they have They're going back into this holding bin For the five months and Yeah, so though like those things are the things that i've built and And Added for him so i don't know that he's looked at the shot but Uh, his partner randy has and and really likes it And so i just put together this Wrote this up this morning so he could read it just to see the flow Like if this wasn't high level that kind of snapshot could be sold for a thousand dollars like that automation in and of itself could be thousands of dollars I get annoyed when people don't value you properly 00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You already made that money drives me nuts. 00:20:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. Yeah. mean, I think Tim's got a lot of money flowing out. 00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I get that. But here's the thing. If you want more to come in, then you pay it to the people who bring it in. Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying and the people that help you keep it or and the people that help you keep getting more out of your existing assets. Like, that's the thing. It's there's a lot, you know, so many majority people are spinning their reel and it's feast or famine and it's their fault because it's the way they operate. It's the way they manage their business and you come in and you bring structure and leverage and consistency, which reduces stress. That stress relief is a real world value. That's a real life quality, real currency, real value, especially because reducing that allows him to operate at his higher level, which is where he is able to make the most money and not go crazy. Like, you want to get in the habit of learning how to express that that's what you bring into the table. And then one of the ways you can do is say, my goal is to block, right, to take off this load. And you can even insert things like, you know, I study psychology, I understand Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And I know that when we're stuck and we're in the vicious cycle, like, we just aren't operating at our highest level. And so when I'm coming to the table and I'm coming to the team, my job is to make sure that there is no, you know, pain and suffering. that we're all operating at the highest level that self-actualization, right? That's where we're delivering the most magic to our clients. That's where we're feeling the most magic ourselves and our teams. That's where the money flows, but not just for us, for our clients. And then they're able to deliver their best version of the product to their customers. And so I don't want you to think you're just getting a copywriter or a guy that does ads. Like, I'm, I bring all of this to the table, and hopefully you've already kind of felt some of that. Like, you want, so you might notice a little bit that it's not so dark anymore, right? But there's a whole level of degree of lightening that happens between coming over the mountain and high noon. It's so subtle that you really don't notice, but there is a distinctive difference in the level of light and warmth that happens in that process from like say 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. 00:23:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Right? 00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) At peak level. And it's so subtle, it's almost imperceptible unless somebody is really paying attention to, oh yeah, look at where the sun's at right now and think about the warmth that it's giving and think about the light it's giving. We don't, we take it for granted, but where would we be without the sun? Right. So it is human nature to just kind of be in the warmth, bask in that light and that glow that is just offered and not notice it. So you have to help people notice it. 00:23:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah, that's a good point. I do remember when I first started, Tim was Vlad and surprise that I knew how to use a diffusion soft. Yeah. and that was just being able to send broadcast demons. Um, but he, uh, will be the first time he's seen me build something a little more advanced. 00:24:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I'd be like, boy, I'm just getting started. 00:24:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) come on. Let's go. Tim is like an expert builder and infusion soft. So I know that he'll appreciate it. 00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, but he didn't have to do this. Like you saved his brain power and like, like, I know you can do this, but I know you got higher level things to do and saving you super power. I like doing that for you, you know, like, maybe don't love doing it. 00:24:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Well, it's, I do enjoy like thinking through, uh, I'm not like, a, uh, a bill. But I do, like, thinking through how to, like, how these automations flow, that is fun for me. But I don't think I'd want to be building these all the time, I'd get, my head would just be too full. 00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are so many people that you can get now that are low-cost overseas that, like, like, five, ten years ago, there was hardly anybody that was good at it. They weren't great at it. They weren't engineers. There are engineer level type automation specialists for $15 an hour, you know, that you can get, who get most of this. And so if you have a few maps and say, okay, go replicate this, but insert this type of which is a lot less moving pieces. and waiting for the campaign to open and to load and to give the attributes and all of that so they can do the actual connections and logic which takes more time and you can just kind of brainstorm it and then you've got basically these different maps and templates but then you're also thinking about the nurturing sequence like it did now you're talking about the customer experience so you this is tip to tail entry to exit your this is not copy this is everything from the beginning to the end other than actually fulfilling or doing the live sales but everything else you are touching touching and nurturing and optimizing and leveraging and that is high high value you're like several people in one for $3,000 a month. Don't just, ugh, don't let me see this bull, okay? All right, all right, right, all right. 00:27:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) So yeah, I got to follow up with him on this, on this email and and yeah, I feel like things were, things were going really well. With, with 10. Everyone seems to be, everyone seems to be happy. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's something to be said for going through it with people though. If, if they will reward you, you know, I've done that a lot of times and you stay, it's just, it's just different. Like I do business different, like we get in and it's like we're putting an elbow grease here in the trenches with people. That is not the most. Leverage thing to do in terms of instant revenue and return, but it is extremely leveraged in loyalty and The the depth of those relationships and how long they last and how long they continue to bless you is Is is very different and for me. They're more fulfilling When you know you brought somebody through it and they know you brought somebody that you helped bring them through it it's it's a whole different kind of thing and You know, you don't you don't just get that in any type of Arrangement, so that's something to think about to you know There's there's always trade-offs in the types of deals in business that we do, but it would be really nice to see you connect with somebody who you know is doing eight figures and Okay, um would like somebody to spearhead marketing and important prove the offer creation and look at what money are they leaving on the table, you know, and just mastermind what's happening. You don't do the copy, you can approve it, right? You don't do the ads, you can approve it, you don't do the automations, but you approve it, like all the resources there, like that would be, that's ideal and you should be getting paid a good amount of money for that, $10,000 a month. They'll be happy to do it because they don't have to think about it, they don't, yes, they're paying for all the resources, but they don't have to manage it, you're managing it well, you're giving them a report of this is what it costs us, but this is what I've made us, know, all you're doing is just getting information from them and then reporting information back and they're getting paid because they built everything up to that point and now they need somebody trustworthy to manage it and that trustworthy is the operative award because there's not a lot of that. 00:30:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yep. Yeah, I point. It's interesting with Tim, know Brian too, it's so easy for me to, I know what the offer is, what they're doing, get a little bit of their personality and their voice and like, I don't run into the same kind of like mental roadblocks doing this for somebody else that I do, like if I was the face, you know, like if someone's coming from me. And I've thought about this quite a bit and there's a part of that whole world of like being, being the guy that. feels, prison is too strong of a word, but it feels to me like I would start to feel trapped of like having to the pressure of like having to be on all the being the face, but I like that because I've got these, these things that come up as like, oh, just doesn't feel fun to me, but at the same time, like when I was doing wookers. I didn't feel that because, you know, the different, a difference there was we were selling this tool and, and I had a customer support team and so if anybody had trouble using the tool, it was just like, send them off over there and I've got, I've got this idea for a software that I've been researching a little bit to see like what's out there, but I first wrote this down when I was getting started to learn a little more about email deliverability and, and I was working with Adrian Savage from email smart who I still work with him in his team was, was solution that would take leads that come in through your regular forms and automatically input them into an infusion soft form behind the scenes so that if somebody is opting in through for lead magnet or even a purchase on a non-infusion soft, and this applies to any ESP, or CRM, but that it would then take that information, put them into, you know, get the tags and everything from the Thrive themes form, put them into a infusion soft in the background as a solution to be able to mail the people who are opting back in on your third party form, and sell that as a 00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) as a as a software solution yeah I mean I wonder I wonder what the demand is for that but I'd like you thinking about SaaS again something I've been thinking about too is is just really kind of different leverage offers so I'm the same way with you know wanting to be the face and always be on I hate it I did a video and I boosted it as an ad on YouTube and it was short and it wasn't even good it wasn't made to be an ad but I did it because I have to push myself out of my comfort zone to an extent I don't have to but there's a lot of leverage in showing up and I want to do that on TikTok but I don't like doing it myself so I found this lady she's been around like 20 years and really I Ideally, it would be somebody like me would be my ideal business partner, because personality, energy, values, language, all of these things are important to me. But being able to have somebody that's in integrity, she's like a female version of a lot of these male marketers that I'm just like, that language is not, but she's not. She was just a woman in man's world and so kind of adopted some of this stuff. But she has been making other people millions and millions she's made millions, but just and she's like mid 50s and she stays home and takes care of her mom and but so much time spending and taking care of other people. And she's but she's all over the board because she's got this hustle mentality. You know what? I can just create some structure for you so easily. And we barely talked and people are like giving her comments like, you're back. You're amazing. Your energy's amazing. You're this. You're that. And I'm like it doesn't take much. I love that. So what I get in return though is she's really great at marketing She's all over the board for herself, but for other people she's really focused Yeah, and she's able to get it done and she loves showing up on video and she has no problem with it And I'm like, you know what we could do to talk lives together And I only have to show up long enough to have a conversation with you You she loves talking about things every morning. She's writing an email every morning. She's doing a video And I'm like, that's amazing like so I'll just let you do most of it I'll do my part and I'll bring something to the table, but she's never been served the way she serves But I would do that you never been served the way you serve and I think Finding that person and they're going to be somebody like you that's just they don't act like a face. Really maybe they do sometimes But they are just consistent and the way they show up or or they're really inconsistent and they in the way that they show up as the face and then they disappear because they are all over the board and so they need a rock like you right they like you know being on video and they like talking and they like promoting but they don't know how to run things smoothly so they're always working they have made lots of money for other people right but not as much for themselves so just starting to like kind of put out your feelers and your intentions to attract somebody like that that you can align with who knows they don't want to do it by themselves but they do want to do it and they want to show up every day just not by themselves because of the riffing because of the face because even if neither one of you really wants to be the face you can do it a little they can do it little you can do it together that energy feels very different it's not like being on it's just like talking to them and kind of taking that, capturing it sending it out. So like we were talking this morning about her and I just doing conversations on live on TikTok because the audience there is so, there's so much of the untapped, Facebook attracts the people that are in the old I am crowd, The hardcore marketers. So they bring in the people that have been brainwashed and you're competing with that. TikTok is all over the board. These are people like just hearing the ideas for the first time. And so they don't have these predisposed opinions about what things should be, whatever, and they're just easier to persuade. They're not jaded like people on Facebook. And so we can go over there, have some conversations, take the, so do TikTok, TikTok likes consistency. have to show up. Tube likes quality. YouTube does not care if you're consistent. YouTube just wants you to create something that people want to consume. Stay on their platform. They will send your one-year-old video over and over and over again, as long as people are still watching it and they don't care if you've never created another video. So we can take the best of the clips from TikTok and turn that into a quality YouTube video. Put that over there. The thing about YouTube is it gives amazingly targeted low-cost leads. So without it feeling like a drain, it will just feel like I'm showing up talking to Maria but we're doing it on TikTok live and it doesn't feel like pressure because I'm just having conversation with her and people are observing and I would do that anyway. I don't have an issue with it that I wouldn't think about it so much. Whereas if I'm talking to a camera, it's exhausting to my soul. I'm looking at myself going, this is 00:41:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) So douchey, I hate it. 00:41:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's it's not it's necessary, but it is not organic and not natural. And I don't like it. And I don't want to do things that don't look so I don't. Yeah. Anyway, but I know because we're always in this evolutionary evolutionary conversation about what is your offer kind of what is your thing. And I think that for most people it should be a hybrid. So I'm not going to give up my high level clients, and especially like my doctors and my attorneys, I'm having the time of my life with them. Because these are people that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, in in going to school, they're gonna be a debt for a long time. They're just used to paying for knowledge. And they're not like, I gotta make $10 million by the end of the year. And I need to make $10 million for every $5,000 I spend with you. know what I mean, debt service, he's like Tina, finally, I've been trying to tell you that you needed to like experience this. I'm like, I know, I know. But, um, but he's like, last night, he's like, I'm so glad that you're finally out of the IM world. I'm like, babe, that's never gonna happen and I'll tell you why. First of all, I wouldn't be where I'm at without having taken this path. But second of all, when moms and dads are trying to figure out how they save their family and how they get this extra income and they have no other way and they go to the internet, the first people they're gonna run into is internet marketers because internet marketers are the ones spending all the money to advertise to them. So I need to be there to show them, look, yes, there are all these opportunities, but here's what you need to do to guard yourself. Here's how you run real business practices, but you don't have to have an MBA and you don't have to be, you know what I mean? Like, very few people can simplify it like I can and talk to the average person and watch out for them. And because I have. of my other clients and my other business. I don't I don't have to charge them an arm and a leg. I'm planning on giving some of my best stuff away for free on YouTube just to be like learn it. And here's what I know because I've seen it happen with people over and over again. You give away your best stuff. Really smart people with a lot of money didn't have to pay to learn it. So they're watching you they're going, you know what? I want to hire that person and they will send you an email be like, how do I give you some money? 00:43:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) How do we work together? Yep. 00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Ten to thousands of dollars and deals happen because somebody saw you thought you were smart but you have to show that instead of showing all your schmuckery and your like 10 million upsells and downsells. 00:43:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) You know what I mean? I mean that's how Tim came to me. 00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I'm saying. 00:43:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) I threw the bootcamp. 00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Saw your smartness out there. Like I got to get that guy. 00:43:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah maybe. 00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So put more stuff out. but it doesn't have to be your face. That's the other thing and I got to remind myself of this because yes it's a popular thing but people don't care if you're screen sharing and they can hear you and there's and there's like cap cut and script make it so easy to caption what you're saying and if the captions are right and you know how to do this because this is marketing magic and we do this right the headline the hook they need to see the right things and hear the right things they don't have to see your face so much and it could be your picture which is not the same thing it's not the same burden it's not the same energy cap cut and a script and loom now has AI editing so it's crazy you're just like oh take out this line and it automatically does it you don't have to go through that how do I like zoom into the timeline and get right to that one second and clip these words oh my gosh it is crazy easy how fast the stuff could be done. So whatever you want to teach, whatever offer you want to do, if you want to do it yourself, do it the way that you want to do it and trust that it's it's going to work because you teach simple, clear, fundamentals, you teach fundamentals too, because you've been studying the fundamentals from gene. 00:45:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. 00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that. 00:52:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) A lot of that is I go through the exercises that I created for BAM on Desire and Product Performance, the channel, like channeling desire and market sophistication. Yeah, mean that that could technically be a that's interesting. That could be a series with the goal. I'm not selling a core or some selling like working with me. 00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and it could just be a soft like at the end. like if you, if this is something you want in your business, and you don't have somebody driving this, let me know, like I'm, I'm not the cheapest guy. I'm not the, um, the laborer. I'm the profit partner. So if you're looking for the, the guy to hire that works for you, I'm not the one. But if you're looking for the guy to be, you know, a profit sharing partner in your business, let me know. And it used to be soft. The other thing is you would drop in there. This is the exercise that I use that I created for BAM. 00:53:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) BAM, by the way, is right through advertising mastery. 00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it is a companion guide to Gene Schwartz is this, because I am partners with Brian Kurtz. 00:53:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) And so now you've just given your pedigree. 00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. That's going to be powerful too. But it up there. Right now I'm douchey way, like just like FYI, this is where this came from. 00:54:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah, that's not a bad idea actually. If I looked at it as I'm not trying to sell a course, I'm but selling my services. Yeah, I hadn't really thought about it that way. It's funny like Brian and I, Brian just got invited to speak to this virtual. But to this group of marketers in Japan about breakthrough advertising and he looped me in. He's like, I want Chris to be on this call with me. This guy, Hyro or however you say his name, H-I-R-O. he's got a little community there in Japan studying breakthrough advertising. And. So, Brian are going to be speaking to them in December, and I mean, who knows where we'll come out of that, but it was like, I wouldn't have gotten invited into that if I hadn't done all this stuff with Break to Arotize it, so that was just reminder. I, do you know Esther Kiss? 00:55:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you know that name? Yes! She's awesome. 00:55:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Okay, I don't know if she, I got a, is an automated email, but she reached out, she got on my list, and one of my sequences in the profit sharing thing, she replied, and asked if I was interested in any kind of PR or media work for me, and I'm not, I'm not interested in that for me, but then I was like, huh, it across my arm before, was like, uh, thinking of Break through Arotizing, like, if there was a more of a PR strategy for that book in media strategy to talk about like isn't this a cool story that here's this book that's almost 60 years old and still you know changing lives and we could talk about you know run some media about it kind of even showcasing it as a collector's item and and and and just go go out to a little bit of a broader market non people who aren't copywriters but I think that there could be a cool story of the history of the book and the story and who gene was and and just kind of build the allure around around this text and so I'm gonna I'm gonna do a call with her and the and Brian 00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Just to see what what she thinks about that As an approach Esther is so smart and she is so Real so humble like she's just she's she's one of those people, you know, just I don't know I think she's the same no matter what yeah, and I don't think she likes playing the game. I think she loves what she does and And loves when she comes across real genuine people and knows how rare they are. She's one of those really rare people Tell her I said hi we talked to her Yeah, she just we've never done any work together, but we You know when you you've got that just kind of vibe from somebody and you interact and you like for me I have these little love affairs with these ladies on Facebook and just like just adore you. I love you You're so smart whatever I gush they gush It's it's a mutual thing and then you don't talk to people for years and then it happens And again, and it's, it's just kind of amazing. I don't know if do that, but, but we women do that. Like you just really see each other and you're like, you're awesome. I think the men do too, because I have that similar interaction with men. a little bit different because you got to be, you know, respectful. it's very, because you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. like, wait a minute, he's married. 00:58:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) You're married. What is happening here? like, no, no, not like that. But anyway, yeah, right, right. 00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, she is, she is, that would be really interesting to see if there's any kind of synergy there. And I wonder with Jeremy also, just because she does PR, he does podcasting, very similar kind of. It's a different path to this, to the same type of thing, which is awareness, brand awareness. Yeah, really. That's what podcasting does, right? 00:58:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Brand awareness and education, right? 00:58:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you just pure, like a direct. response to marketing, which is a different type of psychology. It's it's like surgical marketing to me is what direct response is. Podcasting is like explosive marketing is like here's all the stuff. And PR is also surgical but it's like it's just it's not I mean it's it's I don't know like it's like getting stitches versus getting heart surgery. You know what I mean? Yeah it's interesting. Really keep. I say keep but because we've talked about it but I don't know that it's a big thing but that is the thing that I've been thinking about you since like 2020 2020 started talking about networking community is the people like that that are just really family or truth oriented like Esther doesn't have kids but she is a she is a mama kind of heart you know what I mean like she she she mamas her people and is loving and nurturing like just like you can tell that she loves her people yeah and making money is it's not a make money at all costs and it's they very much care about their relationships and I feel like I don't know you you also have much different values than just making money yes finding those types of people and having exploratory conversations with like what can we do together how can I help you help me but what can we create together and especially in terms of like content that maybe you can put out out on YouTube knowing that if it's quality, it can last forever and just be a beacon to the person, God will send them to you because he's amazing with that. Yeah, yes. Anyway, I'm excited about everything. I feel like I shed the last bit of the snake skin of COVID. You know, like the whole holding back, like it was happening around the beginning of this year, which is wild because that was a long time. And now I'm like, it's not like it didn't happen and there's not real things because we feel the after effects, but it is that I'm not sitting down for the next 10 years. I'm not taking it easy for the next 10 years. I'm not to burn myself out, but dude, I'm going to school. I'm on a mission. I'm doing all these like partnerships, taking care of my kids too. And I'm exhausted and I'm the happiest I've been in. 01:02:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) in a long time. That's awesome. 01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Being exhausted for having labored well is good. But also I nap like two or three times a day sometimes. Yeah. 01:02:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. Naps are awesome. 01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love them. I love Naps. Yeah. Okay. So let me know how Tim replies to you. 01:02:23 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah. 01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Don't go all month. I mean, I guess if you're feeling great about things, but I'm still here. I'm here to do feedback on anything. Oh, my stuff. I don't even know. Like you can tell I'm all over the board. I don't know if there's there's stuff for us to do or not to do, but I don't want to waste your time when I get to it. And maybe I just keep helping you with yourself or whatever. And we just maybe we share the back and forth of here's what I'm working on. Here's what you could add to it. Here's what you're going take from that kind of thing. but yeah you we we got to get you to what you really deserve you've been running fast. 01:03:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net) Yeah it's yeah I mean no pressure you know how to reach me if you want to kick some ideas around. I do have I did get an introduction to this young financial advisor here in town because I found somebody in TXL that works in the financial space with advisors and I've been I've been really interested in wanting to explore marketing and selling these infinite banking concepts and so I did call with him yesterday and he's not really into infinite banking but he does know the financial advisor space and so he he said there's a guy in Nashville that he does about half million a year he's like mid to late 20s and he did this great True to this guy. He's super responsive. So he and I are going to meet on October 7th. And he's got a podcast that he does. I just want to learn like what he's doing and let him know what I'm looking to do, which is I want to create the marketing. Like I don't want to write the policies at all. Like I don't want to get into that, but I want to sell them to people. And if I do this, I can get my life insurance license over weekend and then earn the commissions of the policies that I help sell. 01:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I keep forgetting about that. And you know, Business 101 is diversify. That is the best moat against poor economic times. The money is not Ever going away like ever. It's always out there and and we have so much access to it, but the average person isn't thinking about it. They're not trying to. They're just worrying about it. You If you have different areas that you can get to, but they're not consuming and they're not taking all your time and they're not taking all your energy and you're just building a machine like an engine, right? We've talked about around each of these types of things in the beginning, they're way more work and investment, but then you get in and you figure out how they work and you figure out how to leverage it. But I love that. And I love it being in, you know, the financial space where you can get money working for you plus the helping other people do the same thing. Like that really feeds the mission that you've always had, which is give back help others. And in terms of like business, but I think it, I don't think it had to be business. think business was the vehicle that you had naturally, but I think. Think that like kids you you so the proper type of stuff like huge I think you just want to see everybody be free powerful and happy and it doesn't matter how it gets there As long as it's something you're interested in you want everybody else to have it which is also about you Free powerful and happy I'm gonna write that down And those I want for people All right, I gotta get my girl. Oh go get her. Yes. All right. have a great day It's great talking to you and don't be stranger chris@chrismason.netTina Mariechris mason - Profit Drivers Systems Consult

Good. 00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm not. I'm to hear what you've been thinking about.

So, well, I, um, I sent an email out as a teaser and just the PS, and I'm just trying to pull up that email. there's already a couple of people that best say, Oh, excited to see what you have coming up. And it was like, like, very much a teaser. Hold on. trying to get to my darn Gmail account. 00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have one nail done. I was trying to figure out if I like this color. I like this one better. I know. Oh, that's so pretty. You have such pretty hands too. 00:01:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) you sent your picture. It's pretty hands. Yeah. My rings are in the bathroom. yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, so I like to show me again. Yeah, I do like that. 00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's a cat eye. Can you kind of see the stripes? 00:01:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I can't, but if there's a way to make you. 00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's just like a wavy stripe. 00:02:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. I like that. 00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's got metallic in it and like you put a magnet over it and it pulls it to the shape of the magnet and it changes. 00:02:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Show me now because I just put into top. Let's see. Like a wave? 00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, a little bit like across the, actually. 00:02:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Kind of, I'm gonna send you a picture. 00:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took one and I was like and then I forgot to send it. Because I do not do a great job at nails, so the details are not. 00:02:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But it's my little bit of therapy and my creative outlet while I do it too. 00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Plus I can do whatever colors I want to. have bottles and bottles and bottles. have two nails drills. have two lights. 00:02:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like we have a whole nail station because my girls do their nails too. 00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And my 17-year-old, Emma, she's almost 18. We just got her signed up for beauty school and she starts on Monday. Oh nice. She's gonna be a tattoo artist. 00:03:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) She's incredibly artistic. So that's nice. 00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got these girls. Alright, so people are excited what I didn't see your email today. I saw that you emailed that I didn't see what it was. 00:03:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, it was this uh, seen this year at 10 months, 1.2 million. Um, and there was another email yesterday subject line, same thing. Um, so look at that. So did you do six ingredients? Yeah, but it was just in the p.s. Someone deeply invested in helping on careers like he thrived, I understand important staying ahead of the digital landscape and building something that gives you time and money and freedom. Next week on Tuesday, I can't wait to reveal the opportunity involving done for you and with you to build and scale your online business that you feel called to serve that has a component benefit to you and your clients. It'll give you emotional support, social support, office support, system support, clarity and comments on your offer. What to do today? 00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We come up. Yeah, I love it. Yeah. So I. 00:04:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I was just pulling stuff from our stuff in our conversation. So, so I think I'm going down a wrong path, so I'm glad we're having a call. So, there's this dude that has, yeah, there's this dude that has like this offer template that he used to close high ticket stuff and he just kind of sent them a dock like this on sort of a sales call. And so, I started to try and fill it out, but I was just like, I think being in his box, I'm not sure is working, but because his thing when he presents, some of the just clients is the promise, the problem, the path. So, he starts with what the promise is, right? And so, I like, you'll get everything you need to, and then you insert the benefits. So, here, you need to, you know, blank to outcome alcohol without the pain. So, I was having a hard time filling But a lie, because at first, was like, you get everything you need to have 100% clarity on your offer. I'm is that really like, we're doing so much more. 00:05:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, sorry, maybe, maybe we just start from scratch with, yes, since, yeah, I got into anybody's boxes and templates. 00:05:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And yeah, maybe it just starts like this, right? 00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And so the thing is, I just don't buy people's stuff and I don't follow their patterns because I know people really well, and I trust it. And I think that you will start leaning into it. I think like it surprises me how we'll see this carefully because we say things and it comes out wrong. I don't think you have an appropriate. level of confidence in yourself for your skill and ability. But I think that you also love learning and studying. And I think that that's a wonderful quality. But through this, you know a lot. And well, yeah, you have an appeal to people, you attract a certain amount of people that you you could just literally just have a conversation. And all you have to do is think about what is the conversation happening in their head and enter that conversation with them. So the ideal person who's ready to say yes right now, and this is going to be important because I got to quit looking at the screen because all the moving around is distracting me. But the important thing with the ideal person right now has several products or has been offered bring a particular service and getting a particular result for years. They have been helping others succeed, not necessarily like us making them millions, but have helped others succeed for years. They know that they can deliver a result. They know that they can make money. They know that offer. They might be in the launch habit. They might have launched different products, sold different products, or just sold their services and their time, little time trading time for money, because they either are not great at marketing, or they're not great at business and systems, or they're not great at either, which is the majority of people. They lack structure, they lack support. Biggest thing. is they can do for everybody else but not for themselves which is me too and you too. I'm amazing and I still can only do certain things for myself and certain things I can't. So if I don't get somebody to help then I'm going to struggle. So knowing that that's the case what we're going to do is build a support structure around them and there's two versions of it so the one is the original package and we're going to say you already know most of what you need to do. You just have a lack of clarity and confidence in what the offer should be and the fastest and simplest way to execute it. You may lack some of the market research you may not be clear on the offer or the offer structure. You may not be good at crunching the numbers in order to be able to calculate the best way. to go out building a sustainable evergreen offer. So it should be an evergreen offer. So let's definitely put some focus on to that. Let's escape the launch cycle and escape the madness. 00:09:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Stop the insanity! 00:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But also we're building in 90 days of support. So veteran experts in the trenches with you support on boxer. You can access us. You know, I don't know how many days a week you're available. 00:09:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I can promise five days week. I'm not available on Sundays. 00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I may respond on Saturdays, but I'm not obligated to. 00:09:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And I would say that. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But you know, response within probably eight, let's say eight business hours. So that excludes the weekends. I'm happy to respond within eight business hours because if we're talking about five o'clock at night, you're going to hear from me by, you know, 12 the next day. 00:09:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's eight business hours technically. 00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So and in it so but but what you're going to get is we're going to do um and we can do a screenshot of a um a calculator one of your calculators are so much pretty oh my gosh I was jealous yesterday not really jealous but I was like I was impressed I was like yeah and it's not even envy because I'm it's not a negative emotion but I'm like I need that I want that because mine every time I show mine people like wow because it gets the job done but yours gets the job done beautifully oh my gosh beauty and maria like all that art that pictures that like anyway beautiful your beautiful because like it's cool because I think you're like your very auditory math and and I'm very visual actual oh okay and no no I'm actually more visual than anything got okay um When it's tactical, I need to see it. 00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Got it. 00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I need to see it. So, but I am fast. And so if I can say it, I'll say it first, and if people can hear it, you know, I'll do that. So being able to say something gets it done faster versus creating and struggling. So pairing up with you is like, Every day is a new reason why I'm so glad I found Maria because it's going to be. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I'm hoping to bring the same to you. So, so we're going to. So let's send them a screenshot of like, we've got this calculator. It doesn't matter because the ideal person for us is not going to go try to do it by themselves. And again, we only need a couple of people to say yes. So if they get inspired by what we share and give away, and they go from self. Great. They'll remember that we talked. that matter, you taught them that. So we'll show them that we're going, that we have like an offer calculator that is like, we'll plug in real numbers and we can calculate in average cost per leads, target cost per leads. And we can say, we'll say caveat, we can't guarantee that this is what it is, but these are some average basic numbers that we've tested over and over again. And so as long as you've already been making sales, then we know that what you're offering has some validation. It may not be that you marketed, maybe it's been 100% word of mouth, 22 years, 100% word of mouth, and made a million dollars across five and a half years in coaching, working 10, 15 hours a week. So, you know, like, but isn't the type of thing that I could have gone and marketed mass level very well that I know of, probably. because I've ever had a gone through a lot of sales calls and a whole long funnel, because it's very difficult. It's been difficult for me to describe what I do for people because I'm a therapist. Like I'm so many people that you don't want to go make those claims anyway. 00:13:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Something is in my eye and it's driving me nuts. 00:13:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, so yeah, so if you know that you can fulfill a service or a product for people and you have charged money for it and you have happy clients, but what you lack is an offer, an evergreen offer that maximizes and leverages your, each customer completely. Meaning you have complimentary and supplementary upsells so that you're increasing your average order value as well as your average lifetime value. If you've never built the marketing for yourself, if you've never had access. If you don't know how to write copy, if you haven't had a hook, if you haven't built up an email follow up sequence, so that when leads do come, you're giving yourself the best chance at converting them into a customer, knowing that back in the day it took five to 12 touches, these days it could take three years before somebody converts to a customer. So you want to build that system. We will architect that system and process for you with the numbers and help you figure out how to execute it, who you need to hire, give you access to our road exit people that you need to hire, but we will simplify it. So if you're prone to say, but I got to go get a new YouTube channel, and I got to go create a new brand, and I got to go get a new domain, we're going to tell you stop the insanity. Let's not use that phrase. Let's come up with that version of that, which will be great for us. and then tell them that we're going to help you focus on the minimum Bible product and why would you do that? First of all, because we don't know what we don't know and every offer that has worked has its own kind of magic. You almost always stumble onto it. But there is a pattern for increasing the likelihood of stumbling onto that. Now, that might sound a little scary because there's no guarantee. But you don't need to have a knock it out of the park $15 million a month product. You just need to get to maybe it's $10,000 a month, maybe it's $15,000, maybe it's $20,000. the likelihood that you can get to that given the size of the audience, giving the quality of the market, giving, given all that we know and the fact that all of the ad platforms want you to keep putting their money. money and then they want to give you some of your customers. And knowing that you've already told us that you have the ability to deliver a successful result to people, we're pretty confident that if you meet these these parameters, we can build something for you that like top to bottom and plan out and not out. So additionally, we'll give you 90 days of support. So if you run into issues and you have a question, you get both of our brains resolving it as quickly as possible. This is what we do all day long. This is what has generated tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions between the two of us and our clients. And if you want us to do it for you, $4,000 extra, we will take care of it. That's how confident we are that that this can be built and that this is simple. And then you will have it again. can't guarantee how much money it's going to make. We can guarantee you'll be much closer to success and having the thing that will make you money on a regular basis once you've gone through this. There is no shortcut to success. The work is that you have to build it, you have to test it, you have to refine it until it works. So no amount of thinking and planning and studying all of the gurus is going to get you any closer until you do it. If you're not doing it by yourself, why don't you do it with us? So you're going to invest time and money into success. You can't get more time, there's 24 hours in the day. How much have you accomplished during your 24 hours over the last six months year? How long have you been thinking about this planning this? What are the odds that if you've been thinking about this for years that you're suddenly going to have something in the next 90 days on your own? So, you can't collapse that time and turn that into three years from now in 90 days, but what you can do is leverage money to use our time, our brain, our resources to essentially collapse that time, think about a tesseract and a wrinkle of time, right, to leapfrog ahead and now, and I got goosebumps, 90 days in, you've got something more than you've ever had before. Yeah. That's what your money is going towards. Your money is not going to guarantee success because it doesn't exist. If you do it or redo it, there's no guarantee. Now, do you want to risk that money? Don't do it if you don't want to do it. We don't want your money. But if you know that you have better odds with expert success and support, expert support and planning and structure, if your heart is telling you, this is the thing I've been waiting for. you're If Yeah. Then you're for us. If that's that doesn't happen and you want to get on a call with us and have us convince you it please don't bother me please don't fill up my form I don't want to talk to you that this isn't for you like yeah we are called to serve this is inspired we know it we feel it and whoever it's for is going to feel it too yeah so if you can't stop thinking about this offer at night and when you wake up in the morning then you should be filling up the form of talking to us because this was for you I like it yep that makes sense cool okay so why don't when we hang up I get the record of that and then I'll put it in just a fresh doc like because yeah I already I just started a fresh google doc and I just kind of as you can see the screen here I just copied what I had from the PS and the email that I wrote yesterday so yeah you know You could do too. Do you have testimonial videos of things that you've done for people with your different like micro offers or anything else? 00:20:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, like you mean like of like different people saying how much money they made or what they got tons of them. 00:20:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what if we ran our testimonial videos through like opus and it can get the script with the of the script the script. You know how it pulls out these little pieces like these little clips in highlight reel and it puts in the captions. Captions? Yes. Yes. it could go through and the highlight for us really easily those particularly like really good clips and we could put together a little bit of a montage of testimonials of people that highlight different things that we've done for them because when you stack Maria did this this this and this for me and there are very specific types of issues and that solved and then Tina did this this this and you look at that whole package compared to the claims that we're making they'll be like all those different people validating all these claims that they just made so but either and this is the beauty of the Holy Ghost it's what it is the job of the Holy Ghost is to be a witness of the truth of all things period so a person doesn't have to know that the Holy Ghost exists for him to do his job it is the blessing of being a child of God that Heavenly Father has given that to us he wants his children to be successful he wants them to be provident and independent he doesn't want them to be poor he doesn't want them to be enslaved financially by by any of those things and so If we're speaking the truth, a person who needs to hear the truth and is worthy to receive it, which the level of worthiness is not Christian so many times and so many people will be like, you got to be this, like sin free, none of us are that, none of us are that. Anyway, the level of worthiness is basically have a good heart and not be trying to do bad things to bad people, just try to be a good person, that's really it. And so I trust that that witness will be out there and that a person is going to feel it. So all we have to do is speak to them be like, if you're feeling that, you got that like little flutter in your chest and that excitement and then it keeps going with you and you're not going to put yourself in detrimental risk by making the investment. If you can't afford this, you know, you're to put yourself at risk, please, please wait, we'll come up with an, you can reach out to us, we'll come. come up with an offer that works that might be slower, but a little bit more secure financially for you. And let's come up with that. we can basically give them the template, but that done for you. You know, yeah, anyway, that's what I'm thinking. What do you think? 00:23:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, yeah. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I did work. I just know how many followers going to give us like, we're going to have fun together. We're going to make some magic for somebody who deserves it. And you're going to get the money that you need. I'll get money will like, and that's just resources for us to give more blessings to other people. 00:23:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So yeah, no, I love it. I love it. I was like, you know, it funny. I was even looking at like way back machine, some old, old stuff, like, like, I used to have this ultimate consulting challenges, literally from 2000 with that 2009, right? this is very old school stuff. But sometimes when I write this, I'm like, damn, I helped this guy make $66,000 for his first client. 00:24:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It was almost a confidence boost for myself again, right? 00:24:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This is really good stuff, know? had all these things here, right? And I didn't buy any of other people's products. just wrote, you know? I mean, very non-Facebook compliance. 00:24:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) is all about money but at the same time, that's how a lot of sales letters back then were written, right? 00:24:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But still, I was kind of looking at actually I was looking back on to the quick start guide, all the stuff. So yeah, anyways, was reviewing a lot of this. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And Facebook compliance and as well as Google compliance gives us a gift of a little bit of protection because any of those claims, the FTC can come breathing back and just destroy your life. 00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:24:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. So I'm going to, I think we're done, unless you want anything else to talk to, because once I get the recording of this, I'll just kind of put it all into a dock. like that. And so are you thinking that we should do like maybe then a... Zoom call with with people next week, just invite whoever wants to jump on to talk about who you got this exciting offer. 00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I think that would be great. Um, let look at my calendar. 00:25:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I think they they've never been my people. don't know who you are and vice versa. So I think seeing the two of us together will be pretty powerful as well. 00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I agree. Um, next week. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, I always keep Friday's open. My Friday is wide open and the next Friday? Yeah. 00:25:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like not tomorrow. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're flying. When you're flying today or tomorrow? 00:25:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So, okay. So we can do that. Are you, um, Yeah, let's just take to the fourth because that way we can just like, you know, we start setting people to sign up for it and stuff. the meantime, obviously still have a Google Doc ready to send people. As well, but what time on the fourth works for you. 00:26:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm wide open as well I'm wide open. I so I want to kind of balance out East Coast and West Coast timelines I think anytime between like 10 and one Pacific. Let's see or yeah So that would be as late as 4 p.m. Eastern Between one and four Eastern that's kind of I don't know Do you have any idea what your demographics are? How many are East Eastern Time Zone? 00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I feel like there's always so many more Eastern people Yeah, I do but yeah, I do find lot more Eastern or I have lot of people in the UK like the lady who did a 15 minute School onboarding for you called me today was Yeah, was from the UK Yeah Well, how about 10 a.m. 00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) time because the other thing is that I need to be able to be like on and Energized and any earlier than that. I'm just really My rhythm doesn't work like that no matter how much I try. then it starts one o'clock Eastern and then in the UK, it's 9 p.m., 8, 9, depending on what I don't remember daylight savings, how it goes, around there. And that way it's still available to them. 00:27:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So yeah, and also in the recording because there's a lot of people that have watched in the recording now is kind of give them a summary of what was covered and stuff too. 00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, or seven, that's about six or seven, their time. Anyway, sorry, yeah. 00:27:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's right, yeah, five hour time difference, yeah. Okay, cool. So what else you got going today? You heading out? 00:27:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I got to call it then Ryan in an hour and then I go get my oil change, I need to get packed and get ready and get my girls ready and settled and just just I like to leave with my clean, my house clean, everything. I don't know, just, but also I have lots of space in my day, lots of quiet time, like I never, as much as there's a lot going on, there are pockets of peace throughout the day, every day, always. I never do anything busy all day long, it's just not really good for myself. I went to the gym last night, I'm going to send you this picture of my cute little 14-year-old man. She doesn't know what he took the picture, I stole it. She leg pressed 415 pounds last night. 00:28:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh my gosh, that's amazing. 00:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I did it too, by the way. Yay! I've been going to gym for a year. Ooh, study. And she doesn't know what it is. And she's so cute. And she was just, she's feeling good today, I thought she's going to be sore, because she was really sore, she's like, I'm so cute. proud of myself. I think I don't like she did. Did amazing. So that was joyful. 00:29:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then my friend Stephanie was going to come over and work. So what I'm working on is so I built my own GPT and gave it some instructions for cleaning transcripts of my bottom calls. So it's able to quickly recognize speakers. So it removes everybody but me. And then it removes anything that's personal and only keeps any business up in there. And so we're going to copy and paste that out of each of the calls and then put it into a Google Doc because the custom GPTs, you can only feed it 10 files and I don't know how big they are. But anyway, it's going to be a Tina bot. So I'll be able to ask questions like, what are some of the processes that Tina has described and outlined? And because I don't even remember all the things I tell people sometimes. And I could say, what does she say about that's what you say about that and it will go write an article like let me share my screen hold on second there they go this that's actually cool gpt and i got i gotta sign into the right account first hold on oh that oh yeah log out um yeah i want to see that we can have two chat gpt accounts so that i can have a team working in one and i work with the other and i get it you get my authenticator authenticates oh there you are think this is it oh oh oh Okay, do you see my screen? 00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yep. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So I. All right. What the thing I told it to do first? Oh, so we're coming up with a content plan. Let's just start with this. So, um, what's the next? Okay. Right. Right. That's peace. So we came up with a content plan. Or 100 days of content. The sound from my ear. Um, but breaking it up into basically three repetitive sections. Cause I don't want to take a hundred days to go through everything. want to get through all of my main topics. I teach people what I do over the course of 30 days, so it's fresh, and then I want to do an iteration of that same content, again, the next 30 days, and then the next 30 days. So, did I? No, I'm in the wrong GPT, I think. Maybe. All right, well, it hasn't been fully tried, but let's ask it a question. What can we ask if we could just ask a question, or a piece of content? It's going to be so much better, so I'm excited to see the difference too. Let me think of something Oh, let's let's do let's do an extraction. Oh, wait, it doesn't have everything. It has a few things. Um, let's know about what you can describe for a particular. gosh, I hate when it does off. 00:33:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Imagine this your life was reduced to a spreadsheet. I know. I'll stay with me here, but not just any spreadsheet. This one's Clark Kent. OK, you've said that before. Yeah, I've seen that before. Yeah, Clark Kent. 00:34:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like this. So I believe that efficiency isn't about getting more done. It's about getting the right things done. The things that move you closer to your version of an extraordinary life. That's why the system works. It doesn't just optimize your business. It optimizes you, your time, your energy, your passion are too valuable to waste. Try it and tell me I'm wrong. I dare you. 00:34:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I love it. I love it. 00:34:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So like if you are, if you have a bunch of recordings, we could run it through some transcripts, a service and then build a Maria GPT. Yeah, which, because then it can help you just write some pieces. Like you could give it a specific thing. Like, so I don't think it's got enough of the data now, but I have described, I've described, let's see. I don't think it, I don't think it has it, but, um, simple funnels, you know, like, how you would attract a new customer, um, they're looking for, some like marketing principles. 00:35:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I love it. What's your energy workflow update on the left hand side. Bottom energy work flow update with that. 00:35:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This prompts, here's a transcript. Oh, I don't even know why it did that. But this was me building the, what do you call it? The custom GPT that cleans the transcripts. Oh, gotcha. Okay. 00:35:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I was just working on it. 00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it has a whole mess. And this is me. It's describing me. How's this energetic with verse of excitement? I'm like, yeah. 00:35:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, quirks of. Yeah. Well, I like that embracing the quirks of ADHD is a superpower. That's a great title for an email for a video for so many things. And it was, yeah, you got to go. I got to go. I got to pick up my dog. You can doggy daycare, but yeah. So good. I clear. Sorry. just confused this morning. 00:36:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I got the same trust me. 00:36:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) was like, well, my brain is done. My brain is done. I'm like, you know what? I'm done. 00:36:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Bye. All right. All right. Talk to you. Let's go through Boxer. That was good. right. Cheers. Bye. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) did you say what's up did cuz yeah I heard up low I can pick up the low towns probably but I never know if it's you or the audio mm-hmm how is how is team Ryan and by that I mean mama Ryan especially doing today I mean overall she's doing good there she I mean literally cries every day other than that it's random short bursts random the most random criggers yeah but yeah actually don't think it's happened yet today but it definitely has happened every day so far have fun with that damn mmm-hmm it is also being a woman I just tell ya. Mm-hmm. 00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mm-hmm. 00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Good. 00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So... Hold on. Speaking of my brain. How is my brain? Okay. Actually, it probably really helps me to look at my notes and stay focused when my brain wants to go thing, thing, It's been a productive week, but the problem is I've got all those billions of things in my head. Oh, okay. So, just little by waiting on Stacey for some, actually, she probably sent me a reply in the hand. 00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I actually know. He... You're probably not on it, but he started talking to Mark. He needed Mark to do some stuff, so Mark and him are getting in touch with each of the vendors. So, I think Mark gave him a contact at every vendor, so that Josh could be like, hey, I needed to do it like this. As far as, like, sending... I think the state names or whatever you think that they'll all comply. Oh, yeah That'd be good. Um, I I I love that you feel Josh I love when Dan goes down rabbit holes and comes up with a like gold nugget dude that the guy sawed that I found to do the high-level stuff is I Love him because he just gets it done Andy makes it better like Josh I'd have referred to them. It's like JD funnels or whatever, but they were the dudes I hired to make The custom I bought their custom value updater, but then subsequently they built like The Spotify app and then they built they just built another thing that they released I got a test Tuesday meeting with them tomorrow. He's releasing another thing so I'm making All these customizations to high level with them. They're super cheap, super fast, and he always makes it better. Like this, I love these. They have a four or four page from the front is the code. Great idea. Noria is pretty good, like it works. 00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They have five, oh, I don't know what trust index.io is. Nevermind, I thought that was a trust pilot. I was like, they have 24 or five star reviews on, but it's not trust pilot. So, dude, I don't wanna check that out. It's gonna go ahead a little. So, cause I'm thinking, you know, business 101, diversification, and just lots of different little things. Number one, because I get bored if I stay on the same thing all the time. But, So all things kind of feed each other as long as they're relative. Um, but I like having the agency, it's basically affiliate level stuff. But anyway, having, I want to have a smallish go high level kind of package offering that has the built kind of some basic automation, basic templates, things like that, that is just a side offering, like it's not the main thing. It's just a, cause the monthly fee is not that much. to break even, and if I had a regular amount of traffic coming in with people who are interested in business development topics, there's going to be a portion of those that will want that. So anyway, just thinking about it. 00:04:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, it all depends on who you're talking about. 00:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) For sure. For sure. But since this is going to be my My baby basically, for a few years, because my babies are grown, I get a lot of exploring to do, and yeah, anyway, okay, so what features, oh, the report functions just down here, oh, that was Mark, Robert, I needed to leave myself good notes. Oh, okay, and high level, I was about like, does your, because we were talking, I should probably go to Fathom, so it didn't take good notes, and that's what my note taker is for, but about what mom needs, because we were asking, I was asking questions, and there was too many, I don't know. 00:05:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Stop it, oh my gosh. 00:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Please, yeah. which is the right one, that's not the right one, where's my Dan called? September 19th, and it seems like forever ago, and also too soon. Um, well, once you get your win, okay. This is not a very good summary, project update, center, retrospective. They have all these different summaries, and some of them are good. But some of them, none of them great, that's the bottom line. Anyway, um, these are the things that I wrote down. What features does Mark want? What functions do you want? And what are the most important things that need to happen for your artist? And I know it was talking, oh, circle. You were going into circle in membership groups. That's what the question was about. 00:06:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) But you decided to circle. I decided. on Circle for Mom, I don't know that I think it's too cost-prohibitive for solo artists at certain levels. But it's like, okay, we build ours on there. There is a lower tier, you know, $49 a month version. I don't know what the other dudes that I mentioned charged, but I mean, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood. Or they're getting a rip. Maybe they're getting they got to be charging something. The pricing's not on their site, of course. So it's like, let's be honest, someone has one or two songs out. The last thing they should be, this is my argument, to mark all the time. It's like, dude, we do not want to create jobs for these people. So if their job is releasing songs, not managing their community. So at some point, it might make sense based on the volume of fans to have a community and then to manage that community or pay someone to manage that community. But if you're just starting out, like, we need to figure out, like, hey, when you're this tier artist, if you're starting out and you're getting all their email addresses, you can start a community whenever you want, right? don't need to start it. Step one is build that asset of an email list, which is what they do with family. And then you could then coach them into, like, hey, when you get to this level, you might want to think about starting a community. And here's what looks like, go sign up for circle, potentially, right? Or maybe high levels is at a place where it will work for that. I actually got a response from the high level of devs about, like, customizing it. So, but it's not going to work. The reason it doesn't work for Mark is because you can't embed mp3s. And I'm like, which makes sense. It's like, what poor sky is really embedding an mp3? No. So, that that's sort of the key component of why it doesn't work at the moment. So it's like, okay, we'll either go get around to it, and then we'll just change the advice. Oh yeah, no, just use hours and then unless and until you just direct them towards circle. But again, I don't think we need determine who should have a community. Like Sean's band should have a community, right? On has 400,000 subscribers on Spotify. On gets, you know, millions of, he has over 60 million streams on Spotify, but Sean's also the cobbler's kid and has refused. So it's like, he's not doing all the things that are right in front of him. But his band and an example of one that probably should have a community, right? He's on tour. He's releasing singles consistently now. He hadn't been, but he's doing almost all the things right now, except for the fan flow he did. 00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So we capture things here sometimes that I don't know how it I think I don't know that you remember it to take it back to anybody to turn it into a task like do you have a task for mom would there be a place to put the the highlights of these conversations where you're exploring some things kind of almost like bullet points that you might not otherwise like what are the criteria for who should have a community it doesn't have anything to do with following size releases like I've literally never said that before right so that's the thing is I like rather than it doesn't do me any good just to know how to keep it how do we what would be the best way to put this somewhere where it goes into additional conversations with them or yourself 00:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) the team to uh so first off that's fan flowy that would not be mom um this is fan flow yeah yeah so and then uh you could so you could send it to Stacy and be like hey this is this is for the Monday call okay right so we talked to him every Monday um so yeah that's probably the best case of it so she'd be like hey here's this thing he you know damn brought this up make sure to bring this up on the Monday call because he he'll forget which is 1000% true because mark and then come with the list and we come with nothing so now we're going to come with a bit of a list or maybe we have access to their list maybe maybe if she gets access to the list and we have us we centralized the list that they're using i don't even actually know oh they're doing They come with a list every week. 00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Of things to talk about? 00:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I don't know where that list lives. It's certainly not in teamwork. Even the mark made us set everything up on teamwork. And maybe it should be in teamwork. 00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I think that Stacey can help with the structure of that. But I don't think anybody will help you dig into it. 00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, that's a question for Mark. It's not a question. 00:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. But Stacey can ask it or remind you, whatever. So here's what I did was just said, like, I've got a fan flowy section. And then at Stacey, the above note. could you bring it up on the Monday call? So she brings up, how does Mark bring a list of stuff to talk about on the call? He has one, where does it live? 00:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Should we get that into teamwork? That's what I wrote. Yeah. 00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) she brought that up mission accomplished, right? 00:13:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You guys would figure it out from there? Yeah, and then we have to bring up the other bit that specific bit like, what is the criteria for someone? Maybe it's not for everyone. Right. shouldn't be teaching people that. Right. So it's like, just like we're not going to promote it as part of employee, because it doesn't live in pamphlets. So it's, although I don't think we were planning on promoting that. 00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and what I have there is what I read, which is need to determine who should have a community. Yeah. They aren't for everyone. How big should your following be? What are the other criteria releasing consistently? her question, Mark, like, anything else that you come up with, but that will spark that conversation so that you get some guardrails, basically. on what's being created, and some definition, and some structure. 00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Good to me. 00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, and then... So, is there a community that... I was talking about what marked me, done what you need in terms of community. Is there a community that is joining between you two? Is it for mom? 00:14:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Is it something separate? Yeah, mom is the... Imagine that like, mom is like the umbrella, and it's like... So, fan flow is a service of mom. If we do this distribution thing, so there's this idea of doing distro flowy, that would be a service of mom, while we're flowy, service of mom. Just then it's like these flowies, right, exist over here. And then mom would also have potentially this idea of... well, not potentially. So then mom would also have like, hey, the book is from mom, it's not from time blowing. So this, it's the independent artist compass guide to, you know, navigating your musical success and like that. So the book is like the, the D lead magnet, right? That's like the Maria lead magnet for lack of better term. And then so I make my plan is to make the low ticket funnel with the book on the front end. And then the book has, it's, it's the book is promoting mom and fan flowy, right? In the actual text. But mom has the community. So we're giving away the checklist or we're giving away. So the book has like, she just did this. And it just made this number up. has like nine checklists or nine worksheets, summer checklist, so we're not so we'll come worksheets. It has nine worksheets in theory. Each one of those worksheets could be a lead magnet. I don't I don't think the L.R., but for sure, the royalties one that we've already used has worked, and then the release one that we've already used has worked, and then there are two others we could test or we don't need to, but they're integrated into the book, but they're also going to be these standalone lead magnets. What I did before was I ran ads to the thing, brought them into Lee Flowey into mom and Lee Flowey, and then I was distributing the thing via email from there, but as part of... 00:16:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) When you say lead flowey, when it's music related, it's always fan flowey. 00:16:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Is that correct? No, it was Lee Flowey literally at the time. Now mom will be inside of fan flowey, but it was literally in lead flowey. There was no fan flowey. 00:16:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's how long ago it was. did this last summer. 00:16:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I was getting leads for under two box and I think what I did was they they it was a Facebook messenger at I think it was a messenger or a lead and I forget which to high level and then it maybe was a landing page somewhere in somewhere in there I don't know where it was exactly but I can look it up I asked them if they wanted to join the Facebook community and and I need to go back now just for my own nerdiness and be like what was the uptake rate on community so I actually don't remember but what we're seeing with these fans of this one dude is doing the community thing for this one band and the uptake rate on people joining the community is like over 50% which is interesting so here what I want to do is like deliver the thing through the community so it's be like oh okay here you know so in the Gary, get them in the high level and then according to my circle guy, I can zap over that to circle creating the common circle for them and then send them that be like, Hey, here's where you here's where you can go. know, you're in the community and that's where you get your thing. Or maybe they don't if they don't join the community I just send them the thing and then I try to enjoy the community one of the other. So the mom community is going to be comprised of in theory, musical artists, engineers, producers, music makers. Let's put that way. Thus make our music. So that community is like the shared community and then there will be courses in there potentially that we sell them into all that good stuff, but also from there. don't think I've talked to you about this, but ideally, I think the play is to like build a community and then try to do equity. crowd funding on top of it. We're like, okay, yeah, we're making our own music and now we're making our own label. And you can all be part owners of that. And then raise do equity crowd funding through like we funder or there's another one start engine. And there's rules, right? I think you can only raise like three million the first round, yada yada yada. But you're literally raising, raising, doing a capital raise through non-accredited investors, because it's this thing that came up during Trump. And some people are raised, gives millions of dollars doing it. But the trick is supposedly you build the community first. And then you tap into that community. So I'm like, okay, we have all the pieces to build the community. And then we just need to work out the model. think about some of the model that we know sort of the model is fan plowing, then the coaching would be on top of that. We don't have any date on that. And then this idea of buying catalogs, like I think I talked to you about that, Sean's catalog is for sale. You buy the catalog, and then the third bit would be to actually like sign an artist and do a rev share where you're getting a piece of royalties. then the final bit is this distribution, distribution revenue stream. So basically, if you, we wipe label this distribution service, and then we would tell our people that when you release a song, use Distroploid, when you get a rip of every song that gets released through your software. It's very tiny. But if you've got hundreds of thousands of songs getting released through it, it adds up. I've got to sort a map out. And I started doing a little bit yesterday, like map out how all the revenue was. He may be going to exist and then we start to fill in the blags like, okay, we're making this much on SaaS, we're making this much on Coaching and label services and we're making or this much on forces We're making this much on label services, which is like a done with you tier And then we're making this much as a label, which is done for you tier where you're potentially Putting money into the production of the song and therefore you're you're acting like a label Except our deal is not going to be a label deal. Like so With Sean, I did not understand this until he told me when Sean signed with AF AFM They get a hundred percent of his catalog. They own it And he gets no streaming revenue Why did he do that? That's how labels work. So what the benefit for them was that that they open up the door to them touring in Europe. So I don't think he's in a 360 deal. have to confirm this. But a 360 deal, if you don't know, means these are newer. A 360 deal means they get a piece of everything, streaming, merch, I don't think he's in a 360 deal. I think he's in more of a traditional deal. And that's like the catalog. merch and tour, they have no part of and they gave them money that he has to pay back, right? So and they're not that payback is not happening through his streaming revenue, right? So it's not like, hey, it's 50-50 and then we're taking 100% until you pay us back and then you get 50%. They have no percent. AFM owns the entire catalog. So they, did I not tell you this? 00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:22:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They recently approached Sean and I don't know what to do. He tells, I still have to get them. But it sounds like the heads of the label that signed Lansdowne left, whether it was amicable or not. I don't know. The new people went to Lansdowne were basically like, we don't want you guys anymore. So we will sell your catalog back to you for $250,000 or something like that. 00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wow. 00:23:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And they don't have the money. So they came to me and said, do you want to buy Lansdowne? I was like, really? What does that look like? What it looks like? And I might be wrong about the $250. But it's in the neighborhood. What it looks like is currently Lansdowne makes between $8,000 and $10,000 a month on Spotify, which AFM takes all that. So I buy Lansdowne catalog. I get 100%. I instantly start getting paid $8,000 a month. But then obviously it would be here with me. like, you guys should really be using fan flow. 00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You guys should really be using all these tools, right? But I would instantly start making 10 grand a month, let's say, plus whatever increases they see, because now they are going to tour, they are, they're headlining a tour in Europe in the fall. And what they told me is like, oh, there's other bands that you could go by their whole catalog just like that. And then put them in the mom machine, help them put out new songs, help them, you know, harness what they've already got. And then you, you own all the streaming, or whatever deal, whatever the deal is. And Sean's scenario is all about it. So I was like, oh, that's interesting. Actually, so I just told someone about that. I just told Salco. And he was like, wait, what? 00:24:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right? He's like, that is, okay. I get some money. 00:24:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Go with it. He's like, we need to know the exact numbers, but he's like, I'm going to run it. He's got this buddy who's like this baller lawyer. And he's like, get the details and I'll run it by Ryan. But he's like, dude, I'll throw money into that. Right? I was like, yeah, no. So, and then they had like two other bands that they know of that you could do it with. But there's tons of them. That's the thing, right? So when you look at them buying Elton John's catalog, this is just a smaller version of that. Right. But those guys are never going to go like try to grow Elton John. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why would you? 00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right. It's a proven asset that just does what it does. Here it's to a degree. It's a it's an asset that can be at least somewhat enhanced. And then the big question is like, you know, it's spotify number one in 10 years. I'd say no, but so you use like a five year window when you're when you're buying these things be like, hey, look, we're not Looking past five years. Yeah, they could they can still be number one. Well, could take it up. Like we don't know what's gonna happen. So this is the price based on that. 00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The to me, the ideal investment is something that's already making money regularly, but totally leveraged because once you leverage it, then it's just compounding, but with really little effort, especially if you have the system. 00:26:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And it's all digital. 00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) you don't have to do anything crazy. 00:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I was like, yeah, that is so big. Yeah. So it's like, okay, factor that into mom, right? That's a revenue stream with you acquiring acquiring and then leveraging, like you said, and then also just finding an artist that's happening right now, right? They don't have any of that, but then you think they have the potential to build the catalog. Especially if they follow all your systems, right? 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we have this system, the continuous release strategy. 00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) which is like, hey, you know, you're releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks. Period. That's your job. You have to make the product. right. 00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's say that the artist didn't do anything and you just use a system to keep them top of mind and get new people to be aware of them. They don't create new content. Just new people discover the music, discover they like it. In three years, you'd get your money back. then after that, it's all profitable. But what we know about music is that when you like it, you like it. So yes, there's new things entering and getting into it. There's that competition. What would be interesting is, is what is the attrition rate of downloads and listens when you don't do anything to promote it? Like what got it there in the first place? What was there? Because if the machine of just you might like this song or the machine of just putting up the clips on social media so that new people are seeing it and discovering it, if that's all you had to do and inexpensively, right, to at least maintain the amount of downloads that happened, the streaming, listens, right, however they call it, then that model just over and over again, even here's what I love about it because normally like if you invest in a business, somebody still has to perform something, business still has to operate, you still have to get new customers but generally that means something that has to be fulfilled, nobody has to fulfill this, this is just a thing, like you have to do something in terms of the system but it's not somebody you can't it's you, it's your system, it's not, you know, it's mostly software for the most part, are automations and just checking the stats and making sure, you know, all the automations and the tech is working the way that it's supposed to. But it's not, because if the model is the success is dependent upon creators creating, writers, writers, singers, and those, you know, music artists, a lot of times, I mean, just created to be dramatic, life happens, they can't perform, they break up blah, blah, all these different things that create this volatility is absent in that model, like that's nuts. 00:29:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, and that's why, like, that's why you would acquire 100%, right? with a new artist, they're going to make money, they're incentivized to keep making music, right? you have a, the split is totally different. And then maybe you're also getting paid back. But if you're, if that's done in the context of it's your engineers, it's your your mixing producers, it's your songwriters, you have them inside this machine and they're not, they don't have to go pay $5,000 to get a song made. You could get a song done really cheap, comparatively. They don't have to go pay to get the video done. You're talking to them, like I'm pugging to Jim about this, like Jim and I were going back for an email and I said, Hey, what's the version of like? So he had mapped out a course like to make your own video and I'm like, dude, they're not going to do it. I'm like, yeah, we can sell the course, sure. Some people will do it, most people won't finish the course. And I was like, what if, what if we just showed them how to make a shot list and then they do the shots and then they submit the videos just to be edited because they're not going to edit it, it's Facebook's. And yeah, so I was like, you could, so then it's like, hey, you get a music video and this is how you shoot it. Like you hear it, get your eyes on. But I waste to change the camera to these settings and storyboard out your thing and then go shoot those and send it to us and we'll edit it. And it's like, um, and then, but then that's for like the done with you artists, right? like, they're not there. You're just helping them. But then they're releasing the song through your platform. You're getting paid on their song because they went through your distribution platform. And so, yeah, it behooves you to help them get the song out, have it do well, but you don't believe enough in them or or it's maybe something you don't believe enough in them. You can't work with everyone. Right. So you have to let the cream rise to the top and then the cream you're going to go, Hey, we want to work with you. And then and then we're going to take over all the things that you're the social media and the data that right we're going to take away the jobs. And then for that, we get this and you get that and we're going to help you, you know, people. more consistent. 00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is the structure of like, how does Mark and Jim and Sean and everybody get paid? Like, mom is your company. What does this structure look like? 00:32:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I haven't even said it up yet. So, right now, we're just building fan flowy. I'm funding it, but I haven't really spent very much money at all. And then they're putting in this equity, right? They're building all the stuff with me. The bands that are on it right now, no one's paying a subscription yet, but they're also letting us break their , right? We've definitely screwed up a couple times. But you know what? can screw up when it's free. So, the plan is the stupid spotify app, which is not going to prove to know I'm hopefully in a reason that tomorrow I'm going to get some missing some good book. And I resubmit that. That's probably going to take another eight weeks. Not only knows if we're going to get approved. We have to wait. 00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What was that my daughter wants in right as you said that's getting approved? 00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) We need the Spotify app to get approved. That's the missing piece of the MVP. Once that's approved, then we're going to start charging for bamplowy. So I was waiting for the book, which is now done. 00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is finally done? Yeah, it's done. 00:33:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They're just writing about author parts. Mark's doing it right now. So the book's done. I'm mapping out all the checklists or worksheets right. I was working on that this morning. I'm going to send those to Greg and have him do one. I can't even do one. then he would look like I might have to do a cover for the book too. But it's mom. So it's going to the bands are paying them a done with you fee. I don't even know what it is, I don't even care, but they're like running the ads for them. And they're like giving them support, they have a Slack support group set up and whatever. So whatever bands are on there that are just paying them like a monthly retainer of some sort to get access to the software and then get access to them to run the ads. So like Johnny's putting up ads every day. But they, you know, it's a grind and it's like not scalable. So the scalable version is DIY and then that and then coaching. what I want to do with the book is like bring people in, show them that it works, put them on fan flowy and then they can, you know, send from there. Hey, want to come with you? you want to come whatever, get them in the community, blah, but the software is like primary. Employees like the real Year the main gear There is no financial partnership structure arrangement at all no those guys love that , and I'm like no We're not incorporating something that doesn't make any money Right, so the the deal is 50 50. I get half they get half That's the that's the deal. That's the understood deal That they brought to me. 00:35:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't care how they distribute their house, right? 00:35:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And then I mean I don't I think that to a degree that I don't think they really get it. I don't think Mark understands that like This can be everything that he thinks that he's ever wanted it has the it has I want to say potential, but I'm gonna say it As it has the all the pieces are there, like the puzzle is not together, but it's like the pieces are right in the they just need to slide it over and click it in. Like, yeah, slide it over and click it in. They're not spread out on the table anymore. So that's what he was dealing with before is like the piece, the piece of the puzzle wasn't even on the table. Well, now they're all in the table and some of it's put together and it's like, okay, what do we need to do to click this one in place, right? It's not as simple as picking it up. It's like, all right, what do we need to do that, right? So they're they're all there, but they're not all in place, right? For example, the distribution thing, like they had talked about that and then Sean and Sean found the saying and I talked to them and now that piece is just sitting there and it has not been put in place, but it can be. But there's no point in putting it in place right now. However, the piece has been defined, its location where it needs to go is known about the domain. Like, it's there. we just got to wait to then go click. There's no point putting in a place if nobody's using pamplowing. 00:37:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:37:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Just like the community, like I started it, it was working and I stopped it. I said, I'm not building community right now because there's nothing, there's nowhere for them to go. I have nothing to offer these people other than a checklist. That's not enough. And I learned like, okay, I learned what to ask them and I learned, okay, great. Down. Check. Peace is there. It's not in place. 00:37:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, I mean, do you have, I'm just trying to think about Well, the other bit is like, they, I didn't come up with this equity crowdfunding thing until like a month and a half ago. 00:37:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And I was like, and I got it from listening to one of Joe's podcasts and turns out, the girl that he interviewed lives here, but now I can go meet her whenever, and you can do a sit-jow up. But once I listened to that, I was like, oh, this fits perfectly. In that context, if you're going to do equity crowdfunding, I guarantee you, you need to have an entity that looks a certain way. So I'm like, great. That's what the entity is going to be based on. It's not going to be based on a distribution of bears or whatever. It needs to be based on the idea of like, hey, let's say I want to go rate is $10 million over time. Great. What does that need to look like? That's not that you're going to go public, but when I have a company right now, it's 50-50. It's me and Denise. I don't know how many F&T shares there are in D&D company, and I don't care, right? But if you're going to equity crowdfunding, that's going to matter. Because you're actually selling shares. So, you know. We had an entity, it would be getting dissolved and reformed with this. So it's like, okay, now it'll be like, hey, I want to build because I think I'm going to put that piece of places. Therefore, this entity piece, I think needs to look like this. And I guarantee you, if we build that and they don't equity crowdfund, it won't hurt us because it was built that way. If it's built in a way to allow equity crowdfund, it's not going to a negative from a distribution or equity standpoint. It'd just be like, oh, you have a hundred thousand shares and it could have been a thousand because, you know, that's what you needed to go equity round or whatever. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what do you have defined right now that is what is going to be, if anything, that would be sold, that has a price point where you could do those financial calculations? 00:39:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I think Sean has mapped out the SaaS tier pricing. I don't know it offhand. But I believe he did. I think you've done him and Eric were in a setting up. I don't know if it's inside a family, but I think Sean did it. And we're like, I think the low level is like 97 bucks, right? then the coaching and stuff. They I don't know what they're charging, but whatever they are, I would probably raise the price. So I can get that from them. So it be like, what does the done? What is the done with you tier? And what does it look like? And what is the price? And then the done for you would be this label level thing. And you can't really do that. Unless you had more, but I don't. And you can't do it. But like, if you're going to do done for you and you're going to pay to produce someone's song, what is they've done it, right? So Mark and Sean have, you know, after after what they've done. But like, they work that guy, massive man, who's this rapper who PS they're like, he can buy his catalog. So they work with him. I don't know. So with him, I think they worked on a like, and maybe this is maybe there's like a done for you barter thing, where it's like, hey, we're going to come and do a song with you. And we're going to make sure that we can work together, which is essentially what they would do with him. But they only did that because they couldn't like sign him and be like, we're going to do every song with you. But as I say it out loud, and I'm like, maybe it's that. I don't know what that deal looks like. I don't know what, I mean, I know Mark and Sean worked on it and I know they wrote, but I don't know that they actually charged mass anything. They should have. They should have charged him to mix it. They should have charged him to produce an engineer. But I don't know that they did. In this scenario, you would. But what does that look like? Or, yeah, so that that Or that's that's not even done for you. There's that tier to like you could have a tier where you're like I mean, I guess it's done with you production tier There's a done with you marketing tier done with you. Yeah, it's done with you. So then the done for you There should be like some sort of like hey, we're gonna try this out And you're not signing them to a deal. You're signing them to like a single like that Assuming that could be a thing And then you would just take your done with you pricing and say this is what we're investing You're not paying any of this. 00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is what we would have charged you down here and for that We're getting 50 percent of this or 50 percent of the streams or whatever it is So If somebody okay, so let's say Dan starts running ads and gets people to the book And the book gets people to lead flowy. would be splitting 50 percent of whatever revenue lead flow we make. 00:43:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I get paid back everything first. So I have to calculate all that which stays and I could do it but I just let me in. So I calculate my total investment, I get paid back 100% first and then we go then it's 50% of net. So then you have to cover any of the ongoing costs, the cost of lead flow, the white label, the cost of whatever it is, right? There'll be different costs, right? If we add the distribution in, that becomes like 900 bucks a month. If we add in this circle, that becomes $300 a month, right? So whatever the 50% of net, I get paid back everything and I'm 50% of that. And then the net's like moving moving item for whatever period. 00:43:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So then with, in fan flowy and the services, the sort of done with you and the done for you, those guys are fulfilling stuff and that's what they're doing for their 50%, but you get 50% of that also, is that right? 00:44:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, so the done with you and done for you was like really mom and it's so it's done with you, they'd be on fan flowy, right? it's like, hey, you're using fan flowy. So we won't work with anyone. I think we don't work with anyone that's not even fan flowy. So it's like, you don't, these are even available to you. You can't just come in from the outside. You can come in at this done with you tier, but the first thing you're going to do is start paying for fan flowy because we're not going to help you promote us all or promote yourself if you don't even have this fan after and grow up system in place, right? So done with you, done for you, that's mom level stuff. And in my mind, it's like an ascension out of fan flowy. Well, fan flow is with inside a mom, right? the ground level of mom is like the book and then fan flow is a service and then it kind of goes up from there. 00:45:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. So what I'm asking is, is everything under the mom umbrella being split with them 50-50? 00:45:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, yeah. someone came in after the fact, after we have an end of the year whenever all the money would go into a mom account. So they would pay mom right now. They're paying bam rock or whatever. They wouldn't pay them anymore. 00:45:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got it. 00:45:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Or maybe they would keep the ones that they already have and then all the new ones whenever one of the other. 00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. OK, that's more clarity, I think, than I've ever seen. What I'm going to do, a lot of these notes are already structured as is. I think would be really helpful. for Stacy to have so that she can house them somewhere and she's in the meetings. 00:46:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I assume she's in most the meetings. That one, yeah. 00:46:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so I met most meetings like with you guys about these topics. Anyway, I'm gonna highlight some stuff. might even make like a tiny little just kind of mind map as a visual starting point for helping facilitate that conversation that you guys will be in so that because you know how it is, we see it, they see it literally same page because now a page exists to be able to look at it. Since you're getting so close to being able to start ads and, um, you so much, um, start ads and, uh, and sending traffic, um, So, but you can't sell stuff you haven't defined and you're building the technical aspect of it. But anyway, you know, the offer and the physical fulfillment are two different things, not that it's physical, it's digital, but you know what I mean. So, it's just bodies are weird, damn, they're just weird and inconsistent and annoying and frustrating. Like if I do the same stuff every single day, then I should get the same type of results. But do you think that that's how it works? No, Dan, that is not how it works. No, it is not. No, not at all. That's okay because I'm a boss at figuring it out and then solving it quickly. I'm just annoyed. have to work so hard at it. 00:47:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And it is not a plus. 00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not. It's really not. My sister has like the easiest life. She has them. is she's got no issues. She's just like flowing through life, not thinking about nothing. And I'm like, if I don't think about anything, I'm dead. So that's nice. I'm not even being dramatic about it. That's the truth. 00:48:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, it was the truth. 00:48:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. That's good. Okay, I'm not gonna save my notes yet, because I don't want to trigger the app CC until I'm done with that. How is the Google analytics stuff going? 00:48:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well, I jumped in Wednesday and I looked at a number. I can't be right. It's way too high. I gotta go figure out why that's so high. So I think, I don't know, stuff might be double firing. So there's two numbers I looked at. One, I have to confirm, which is my new customer customer variable customer event. So I have to go try to match the that up with meta rick and see if it should match. If it doesn't, then I'm going to circle around a mushi and be like, this is wrong in this way. So if it's over a ronder. Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to get the date that he put it. have that date. But I see if that's working and then they do this past stuff. It's only way you can describe it is like you fire an event on a URL. So like I set up two paths, which are literally our paths, right? So our paths are choose a path, go down a path, go to the product page. I created an event so that I could say show me the ninja only path, which would mean they start on the paths page, they choose to go down the ninja only path, and then they end up on the product page. And then conceivably they go to the next page and they check out right. So that would be the entire thing. So it's path. selection down the path, product page, checkout, and then purchase. So initially, I think the first two were missing. I set those up. Now I see them, but like, I want to say that like the individual path pages are higher than the path selection page. And I'm like, that's there's no way that's true. is the only way to get to those is through that page. Some like, it should be that they are half or roughly, right? They should they should sum to the total of half or or near the path could be higher because people don't want to work. But I looked at that, whatever, and I was like, that's way too high. That the numbers between the two paths were pretty close, which makes sense. But they all they seem too high. then they didn't seem to really relate to the way the path selection page they should. good. I don't know what's going on. So I going to dig into that and then run it by my buddy over there at Mercer's Place. And then this other one is, there's something wrong, like, it does video percentages. And I think it does like 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, not 100, or does play 10, whatever. And I think the only ones that are registering are play in 90. I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Pretty sure there should be some other ones before 90. And then why is only 90 working? So I got to send that into them and be like, is this something about the trigger is wrong? I'm assuming like the con, I'm working. But it's, it works on the beginning and the end. I don't know, so I swear I did it right, but I'm going to send that into versus people to be like, any idea whether this is happening? 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would love to, like, if you just, like, screen share one day and just kind of show me what you've set up so I can visualize it, because so often we're talking about things, and I think I follow it pretty well, but, you know, the visual, it's a whole new kind of understanding. Okay, so how's sales going for another 71? 00:52:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Steady, Eddie. 00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's good. 00:52:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) We didn't get a big pop on. We didn't notice that we didn't get a big pop on the new release type. Like, you do to a major score release of the calls. We just had one of those when it was, like, moderate, not great. 00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) whatever we know so that was that's 2025 don't want 2025 I was trying to figure out what the different types are because I remember looking at them with you and they're like the 21 or whatever there's going to be in 2025 and how they were broken down let's see okay I don't like to get my notes real quick and see if there's anything else I want to ask about although that the whole mom stuff was a really good oh any updates on just the weddings stuff at all that whole wolf or thing. 00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, pretty sure Heather, you know, Heather's smart or whatever. But I think she's basing her price on the total amount of money she's made there. And then she's putting a multiple on that and like, Oh, sweet, no sweetie. That is not how that works. And then she's also basically get on the fact that like, Oh, she did say this. Oh, yeah, the gen tucks revenue wasn't good in 2024 because of a bad contract. 00:54:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But that's going to remedy itself. And then it will be, you know, like, hmm, that's not how that works either. 00:54:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Her number is not based on reality. But she's like, totally checked out at this point, like, we were supposed to have a meeting, same page meeting today. She's like, I think we should cancel it. I was like, okay. And I mean, just making good money. And she's got two babies now, right? Yeah, and she's like, I just don't want. I don't put any money or any energy towards it. But then she did that in Slack. I don't pay attention to Slack that much. And then she's texting me. She's like, Jamie's really pushing for a meeting. And I was like, are you talking about? It's like in Slack, I go, oh, I didn't see that. So then I went, then there's Jamie trying to keep this meeting that we're supposed to have today at night. And she's like, well, Jamie's like, I think we really need to get on the same page where Heather's future is unsure, right? The very Jamie thing, right? And then I was like, okay, well, there's really three, she's like, oh, Heather's future is uncertain. I go, well, if you wanna relieve that uncertainty, then you need to exercise your first writer refusal. If you're not gonna buy it, exercise it. And the 60 days goes away. And then he can proceed. even whatever way she's going to tomorrow. And of course, Jamie doesn't want to do that, right? Because she wants to be in control. And so she's like, well, if the meeting is contingent upon me making that decision, I say we post upon the meeting. like, the meeting is not contingent upon you doing that. But I'm like, here's the deal. There are three outcomes here. Other cells. Are there, oh god, what did I say? Heather cells. No, you buy Heather proud. One, Heather cells, two, Heather stays in some sort of non-engaged, you know, whatever capacity. But I'm like, this is just, they all equal the same thing. Uncertainty. I go, well, we can lower the uncertainty by you making your decision or not. If you're not going to buy it, just say no. And then we can move to step two. And then, but here's the problem. Step two and step three, no idea how long Those are going to take, right? It could take forever. Yes, no one's going to buy this thing. It's like, what are we doing? Like, I understand. I just want to get the sales page up, charge them $600 bucks and bucks. Because I mean, I thought it's the same principle, right? I about buying it. I was like, nah, I'd rather go buy Lansdowne. Because that's, I'd rather work with Sean. And I don't have to work with it to your point early, right? I don't have to work with anyone. I own the thing 100%. And they can't take the off Spotify. Like, I'd rather go do that than this. And now, of course, now I'm stuck with this software that we developed up to like, thanks, Heather. But I don't think, I mean, I don't need them for that. I think, I I don't think Jamie's going to like, F with me. Right. then she, so then subsequent to that, she texted Heather and like, can you tell me where you're came up with evaluation and can you send me like the countersigned documents of this and that? And Heather's like, I'm not doing that. He's like, you don't have to. We had the rotor back. I came up with it. It's an SDE evaluation based on all the remote, which is wrong. And then she's like, I'm not, I'm not doing your due diligence for you. Like, if you don't have those documents, then I'm not going to get them for you. Um, which is fine. Totally acceptable. You should have them. And then that's where it's at. So then I was like, when's the 60 days up? 00:58:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:58:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) November 4th. So basically nothing's going to happen until November 4th. And then they'll shut down for the year. stops working in December. So it's like, what are we doing? Uh, so yeah. 00:58:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, I don't understand what's happening. always operated so clearly and smoothly before. 00:58:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Just kidding. Well, that's the thing. I mean, part of me is like, like, what are you doing, Heather? you didn't, you didn't need to do this, you know what I mean? It's like, now, now it's like, you're kind of up. It's like, you're getting a motion. 00:59:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, that's, that's exactly what it is right there, though. Yeah. done with you, Amy, it's a big off of you and cut off your nose to spite your face because I hate my face and the face is Jamie. 00:59:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. And I mean, it's in the context of like Joe making money now. And I'm like, yeah, for baby, it's the combo. 00:59:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But if Joe wasn't making money, this wouldn't be happening. 00:59:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, I know. But my argument to that would be the money that Joe's making is not real money. It's not, it's not a, it's a business that could disappear tomorrow. It's, he's building the wrong business, right? So he's like, he's doing And this AI consulting with who I would say is a scammer. So I'm like, that's great. Now with, he was an ascending kid. He was like, I can see a space, but whatever. Yeah, so they're doing this AI consulting thing where they're overcharging people to do it, right? 01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) mean, come on. separate? 01:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, he lives here. Mike came in, Mike came eggs. 01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, that dude. 01:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I never liked that guy. I never really came to be alone. 01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Did you ever do anything with Mike the same? 01:00:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh. 01:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I thought. 01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) hung out with him once or twice, so that's about it. 01:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 01:00:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right, Joe worked with all of them, which is fine. So anyway, it's like, you know, he's ignoring his own business for that. And I'm like, I don't dude. I don't know if that's it. It's a great idea, but whatever. I mean, my plan is still to, I now think Joe, I mean, I'll get with Heather and be like, all right, let's build Joe's business. And on basis, and then sell his courses, and he should build a podcast or network in circle and sell the courses in circle and do that. And then sell them on to your basis, podcast, and dang. And yeah, let's go do that. And then just charge Jamie 600 bucks a month. Part of it was, I was also thinking like, I should just go to them and be like, I'll buy 25% from each of you. 01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Dude, for real. 01:01:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Right? then I'm like, I own 50%. And then you guys can both check out. Yep. Except it's not worth it to the grant, yes. 01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah, for sure. Yep. But. So you throw something at them that's, you know, gets them by. 01:02:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) problem is Jamie is going to check out too. They're both going to check out. 01:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's like, whatever. But that's okay because, well, never mind, she owns the YouTube. I mean, because the content really is the only thing we're buying. 01:02:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I mean, I realized also this week that, like, they built, it's the wrong model, right? It's like you're, it's not going to be this huge course. So I mean, same thing, the them on circle. Like if they start, if they got rid of the Facebook group and they put every lead into a circle community and then you were selling the course through there, you're selling the course through email, you're selling the course through circle, but then in circle, they're helping each other, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you, you bolt on like, of course, this is not going happen. But it's like you start what models in that industry work better Zola Zola is doing 120 million a year It's like okay. Well, what how do you go build a baby version of them of what Zola? Which is like they give free websites, dude. It's ridiculous I think they make most of their money by offering free websites and then on the website. They go put a link to your your Put link to your target registry on this button and then when they do that they append their affiliate URL to the link That's wild. I have it is I just realized how late it was and I went on as I've been waiting. So I gotta go. 01:03:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that's a good name That's wild. Anyway, to be continued 20 mil That's yeah The whole the whole new craziness anyway, okay, you And your special sweet wife go take care of her. Good luck with that Thanks. This ending you guys did positive vibes. 01:04:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Try not to cry. dan@danddcompany.comTina MarieD&D Co & Profit Drivers - Weekly Review

Oh, we didn't talk about that. I did not do my homework. 00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Everything okay? 00:01:59 - Michael Any good reason why I don't? I ended up I went to a 40th birthday and no good reason but now I went to a 40th birthday party from Friday to just got off the plane actually about an hour ago. 00:02:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh was that the one that marks did the chat GPT exercise with for ideas? 00:02:22 - Michael Oh I didn't go on that one now but this is just it this is a different friends birthday I don't I don't have crazy rich friends like Mark. Okay well this is where we're at this is what we need to be working on so we can just do it on the call. Okay Okay you be invoices to my accountant. 00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We'll do that first. 00:03:05 - Michael What is it called, itemized invoices. Should I show them an example or do they know what that means? 00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Show who an example. 00:04:20 - Michael Oh, the accountants. 00:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can you see my, can you see my printer? 00:04:29 - Michael Oh, yeah, okay. 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see. 00:04:42 - Michael Oh, yeah. On Thursday, before I went to Vegas, I left my computer in Modesto, which is two bars from the Bay Area. When I was working there on Wednesday. Oh, no, worked in a third section. And then I came home and I took out my computer, so now I'm using my backup computer. It's weird. 00:04:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Your audio is really rough. like very I don't know it's kind of scratchy. 00:05:05 - Michael don't know if it's just me or you I didn't have any issues with the last call but any test test test is this better? Yeah, much better. 00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got it. Thank you. Okay so for emotional taxes and the close can I see an itemization of how you arrived at the total charge. Oh okay now I remember what this was about. Sorry I had to yeah um so yes let's go back and take a look at that because it was a lot. You told me you pay X a month basically and then the bill was like astronomically higher. 00:05:53 - Michael Yeah so like this is an example here's one of my corporations and this is the amount of you. So you were asking me like well how did they arrive at this? 00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I was like, I don't know for sure that just, no, you give them, don't give them an example. So, because then you kind of, yeah, they should be able to just tell you this is what we did, rather than maybe you ask for less and they just be like, okay, give it to you. 00:06:23 - Michael So let's see what they come up with. 00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. It's very specific language. It should be very clear, itemize me, each item is listed and quantified. 00:06:35 - Michael Okay. Should I list that the corpse? 00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, for sure. 00:06:58 - Michael I hate my lawyer for me. And he named that so stupid. OK, I think that's it. 00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why did he do that? 00:07:14 - Michael Because it was a new lawyer. And they read, I guess, the code, and they're like, oh, it's a good idea to name the medical corporations and the name of the doctor. So there's no confusion if another doctor has the same name. So that's what they called it. And they said, oh, it's a good thing on professional corporations to add a medical corporation to the end of the doctor's name. So that's how they arrived at this monstrosity. 00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) can change that. I know. It's a little piece, not that big of a deal. 00:07:44 - Michael I mean, if you really hate it. I do really hate it. Actually, I was just thinking I should change that name. OK. 00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, I think that's Every time you see it, it causes negative energy, then you should change it. 00:07:54 - Michael OK, going to change it. Oh, that's a good point. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, see. So we manage energy, we manage energy big time around here. 00:08:04 - Michael I think they did show up. did. Yep, that should be it. 00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, send it off. Yep. And I would personally change the language. I would not ask, can I? I would simply tell them, I would like to see it. I'm not asking permission. I pay you. 00:08:37 - Michael have permission. 00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like that's their job. So I don't, I don't mean it in a disrespectful. own you. I pay you blah, blah, You know what I mean? Like, it's literally the job, though. Okay, we'll see what we get back. And that will be revealing one way or another. 00:09:33 - Michael Oh, and then I am going to be interviewing another accountant on Wednesday here. 00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:09:42 - Michael Just. It's been, I've been with this same accountant two years. So. We feel pretty good with them, but I always just want to make sure we. doing all we can. 00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And it's, yeah, for sure. It's. You don't want to be complacent when it comes to financial management at all. 00:10:05 - Michael Or I've got another one of my friend likes to say you can make a lot of money, but it doesn't matter. It's about how much you keep it. 00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That makes sense. Yep, 100%. Okay, so next task item, go into my email. 00:10:27 - Michael Okay, let's see. 00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That was not it. I didn't say fun. 00:10:41 - Michael Okay. 00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That mean you probably didn't send it. I just laughed at it. was just thinking about Esther like moving the baby to get sleep. It's just as a mom sometimes you just like, I need to do something. I'm done. That was hilarious. It's to me of like a cat. 00:11:01 - Michael Anyway, let me see. 00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. I said you have to send this to you. 00:11:05 - Michael Can you kind of look at Tina us a meme or you a meme here. I just thought I watched it and I Oh. Yes. 00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's why I'm done. Beat yourself. 00:11:52 - Michael Yes. Here's the cat food. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is what you're going to be eating from the rest of life. My body is mine now. 00:11:59 - Michael You're done. Oh my God. It's not just you Esther. 00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We all are there at one point or another. 00:12:07 - Michael I agree. Yeah. 00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I saw that and I had to send it. 00:12:11 - Michael love it. Oh, that's cat food. 00:12:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, guys. They can't run to the owner. Can you please give this to them? Because I don't want the mommy anymore. Anyway, I wanted to share. 00:12:29 - Michael Yes, it's totally true. 00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. What is our next? Let's see. Let's see. Homework recap. Oh, I'm including one of the how many are in potential growth areas. Want to work on that? Let's see. 00:12:47 - Michael just did. 00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I mean, we can go through this. What? Where would you like to start? Wherever you have the most energy towards. because this is a long list, this is a lot of stuff to do. 00:13:03 - Michael If you could Joel me to do it, I will do it but I have zero energy today from Vegas, I am working off of a team of words. 00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You tell me what I should do. I just do the next one, report. Yes. Hold on a second because the one thing, the high-level one, compile financial data for all the businesses. That's a big task. We're not going to do that today. That's something that I don't want to do it when you're low-energy because I need you to be focused in paying attention, but it's the one document to rule them all. 00:13:38 - Michael That really needs to get done. 00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That is because that's the leverage. That's where we make your 2X plan without working more. That's the thing. That's where you start getting into a whole new level of operating in business and what's going to make you feel even more successful. more confident and once you start to get that traction, but when you got that traction intentionally and without that terminal cost and extra stress and bloat and all of these things, what you believe is possible as well as your discipline. The discipline becomes easier because you're like if I just put a little effort into the right things, I get bigger terms. So that document is how we plot the path to that particular type of life. So work on that this week. Let's go ahead and get to the next thing. don't have an assignment due date for HSA payments, but any type of payment plan that you can set up for Delta, I think it increases your ability to convert, you know, patients to... Someone to buy that. So I think that that's something that you should consider and work on the initial. Okay, so this was a chat GPT note. This wasn't Tina saying, I agree with your 10k budget. Do not think you need to spend 10k at all. So I need to rework that for you. I wouldn't spend more than $5 a day. It's not about waste. It's actually that if you spend bigger budgets almost always, Google just you on purpose and they're okay with it. They don't even care. I normally would not ever use that language, but it's really like I'm trying to be graphic on purpose. The abuse in ads, if they know you don't know what you're doing, they will take a balance of you. So you need to be conservative and stay conservative. And a lot of times scaling big does not work well. you have to really know what you're doing before you start putting in money and you really have to know how to prevent Google abuse putting in big money. And that's a whole big long topic. It's not your job. It's not I'm not the expert. I work with them. I can tell you who to talk to, but the whole point of this exercise is you just being familiar with what it looks like to some extent so that when you hire somebody, you know what you're talking about and you can, you know, your BS radar will be nice and fine tuned. 00:16:33 - Michael Okay. 00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway, those two things we can set a due dates for them that you think is appropriate. They should have due dates, but I don't think that they're as urgent as other things. The one document to rule them all next Monday at cost of penalty. Okay. I agree. Okay. 00:16:57 - Michael You're just like, I'm tired. Okay. 00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. All right, we'll figure out a due date for the other two next week. That will be part of our conversation so that you don't have to think about it right now. 00:17:14 - Michael Create report showing. I'm doing the, I'm doing the HSA thing. Oh, do you see my screen? 00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, I was looking at my notes. 00:17:24 - Michael Okay. Got you. 00:17:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, catch EBT entirely too much. I'm like, where have you my whole life? 00:18:22 - Michael Thank you, okay, good. 00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. 00:18:28 - Michael Nice. Thank you. that's pretty detailed can you see my desktop right now or are you looking at just the window now and I can see your desktop so if you only want to share the window you have changed your sharing and go select just the window oh I should show you my website that's great I did it oh wait what is this it's actually delto not delta oh I do I thought I said delta or something I've seen that oh but I think the note taker got it wrong oh yeah this is the website yes also done with chat GPT that's it 00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that's that's the entire website yeah they're pre-sold somewhere else though right what do you mean oh you mean yeah well right now um the person that makes or the company that makes the AI software is like getting inbound people that want to do this and they just right now they've sent two to me um but they have I reached out to them say hey I heard you wanted a braidskin ready to go they haven't responded yeah um can you scroll the way up so that um is difficult to read there's maybe a drop shadow behind it but I doubt it but if you have texts like that you're gonna want to have some kind of like a stroke a drop shadow or a bar behind it oh okay also um if that's a brain scan image like if that's what it looks like it just does not seem that obvious in the beginning because you can barely see the outline of the brain. 00:21:04 - Michael Oh, it's a good point. 00:21:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But what I think would be really useful what what people want to see is either some screenshots of what the scan looks like and they're clearly labeled or almost like a it's like if there's a video or kind of like a slideshow type video of different pictures of like this is what you see, this is what you learn. You can show people it's show me don't tell me kind of thing. So you want to tell them also, but people are very visual and the sooner they can wrap their head around what's happening as well as stories of what it like because it's preventative medicine, right? Sure. It's about finding something out of time. So are there any stories about what has been prevented? What was diagnosed and found in advance? like no one can know exactly. what time was saved but we can estimate you know if something has been found at this particular stage the prognosis is generally this but because we found it here it's going to be this that type of thing. 00:22:16 - Michael Yeah I went through it and the kind of the what you were saying is I think one subset of people they're kind of worried about like what's inside and then another whole class to people seem to be people that yeah I mean obviously they want to make sure nothing's wrong but they also want to optimize their health and so that messaging was a little bit like there's two distinct subsets like the kind of overlap but so then you want to have different landing pages for different audiences yes and you there's there's two specific ways to go about it so first of all your stuff your your keyword campaigns and your marketing campaigns like 00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and on specific landing pages, but let's say that they come in and they just typed in your website. so you don't know because it's a direct visit, there's no trackable source. Then you can ask them, what is your main purpose for being here? Is it preventative healthcare or health optimization, physical life optimization, and so then you can direct them to the proper, the best landing page based off of their answer. 00:23:40 - Michael That's interesting, like even before they get into the site, just have a simple like two buttons and just be like, are you here for optimization? 00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. right, and it just, are you more interested in preventative medicine and you could put in parentheses, aka a avoid diseases that you're afraid of, whatever, you want, the copywriting matters. It needs to be better than that. Or are you just interesting and optimizing your body and maximizing longevity and quality of life? 00:24:15 - Michael No. 00:24:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, I love these ideas. 00:24:22 - Michael just don't know how to like how to get it done because you saw the website I made and it's obvious to you that the wording wasn't very clear, but it's just not obvious to me because I'm just not how I am. 00:24:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, this is why, first of all, we're doing the one document to world them all because rather than just picking something to talk about and spending five minutes on it and then going to the next thing and unstrategically spending another five minutes on it and just never getting into flow and purpose with anything, we're going to look at your numbers and figure out where. you should go through them strategically, right, in order of leverage ability in terms of meeting our goals of making more money with the least amount of investment of time, specifically, and the least amount of risk. So I don't know where Delto falls in that right now, but it's definitely not at the top of the list. When we get there, it's as simple as potentially consulting with or hiring a copywriter and then a development person who can very simply create separate landing pages. Even if you do hire somebody for SEO or keyword research, rather than a marketing campaign, which has to hire somebody to do some low-level SEO, there's iterations and there's levels of where you want to start with it. And you could go drop big dollars on a marketing agency, but you definitely don't need to and I would not recommend it. amended because, well, you've already hired me and I'm pretty good at marketing and I could beat most people in the split test. For one, do you know what split test is? 00:26:11 - Michael A-B testing. 00:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, so headlines, calls to actions, images, those are the primary things that you want to test. And then pricing and offer structure, so not necessarily the price but how you present the price. Like, have you ever been on a page where you're like, they've got three different options and there's one on the left, one on the right, and one in the middle, it almost kind of pops out. Okay, well, the left and the right are throwaway options. You don't even, the left makes no sense because the middle is obviously a better deal. That's on purpose because they don't want you to take the lower price deal anyway. The one that the tire is, well, we'll be happy if they take it, but we don't expect them to. have done our numbers and we know that this middle one is right, so it's visually created. in order to get the most people. And it's also strategically presented to get the most people. So let's say the price is, what is it, was $24.99? 00:27:12 - Michael Yeah. 00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's say that's the price that you want it to be and need it to be. So you explain what they get for that price. And then you make this throwaway offer of, well, here's what you could get for this lower price. Here's what you could get for this higher price. Nobody's gonna really want that. So they're like, oh yeah, this one's perfect. Anyway, there's all kinds of psychology. There's also psychology that says the more options you give them, the less likely you will already get a conversion because you created friction in the mental process. You, by, you created a pause, because now they have to think about something other than just one thought and they have to measure this or that. So anyway, there's a lot. There's a lot. It's not just about putting up a website. and orders coming or whether it's pretty or all these different things, all of it has to be engineered psychologically for optimal effect and according to the avatars, like you said, there's two different purposes. So you need to make sure you've got a landing page for each purpose in each avatar. 00:28:20 - Michael Got it. Yeah. All things that I know and just things I haven't executed on. 00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. And that's the case with almost all of us. But most of us don't need to go study anything else or learn anything else. We just need to actually employ what we know. 00:28:36 - Michael So one of the maybe one of the things that I could do is find it. Yeah. At first, I thought I needed a Shopify. That's why I built this site on Shopify. Yeah. I because I thought I had to have a robust payment structure, but really I'm just accepting 242999. And that's it. It's not 00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) because I cost you. 00:29:01 - Michael Oh, no, it's not the cost. It's like, you know, $29 a month. 00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's here's why it's really good, though, is because it's a well-known platform and it creates trust. And that is very important. 00:29:13 - Michael I wasn't going to use like, I'm saying like, I could use a platform that's more known for their websites, whereas Shopify was more well-known for their ability to like, like handle, you know, all these complicated storefronts and have multiple products. Right. I don't really need that. I just need one beautiful page, or like you said, AB testing, separate pages and the ability to accept, you know, PayPal and a credit card, which everyone can do. So I'm actually thinking maybe I should just, you know, use, like Esther keeps saying, just use Squarespace, just make a beautiful website, add, and then add a payment system instead of like using a shopping-based thing to try to make a website, which isn't really their forte. 00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, the other thing you have to think about is page speed and load time, because every millisecond it takes longer to load is the more likelihood that you're going to lose the person. People, if it doesn't load in two seconds, it's like 1.5 seconds out, used to be 20 seconds like it just gets smaller and smaller, then the bounce rate increases exponentially. So, Squarespace, generally speaking, is bloated and slow, so that's something that you need to be aware of and you need to compare and ask those questions before hiring anybody. But also know that, no matter how aesthetically pleasing it is, it doesn't have the content that the person needs to have, and Squarespace is not going to do that for As well as getting the videos and the presentations that you're probably going to get more from the creators of the product. So, going to Squarespace wouldn't solve that issue for you, and could actually create kind of like with a magic bullet to make a beautiful website, but I've asked the founders and this is like, this is their like, oh, this is our, you know, this is our backdrop that we can provide you with. So, a couple of things, the beauty is overrated, ugly often converts better than pretty, also just because they made an awesome product doesn't mean they're great at marketing, and just because they. 00:31:31 - Michael Yes, and that's why I'm here, that's right, that's right, yes, okay, that makes sense. Alright, how do I tackle this? Because I guess I'm overwhelmed, obviously like, I wanted, I want this done, this should have been done three months ago when I was in the incubator, and I want, I want this done, but I also don't want this to take over July. I don't want this to take over my CUMI work, but I do want to get something up, because The company, the AI thing, are actually sending me hot leads. 00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And if I convert just one a month, , that's like, you know, it's a couple thousand dollars I make. OK, so do you understand the technology well enough that you could shoot a video talking about it and really inform people and put it on the website? 00:32:21 - Michael I do. I don't I don't want to be in the video, though. 00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You your face doesn't have to be. It could be a voice you can even use AI to do it. But the AI voices are just a little laggy and their their animations aren't really they're not identical to what you do. But they don't have to be. They have some pretty good ones. If you go to Hey, Jen or Cynthia, I think I could do in lieu of making a video. 00:32:50 - Michael Like I think down the road, I would absolutely do that. sounds I mean, I could use my voice video, but is anything maybe just getting your making me busy going back and forth back. That's not like you at the screen. I'm sorry. 00:33:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm just gonna hide it. Um, I can't it. Okay, I'm gonna put something else in front of it. Um, yes. So first of all, better, better pictures essentially. 00:33:14 - Michael Okay, well, purposeful pictures. 00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not about pretty. 00:33:19 - Michael It's about function. Can I just show you what they've given me? 00:33:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Totally. 00:33:25 - Michael Oh, God, I don't know how to use this computer. I don't have any of my stuff on this one. Uh, did I lose my mouth on the computer? 00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Everything's okay. breath. 00:33:50 - Michael I just like convenience and this is not convenient. 00:33:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, I'm with you. I like it because it creates speed and I like speed a lot. I talk through things. Is it a new computer or borrowing or? 00:34:50 - Michael This is my old computer, long ago. Well, not long ago. I was using it up to like six months ago. Let's see. I need caffeine. No, not here, okay, I can't, I don't know where it is, yeah, there it is. 00:36:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You want to show me their website? 00:36:28 - Michael Yeah, that's a good place to start. 00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You might even be able to just search it and see what Google images is available. 00:36:43 - Michael So this is theirs, brainkey.ai. This is outdated, they don't do this anymore. 00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Look at this. They don't do what anymore. 00:37:03 - Michael They don't really do this genetic one. 00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They do just analyze your MRI scans to learn about your brain health and longevity. Okay. Thank you. Good. Yeah. This is what you should have. This is the type of stuff you should have. They're they're not using color psychology very well. But keep going. Keep going. going. I'm just going to scroll and I get actionable recommendations and then sides. Okay. That should be higher on the page. then so basically the way you do is you create an open loop. Basically, like something to the fact that we have this brain scan technology that will give you actionable items to whatever, improve your longevity, something like this, calculate your brain age. Okay. And now let us show you how you do it. You get this view, this view, this view, this view, this view, and then you bring it back to what you first told them about longevity and the score and actionable items. And then you want to learn more, here's the next step. And then it should be book a call to a sales person who gets you on there. Like if you wanted maximum conversions, this should be a sales call. 00:38:42 - Michael That's me. absolutely want to do it. mean, yeah, I can convert one people, one person, that's more than a thousand dollars. So absolutely. Okay. That's a really good point. How do I get started to do what you just said? 00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So basically, we just want to. a reverse engineer, and you need to ask and find out what you have permission to use. 00:39:05 - Michael Everything. They said I could use anything I want. 00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so we could hire somebody to basically replicate this website, but then, huh? 00:39:19 - Michael On mine. 00:39:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, and as its own landing page and landing page, so that we have it done. Oh my God. 00:39:28 - Michael What? Mine. Mine looks so bad. Okay. 00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Yes, let's go. Well, so what you need to understand is all about psychology, you know, and what they're doing is people, like if they're going to spend money on this, why? It's because they know something. They know that their brain health is important to quality of life and longevity. They care about it. Now, what do you automatically know about the person who's interested in this? They're not the average normal person. They're not looking for entertainment. They're not randomly scrolling the web. They need specific amount of information. It needs to be high level information because this is a high level function. It's a high level offer. And so you need to give them what they want to know. So visually, and you want to be very clear, very succinct about what is available, how it works, why it works, the fact that they can have access to it, what it's going to cost to have access to it. so what I would test also is not knowing the price, like for less than whatever. So you kind of like leave it open-ended or you do put the price in either way. You have them book a call and see if it's a fit for them and let them know that financing is available. One of the things that I would... would add color wise in here would be either orange or yellow for so so blue is blue and yellow actually both are trust but yellow is calming orange is action it's take action and so I feel like with this market and you can split test on colors too and see but it psychologically people feel energized towards action they see orange and they take action green is travel um little bit of luxury black is luxury orange and it can be luxury there's there's this whole thing color will of psychology so you will look at that but there's not a lot of color on here and that the gray and the parallax that's pretty common but because there's a lack of color splash elsewhere the energy is kind of low so you don't want a ton of it you just want it strategically placed the right types of color. Let's see. And like right there where they have you can your computed brain ages lower than your chronological age. Like I would highlight with like you know the highlighter effects. Like it looks like you actually just highlighted it. And so where's the part I think is above this where it says get actionable steps. Yeah. Can you click on review insights? 00:42:36 - Michael No, they don't have a link to it. 00:42:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, okay. 00:42:41 - Michael It just goes to their form form collection. Yeah, I see that. Just to tell you the brain key report, they don't show that because it's really the same recommendations for everyone. 00:42:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The recommendations are literally exercise, sleep, and eat well. Because that's pretty much what it is for us. But they want to get into gut health and very specific to where they'd have to test actual stuff in your brain and in your body. 00:43:08 - Michael Well, we talked about it last time, think, that yeah, I ultimately want to sell that stuff, but that's not the first thing. I want that to be in the report so that I could sell stuff to those things, right? 00:43:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) know, yeah, sorry. aids and gut aids, you know, it's you do some research, I'd be interested to see because potentially there's some affiliate partnerships that you might be interested in as well, but, and I don't know, but because we don't know what we don't know, I would just love for you to go explore it because this, I can't even tell you how many thousands of dollars, tens of thousands, I've spent as a result of the test that I got from a company called Vio, V-I-O-M-E, V-Like Victor. But also literally flips my health around. COVID completely destroyed me. lost so much hair. allergies, like I can't smell anything out. I mean, it couldn't, if there was any sense in the air, like my asthma would be so triggered. was on an oxygen machine for months, all these different things. And it actually was that it destroyed my gut health. And that's actually pretty common for COVID. I didn't know that slows everything down, created massive motility issue. So biome got me a start because it breaks down everything that's inside your body. And it gives you some recommendations. So from there, I went to another one called try health smart or something like that, which did a methylation test Oh, try small. So it had, you you take, you know, 75 grams, whatever I think of glucose. It's the same thing for pregnancy, basically. Chug that, and then you breathe into these mylar bags every 15 minutes, and it measures how much, well, how much your methylating, I can't think of the word, methyl something, whatever, is in there, is in your breath, and so, and of course it can do calculations of how your body is functioning with that and then makes some recommendations, so it did that, and from there, I found a company called Silverfern Brands, and they're laypeople, they are not doctors. They do have some, medical type people on staff, but they basically just did the science and research that I've spent a lot of time doing also, and figured out if you have more of this, you have less of that, and less of this, and more of that type of And then, specific types of herbs that really just I've of how digest everything and then also learning that most people solve acid reflux by trying to reduce acid when the actual issue is motility and the only reason that the acid is bugging them is not because they have too much of it but because it's just staying there and it's coming up through the throat because nothing is moving the way that it's supposed to out of the stomach so what call so barrier so that your you could maintain the acid in the barrier so that it could break food down without like killing your lining and anyway whole lot of things all of these things go together so for anybody invested in looking at longevity they're going to go down these paths especially one of the gut brain barrier and since you've got a brain scan that i've never heard of before right you you have an answer What you know is that if somebody makes it to you and is willing to pay that, they're for sure willing to pay for all these other things. So then you get down a path of you can start with an affiliate relationship where you send people to these other companies as a partnership and you can affiliate commission. But as you start to learn more about study it, how do I, what are my first step to get my website? one sec. And the more you get interested in it, then you could potentially create your own stuff because it's actually not that difficult to go to a lab and have somebody else's stuff broke down, make a few tweaks and come up with your unique formula. then you can go sell that on Amazon, which I've been a part of a multi-million dollar company that got sold for 10 million dollars two years after it was created. So anyway, there's a lot of money in this path is what I'm saying. 00:47:53 - Michael (3) How should I, should I get my website, how should I, so how should I do my website? I'm just like overwhelmed. How do I make my website? site look like a simple version of 23andMe, or if you think Vioum's good, I don't know, I don't yeah, websites to me, I don't, okay, anyway, go ahead. 00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, let me let me look at Vioum, but actually the brain key is pretty good. Because it breaks things down, so it's at least a much better start than where you're at. So if you look at Vioum, yes, notice how graphic heavy it is. 00:48:31 - Michael (3) Yeah, lots of graphics, yes. 00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's more color, yeah, and it's not a lot, but there's more, and it helps keeps the brain engaged, and their images of the food, it's a big image of the report. Big stats right there, a whole line that says 86% find that Vioum improves at least one area of health, 70%. communicate benefits to several areas of health and 74% on improvement in health issue that led them to bio. So, like Brinke has parallax, which is you dividing the content between a row of white and a row of gray and a row of gray, right? You saw that. So this is not using parallax, but it's effectively doing it in that there are blocks for each type of text, like the full body health solutions. And then there's a mouse over effect, which means if I put my cursor over it, it goes from black to this beige color and there's movement. So it moves from the picture of the box to a picture of the pill. That movement, again, helps people stay engaged. People get bored incredibly easy. So these little things of movement and these very big, simple pictures. that communicate a lot, pictures with a thousand arms, right? The next thing says gut health solutions, again, mouse over effect changes the color, changes the image, and you see the person with the biome packet pouring it into the water. looks really simple. It's a classy looking box. It's a very simple looking effective. Like I just put it in my cup. And then the next one is oral health solutions. And we have the same thing happening, but instead of pouring a packet into a cup, now I've got this handful of pills that I take, which are giant, but anyway. 00:50:40 - Michael (3) So how do I make it mine to be like this? 00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not that simple. First of all, I mean, this website is probably 10 to thousands of dollars. 00:50:50 - Michael (3) Oh . Yes. How do I do like just one part of it? So you should not be doing it. 00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is. if you're going to invest in it, invest in it. So this, this is where you come down to minimum viable product of Fuji. 00:51:07 - Michael (3) The first, have you sold anybody into it at all? No. 00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So rather than worrying about a website, the first thing you should do is say, can I have a conversation with person, a person and convince them to buy it with what I know about it? 00:51:21 - Michael (3) If you can't do that, you shouldn't be worrying about a website. That's right. Well, I have two people that I message, but they haven't messaged me back. 00:51:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, your website is only going to sell as well as you can sell. You or your team, if you don't have the content, if you can't convince somebody to buy it from your own words, your website is never going to be able to do it. 00:51:48 - Michael (3) So, okay, I'll really try to get these two hot leads on a call. That's what I was trying to do is, and that's just suggest that too, is like, we have to get them on the call here with their here, why they're interested, and then try to close it. So yeah, okay. I'll really focus on that. 00:52:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so then the next thing that you do is whatever money you make from it, set aside for building a marketing engine and just reinvest it. But you first have to validate the concept before you spend a lot of money on it. Just because it sounds cool doesn't mean it's going to do well. 00:52:23 - Michael (3) Well, I do know their sales data, but they're selling it from in-person clinics right now. 00:52:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So like, you know, there's a place which is my point like how you sell makes a huge difference. So now if that's effective, then you have to replicate something like that online, which is where videos come in. Because when you see a video, you feel people feel like they're talking to a person. If the video is done right and the conversation is right, you basically enter the conversation that's already in the rain and you talk to them about where they're at. Like, hey, I know you're you're interested in having the best life that you possibly can have, you know, just getting by isn't your style. If you want to have maximum energy, you want to have maximum quality of life, and you know that your brain is right in the middle of all of it. And so, you know, you're looking for how do you make it work the best that you can? we've got an answer for you. These are the scan. 00:53:24 - Michael (3) This is the data we can get. Okay, so really try to get my initial customer. Well, any hot leads I get from the founders of this company really, yeah, okay, try to get them on a call. 00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If you can't sell 10 that way, don't bother with the website. Once you sell 10, use that money to help you with the website. And I will help you to not go do something dumb and spend too much money for nothing and also not be you because that's not your skill set and there's nothing wrong with that. None of us get all the skills and it would be foolish to spend time doing that with and you're going to make most of your money doing all these other things. Use your money then to have other people's skills on it. 00:54:08 - Michael (3) Okay, I think that's a good plan. So I will try to make well, so I just leave this website. 00:54:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, I need to collect their money somehow. So should I just leave this for now? 00:54:17 - Michael (3) Yeah, you can even just call on a website. 00:54:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The main purpose of it is to be able to allow you to make a payment online. If you have questions, here's how you contact me. Here's my phone number, my email, my blah, blah, and you can set aside a Google voice number just for that so that you know what that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:54:38 - Michael (3) All right, I like that. 00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll do that. But again, you really should be spending your time based off of priority, which should be informed off of numbers, which hasn't been collected and organized and structured yet. And we're like three weeks into four weeks into that conversation. 00:54:57 - Michael (3) Okay, yeah, we're going to work in the one document. 00:54:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's my homework. yes it is and yeah so create a report how about you give Esther the penalty money this and go get her a massage I'm gonna do not do your homework you got it you got to suffer somehow but we can give it to Esther I don't think we agreed that this is homework do we um yes sir we did I will go back and look at the father now I said this is on the fact I'm gonna go do that and I sent you the homework assignment you didn't even read it until today so how are you trying to use a lot of this I thought you didn't I thought you didn't send it okay yeah and if you thought I didn't send it you didn't say you know I didn't get it just in case there's an error or anything like that you're not wheezing out of this no sir that's not what you hired me for to let you weasel out of things right that's true Okay, hold on. Let me go to transcript. Search the word homework. We've got to break this down. I told you, you're going to feel the eyeballs. We see you're ready to work on this day, blah, What day was that? September 19th. When did we talk? That's not the right one. 00:56:35 - Michael (3) I said we talked on Wednesday, remember? Like, I had to be switched it. 00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, we did. Oh, there it is. And then we talked and spoke on the 23rd. 00:56:46 - Michael (3) So, transcript. That was the way to go. 00:56:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll do that. Can you send me a reminder email? Oh, about my homework. Yes, I will do that. 00:57:09 - Michael (3) That's fair. So, how are you? What's your accountability? Oh, it's a massage for you. 00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's not going to be for Esther. What? I'll take it, but come on now. All right. Well, deal to deal. You got to take care of that. Get your homework done. So, the homework, one thing, I will send it to you now. But regardless, I've said it. You hear it. You committed to it. Even if I don't send an email or you don't get it, you're still committed to it. And that is the one document to rule them all needs to be by our entire time, huh? Can we have a link to that? 00:57:56 - Michael (3) Yes. Okay, well, are you going to send a different homework? 00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) game alert is just use this one you just use that one actually it's already there can you reply to it with the link to the document to fill out yes hold on let me do this don't say okay and then let me make sure next monday's clear so i don't bail on you again yeah sorry about that that is really weird why does that happen if you don't say oh that was weird i didn't know you could do that okay i'm confirming with you that next monday i'm not doing anything and let's just go ahead and check um calendar so what day of the month is your is it the 16th like middle so let's see the 14th of october oh and we're moving into our new house no um that you work so that you can't meet on monday's 00:59:00 - Michael (3) Next next month I can meet every day. 00:59:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, okay. I think you should actually tell me that All right, so how are we looking just for like the next couple weeks out? 00:59:12 - Michael (3) Yeah, seventh is the next one. 00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I believe I just got your knee ball. 00:59:16 - Michael (3) Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so the seventh looks good and you want it um is 130 better? 00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Okay, you will get the best version of me later. 00:59:27 - Michael (3) Oh, that's right. I'm already telling me this last week. Okay, it's good. It's 130 on Mondays. 00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. It gives me plenty of time to catch up on your homework and to really be kind of sleep in too. Which is good because I need your brain to be at optimal level when we talk. 00:59:43 - Michael (3) You know, that maximizes your investment. So, okay, that makes sense. 00:59:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, again, energy like we are always looking to maximize energy. Okay, so you have your homework. Yeah, no excuse. No excuse. No excuse. But at the end of the day, and here's the thing about the penalty, sometimes we can make a conscious choice to pay the penalty. Sometimes you're just like, you know what? I'm not going to do it. I'll pay the penalty because I'm sleeping in or going to a party or something else is more important. And we get to make that decision. We're all ask people. You know, sometimes you just want to shift your priorities. And as long as you're accountable for it, and you're willing to pay the price and not pretend that it's something else and not blame somebody else. you're just like, yep, I'm paying the price. Here it is. Don't want to hear anything about it. I just made a choice. Then respect it and be a piece with it. And that's really empowering. Don't feel guilty. Don't feel shame. Don't be like, I should have done better. I made a conscious choice of how to use my time and I'm okay with that. That's fair. Yeah. But because when your time involves somebody else, you know, the respect of it and like, okay, well, here's what I'm going to do for you because, you know, you don't get to, like for me, I don't get to go. It either results as fast. It kind of ties my hands. 01:01:02 - Michael (3) Like I have performance expectations. Be like on that point that we split our meetings like 30 minutes and 30 minutes. That way it will like literally force me to work twice a week on this. 01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, because that takes up two calendar blocks from me. 01:01:23 - Michael (3) Oh, I see, okay. 01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know what I mean? So I have to set two separate times to be committed to on my schedule in order to do that. 01:01:32 - Michael (3) And it might as well be two different clients. 01:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I gotcha. Not the amount of times the the block on the calendar. That's fair. Yeah. But you'll get this and once I'm just going to reiterate this and then we'll go. Once you get the one document to rule them all, the way that it's supposed to be and fully populated, the plans and the clarity will start coming together. And you will see with your own data and numbers why you should be doing. One thing instead of another and not just doing it because you're like, I feel like this today, you know Okay, that's fair It's doing good. So um one question I haven't had answered yet is we had GPT help you with those Particular reports for that one attorney that kept giving you a problem How were those reports received? 01:02:25 - Michael (3) Yeah, I messaged him last week and then he didn't respond So again, but if he had issues, would he probably have sent that to you already? He's very behind so I let me let me just ask him. That's a good thing I could work on Yeah So let's get that reported to you because I want to know if it made the difference and have you had anything else to send to him since? 01:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No Okay, all right. 01:02:54 - Michael (3) I hope he's gonna still use me, but we'll see Yeah 01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We we want to track that like how what is your relationship with your attorneys and are they using you? they using you more? Are they using you less? There's so many different ways and levers that we can be optimizing, but without tracking it and organizing that data, we're just talking about it and wasting time. 01:03:19 - Michael (3) That's true. Okay. 01:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm not here for that. I'm here for optimization. All right, Fuji. Good talk. Good work. 01:03:30 - Michael (3) Yes. Do I have to do all this for my homework? 01:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The the one document to roll them off? 01:03:36 - Michael (3) Or I mean, you know, there's like a bunch of stuff on September No, I will be satisfied if you actually finished the whole thing. But if you didn't finish the whole thing, then do all of the rest of the other things. I see. Oh boy. Okay. We could try this. 01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, or you could just like be a slacker, but I didn't think that's what you were here for. 01:03:58 - Michael (3) I won't get it done. 01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I won't it done. I'm teasing. right. You have a great day, a great week. 01:04:04 - Michael (3) I will talk to you Monday and say, hello to all your ladies for me. Sounds good. Thank you for rescheduling. 01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Appreciate that. No, I appreciate it from you. 01:04:13 - Michael (3) I felt much better about this call showing up for you better. So thank you. Awesome. 01:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. michaelfujinaka@gmail.comTina MarieFuji/Tina Coaching
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, hey, how are you? 00:00:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. me just grab a glass of water. just realized I don't have that for saw my desk. 00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hold on. 00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Do you have a fabulous weekend? 00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I did. 00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yay. 00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I needed it. 00:00:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, good. All right, my water. 00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm already looking at flight for next time. 00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Alexa, stop. Okay. So I was hoping we can just open up a Google Doc and just knock out details of the offer. Yeah. And then, um, I don't want show your screen or my screen, but I didn't want to show you one quick thing. I just put together. they're like over the weekend just finalizing it now. This is what I put together. She had this is one of the two gay clients. And she sells ADHD stuff for kids, but also this child custody binder, that's why she was taking a long time to decide what niche to go after. So we're starting to after this one and the whole parenting niche. But I'm really proud of this. 00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This looks awesome. Very good. 00:01:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Anyhoozy. So yeah, so pretty proud of that. 00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah. That's awesome. 00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) she happy? Oh yeah, she she's I'm very careful with her what she spends because she's like really been through a lot and doesn't have a lot of money. So I'm always helping her above and beyond. Without a doubt. But yeah, she's happy with everything. Whenever she gets on a call of me, or if I help her something on her Shopify e-commerce store, she makes money. And unfortunately, one time she had someone else help her for ads, and then the ads went tagged after that. So, but literally, she's someone who only has like a budget to spend like $25 then ads. Like, that's it. That's why I'm saying I go slow with her. 00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, but yeah, she's, she's happy. 00:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) My biggest issues, I really don't want her to spend a lot of money on tech stack. So I'm probably going to transfer this. That's what's been taking me the long time. I think I'm just going to transfer this to system I owe for her because it's so much cheaper than anything else. And has email, everything. But I'm just going to tell her, I thought I would do it. screw it. Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list. 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What? What was her domain? 00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let me share a screen again. I don't know what her domain is for selling the 900. I could probably find out if I dig or into it. 00:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been trying to say to be different digital wealth, like academies and- Yeah. It's digital growth academy, but- growth. 00:04:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But this is only the 47 a month, right? This isn't selling the 900 thing. So, um, I don't know where in here, like I'm in the community in the classroom. That's the only thing that's weird. And like, she'll has Texas sport calls. Anyone who buys the $900 gets free access to this, I think membership. So, so everything that's in here, um, and she does this, you know, like 90 day success sprints day one day. Like, it's, it's really good. I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, you and I would create with full value transparency, giving value to people. Um, or we could just become, I was even thinking, just become a damn good affiliate for her because a lot of people are pursuing early, like she's gotten all these wins, like all these people making sales. She's got, look at all the pages of sales. What's that? sorry. I just had a funny message. She was like 18,000 and 32 pages of wins. 00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Rosie, do you think it would be helpful if I join and pay for that? So that we're studying the same thing because here's the thing either we're creating our own path and just using it or That it will be what I do and we do it always should be but I Love modeling after somebody who's doing something similar to what we want to do and making a couple tweaks and I feel like if we're Number one it doesn't work with school to share logins or whatever and for the price. It's nominal Anyway, I'm just kind of study that and be on the same page Because it's low ticket because so you think that she's you know Telling the truth not really the bro marketer club. 00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Just kind of She's definitely a bro marketer and you know who she hires in their dual mindset coaching is the same female mindset coach from LA That was on sunset that Netflix show sunset and I watched a little blurb of the mindset coaching. It's pretty good I think what amazes me to two things to you. What amazes me is Um, her, I'm just going to give this link to you. She's only been in this for two or three years and she was, I think, in network marketing and then she switched to this and one of her friends or colleagues, just like how you and I are connecting, one of her friends colleagues, it was a really good web funnels and tech stuff. So that's why they decided to create this because they figured that's what was missing. So I think she had a big boost from the start of all of her MLM people because this is so good for MLM people, right? To eat up and find another revenue source. 00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know if we want to focus on such beginners. So that's my only thought process. 00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like, so here's her Instagram thing that this is what her real thing is. So she calls it the free daily pay blueprint PDF, zero six, three or six months coming to here. So this is what she gives you. If you were to pay $900, you get this whole system as well. So you enter your email and then sends me the blueprint and then she's got this legacy build program and I think it goes into a webinar. And of course, she's, this is all in school, like, She just started the school community not long ago either, but she's just growing fast. 00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you're probably one of those ones I kill it in network marketing and really, you got to talk to people a lot and you got to work a lot to do that. Oh yeah, I think is. 00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Go ahead, sorry. 00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's one of the things that is a big something I always want to pay attention to when I look at somebody and look out, why are they successful if they're successful because they're working constantly. It doesn't mean that I can't take what does work and then figure out how to make it work well or just set different goals. you know, maybe she's got 70,000, I don't need 70,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, like, you know what I mean? It's a whole different level and also, I mean, how many people does she have to have to support the team? What kind of margins does she have? 00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What kind of headache is all of that management? 00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, they look good. All the different things and it gives It's exciting, you know, when you see these big platforms and these big numbers, but it's it's really easy to not take into account the cost of that and I'm sure you've done this as well. Worked with a lot of these people in the back end and they're just burnt out, they're happy on the outside and on the inside, everything else is falling apart, their health, they don't see their kids, they don't see their sweethearts, they, you know, there's a lot that you don't see and and the other thing is the difference between like extraverts, introverts and amberverts. I'm an ambervert, so, you know, like I can only spend so much time with a lot of people. I light up, I get energized, but then I'm super drained and I have to recover so I can't do that all the time and I'm not seeking out opportunities to be in front of people, but also if I spend too much time alone, I get depressed, introverts are like, let me be alone. Yes, I'm right there. I'm right there in the middle. Now, you have to take that into account with the business model. I would say I would think you lean more towards extrovert, but probably in the like, but so if here's a spectrum, here's introvert, here's ambivert. I mean, here's extrovert. Here's ambivert. would say Tina is probably right around here. Maria's maybe just a little bit over here, slightly more extroverted, but still probably doesn't need to be with all the people all the time. Yeah. Well, am I right or wrong? 00:10:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, no, totally. Totally. know, and I don't want to be a me too product. I'm going to be honest. Like, I think what we've been talking about, thinking about is really powerful and, and, you know, it was solidified even in my mind today when I saw Alan's post today about how in a nutshell, he just said all the people that he's helping. in his fast forward scale to like $100,000 months or whatever, $1,000,000 months, there's no more messaging of here's how to get five to five more clients, here's how to make more money. It's the messaging that really works is just having like that work, like work life balance, right? Which is what we've been talking about, right? And I believe in it, like a simple, anyways, we don't need to go into all details of that, but yeah, so don't buy it yet, you know, because we may not want to go that direction because sometimes what beginners deflates me because it's hard when someone comes back to you and says I only have like $20 a day to spend on ads. 00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And actually, I think that that's not a bad budget for, for trying things down starts even our seven and eight figure clients with a dollar a day or to $5 a day at budgets and does well. But there's so many things that are an uphill battle for beginners. They don't have perspective and I don't I don't have the energy to want to impart low-level perspective, like the getting started perspective. I can give you impart the perspective of, all right, you've got all these great things, and you're doing all these great things, don't get psyched out and play smaller than you can be, but I don't want to be teaching the basics. I want to teach and offer that as a done for you, like just self-paced do it yourself. I want to teach it because I think that the way that I teach it is different than everybody else, and we'll resonate with the small group of people, and I just want to offer it and let God bring the people who need that, and it's its own thing. if I'm going to work one-on-one or in a group or anything else like that, I need it to be high-level, or at least mid-level, so for doing hybrid coaching, needs to be mid-level. We're experienced, we know a lot, We don't know it all, and we need some hand holding, but the group can kind of hand hold also, you know what I mean, that's that mid level. High level is, I just need you to catch me when I'm screwing up. Tell me the things that I don't know, and then I'm going to go off and do my thing, and I'm going come back and report, and then we're going to do this again. 00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's high level. 00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They don't need a lot of hand holding. I love those people. I barely talk to them. They're my favorite, and they adore me, and likewise, so for us, I think getting started really targeting that mid level person, where we can get some exponential kind of like results, some like raving fans of like, holy crap, you know, this was just, I've been here, here, here, here, here forever, and I just went, whoosh, but I did this without getting really stressed or trying to follow somebody else's thing that doesn't fit me. And that's what I want to deliver to people. And then what I want to do. as while we're doing this for people and making the money that we need to and want to, is figure out what did we do consistently with every single person? 00:14:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What was the process? 00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What was the fundamental questions we asked? Which I mostly have out mapped out in my course that I started. But how could we improve that and so give that to people and then maybe we scale it up and we do a few more of these. Maybe we train some, because there's not enough of these people in the world, there's not enough high level coaches that are really good that can actually serve and take care of people. And so maybe we can train junior coaches or something like that who are really good at walking through this process that we've taught and completely outlined. And then maybe once we have a team meeting where we meet with all of our junior coaches and they say, here's the issue, here's where I'm getting stuck, or this is my plan. And what do you guys think, run it by us? Like, we could have a whole kind of school of ourselves. I've literally never thought this thought before ever. Yeah. So this is all just, it evolves, it evolves. It just keeps evolving. Because I'll tell you what happens. If we weren't talking, I would talk myself out of all of it. It was starting to do it. 00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, no, no, that's why that's why I forced myself to launch a member of what it is. I said Tuesday at 6 p.m. So that's like girl in like five hours. 00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And like, I don't really have much to launch. 00:15:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But I'm very good, I don't know you noticed this about me. I'm very good at teasing people and getting them excited. I've got people already saying, I marked my calendar for 6 p.m. But the thing is, here it is, go buy it for $100. This is going to be like, this is the price, take or leave it. But I have been torn between something that Josh Gavin actually said, because I'm in his little community, because he just called me in. And he's interviewed me about the success of how to float ticket offers. Hasn't be able to take it offers and I respect him, but he sometimes in his group. He's so cute He puts out somebody should do this offer and he'll just list out offers that you should do right like he says I'm too busy to do this. Someone should do this because I would buy this right or and so his latest one He says he says whether one or all of you do this go for it I thought that actually is brilliant He says someone should offer a pocket cmo offer Where for like whether it be 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month or whatever a month You are the pocket cmo where they could twice a week or something Send an illume video to you about what their needs are like what they're stuck on and then you within like say a two day turnaround or 24 hour turnaround send a loom video back to them, right? he said for instance for him He would pay that for someone he doesn't want to hire someone like we're an agency for 5,000 months to run his ads or anything But he would love to if he's ever stuck or what to do share a screen and show someone something and then get the tips from someone else Um And I know my friend Cara who runs all the ads for like soon with Claire and she like paid herself I'm like, why did you do this? really good at what you do. I remember she paid $1,000 for one hour or one guy Who who proposed to be a Facebook ad scaling expert? And she said oh it like I knew more than him I'm like, what did you pay for the point is I thought that was interesting with our skill sets as well pocket CMO, you know And when I started I remember do you know who my kill is do you remember internet marketing? Super friends. 00:17:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yeah, so Somebody people would always try to ask me to describe what I did and it was really hard because no role that I had found ever described it and then Matt Gill was a good friend. I don't know if you know him from nitro marketing Not that well, but I know him. He has a name Yeah, so he's like Ops you do operation. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. So then I was like Okay, I'm COO for hire. now they have fractional COO. And I was like, yeah, that's that's definitely there. But that doesn't make enough money. I would not do it for anybody because they don't. It's not positioned and valued right for for the level that I do and brain. But I wish if like if you have that post, I'd love to see it because I'd love to send it to a client of mine who would be that that would be a great offer for him pocket CMO. He does the fractional CMO but I like the pocket CMO. 00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) like that level of access because it's more leveraged. 00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I need to need this. I got to remember I got homework to do now schools in session. Um yeah anyway okay so let's see screen sharing our offer. 00:18:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Which you want me to share it or do you know yeah however yeah yeah. Okay. 00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, was it the Maria Tina partnership one? 00:19:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know what? We have stuff in there, but I just created a new doc and it's not good. I don't even think I've shared it with you. So I'll just put it in the comments here now in the chat. And I will share screen right now. I have the other ones open too. Done. love it. But, you know, obviously starting to work less, have fun and have a life. And then do we just want to say one on one mentorship? 00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Opportunity? Yeah. I love that. 20 plus year business veterans like, you know, how long have you been doing this? before I I did it online, which is 22 years. It was six years in corporate. And it was for a call center, but I was still managing metrics. And it was basically a business within a business, the call centers work. Because I did my own hiring. I did my own staffing. I did meet my metrics. I had to meet my contractual agreements. So in all of that actually prepared me for what I do. So I would say I'm closer to 28 years with business experience. 00:20:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I quit the big six consulting firms in 1999, 2000. So I guess 24 years. 00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we're close. I would say nearly 50-year combines or we'll say 25 plus whatever. However you want to do that, it's close. Because if you want to be real about it, I also and you did too a paper route for a couple years and all the other things. So if you out of my business years, I've got 30 years under my belt for sure. 00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wow, that makes me old. 00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Ha. ha ha And this is a mouse. Oops. 00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But it's that that let's break down full stock. 00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay, for this. I just wanted to put this in before. Forget. Yeah, yeah. Because the feedback I'm getting from people that I did do some one in one calls with, by the way, I do have one in 15 minutes, so, but I get back on with you after that. 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, just, just, okay, this was only scheduled off till one 30 my time. So that's why someone snuck in and booked. 00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's yeah. Yeah, but I'll be available in an hour after that two, three, my time. 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm but anyway, you are not looking for money this meeting an hour long because that Tuesday. 00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) We have gone the whole weekend. 00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, they have it. 00:22:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Action. I don't know. So yeah, we can go back to the full staff. Yeah. So this is what resonated with people when we were talking just back and forth about so many things to build on the business that you feel called to serve this component, but it'll give you emotional support, support, support, support. really, I think, resonated with people in the PS of the email that I sent a couple days ago, and then you saw some of my Facebook posts that are resonating with people. Maybe it's just cutting out what's in my Facebook post that I wrote on the weekend or Friday. 00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The one I tagged you with. I don't know if you saw that one. I didn't even so. 00:23:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I quoted you in it too. 00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was off. I was like, I'm not online at all. 00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, so this one, timeless principles for building a business and it's kind of summary of what we do and it says, what are my good friends to? Marie says, I take you on it. And it said, the offer match to the audience Trump's brand power all day, branding, just sports, organic traffic, so it was your words there because I wanted to slowly bring in you. But, yeah, so it's a long post, but I was talking about, you know, there's so much crap out there. And maybe I just can't pace this because people love this post. Yeah, you know. 00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let me, oh, go away. I've missed a lot, like apparently the swarms are terrible, and just... 00:24:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you want stop share? 00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, no, I just want to... I have my settings so that things that I'm tagged in don't... have to be approved to get on my wall, and like I'll still show up, but I wanted to do that. Go check this for you. Yeah, and then I can go... Wait, wait, that's not it. Oh yeah, no, sorry. 00:24:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, no words, no. 00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. Yeah, I see... I'll read it from here real quick so I can see all your... What do you call it? Words? please, but can I just get to my own profile? There, okay. Absolutely brilliant post. Nice job. thing you say, video or write means everything to me. Oh, good. So that's like, I may have heard a version of some of it when I when I hear it from me, it downloads directly from my brain, can't get enough. You have got to keep that as a testimonial and use that, Maria, because that's the thing. That's the type of comments and things that people say to me. This is what makes us most unique. 00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What do you talk about? 00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) is a comment on here from Colleen held Ladwaib and she says, everything you say, video or write means everything to me. I totally get it, absorb it. And it's like, I may have heard a version of some of it. But when I hear it from you, it downloads directly to my brain, can't get enough. That is a skill that I have as well too. I that is so unique. I don't I don't know that that I've ever read read anybody say that about somebody else. I'm sure that it's there. I think like Alan and like there are certain types of people, we have, we connect with other ones. So you and I both do a little storytelling and correlating of a technical and tactical concept and put it into life in a way that people can just like go wait a minute, I get that now. You've got a, you are the class from the pulpit side. What we the teacher saw was someone without their ego, I'm gonna cry, getting in their way. You were there to learn all the questions they came at the right time. You followed instructions were first to finish the exercise, give me time to dig deeper. Those are really pioneering days of internet marketing. 00:26:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh yeah, that's my software friend. That's interesting too, but just he'll always couch it with edifying him. He'll never fully me. Oh yeah. 00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm, that reminds me of Seth Laraby. Like he, You did a lot to lift people up, but you'd always be like, my student, my this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, even teach what you're talking about. Like, he did that with me a couple of times. I'm like, you understand that this was not because of you. 00:27:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So yeah, yeah. 00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, but yeah, okay, you know, I've been walking just you do such a good job of, I mean, even the emojis, the number emojis, I've never think of the number emojis. 00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Because sometimes it takes like two, three hours to write one post. So that's why I've been warming everyone up for the last 14 days too, to video post. 00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love it. So, okay, what? Man, you've got to go soon. 00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That sucks. 00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) is the best way to use this time to support where your brain has already been going because my brain can go off of on a whole different ten right now. 00:28:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think probably the stack. It's even happened in webinars. I'm so good at the whole webinars. I'm right when it comes to the pitch section of showing the stack or what they get. I fall short a little bit on bringing the power to that. So people convert because they know me. But maybe at the end of this document, I'm just going to say here's what's something like that. What's waiting for you or here's what you're going to get or something. 00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:28:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Can I type in then you tweak because it works better for me? Yeah, that's how I thinking. 00:28:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Okay. whether you want to do it as a table or they just like, well, let me format it. Let me just bring dump. 00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, for that work. Okay. a so first. 00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I love it. 00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You You Whoa, sorry, sorry didn't do that. thought I could add it. 00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, it shouldn't have done that. No, yeah, I was trying to add my own stuff at bottom, just to give you a If this helps from the post, if you talk, I'll lose what I'm saying. 00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, you have a call. 00:37:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I got a dash. If you scroll down, I also put Josh's post in there in case there's any burby ash from there that you want to add about the pocket, CMO and CFO. 00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nope. I don't want other people's rides. I just like, it was going to be fractional, but pocket was cool because boxers in the pocket. 00:37:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) no, I love it. 00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:37:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) All right. Talk a couple hours or yes, I have calls into like two o'clock and then I'll need a little break and then I have to get my daughter. 00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm not sure, but let's at least box because traction got it. Okay. Cheers. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, how are you? 00:00:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay. felt that. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many flights did you take last week? 14. A little grandma. I was so cute. Oh, it's done. 00:00:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) But I'm off to Seattle tomorrow. 00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Or what? 00:00:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Dr. 00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's turn this up because you won't talk, it's all the way up, Mark. 00:01:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, yeah, I'm E-work, we know. 00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, you're on video, hi, I was looking in on my browsers, um, oh I need to message China too, so like, ugh, just a lot to going on, not bad, it wasn't bad until my baby was crying. 00:01:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) It happens. 00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want to go beat a boy up, but it also happens, I got friends in all places, so. 00:01:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Did you know that you can order buzz from Amazon, you get delivered in 24 hours? 00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. 00:01:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You can send an elephant who, you. 00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What? What did you say? Oh yeah, I'm meeting with the friends right after this. Oh, did Patrick cancel on me to meet with you, rude? 00:02:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) We're taking the lunch for his birthday today because I wasn't going to make it for yesterday. 00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. We're going to fly. 00:02:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. So when I talk to the Rams, one thing. Talk about efficiency. Colby will talk to him about it, and he doesn't do one thing that every other attorney does that's just more efficient because I know he's trying to delegate things to some level. When we settle the case as an attorney, we know very heavily what. Medical bills are. That's how we kind of what the case is worth. Right. We send. Once we settle case, we directly send to the lien department, what the reduction requests are. He doesn't do that. He has his team do that. I don't know why. He has this little thing down by a dare to, and he already should know what to reduce down by. 00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think he does know or do you think he delegates because he does know? 00:02:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I don't know. Mary brought it up to me today. And I was like, I'm not sure if he knows this or not. But I just triggered, if you're meeting with him today, that he'd be a way that he'd be more efficient and take a little bit off of his team. 00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How long has Lorenz been working for you? 00:03:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I don't know, too long. 00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, for you to not know if that's an issue, like just to be discovering that issue? 00:03:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I've talked to him about it like four or five times. 00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But not to the extent that you actually know and have asked the question, can you do it? Let me see you do it. How would you do it? And take it to it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So now this goes back to, though, having the specific type of model that you want. Every business can be way more optimized. And you can be militant about things. And it gets a particular type of result, including the negative ones. right? You have a specific priority of you don't want to be there when you don't want to be there and that is okay that works but as you can see things fall through the gaps if nobody's watching there's a certain level of oversight that needs to happen for at least for maximum efficiency as well as a certain level of efficiency so the things that we need to look at and of course also we cannot forget how difficult it is even to get a person into sweet law to get an attorney in here right so that is a bigger issue than the ineptitude because you just can't even take that business if you don't have somebody to fulfill it if you don't have a business yeah um so that being said it would be who was to have an evaluation process that really works well and this is and I think that we're getting on this line and me talking to them and then talking to you and being able to look into it more but this is also a slow process especially because now it would be faster if it was in person it would be faster if we had more meetings more often that's not really compatible with your schedule either so that has to be taken to account that it is a pace issue the improvement isn't going to happen really quickly unless the oversight and the engagement and interaction happens really quickly makes sense okay so um so I took that one I let the highlighter what do you call it Adam take note but let me write this down for myself Oh, okay, let's see. More. So the Rens. Explain it to me. One more time. What is he not doing? Yeah, just one more time. 00:06:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So after selling the case. Generally, the attorneys will send the lean reduction selling department. 00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What, what they will do what. I didn't hear. We'll email. We'll email. To the department. The lean department. Okay. 00:06:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And said it seems like he's having his team do that. 00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who does it really well? Tyler. really? 00:07:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I mean, most of them do because it's not this is not complicated and it's what we turn all them when they start like it just it makes total common sense and he was doing that at some point I just don't know when he stopped or why he stopped and you were saying that it's happening like a couple days after instead of immediately that I don't know Mary was saying that she thinks there maybe delay because that but regardless it's putting more pressure on her on his team because now John or Jessica whoever else has to now go look at the file and then they have to think what they want to offer Or he's already deep in the file because he's negotiating on it. Unless he's not actually negotiating on it, which case that's a whole other discussion. 00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, as in doing distributions. 00:08:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) As in if he's not negotiating on the case is meaning. He's sending or someone else is writing this demand still. And if he's not negotiating on it, then I don't know what he's doing all the day. I don't think that's the case. 00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, when you say negotiating so that I understand where that. Okay, with the insurance company, because. Um, distribution is also kind of a negotiation process to it. 00:08:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Sure. 00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, well, you say sure that doesn't sound like a. 00:08:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That's not clear. 00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) can be. Okay. They have made it sound like that's what it is. So. I don't know because. Do that. Um. When you talk about training people, and I know that they come in and they watch other attorneys for a little while, Lorenzo, he did go out there, did he need a little bit? 00:09:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) He did. we've gone there and we've had a lot of meetings and everything else as well. 00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what else do you know of that is not being done right like in specifics? 00:09:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That's the warning I know of in specifics. 00:09:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm going to look at what if I. Come on. Better not change the password. right, good. How's Chona doing this week? 00:10:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I am, as they haven't seen a lot of her. She's still a bit overwhelmed with everything going on and, you know, the doctor has put a lot on her, so I'm still trying to, like, she's still asking for lot of help with the reports, which she should be, because they're not near where it needs to be, but it's just, I mean, personally, it's difficult, like, I literally just walked through the door and it's like, I need this right now. I haven't eaten in 24 hours and I would like, minutes to go to the bathroom and eat some food. 00:10:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, let me do this right now. Mark, what did you get me into? 00:11:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Man, it's fine, it is what it is. And then she was working on one last night and sent it to me, but it was clear that she didn't spend the time reading through before sending it to me because there was contradictions within it. And so for me, personally, I don't mind showing her how to make things better or here's the differences. when there's a direct contradiction in what she's writing, it just shows lack of detail and focus and it kind of always be. 00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So one thing that she told me is that writing is not something like culturally they even do in the Philippines and she's procrastinated writing and I had asked her, I say, can you just give it six months of your best effort? And she said that she would commit to getting all of her charting done the same day. 00:11:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) She's getting better at it. She's getting better at it and from tenses, she's going to always kind of have something to a problem with as like ESL. It's like half verse has like she'll make it in that, you know, I'm not gonna beat her up over But when you say like they don't have pain it's non-ridicular pain and you say they have radicular pain That's how we're doing it in the same paragraph like That's not grammar. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's you not paying attention because you're writing this at midnight because you spent hours on Facebook Okay, so the next time we have a conversation together Yeah That needs to come up so that you can help her with full like either She's in or she's out. You can't be halfway in and so just full open like you'll tell on yourself. 00:12:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I Don't know if Jonah will The other part of it too is you know what I'm hoping is as we get these better. She starts making these into templates Okay Okay, fast from the future and then I'll talk to her about yet because she's still just going through the process and a lot of it's just cleaning up She's looking at these reports that Dr. E wrote and they're very clearly dictated like there's words in there that don't make sense for what it is, like underscores. It's like that's not but no like it doesn't fit and so it's just cleaning up some of that stuff and you know as long as she's taking more from scratch I think it'll be better moving forward but the goal is hey how can we make some of these into templates where you're just changing around the he's and the she's and like that's what was hoping for too but I don't have nearly enough understanding of what she's doing to even get to that conversation yet. 00:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) think that so let me look at the calendar real quick because I know we're not meeting with you this week but can we next week. 00:13:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) The next server both in Louisville on Thursday Friday. 00:13:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh. 00:13:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Is the one you guys meeting? You meeting with someone called right? 00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah wait what's today? Hold on now we're meeting Thursday. and a third. 00:14:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) My people didn't make the third word. 00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really this, but with your traveling schedule stuff? 00:14:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Maybe. Still shooting from out of top room. 00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I think if you can, even just for a little bit, and just be like, OK, here's what I have to contribute. And then we can work with that. I think that'll be great. I'm going to check in with her today anyway. I don't see that my calendar, so they go by to find it. It says that you have said yes to it. 00:14:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) She didn't, but you did. Cool. Oh, yeah, there it is. 00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 6 p.m. OK. So anyway, wait, where was I? Oh, lot of fire was in a lot of fire. OK, so. Last 90 days, what do you feel like is the best kind of snapshot to look at relative performance stats? 00:15:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I think 90 days gives you a pretty good indication when it's a quarter, 180 days, maybe it's a little better, think 90 day kind of segments gives you a pretty good idea, 30 days, there's unfortunately a little bit too much potential sway. 00:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, because we have, we can ask Josh for 180 days, I think that's a Yeah. 00:15:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was like monkeys, just all over the and choose the leads. So that's why I think putting quarter to quarter makes the most sense because there's going to be some ups and downs. Obviously, part of bonus plan is to try to even out those. Waves, if you will. 00:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So, like, what if I... One thing I have been looking at... Also, turning keys, not to stuff. Because in my mind, Tyler is a slacker in Kennesox and then I look at him compared to like Lauren, who is slow and my Tyler's beaten him in a lot of things. it's not everything right so but that's why i'm saying what is the best way to look at it so i'm looking at 90 days the other issues are you looking at settlements or money or i'm going to i'm going to screen so i have like one very large case which moves off so yeah so gross so this is 90 days yeah oh one of the other things i wanted to have is oh i guess we do have record counting here and then oh dropped out and subbed out and other what is other i don't know 00:18:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay, I have no clue that could actually mean unless I just comparing it to the rest of their cases, but that wouldn't make sense to include that. 00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I will ask that also. So this is what I've been trying to get shrunk, but it obviously takes a If I go last quarter. That should be. 00:19:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Well, of course, if I can do the same data. 00:19:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, because we're right at the end of it. And I can't do. I can do this here. So it was 345 days. So that has been consistent, although I think hers is less now also. How does resolution speed? So close and resolve is closed, settled. 00:19:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) No, closed is pale. 00:19:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I meant. Sorry. So this right here. So resolved is settled. So and close this paid. 00:20:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) But you would. I think, settle, settle should be shorter than paid. 00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is. 00:20:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Now, then we'll be like, Tyler, it's 309 for 94. 00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, and Samantha's the other way around too. Okay, so something's wrong here. 00:20:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Something's off on it. 00:20:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, let me get this to you. Okay, so I'm going to go actually even correct. Yeah, like so Tyler and Lorenz for this year, and like Tyler's a slacker and he's barely just showing up for a paycheck and Lorenz is given it his best and you've got the same level of performance but not really because Tyler gets paid sooner according to this. And then let's see that's gross but let's see average. Fee by team Lorenz is higher for the year but not a lot and Samantha is like 33% higher than Lorenz and more than Tyler going. The record count 99, so 2, 42, one ninety nine percent. I mean, he's got more 218 or something, yeah. Volume-wise, some app is clearly doing more, but so, but looking at this, I don't see anything where, and I want to know how you're evaluating things, could it be better, should it be better, should we be doing things, make it better? Yes. I don't see where there's a, you should definitely fire Lauren's kind of thing. 00:22:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You know, it's not, you know, it's not here. He has the largest team, like the most important structure. Yeah. He also uses the most amount of resources. 00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, how would I look at that? It's not going to be unmodified, but how could I look at that? I would love to see what the cost of each pod is. 00:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Or I'm once I've had anyone that we're putting that together because I'm trying to now get the pods to be about 18% of what they bring in. 00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:23:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So we are quickly working on that. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So then, is your strategy like, okay, Lorenz, these are the amount of people you get sink or swim. No. 00:23:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Well, we have to begin with first, we have to know what we're dealing with, Set more. Set the expectation. If you want to continue to have x, y, z, then you need to be at y. 00:23:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:23:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You can't be at y, then we need to start taking y, x and z. 00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And if we take it and then. So we'll spell all of that out, right? 00:23:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, because we have to. I mean, it's going to make sense. 00:23:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what is. 00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) the timeline that you're looking at for having finishing putting it together. hoping the lead month will have what they each cost the team was. And then from there, just putting it into how much they do for months. 00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So theoretically, if Lorenz's pod can't handle it, and you're like, I want you gone, but you don't have anybody to replace them, do you take the existing caseload and put it on the rest of your team and just say, and we keep the leads going at the pace or risk pulling back, you have to play that out in your mind. 00:24:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) What do those scenarios look like? I mean, number one is always setting an expectation. 00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) For sure. 00:24:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) If they continue to not be able to meet the expectation, then we have to figure out why. If they come down to its personnel issue. And so we have, we have hang, we have a Yuri, we have additional people who can put substitute, and because the interns are paid on a percentage is what it is. 00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:25:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And it's just how can we make this more efficient and without being able to tie numbers together. 00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:25:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. Yeah. We're just shooting the dog. 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What's good. 00:25:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Because I can see specific cases that I know could move faster with someone who is here every single day working 60 hours. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Why would you want somebody working 60 hours a week? You have quoted scrum. You know what that does. 00:25:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You're an attorney. If you want to make $400,000 a year, yeah, you need to put in some quick in time. 00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So. But the premise of that is that quality suffers after. a roughly 20 hours a week that productivity goes down, the output goes down, and that the quality of the output goes down. Now, I don't believe that that's true for all people, all things, all markets everywhere. don't. I never do. I believe that there are outliers. I also believe that, you know, there's relativity, everything's relevant. That being said, there's a lot of science behind it. Google has built their entire business model around it. There are seasons where people can hustle and grind, and going back to the culture that you want to have, that's a whole big conversation to talk about. you want people working 60 hours a week? Is that, is that something you want to be seeing? And, and you could say, yes, because This is the incentive plan, right? This is who it's geared for. I'm paying this amount of money. I want butts and seats for this amount of time, roughly. And if that doesn't work, then or do you bring new people in under a different incentive program and be like, which is really the biggest issue that that was formulated incorrectly and wisely, got something done, so not necessarily unwisely at the time, but really not working very well right now. 00:27:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) They worked with a smaller scale that just don't work on bigger scale. Like, Grins' percentages are okay. Just one person's is all black. 00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Just Samantha? Yeah. So, do you have a model, or do you have variations of the model that you can put pods into? Let's say, look, if you want to work here, this is the model that you get to have. So you've got four kids, you don't want to be working 60 hours a week. This is what I'm willing to pay you under these particular circumstances, and this is what you have to put out in order to make this arrangement work, and to take it or leave it. And so instead of saying this is how everything happens at Sweet Law, it can be like every pod is basically a business and a country unto itself, barring there are certain rules and principles. So let's say maybe there are states instead of countries into itself, right? We've got the federal rules, but then we've got state-level government. And rather than thinking on a typical company thing, which is everybody gets the same rules, you can break away and split up and say, no, every pod's going to be like its own state, which they kind of are anyway, but with a unique incentive program. So if you've got people who are not your high performers, and they're all kind of, know, because that will Patrick has Cynthia, you know, like there's different people that perform at different levels at different like case managers and assistants and whatnot. So if you put them in a place where the incentive program works for them, they're making you a prophet. It's not the exciting thing you wanted to have, but they are part of the moat system, part of the financial leverage that keeps sweet law afloat. They are the steady robots, they come in, they're never going to be exceptional, but they're also never going to really disappear because they need the job. You know what I mean? Whereas you've got the hustlers and grinders, and the problem with that, like you've experienced with the Samantha's, something goes wrong in their lives and they're like screwed up for a little while, like a couple months, and you feel it in the business, but that's don't want them to maximize the value of the case. 00:29:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) They don't have an incentive to try to maximize the value. Would you take 14,000, 715,000 it doesn't really impact you. 00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but so it does, because if you consistently fail to meet these metrics, you no longer have a job. Like there's all kinds of different ways to put the incentive program. The incentive is you get to keep working here. That's a big deal, especially when the culture is not one of constant stress and threat compared to what the rest of the industry is. Like markets that you want these seem to be like this. And then I asked them to think about stuff and feel like, well, well, actually, he's also really helpful. Like he'll answer any question 10 o'clock at night. If I have a question, he'll help me out. Like he's always really helpful. He just really wants us to do well. I'm like, okay, that make him angry or bad or whatever? They're like, no. And then Lorenz had the epiphany where he's like, well, if I saw this stuff was going wrong, I get pretty upset with it too. So, and he goes like, I'm not. bad guy. So it's just interesting how people have to process things and see it. But anyway, I'm definitely intense. I'm telling you, like people are terrified of me. I've had total strangers be like, don't mess with her. She'll kick your . I'm like, I don't know where you get that from. But there's energy and people perceive it. And even if you've never made threatening language, whatever, when you are potent inside of yourself, it is perceptible to people who are not. And they are intimidated, whether you're intimidating or not. So and also, when you don't mince words and you just say, these are the expectations like, what's going on? And you ask like accountability questions, and you don't have the gall to dance around it and sugar code it, they're like, what the? This is scary. So, you know, that's all that is. But the other thing is, We're doing it directly whereas somebody else might see that kind of stuff and they're like they've already been thinking I'm gonna fire this dude, and I'm just now coming at him kind of thing, so It's it's trying to understand all of that. I think that there are that we Should always be looking at this non stereotypically Starting with the fact that you want a business that makes a lot of money and You want to do the things that you want to do and don't want to do the things that you don't want to do and you're honest enough to say that right most people will want that and Then never actually try to create that for themselves or try to create it for themselves and then call it something else So that nobody judges them for that or they feel like they belong or whatever so That in and of itself is unique and it's it's great actually because Because they're you're doing it's not cognitive business. You're not just say one thing do another blah, blah, I think that thinking about the pods as having access to maybe different incentive programs and that maybe there is an eligibility clause, right? become eligible for this type of incentive program upon this criteria. You lose eligibility to this incentive program upon this criteria. So it's not a once you get here, you get to keep it type of thing. Now, you can't, you can, but it's not wise to pull back and reduce what a person can earn, right? So you can't lose eligibility by being too good, but what you can do is unlock a whole new level of expectation where much is given, much is required. So, yes, you're getting all this extra bonus pay, but here's what else I expected you now, because you've gotten this. Which, They might take as a penalty. Yeah, I can't, I can't win. I've done this good and now this is what's happening. You could say, no, it's not. But as long as I'm paying this level of an incentive, I am going to ask you for more because you're getting so much more. And you can't like, you pay the marketing fees, you meet with the vendors, you do all of this. Like they can't just go out and bring themselves more money. Cases don't magically just show up. There's a lot of investment you make to bring that here to them to even fulfill. They could go open their own business. Do you think they're just going to like half cases, land in the lab? That's not how that works. You think you can just go to another law firm and get this kind of incentive program? That's not going to work. Maybe, I don't actually know. So anyway, maybe it's time that we think about instead of, yes, we have this plan, period. How do we make it work? Maybe it's we have this plan for this pod under this criteria and Maybe we tweak the level of expectations Is there anything that we could ask above and beyond other specific financial thresholds? Let's say if you make $12,000 a month You also get to do this or this like Maybe you're double checking other people's cases or I don't know and that doesn't even sound fair. I'm literally just spitballing things But I'm doing it so that you can trigger a thought of well Is there a threshold if I pay you X amount of money? I want you to show up some extra and do something else. I don't know if that makes sense or that just saptons But I'm trying to get us to think outside the box I'm supposed to meet with Lorenz in an hour There's lots we didn't get into but just Honestly, I think that's the biggest thing. You creating structure, understanding the numbers, every time, and it's usually every few months, you go and dive deep and you get some specific numbers that we didn't have before. Every time you do that, something shifts significantly. And I know you always want bigger, faster, better immediately. But the trajectory speaks for itself. You can look at it. Maybe not with profit margins and net profits, which is not something we look at enough and I would definitely like to look at that. But with gross margins, you know, it's definitely impacting. So some things working, and every time you do this, it gets better. So keep doing that. Okay, better go. Let's see. It sucks, though, because I'm not, I can't wrap up. Oh, tell Patrick, I'll be working for me, do something really embarrassing, then you can tell me about it later to embarrass them for a birthday. uh, you're awesome. Thank you. Sounds good. Bye. mark@sweetlaw.com,dan@danddcompany.comTina MarieBasis Integration/Sweet Law
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello. Hello. How are you? 00:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Good. How are you? 00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. Good. I'm busy. got the poem of Mark. Because we had to move our Monday meeting. Why? Because he was traveling. 00:00:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) That's right. 00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's Tuesday, right? 00:00:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yep. Yeah, he's been traveling. 00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Me too. I was in Arizona this weekend and got home like one o'clock in the morning Sunday. Why? 00:00:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Mark was in Arizona on the speaking. 00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. He's been all over the place. All over the place. Okay. I thought Patrick was supposed to be here too. He is, but apparently it's his birthday and Mark is taking him out for lunch. And also talking to him about stuff. So I just got a last minute thing. Hold on. Most of the cases I need to get and a little fire report requests and not before I forget. Okay, um, so last week we were working on am I the right? I am on the break down. Equals of the cases, and I'm just trying to find, uh-huh, here it is. Oh, good. Wait, yours is updated. I'm like, wait, it looks just like it was last week. Um, so sheet two, that's the rest, but I don't see you have a assignment of who does what. 00:02:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah, I apologize about that as the last week of the month, I had one person gone out of the office. I'll get done. I'll be done by getting today. 00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, um, that was most of where our time was going to go. So that kind of cuts us off a little bit in terms of like what we can do. Mentally, I prepare, and I prepare for that particular type of conversation. but, um, I did get something from Mark to ask about. And that is that. Let's see. After settling a case, the attorney will email, send an email to the lean department. And he's not sure. Mary brought this up. 00:03:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) If you're doing it, or if your team does that, we do it together. We would do the, we would do the, the reduction together. 00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And what is your pace for that happening? 00:03:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I've been trying to do it. Right now we're doing like, we're, we're getting on, we're, we're, we're at the point where we're getting it the same day. 00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, since when? Since last week. Okay. And is there a reason you're doing it with the team instead of just yourself? But I have no opinion about this. 00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) don't know anything about How did I'm learning? Yeah, well, usually they have a team has a good idea. They've been in contact with the providers. And so they have a good idea of whether we can get a bigger reduction from those providers or if this is something that has been discussed before. 00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) A good idea about what about the reductions, is that okay? 00:04:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) So they've been in contact with the providers during the treatment. And so they have a better idea, have a better appeal, whether the provider is going to be willing to reduce service is going to be in our negotiation. 00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, and let's say they think it is going to be a hard negotiation, then what? 00:05:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Then I decide what we are going to reduce it to. And so sometimes we don't reduce it. We're paying full to save some time for the client. And sometimes if it's the beginning of the month, I'll get on the phone with the provider and try to negotiate that. 00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, do you not think, and I don't know, again, I'm asking this, but if that is a lever that has an impact on the revenue for street law, that everything should, that you should attempt negotiation for each case with the provider, even if you think they're going to be hard, or even if you think they're not. 00:05:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) We do. That's why we do. We submit all the reduction requests for all the reduction requests to Oscar, who submits them to the providers. 00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so the difference is sometimes you call them, like I think I missed something. 00:06:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Right, yeah, so like if we get some pushback on some of the providers, then we'll call them. If they're, you know, if they're arguing over $200 or something like that, then we have to make call to either settle it so we can get the revenue in. Or, you know, it depends, it really depends on what the client expects and what we want to get out of the case. If it's like a small case, if it's like a case for like $6,000, then usually we have to fight a little bit harder so that the client can go home with some money. Right. 00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But if it's a policy limit case, then at that point we have a little bit more leeway because we know the fine It's gonna go home so money Okay, got it now You said that this sped up starting last week. What was the Capitalist for Making that change We're just looking at ways to accelerate All right, so let's just we've got this time let's work on this together a little bit So So do you have you have this dark? I'm going to screen share, but I don't need to be able to get into it if you need to. post it in the chat. Get it open. 00:08:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I apologize about that. It's been a stressful week. 00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Everything okay? 00:08:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) My wife got rear-ended three weeks ago and she's been bedridden, so I'm kind of pulling double-duty for her. 00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That is hard. How old are your kids again? 00:08:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) 14 is the oldest, 4 is the youngest. 00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I mean, even when you've got four teenagers, it's hard. People think that older kids are not as much work. They're a completely different kind of work. They're emotional work, but that's a lot. So I feel for you. And that's okay, we can still use this call. We'll just do this together. All right, so do you have this sheet open? 00:09:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Sorry, I thought you said you were gonna screen share it. 00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I said I'm not going to. I haven't send you the link in the chat so that if you wanna type something in, you can type it in and does that make sense? 00:09:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I see, yeah. Sure. Okay, I have it. 00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Speaking of daughters, I was half an hour late to my meeting with Mark because mine came home from lunch and she was crying. and boys are dumb like boys boys you know yeah yeah she'll be okay she just be treated better and I needed to be there for her so but Mark is always very kind he's like take your time no worries and he still hung around special kind of person that dude right there yeah um okay so all right so let's see what kind of first of all do you agree with the order that these things are in given that some of them can probably happen at the same time do you have any improvement of what's in the column or changes or modifications I guess is what I'm asking yeah second I think I need some fresh air, I've been, I've been inside too long today. 00:11:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I think that's that number six, it can be broken down to maybe, two more steps, there's initial chiro and then make sure that it follows up, we need to follow up with the chiro and make sure the client gets an MRI and then once we get the MRI, we need to talk to chiro about whether to refer for pain management or not. 00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, what goes about this one? 00:12:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Refer for MRI. 00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. It. What else? 00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Well, it's I guess it's probably damages number one. 00:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, it's not even a complete sentence. let's elaborate. How would you write that? I mean, nothing can happen before the introduction call, can it, or do the property damage is taken care during the introduction of all? 00:13:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) So they explain to the client that, you know, we can help out a little bit, but that's, you know, we kind of walk them through the property damage process. But ideally, we help them do it themselves, because we don't get any money, we don't get any fees out of that. 00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I'm going to go into Patrick's side and just, actually, let me see, I just want to make a note about this. Ugh, that was not my bottle at the desk, insert. There go. That's You can make this a complete sentence. That is done here. Right. Okay. 00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I'm not sure why I set up for treatment is after distributions. That should be number six. 00:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. right. So we'll just compare next week. Oh, I didn't know where to move down that way. Okay. What else for that? All right, now, let's break it down by who does what on the team. 00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Sure. So introduction call, you don't need to put it right here. 00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yep. 00:16:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) So intro call, I like the CM to do it. But right now I'm training theory on doing intro calls. 00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So how I would like you to fill this out is something like this. Like you can do parentheses, prefer CM to do it currently. This is who does it. This is who I'm training, et cetera, like really let's be detailed in here. I changed my audio setup, by the way. Is everything clear? How's it for you on your end? It's working good. OK. don't know if you deal with allergies, but I do. And every now and I realize I didn't take my medicine today. I'm just really happy that awareness. 00:17:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) And once in a while, did implement as your goal. 00:17:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Daily life for me. then if I don't take care of it, I can't breathe. It's awesome. That body's a lot of work. I'm ready for the resurrection now. Change me over. 00:17:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) How's that work? Is that good? 00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Well, OK, so who's your case manager? Who's doing it now? 00:17:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Right now, I'm having very for the next week or something very do all of But then we're going to go back to the CMs doing it. 00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, fine. Here you go. Back to. Thank So you have Jonathan, Jessica, Mike, right? All right, so Jonathan and Jessica both do this, but you're turning the viewer to do it. 00:18:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. And Mike can do it as needs be, but he's on his main role. 00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So who does this the most? Uh, the, the two CM, Jessica and John. Okay. And why are we training theory to do it? 00:18:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Is it because of all your absences and just so have another person or? Yeah. And John is going to be out of the office when his baby is born. And very, you know, she, goal is to eventually become a CM. So I kind of want to show some, some new, uh, some new things that are once in a while. 00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Great. I'm just going to go ahead and put that all in there because that's helpful. Um, all right. Any other notes to make there? 00:19:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Um, well, that's good. 00:19:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And all right. Walk through the property damage process. Who does that? Is that part of the introduction call? 00:19:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. Yeah. And then if we do need to deal with BDR selves, it would be either Mike or Barry. 00:19:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, I'm going to do this. And explains me what you mean if you have to do property damage. 00:19:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) So the client says I really don't feel comfortable dealing with a property damage aspect of it. Can you just do it? Then rather than like get sucked down because they, um, they want. someone to take care of the probability damage, then we'll just do it as kind of like a courtesy. And then at that point, Mike or VRE will be in contact with the adjuster, the case the insurance adjuster and start dealing with the property damage themselves. 00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And do you know if one or the other is better or same or? 00:20:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) And Mike has more experience, but it's pretty straightforward. 00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's not. 00:20:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Okay. It's not very nuanced. 00:20:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Confirming coverages and liability. 00:20:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) That would be Mike and Barry's perspective. 00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And is this you calling the insurance company to confirm that what their person told you is true? 00:21:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Well, so we don't want to, ideally, we want to confirm early on the case that the defendant is accepting liability, that way, know, we know we can receive a treat on a lean or something like that, and that helps us maximize treatment for the client. 00:21:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. That helps me to understand a little bit. And, okay, or is there any other notes on that line? No. Order initial documents such as police reports, hospital records, health insurance liens. 00:21:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Mike, I'm very. 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Which makes sense because they're your systems, right? 00:22:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. 00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Does Mike have any aspirations towards case manager? 00:22:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) He is a case manager. 00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. is. Okay. Also, case manager, I literally have it in my notes that Lorenz, my brain, I still remember everything. And they don't read all my stuff. Okay. 00:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Oh. Jessica, the team lead because she's, she just has a little more experience than that. right. At this point, trust them equally. 00:22:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Trust who equally Jonathan and Jessica. 00:22:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Jessica and Mike. Oh. Well, they can both do each other's job. Well, Mike doesn't. maybe doesn't have as much of a soft touch with clients, which is why I put him in less client-related tasks. 00:23:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, but he has a particular scale with distributions because of that, right? 00:23:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yes, he's very hard-nosed. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's from New York, so... Hey, you're talking about me. That's right. I can't leave it, okay? 00:23:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. 00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, wait, what you want to do about it? can't do anything about it. 00:23:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) This is what the boss did. 00:23:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sending dependent insurance inquiry requests or DMV insurance search requests. Mike and Viri? 00:23:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. 00:23:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Order policy limits. 00:24:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) That is usually like, I would put that in parentheses because we don't always do it. And that's, that would be my convenience if we do do it, but Jessica does it too sometimes. 00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, and set up for treatment. 00:24:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) John, Jessica. 00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Continuing client medical referrals and make sure they go to their appointments. 00:24:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) John and Jessica. 00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll to MRI. 00:24:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) John and Jessica. 00:24:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Talk to Cairo. 00:24:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Usually that's me or John and Jessica. 00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, that is not how it's going to make. I'm preparing the managers. 00:26:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I use, I use Hank to do an initial draft, and then I usually. Go through it. Make some edits and corrections and then the more complicated ones I draft myself. 00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Negotiating and finalizing sentiments. 00:26:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I mean. 00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's weird that it changed the font. We will default. Okay. See, again, that's weird. Dr. 00:27:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Redactions. Me and Mike or me and John. Distributions. Me and Mike or me and John. 00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Property damage. So there's nothing at the end of it that. You would call this like maybe that Patrick was thinking of. 00:27:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) No. One that we forgot is met pay, met pay demands. 00:28:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Where does that come in? 00:28:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Probably underneath ordering final medical records. 00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's where I was going to put it. right. Med pay. 00:28:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah, that they demand. 00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And who does that? 00:28:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) The CM. it would be Jess or John. 00:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. All right. Now. One of the things I didn't get to with Patrick. But that I want to do with both of you is estimating that. I know that. This can take a certain level of time depending on the difficulty of the conversation and the difficulty of the person that you're dealing with in order to have this at the insurance company, at the doctor's office, et cetera. But let's try to put a rough amount of time that some of these things should take in terms of the actionable task that could be had, like an introduction call should have an average amount of time. Most of these phone calls, sending emails, whatever, should have an average amount of time that the tasks take. So, pop that a little bit and let's put some stuff down here. 00:29:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Okay. So, introduction call, I would say 30 minutes. That's, I mean, the property damage, it depends, that's several phone calls. do you want like, like in days, how long it takes to complete on average in days or? 00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so let's just get all the details, could take days, how long would each type of call take, how many calls could it take, let's really write it all out. 00:30:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Okay, so let's start with the client, because the clients are usually in panic when it comes to a property damage, that's their first concern. I would say when we first sign them on, they want us to deal with the people. They probably call about probably five or six times before PDU resolved, and each call takes about 10 minutes. And then there's a PD adjuster. Now before that, there's the, we have to order the police report, usually that's what the holdup is. We try to follow up once a three, five minute phone calls, and then we have to make calls to the shops or toy yards and that is a little bit more time consuming that probably takes four or five ten minute calls. Okay, that's why I hate property damage by the way. 00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many, how many times does that come up? you think one average in your cases? 00:33:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) It comes up a lot with the Hispanic clients. they don't usually have the confidence to deal with I think, for good reason, they feel like a lot of people have ripped them off. I think that's a, they came to honestly, honestly, I think that's, um, and so I would say about 35% of clients, I wouldn't say it's a majority, but it's a good chunk. Okay. 00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anything else that we want to add to the property damage line? 00:34:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I mean, If we want to get into the nitty-gritty, once in a while we have to, they don't want to accept the property damage settlement, and we have to step in and negotiate a little bit. You know, there's not much to negotiate, it's basically all computerized. But sometimes if I make a phone call, I can push up the offer by a couple thousand dollars or so. 00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, that's good. I think what I'm doing as a result of this is creating more line items over here and breaking it up more, and so that we can really just see how it goes, and then what will come out of this is some target for how quickly things should go, maybe an adjustment to the schedule. of what we follow up with and when in order to continue to shave off because really I think if we're going to target me, let me do some math here because I was actually about the same. So I can't do it that way. Well, I think we need to try to shave at least 20 days off of your average close slash resolution date. And I say that because the way that it isn't letify is not correct and I have to get that fixed. But if we can shave and it's already happening and there's a lot in motion that even if we didn't make any other changes, that number would probably keep shrinking because we've already made some changes, so it's going to impact that time. But we want to keep reducing it. And so, within reason, obviously, there's a threshold where now we're cutting corners and we're not doing it well and all of that. that's not what we're looking for. But the more that we break down these processes that have to happen and who's assigned it, the more that we visually look at it and go, you know what, we could probably look at how we do that and see we do it better. Maybe in terms of time blocking and just sitting down and like getting all the phone calls that have to be around policy limits being done, phone calls and emails around initial documents, that type of thing. Because when you stay within like tasks for a while, you get into a state more afloat, whereas some things are so opposite of each other in the nature of them. One might be communicating with people, and the other one might be research and analyzing. If you're task switching from a type of task where you're researching and analyzing versus communicating with a person, there is a mental lag time to transition between one and the other. So if you're constantly switching this type, this type, this type, this type, throughout the day, you're adding a lot of mental lag time throughout the day that could be diminished or just gotten rid of if you just stay in this type of task until you finish what needs to be done for the day and then move to the next type of task and knowing also that there might be sometimes a day when it's easier to get a hold of particular types of people and so making sure that your team is available to be working those types of tasks at that type of time. Does that make sense? And so, breaking all of this down helps us to look at what are the things that we can do to kind of improve efficiency in just the way that we manage tasks throughout the day, even if we're not changing who does the task or the actual process of the task just when and how it happens. Does that make sense? So, we are on confirming coverages and liability. Let's talk about how long that takes. 00:39:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) That one is tricky to assess because some cases like right away and get it within a week. In some cases, it takes like 30 days. We have a case where we have two witnesses. We have a police report put into the defendant's fault, and we still want accept liability because they haven't received a statement from their insurer yet. So that's, I would say the majority of cases, if we're just talking majority, probably two weeks. 00:40:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anything else we want to add there? No, that's One more, just on Completing coverage of liability, no, Ordering initial documents such as police reports, records, health insurance lanes. It feels like maybe that should be broken up into different steps because there are different places, different sources that you have to communicate with. I get it as a chunk, like as a main task, I think I'd like to see it broken up as some sub tasks. 00:41:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) So police report. Yeah. Possible life is in health insurance. Okay. 00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Please report. Yeah. Let's just break this down. right. All All All All All All All All right. And he talked about it. Any thoughts about it. 00:42:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Police report. it depends what department it is. If it's Phoenix, we can get it in about a couple of weeks, two or three weeks. If it's Tucson, then it's like two or three months. 00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? 00:43:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wow. 00:43:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Two songs of that. Hospital records is the same. depends on which hospital it is. But usually, I would say, about three months, that's like following up every week. 00:44:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I get the hospital taking a while because there has to be an assessment and I don't know if they come in quickly, but I guess that should probably happen quickly too, right? just go in if they get hurt, otherwise they go see doctors, right? 00:44:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah, but it's not a matter of like the It's not a matter of how quickly the reports are made. It's a matter of the records department, how well staff they are. like Banner Hospital only has, well they have a backlog, about a thousand requests and then we have two people in the office for the whole state. Yeah, it's scary. And then for Tucson, yeah, they prioritize for the police reports, they prioritize criminal cases or civil cases. And because there may be minors involved, someone has to physically look at each report for each request and decide whether there's a minor or not. I don't know how Phoenix, Phoenix probably is better staffed. That's probably why they have, they can get them faster, and yeah, that's how it's always been. Tucson has always been still even when I was before this firm, so it's been really managed. 00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Tax dollars, hard at work, people. 00:45:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) All right, health insurance, liens, health insurance things, depends if it's private or public health insurance, private health insurance. trolley about a month. If it's Medicare. That's the longest. That's usually the longest. That's about three months. Medicaid looking usually get it pretty quick. 00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If we're following up. What's it quick? 00:46:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) What's What's it six weeks? 00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So for the whole thing we can say like a month to three months. 00:46:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah. 00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Roughly, what is the percentage of private health care insurance? 00:46:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) What's the percentage Let's say it's about 40% private and 60% government. 00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is good to this might help me with some five report requests. Oh, my sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&B insurance search request. 00:47:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) All right, that's when there's no. That's when there's no police report, like, maybe on a dog bite or something like that, or when it's just word versus word. That that can be done in about 20 minutes. That's it. to send the actual request is pretty quick. 00:48:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, order policy limits if needed. 00:48:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Ten minutes. Probably a 15-minute phone call to the provider that we send them to. Just to build through the case, give them the application information, and give them the insurance information and everything. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Continuing client medical referrals and making sure they go to their appointments. 00:48:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I'm not sure how you can quantify that. Because that's just throughout the life of the case. You just keep reviewing it. I would say, so we're accelerating the reviews. We're now, every case gets reviewed twice a month. So that's every two weeks. And I started reviewing, like you just asked, I started reviewing the cases for contact every week. 00:49:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you anything where you did that? 00:49:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah, I found some things I've felt through the cracks. I was trying be as gentle as I could on my nudging, but I'm not, I'm not a politician. So, but they know me. My team knows me really well. 00:49:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, we all need it. all of us will drop the ball on some things all the time or you being so but um we need to be told and and reminded everybody so if you're approachable somebody says hey Lauren's notice you're kind of dropping the ball here you know like it'll happen if we can all help each other um it's good so um felt through cracks and nudged a on it um like what would you what do you find um well i guess the most recent one is uh is uh today or was it today or yesterday as reviewing a case and uh you know the the doctors were being contacted it was being managed but you 00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I was like, uh, we need to contact a client today, not what you have time, not when, you know, at the end of the day, when you think you don't have anything left, you need to contact him like right now. 00:51:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And how was that received? 00:51:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Uh, it was John. So he knows, he knows me, he is used to my bluntness, my, I need you to elaborate though. 00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How was it received like, uh, did he, did he care about it? Like did he know why do you just like, yeah, okay, what up, like, how was it received? 00:51:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) He said, okay, I'll go right now. 00:51:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Not a, you're right, that shouldn't have happened. 00:51:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I think maybe he said something like that. I don't know, wait, we kind of have a short hand, we've been working together. 00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) as before, sweet lawyers, we kind of. Right. So the thing that I just want to make sure is that, so we're setting some kind of new expectations for, because we talked about the customer or the client's perception of how we care about them, right? So it's not just enough that the job gets done, but that they know that we're getting the job done and that we care that it's getting done and that we're following up on it. So I would recommend just touching basis if you don't feel like everybody's on the same page with that and that's a very clear obvious thing, which I don't think is a very clear obvious thing to most people and most businesses. You don't think about things that way. I think that you should have a conversation about, hey, like this is what we're going to be doing. First of all, I'm touching the cases for contact every single week just to look at it and here's what I want to see. 00:52:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I did mention that two weeks ago, or right after our meeting, I told them from now on, going to review cases for contact. Okay. So I know I'm. 00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got it. Good. And then anything else that showed up in your review for context? 00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Yeah, today there is one where we had texted and left voice notes. One of the logs of the client said their phone was going to be turned off soon. And so I was like, well, if we know that we should probably contact them through email them. Not just check the box, you know? 00:53:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, very good job. And what did they have to say about that? 00:53:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) They said I am a bad. 00:53:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That makes sense. Yeah, let's not be robots. Okay, let's actually think about. So this is the thing. Get off autopilot and think about the client's experience. When you look at their case, so this just popped into my head. So I'm just going to go ahead and say it. When we are at the temple, we're looking at names, we need to be mindful of them. You know, just go through the road experience and like we can, I'm sure we do at times, but the purpose is to think about that person that we're serving at that moment. We should be like that in the cases who this person is real. This is just a name in my log, even if I've never spoken to them, but most of you probably have or will. But what is their experience and it matters. So the the lifeblood of street law is the clients. There is no business, there are no jobs for any of you without the clients, but they have gone through something traumatic, even if it's minimally traumatic compared to some of the others. It's traumatic. They have one advocate. It is sweet law. So the doctors, know, maybe an ad doctor is advocating for them. Doctors are pretty burnt out, whatever, but your job literally is their advocate. As an attorney, you are their advocate. That's an important word. and, you know, you don't have a Hippocratic oath like doctors do or whatever, but you would want to have, I think, a culture of we care. So if that's the case and we're looking at it, just think, did we connect? Do they know that we cared? It doesn't take much more effort. You really don't have to do anything different. The only thing that's different is your intention when you manage the case. And so having a conversation with that, and I'll tell you this, Lorenz, between you and me. So I wouldn't say to anybody else in sweet law. So one of the things I asked Heavenly Father was, look, I don't, I just take my kids to school, I'm at home, and all I have is my business. And this isn't really the place I can talk about the gospel and do missionary work. I really want to do missionary work. So how can I make what I do still be a part of your work and your glory? Like how can I participate in that plan? And the message to me was really just like, I teach fundamental concepts of organization and structure and accountability. And if that isn't preparing fertile ground to be able to receive commandments and the gospel and to, you know, to consider values and to consider the way that we show up, all of those things are gospel oriented. Stephen Covey is a businessman and he taught business principles. But if anybody's familiar with general conference talks, they will see them all throughout Stephen Covey's and habits of a highly affected people and highly affected marriages and highly in the eighth habit and all of that, you will see general comfort on getting goosebumps, which is woven throughout there. And nobody's offended by it, because he didn't actually name it. But for sure, those people when when they hear the gospel for the first time, they'll be like, this kind of sounds familiar. These values are familiar to me, like this, caring about people is familiar, this being accountable for what I do is familiar, this showing up regularly and doing what I say I'm going to do, that sounds familiar, you know, and it's not typical in all the world to to have that level in integrity. So you teaching your team to care about the one. You it's an opportunity for you to kind of mix that and it's really not appropriate for me to say But I'm going to do it anyway, because I'll take my risks or that type of conversation and roll with it. So, anyways, there's just something to consider that you as a leader, you have a chance to help people show up better and teach them how to be about the one, even without giving them the reason behind it, and watch them become somebody who's like, need to care about this person. I guarantee you, it's going to show up in the rest of their lives, they'll pay more attention to the one when there's one in front of them, if that makes sense. So anyway, well now I'm glad Patrick's not here. 00:58:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) I wasn't not glad, but it's his birthday, but you know, sometimes God does what he does, and there's a reason that we don't even know it, but that's kind of how I want to practice this law, honestly. That's, you know. I want to care. That's why I went to law school. didn't go to law school to make loads of money. That's the way I want to practice the law. I want to be about, I want to be about people, not about, you know, but necessarily bottom line. Although, doesn't matter because then you can't take people here, people. 00:59:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, we pay titling like still money gets the job done, get certain types of jobs done. But I think the whole spark, the whole conversation was advocate. That is one of the names of the savior is advocate. And anyway, just, I was just thinking about it and it came out. So that's the thing. We can teach them and remind them we are advocates, which means we have to care for them and we represent them. But how can we do that and then not show up and be like, oh yeah, we're doing the thing, but we're not talking to you about it because whatever, like we're getting the job done, they are the job. Your experience is the job. They are the job. So anyway, what I would like you to do, and you don't have to do it right this minute, but please have it down by next call. Now, I am not upset that you didn't. You've got a lot going on. 01:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Is your wife going to be okay? Well, I don't know. She's been basically bedridden for... She goes to counterpoint-minds, and she's got a herniated disc, and she's pretty bad shape. I think she's going to be fine. It's just no different from the clients that I see every day. just takes time. 01:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would not wish that I was not anybody, and to lose any kind of mobility. So, hot flash this. had one in Phoenix, and I love the heat. Okay, but then... I realize it triggers a hot flash, and I'm sitting there and I'm trying to pack up and go, and I had to lay down, like, pull my shirt up here, pull my pants up as high as they will go and lay on the tile just to get cold as fast as I can. And my fiance is like, what could I do for you? Like, you can't do anything for me. Um, and he's just, he just doesn't know what to do. And I'm so annoyed. And I cried a little bit, which really annoyed me. Because my mind is ready to go. My muscles are ready to go. My health, like, I've got everything. I've done all my work. And I still got shut down. And it was so frustrating. I could not control it. And this happens, you know, your wife, you've got, I'm sure she's like, I've got things to do. I don't want, and women, we don't want to add to anybody's burden. Men don't want to add to anybody's burden. handle it differently. It's the same thing. It's a lot. Speaking of my love, there he goes. Um, so. I hope anyway, I don't I don't I can add you guys to my prayers. I don't know It's been rough month. Yeah, well, have you put her on the prayer rolls? Yeah Well, I will put you on there also just in case you're neglected yourself and gonna send I'll just tell you I've got powerful prayers Because I got a lot of faith so I'm gonna start sending them to you and I I'm sending the biggest giantest hug for all of you and for your kiddos and Okay, it's okay because that's the spirit, but I know the tendency is and I'm learning this as my girls Are older and a little older than your kids and I wanted to give them the best of everything and let them experience Childhood and I robbed them of some Work opportunities and I mean like emotional work. I coddled them too much and I I thought I was doing the best thing, maybe this is a time to call your children up to something bigger because they were saved for this time because of what they're able to do and so maybe you can deputize and delegate in a way that you haven't before and maybe reticent you because we have we have this culture of softness but think about our pioneer children think about what God's people are made of Lorenz and we're not little off-lowers so maybe the time for you to kind of get your little army of heelmen going and clap around your your sweet wife and and down together I have no idea because I don't know anything about your family but words come into my head so I spit them out of my mouth and I don't know if they're helpful but appreciate that be prayers to you you know oh man I'm not really I'm not a crying person Oh, I make it happen to people. Yeah. Welcome. But. Thanks for your kindness. It's love, Lorenz, you're my brother. And I get called to the work that I get called to just like you do. I'm called for the right people, so hang in there and keep serving the best that you can and don't forget to ask for the blessings you need. I am 100% positive that the law of justice is required to be fulfilled and mercy can't rob it. We know that. But when he says asking you shall receive, I'm almost positive that that is a threshold of justice that he wants to give all the blessings, but the laws require that there be a certain amount of faith that is given and shown and demonstrated before more blessings can come. That's why prayers are so important. That's why the volume of prayers are so important. That's why the amount of faith behind them. so important. That's why the temple rolls are so important and why he puts temple rolls on the home page of the LDS tool that so we can get to it so quickly because there is a threshold. He is just waiting to give us. So ask, ask, ask, ask your friends to pray, ask your family to pray. Don't forget to fast and don't tell Mark I went all LDS on you right here. 01:05:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) Okay deal as long as you don't tell my crying. 01:05:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You did what? 01:05:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) didn't see anything. 01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's right. 01:05:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (3) What? dust. 01:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's It's allergies. We're both having allergies today. That's what it is. All right. Well go fix your allergies and I'll talk to you next week. lorenz@sweetlaw.comTina MarieLorenz- Tina
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello. 00:00:04 - Laura L (3) How are you? Doing well yourself. 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm just texting my daughter and she's just frustrating and having a bad day. So I was ready for this. 00:00:18 - Laura L (3) I lost track of time because I'm messaging her. Sorry. All good. I hope she's okay. 00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. She's just emotionally struggling. Just like. Let tell her this real quick. Okay. Okay. Um, um, so. Let me go look at Trello. Hey. I had already, I'm in a long browser. Nope, that's the one. Where's my workspace? This one. I think it was the one called business HQ. Yeah, there you go. Okay. And you updated one for the, what you call it? DNS. 00:01:45 - Laura L (3) Yeah. 00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Questions for next meeting? Is that in there? What is it at? Okay. 00:01:56 - Laura L (3) I'm the current in progress that we have is. for the thinkific and I assume we're no longer using thinkific. 00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I don't know. canceled it. I have so many things going on right now. I'm I am all over the board and still just trying to figure it out. But what I did do is I had a man, I wish he could give you access to it, but I can't. So I bought that snapshot I told you about with high level. I just got access to this training for it today to know how to use it, because so there's kind of like two tracks that I'm working. So one is just being able to create my own training content and deliver it to people in an easy and simple way. So high level is not easy and simple, but I want to learn high level and use it. And so slowly just creating things. inside of it and building it. Um, let me log in. Let's see. Oh, yeah. I need to change the, no, I'm going to keep that. And decide if I want to keep it as agency or not. I think I will. we'll see. Let's see, profit drivers. 00:03:24 - Laura L (3) Yeah, you bought a subscription in go high level. Still blowing one. 00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, it's, it's, they're kind of the same. Like they combined it, I think, because of my email address. It shouldn't have. It was really weird because one is a white label agency. that definitely shouldn't have happened. Um, um, okay. So sites, memberships, Okay, so maybe these are separate now, because this is not an agency dashboard. All right, let me. I have one account. Settings, let me change this account to different email address and see if that will help kind of clear up the confusion. I profile. I think it would be there. I'm not changing it, so let's see if I can do the profile. NTP. Send me the thing. 00:05:40 - Laura L (3) I think you could also add your other email to the agency account. 00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) whenever it already is, so when you say other email, it's go high level, right? 00:05:55 - Laura L (3) Yeah. 00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Go high level. You have to say exactly what email. Because if you say other one, I'm assuming that you meant the profit driver's ink. 00:06:04 - Laura L (3) Yeah, both emails like as a profile or admin. So you do both have access, whichever you want to use. 00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Um, okay. So here's which also this makes no sense. Like this is got to be an example. Yeah, I don't actually have that. So, um, let's see which one I pinned this. So the one that's called beverage systems, memberships, communities, three. Well, again, um, beautiful. Yeah, so they have. Um, let me go see if I can. Let's show you something a little bit. Let's see community builders. Let's check my email and see if In here, last one. Snapshots set up in training, community funnel overview, community setup, setting up their surveys in the CRM. Yeah, how are we? Oh, this is a free group. I wonder if they'll let me invite you. Well, yeah, maybe under members, you could invite someone to join. Yeah, I can invite you, but I think you wouldn't have access to that. So, um, wait, okay, so things. Oh, yeah, group profits again by a copy and let's go to zoom chat. What was the guy's name, Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? All right, we'll see. Um, hopefully they'll say yes, because that doesn't make. I mean, so like if you purchase a membership area anywhere else, you can pretty much just share the password, but school is different. Like that's all these different communities and that doesn't make it. So we'll see what they do with that. So I just want to learn how to use this and it's it's got training. So anyway, it's a whole whole thing that probably keep us a little bit busy for a while because they have this. 00:11:55 - Laura L (3) The guide is for the school, I mean, for school community or membership. 00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What? 00:12:02 - Laura L (3) I mean the guide or the training that you shared is for school community, grading, or higher level. 00:12:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. they have all these automations that are set up and they teach you how to different surveys and connecting it all in the high level CRM. Okay. but I don't know if it's actually already in, like how much of that was in the snapshot already? 00:12:44 - Laura L (3) Yeah. But I think if he shared you with the link, you could import it to go high level so you could see. 00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's already imported. 00:12:53 - Laura L (3) It's already there. 00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Yeah. And I don't see it here. I don't know how much of it is, because, yeah, things just aren't Legends Academy, no one if that's part of it. Anyway, we really need to have the training to put things apart because all that should be in here is the existing snapshot that I imported. So, I'll show you, let's see, switch the agency view. 00:13:31 - Laura L (3) Yes, okay, if you could also invite me in that account so I can have a look. 00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You should be in here. 00:13:38 - Laura L (3) I think I'm invited for the other account with your lead loan at the agency. 00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Okay. Oh, what's the number I forget? 00:14:04 - Laura L (3) I'm sorry. Yeah, two five eight. At gmail.com. 00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm sorry. Stations. Stations. Okay. All right. now you should have access to that. And this one leveraged systems membership is the one that I have imported that snapshot. I'm sure let me go back and show you. But it's snapshots, imported snapshots, launched a simple community. So that one, this is what I did, right? I just created a new thing off of that. So that is what this is. There's a sub account created from that snapshot. 00:15:25 - Laura L (3) Huh? 00:15:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Huh? 00:15:27 - Laura L (3) And I'm just reading the name of the sub account so I could navigate when I'm okay. 00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see. 00:16:33 - Laura L (3) For the product in WordPress, I think we need to set up Stripe for that. What product? You mentioned that we will be using WordPress for the sales page. 00:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, let's see. Wherever you need to go and set up Stripe, let me know I can set that that up because my brain can't even go there right now. We haven't talked in so long, and I'm just trying to get there. going down these tasks, if I get updates throughout the week, so really what I would like this call to be, would be to do things that we can't communicate through Trello during the week. I'm still trying to find the DNS task. 00:17:25 - Laura L (3) Yeah, I think you put it up there in the domain, like the July 20 due date. I added there the articles where we can, there's a guide how to update the DNS record. I'm sorry, it's August 6th, the July 20 due date. Yeah. 00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh yeah, so profits, rivers. I think, right now it's still in, I need the error, it's still error, okay, hold on a second. Because I think what I did was used leverage systems instead. Yeah. Sites. Yeah, this is just not like intuitive, where's domains. No domains found. I'm moving all around I'm Right, that's not it. So I set up clouds layer, first of all. Which I can share with you. Okay. Didn't launch that. So what I figured out is that if I point the domain to cloud flare, then it can work with chi level and you can have the Access to cloud flare to set things up, but that looks like it's not working. 00:20:08 - Laura L (3) Just to confirm. So the sales page would be in WordPress with the profit drivers domain. 00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think I'll probably use leverage systems. 00:20:21 - Laura L (3) Okay. That's the domain, but it would be in, I mean, WordPress, not high level. 00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:20:33 - Laura L (3) Okay. from WordPress, we'll be pushing the signup or contacts to high level. Yes. Okay. I must wonder you don't want to use the high level site for the sales page or landing page. 00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. We use WordPress for that. All right. High level is basically, the power of it is automations. 00:21:06 - Laura L (3) Yeah, because most also people using the sites, mean, for the landing page, so it would just want access. I'm not sure I understand what In building the sales page or landing page, so it will just be in one go. They don't have to push the contacts from the other side to go high level. It would automatically captured inside go high level and go directly to the automation. 00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Are you saying you think that I should build the site on high level? I'm trying to understand where you're going with this. 00:21:57 - Laura L (3) Yeah, I'm just trying to confirm or check. 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, you don't want to use the high level because high level is too glitchy. They're not good at hosting. 00:22:05 - Laura L (3) They have too many issues. Okay. 00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that's just, that's what I want to check and yeah, when they are more solid and things work more fluidly and then I would use it, but their word press hosting is not very good. And I host it on percidium, which actually maybe that's part of the issue. 00:22:30 - Laura L (3) Yeah, I think you could use high level without importing the side from go. mean, word press like directly from high level. 00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Say that again. 00:22:46 - Laura L (3) You could use the high level side without importing or yeah, embedding your press site. 00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's just directly in high level. So let me just break down what we are. are going to do. The sales pages and landing pages will be on WordPress. And when somebody orders something, then it will probably be zapped over to high level. And depending on what they did, if they opted in or if they purchased something, then that zap would have some data appended to it, which would say it's either a customer or an opt in a river, and then it level would trigger automation as to how to handle them based off of what data was appended, whether it was a customer, what they bought, what they should get access to, if they need to have an account created in the membership site. So the membership site will be hosted there. And primarily, though, primarily, what I'm using high level for is to learn how to use it well, so that I can help teach other people who don't, do things, because the stacks get really expensive, you know, Click when it's expensive and it's bloated and it's slow. If you have school, you have multiple memberships, then you have to pay $100 for each one. So because I teach business and simple business systems and because high level is evolving very quickly with the types of automations they can do, with all the services that they offer, I want to put some things in it to learn how to use it so that I can create a simple system inside of high level, but in the meantime it doesn't work really well. So I'm not going to put everything that I'm using there at the same time. Does that make sense? Yep. Okay, which I get is confusing because it's all all over the place, but that's kind of the process that I had to go through is so many of these things are either too expensive or they just, when people are starting out their business. They need to leverage all of their investments and everything that they're spending and they need it to return quickly, but that's not usually what happens first you start building, then it takes a while to make sales, it takes a while to, you know, get any kind of volume. And they don't know how to create nurture sequences and follow up with people. So the really big value that high level has is the CRM. It's how you handle customers and process them following up with text messages, following up with email messages, giving them magic link access to whatever they purchased. It's that. What they are not good at is WordPress hosting, their sites are slow, they have down issues, they're doing okay with email delivery, their membership is okay, it's not great. So, what we're building there, most of it is going. to be just kind of a test functionality. I also have a school membership. I may do something else, but our assignments and you and I talking about this is going to be figuring out how these things work together. And if we can make it work well, then we can move things over to it. So I almost have two separate tracks. One is building for the future through with high level and one is building for the right here right now. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. And that's kind of been an evolution for me because I didn't know what I wanted to do in the beginning and how I wanted to go about it and what I wanted to do, but because in the last month or so, you know, just getting busy now that the girls are in school, but also seeing the things that some of the things and the snapshots that are coming out in high level, because I didn't want to have really anything to do with it too much. to go have a simple community and be able to teach and get people to this but I do think that there's a lot for a lot to be said for being able to create small snapshots ourselves and provide them to people so ultimately that's what I want to be able to do with the agency account but I've got to learn how it goes and if I do it all by myself it'll take me forever so you already know a lot of things about the automations and how they work so if you can figure out and we can figure out together how to use the snapshot that I got and set up an automations that has to do with the membership that will be step one and that will be great so in the domain man I'm like okay so cloud flare so we're first sitting on we've got all these pieces and everything Time, like I saved this password and updated and it does not save it correctly or it does and I have to fill it up. Okay, let me do this. And we'll see, um, authenticator, okay, so we've got, what do you call it, it's, okay, so that's 20 day cloud flare. It's hosting at Presidium. Cloudflare is not a host. I'm not really sure how That works actually. Well, let me go see you. So you found. How does that have a domain and that's DNS records? Yeah. That I know for a proceeding, I think we add different things. So let me I don't know if I can do that, but I'll see if I can do this advanced DNS. I think I would have to do custom name servers, which I think would change. Now that some of that I'm going to struggle with domain. It's in DNS. And it's left there. You can manage those records in this game. You Yeah, I feel like I have to for new cheap stuff, because you have to do a name and C name records. I guess they're all a name records. How do I add a record? Okay, that's it. So I need to do that here. DNS. Oh, so that should be. Right. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go back to next I'm to slide. 00:31:29 - Laura L (3) Your website. 00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. But I have to get rid of it because there's a max of five. So I'm trying to figure out how to delete this real quick. I'm going to go back to the request plan. Let me see. And I really don't need this, so let me go back here. I'm trying to figure out the fastest way to just delete it. Right now on the website, no, it's probably I guess so far on new website. Really? Did they change it? So I deleted it in the last or just hasn't happened yet. Right. It probably will take a little while. So we'll an additional site on. Let me see what their CL plans to see with the one WordPress site, three WordPress sites, five WordPress sites. I feel like they've changed the prizes. I'm pretty sure I paid. $49.99 for mine. First, let me see what is going on. Oh,.80. Okay, so I guess that's what I'm getting there. Something like that. All right. All right. All right, that'll take a little bit. So it's already pointed, so this domain is the one that I want to use. It's already pointed at CloudFlare. She couldn't see here. So and you go, sorry, CloudFlare access. So you should be able to add a records. Let's see, I've got one a record there. I was just trying to find what it's supposed to be. But it should be the same for all of us at once it needs to be. Yeah, add a record, a, there, and it will be, I think, a step to be. That's why you. Well, it's, you know, what that already exists. and you're not showing me that, 173.230, I do not see you, 173.230, here. So, A, W, W, there's the thing, Or is the other thing, 3,000, 3,000. Okay, well that worked. Yeah. Oh, why wouldn't you let me do? Parking page. Oh, that's why. Oh, yeah, that was the issue, okay. Which one did I just do? Okay, so I don't know how fast it takes to propagate. right, so proscenium is definitely hosting it. Okay. It just doesn't have a site created. So, um, and it's on cloud there. And then, okay, so, vercedium is, it's pointed at vercedium, but I haven't created that domain yet. So let's go here. And now be able to So, I don't want probably working to create that. And then once it does show up here, we can install WordPress on it in the manage website. I feel like, I mean, this is WordPress posted. So it probably will happen automatically. 00:39:35 - Laura L (3) Yeah, as connected. 00:39:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so then you should share this with you. you. This should be the one because nothing else makes sense. No, edit. So it actually be... It should be this, and then not for sure, and then share. All right, let's check this one time. Yeah, it's not there yet. Okay, so just to recap, we are going to have WordPress installed on a site that is Leverage Systems. Actually, you could probably clone, you had it on tinamarita.io, right? 00:41:23 - Laura L (3) Yeah, I could actually, I mean, export those and import it to the website. 00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) so you can do that. It's pointed, you have access to cloud player. You should have access to everything that you can do. And we can create that landing page that you had on tinamarita.io. This one could be the whole page of Leverage Systems. 00:41:56 - Laura L (3) And. 00:42:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Separately, we'll see if I can get access to this training and just look at and try to wrap our heads around how the snapshot works for the membership site and high level. So the other thing that's happening is I'm helping, I'm working with another lady on launching a product with her, so we'll have some traffic and sales coming in through that way. we'll have a little bit of people to put in kind of slowly and make sure everything works before trying to build it at any kind of scale. So we'll have time to be able to break it and still take care of people if something goes wrong, you know what I mean? Yeah. Okay, because I don't want to create a big support issue and not and give people a bad experience. Okay, so leverage the Trello. Trello. So, you can get rid of anything or ask if I want to close it off because my brain can't pass it right now. 00:43:11 - Laura L (3) In progress, we can delete for the thinkific task since we're no longer using thinkific. 00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, hold on a second. No, not leave that as the task for right now. And the card. See. Wait. We've got two of you in here, which one That one the next two Tina. Yeah, okay, this one, okay And worse think if I do you see it Yeah Is it in progress with that? Yeah in progress that one there because that's where they think it's this Yeah Okay, well, um, let's see, or maybe we can you tell it's still the same Can we do this in WordPress Let's explore Funnel kit with WordPress and And More plus so I'm gonna say this and so I'm gonna put a let's see What's just kind of like an overview project resources, we'll call this, and I'm going to put master plan, call it that. Really, it should be like a flowchart, but we'll say this. So landing pages, popped in sales pages on Elementor, Wordpress, all kits, match 100% sure how that works together, but wants to explore it. Every customer or lead pops in, gets zaps, Over to higher level and needs an automation that handles whatever needs to be done depending on how the trigger, for example, need a sequence, not your sequence, that's the delivery. Or feedback, et cetera, sequences, how that's accessed. Let's see. Okay, I'll maybe not try this. You You You Okay, so this is just kind of I don't know this to the top. Would be great to create this like in a flow chart or something so and then make that a picture right there so it's easy to look at. Yeah, that is actually a great board and it's not one that I came up with but. So, like, if we have questions that we need to talk about for the meeting, this should be here to do. already have a couple. To do progress for a block area, you have that. Where did you go? Right. We have some structure. going slowly but surely. Okay. Do you have any other questions? 00:50:08 - Laura L (3) Do we already have a Zapier account that we can use for the Zapier to create like push contacts to go high level? 00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 00:50:22 - Laura L (3) I think also be great like give me like a draft or object teams of the automations that will be creating inside high level depending on the segmentation of the list. 00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry again I was doing that. 00:50:41 - Laura L (3) I mean be great if we also have like the list of objectives of the email nurtures that we will be doing. 00:50:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have not got that mapped out yet that'll that'll be a little while it will just kind of first it'll depend on what I want to offer and then the kind of experience that I want people to have so that's going to take weeks. the kind of formulate, but for sure the way the way that I would give it to you would be like a flow chart kind of map. So and and something that looks a lot like what what they had. I mean you know what a flow chart looks like right? Yeah. So like here's the entry point, here's the ad, here's the whatever, here's the landing page. This is what happens next. This is what happens next and just kind of flow all the way through. If this does not kind of thing, decision matrix kind of thing, so that like it will all be heavily mapped out when the time comes. But the first thing is just kind of so there are some snapshots already and automations already in in these accounts and you can play snapshots. These are all the same. I don't have these. These are templates that came with them, don't really need these, but we're not delegating them because they could be valuable down the road. But the snapshots that I bought from other people, you can create a sub account with one of them. So this one already exists, and this one is in the Leverage Systems membership. I'm not positive where this one is, I think it might be in here. I'm automation. I think that's this, but I'm not totally positive. So you could create a new one if you just wanted to see and see what the snapshots do. you. I'm pretty sure this is from Anik. Let's see. All All right. So this is good to know, and those are, well, that's pretty cool. Wait 10 minutes before that. That's awesome. That was only two workflows. I swear there was more things. Okay, it's just because I put it in community nurture, join the community. Oh, this seems like it might be. Transfer access for an offer to say, well, D and D school tracker pipeline. This is definitely the one that I bought. Um, so then. Alright, so let me go to here, so this should have that here, too, then if I go to Automation's weird, it's not here, extra low, no, no, it's not it. Very confused by how these things come. This is webinar, this is totally good. Let's just experiment on. Yeah, so, is it this one in Automation's? Yeah, other one. Yeah, that's the only question. Yeah, I won't know until I go through this training to see exactly what all it is and hopefully they'll let me share it with you, but anyway, as you can see, there are some automations that are already fully mapped out that just, you know, you would plug it in your own product, your own text. Let's see, okay, action name, type, date, email, alright, from name, from email, subject, template. It's awesome. Today we're posting a line and put all of that in there right now. Yeah, this will be great. Just got to go through it all and just kind of wrap our heads around it and then put a product to attach to it and then some ads to drive traffic to it with the product. Then it all takes a while because I'm also doing a whole bunch of other things including going to school, answering your mission, answering clients, and raising kids, just a little busy, just a little bit. Yeah, but you say automations light your brain up, so it's about the time to get your brain light up and take a look at it. And if you could, I'm going to pause on any assignments for right now other than just this one that we have, which is, and I'm going to move this up here because it's probably the other one, page for local ticket offer, don't know if this driver's live going to. Okay, uh oh, I think I need to get some of it, but one more second, this is... Yeah, think once I imported all of those things, then we can integrate the stripe or paper. Yeah, we'll just edit. Oh, think if the final gets out of order, too. Okay, change the date for like a couple weeks from now. Oh wait, let's see. What? Oh, that's obvious. Okay. Okay. Okay, I have to go to my daughter. 00:57:52 - Laura L (3) She's blowing my phone up and having a hard time. 00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, she came home at lunch and was just crying. Okay. Okay. So anyway, just. You could spend a few hours if you wanted to just getting the, what do you call it, the this one website leverage system set up and then just playing around with high level and the snapshots and getting familiar with what's in there. And getting familiar with both snapshots is good too because there's a lot in both of them. 00:58:23 - Laura L (3) Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. 00:58:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. All right. Do you have any questions? 00:58:32 - Laura L (3) Yeah, I'll get so far. once the site is added to a proceeding, then I could go ahead and put all those templates and play around as well as, as well as the snapshots in go high level. 00:58:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yep. Okay. 00:58:55 - Laura L (3) You're just, you just want to make sure you just repeated back to me like what those two assignments were right. I have questions, right? Yeah, no more questions. 00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, all right then. Just let me know as you figure anything out. would hope to hear something maybe by Friday. Just how things have gone unless you're waiting until Monday to do it. But it's more helpful if it is done well before Tuesday so I can review the work. 00:59:24 - Laura L (3) Okay, sure, we'll do. So I'll just update here in Trello and that you know. 00:59:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that would be great. 00:59:32 - Laura L (3) All right, sure. 00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, all right, then I will talk to you next week. llaurel258@gmail.comTina MarieLaura + Tina
00:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hey! 00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey! so sweet. 00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You look great. Your hair is perfect. Were you doing videos? 00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nope. This normally what I do. I've just been really exhausted and seminary has disrupted my routine. 00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Got it, got it. I'm smoking. 00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm wall-stinging. So dry. Let's talk. Oh, I got, I got a new, you can't see it. Mike. Nope. Oh, because of the virtual background. 00:00:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I playing with backgrounds. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, Do you, I got back to everyone. I'm going to follow up the personalized room as well. 00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mappier commented as well. Do you know him? I know of him. Look, it's a road up. I don't know how good it sounds. it's Yeah. So, It's $100 like the Yeti mic and but it sounds way better. It sounds as good as the Shure SMB 7 or something like that. Yeah, I know I've heard good news. Yeah, but it's USB, not XLR and it doesn't need any and it can plug into your phone and it doesn't need anything. 00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No cloudlifter not phone to yeah. 00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so I mean, I like technology. I play around with a lot of things and because one of the things that I want to do is create some recordings that are like, you know, I was talking about some of the like inspirational, but also specifically calming, soothing to get frustrated. sometimes you hear something good that is specifically engineered towards getting us the energy that we want to have in business. Anyway, I think sound quality is important. So. but also I like shopping sometimes. Only online, not in person, do not like in-person shopping. I don't generally like shopping in general, but I do like the new technology thing that I would share that. Okay, so Neil, what I know about him is I got some of his stuff. He does like war reform products and... 00:02:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, I was just checking out his page. Looks like he's got a pretty slick thing for shorts and stuff. But yeah, I think he would be... I don't know that well, but I imagine it'd be a really good client too. think a lot of these people... Yeah, they need the combo. They need the combo. I think it's unique. I think we've hit something and then I think we should also create some kind of low ticket offer that leads into this for them as well. 00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who leads into it? Yeah, because I was thinking yesterday about how do we serve people who can't afford this, aren't ready for it. don't know if you heard it. And I thought I left it in the message, but I'm pretty sleepy. So I was saying that it was around the Cory Michelle thing, too. 00:03:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was thinking, I think I did here, yeah, after that. 00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But I was like, there are going to be some people who are not ready for the investment. Oh, OK, it was when, because you were talking about 5,000 or 6,000. And I was saying, I think it should be 6,000. And I don't think that we should do less and that it's more about that price will match for the person who's ready for it. Like, this is really targeting a specific type of person. I put the requirements in the document. And that $6,000 should be fine for that person. Now, some people, especially that are already on your list, are or you're going to want to serve them and help them. And so the tendency is, like you were talking about that lady who had a sliding scale. I'm like, sliding scale will modify the offer, so we won't modify the price. So the offer can change, which changes the price, right? So you get a different version. It isn't one-on-one, but what you could have is maybe just the plan, like that it's more generic, and how we would come about the plan. So here's how we would come about the plan. We would ask you all of these questions, and we would look at all of the things that you have. And here's some examples of how we would package things together, right? you can apply this logic to whatever offerings you have. And then this is the business plan, and this is the logic that we use to come up with this business plan. So you can kind of formulate your own based off of what we did as examples. Now, if you want to say, hey, Here's what I came up with is this is a good idea and have vox or access to us. Here is our $200 a month coaching or $400 month code, like whatever the vox or access would be. Yeah. And then, you know, maybe a call a week or two calls a month where you can come in and you could get like hot seat reviews, that type of thing. 00:05:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Um, so it's okay. 00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Way cheaper. And it's along the same line. So we're staying in our lane, right? And which means that we'll get the testimonials and the referrals that we get will all be concentrated around the offer that we have, which, so all the traction, all the energy that we get, it will all be relative, which means that, that anybody coming to us should be hot and targeted, right? 00:05:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I love that idea. Like I was just going to say, that's sort of a little bit like, um, what do you call it? Alan Sotanic, what I pay 500 a month for, once a week he does a call, he's got the forum, right? But he doesn't do chat support or voxer support, but he's sort of in discord answering some people everywhere as well. And then on his three, four hour calls on Thursdays, you could ask a question. Um, so, so I do like that concept of what you're talking about, like you're thinking, because these people are excited and they don't, um, you call it qualify. 00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what else can we give them? Is that kind of where? 00:06:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yes. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I'll tell you what I like about this court is you can do audio recordings and replies and video recording and replies. then it's a, it's a chat and generally the people that are in discord are either active or they're completely negative not which is there's not a bunch of just but they're coming there for a purpose so they're either talking to each other or they're completely out of it because they don't like it and they only go in for you send them email here's the content so this is another option and thing to be because of the clips specifically the audio interaction. 00:07:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well yeah and what's interesting so you know is the discord what Alan does on his $20,000 mess run that I joined last year he will do a loom video for the feedback and he'll just give you the loom link so that's kind of cool as well. 00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah and I would totally be willing to do that too but I don't want to do that for like a $200 offer of 400 or 500 would yeah so what are we really talking about them because like for me and I can just 00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) open up Google and we can just start writing because the auditory I won't remember but if I open up Google Doc. So, well actually why don't we do a customer map? What's your customer map? File, we'll make a copy in our position. So, so technically we have like let's just call it high ticket, right? Right? Technically we have this one for the pocket CMO, right? 00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me zoom in bigger. Want me to share this with you as well right now or do I want to wait? That would be great but I'm good with watching you while we do this though. 00:09:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I said in the Google background, if you saw that change to 12K in 2025. I love that. Yeah, six people. 00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Then we have to back that up and do that, and then I think that we could change the 12K also to 12 months and maybe also put in like a call once a quarter or something like that so that the value is stacked a little bit more. 00:09:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, so what you're saying, so repeat kind of what you're thinking here, I was thinking like a full on low ticket funnel, but you were saying something else. It's like a lower fee subscription. 00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I was saying, like, and I wouldn't really want to offer this until after we've done a couple of these because it would give us the framework to make that so much easier. But basically, they would get the same thing, but it would be a do-it-yourself version. So here is because what we're going to do is we're going to take a survey form that is thorough. It's basically an intake form that gets all this information from people. And from that intake form, we're going to figure out all the assets that they have and the skills and abilities that they have and formulate an offer stack for them, right? Front and like a low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, if possible, and different types of offers and packaging that they can give and not necessarily that they should offer all of them, giving them some options. and showing them how they could package their products slash services differently. And in order to just have something, first of all, that's scalable, potentially. So potentially low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, potentially something that is recurring, but it really depends on who they are and what they're offering. That doesn't work for everybody. But that's what we'll be looking at is what is the best way to leverage, whatever is that you have to offer to people. And then, do you want me to finish the? 00:11:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Try and thought, yeah, yeah. 00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so are you talking about what is the low ticket? So then the other thing would be we're going to create a business plan and say, here's the strategy that we would go about for you to make sure that you're not overextending yourself, like minimum viable product, really laser-targeted marketing using existing organic traffic. them. Coming up with the most leveraged business plan that they could have to mitigate loss and maximize profits. So that is very custom. That's what we're offering to people who's going to be talking to us one on one, which is a little bit more detail than I've given in the past, but since we've talked about this. But what this front end version could be is like here's examples of what we've done. We're not doing this for you, but we're going to show you our logic and we're going to give you these case studies or examples, right? So that you can put your own stuff through it and come up with a plan on your own and try to apply what was done because you can't afford it, or whatever reason, just choose not to invest in us on a higher level. But if you want support doing that, if you want some feedback, if you want to be able to get some help with it. And again, still don't want to pay the $6,000 price, then you can join our monthly group and you can quit anytime you want to. There's no commitment. So let's just say you want to come in and ask a bunch of questions. Then you get access to us for $400 a month. You can ask questions. You can, we'll have two live calls a month and it can be a couple hours long and bring your stuff, ask your questions. So that's still so it could be the front end is here's how we did it. Here's the framework, $97. The next upsell was if you want support while you came up with it, if you want feedback on your plan, if you want us to look at it and see how we would tweak it, adjust it, then you can come into the membership group for whatever $400 a month. And we'll give you feedback and if we're giving good feedback and it's going to take you what a launch that I imagine you're going to save for a few months, right? That's not enough you want to get there faster and you want us to really plan it out if you want access to a roll of X and who we would hire for this type of thing then it's the $6,000 one. 00:14:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I still can't visualize picture of the front end same thing but do it yourself version. Here's how we did it. 00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Here's how you can model it. So you won't probably until we've done it for somebody and I was just about to say maybe we need to run through the client stuff and you know see most of you all but so yeah it'll look kind of. kind of like our calculators. like you've got the the funnels like right you've got that. So they would be able to get one of those and plug their stuff into it. I have a different version of things and we would have an outline of maybe it's a Trello board like a project suite that says because we can share Trello boards people can copy them and this would be stage one stage two stage three kind of thing or maybe copy just graphics development all the different moving pieces and create them into tasks that they would then you know modify but they at least have a framework and we could put etas of how long this type of task should be should take to do so really break down the whole cycle into actual task and in actual project management suite that they just import and so let's say they get a developer they just assign those tasks to their developer and maybe instead of school they're using circle or Facebook groups or whatever so they modify a couple of things but for the most part it's gonna be pretty duplicatable. I think that's super high value and I'd be okay with giving that away for $97 because I think we want to over-deliver below them away with everything that we do and basically prove like how much we know and understand and how valuable we are so because at some point they're gonna go this takes way too long even with all the amazing tools that we give them they're like I want more help and that's that's what we want is we want them to be sold on how helpful we are so that we're not trying to you know we don't have to work for sales calls they should basically be begging to work with us because they know what we know, they know where they answer and they're happy to give us their money. It completely changes the energy and the dynamic of their relationship versus when you go in like and somebody hires you and they're like okay prove to me you're worth my money. 00:17:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Yeah yeah so yeah like we had like for my car for magic we have like I'm just going to share screen or show this we had a product called high ticket toolkit as well and it had like yeah four calculators crush your launch creating proper headache offers easy but and then we had a whole excel or csv so where they could just import into a sauna and have like all the tasks they have to do like 00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I actually have a base camp project template that I use for my freedoms, huh? 00:18:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That I used to use for my freedom systems and if I, let me see if I can find it in my drive, I use a new project template, let me share screen with you for a second, is that okay? So this actually came from, this came from starting with building Ryan Moran's Shear Strength Labs, the 12 months to a million bucks you wrote. So, um, Well, let's see, project discovery, that's a whole new thing, right, is kind of defining the avatar. These are, these would be tasks that you start with, conversations that have to be had, meetings, exploration on the team. Like, it depends on who you're at, but if you're doing this for your, as your agent agency, then you're doing it for a client and you're doing it with them. So, and the note is here, remove any items that are not applicable to the funnel, but what we'll do is have it where it's, you know, project suite specific and just be able to export from one to another. But these things, right, define what it is, title was the price, who's responsible for creating the content. So, like, if the copywriter has one part, the graphic designer has another part, that type of thing. sometimes before you even get to the copywriter, you have to give. of product-specific information, so then it's kind of three part, right, because it's the product owner who has to inform the copywriter, and then the graphic designer should be entitled what they want, and generally the copywriter probably is going to inform that if they're really good at marketing and you're hiring a copywriter. Due date, stages, dependency tasks, things like that. Yeah. core offer up sales, that admin instruction tasks, labeling base camp tasks properly, creating client project folder and Google Drive, creating the following sub-folders, all these things for approvals. 00:20:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's a lot. So you can like make some like this, but in Trello, so it looks really pretty, people go all about it from a marketing perspective? 00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. And also, this could be a PDF that is broken down a little bit more and explained a little bit more, dressed up and made pretty. um, um, explain with some videos, like this could be a product all in and of itself. Um, I was going in a totally different direction. 00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was going more, um, the front end, like a true low ticket funnel, like more about the end result, getting them on, whether it be go high level or system I owe, so that they become a customer that way. Like, so, so for instance, like, the thing could be a 37 or $27 in $14, like a lot of Alan's tannic students are making, you know, multi-million dollar low ticket files and they're using a $14.40 price. But I could be, we have to figure out who our avatar is on this one, but like, so for instance, it could be just one around, um, you know, here's like, just to get them hooked is that, you know, here's like, whatever, five years of winning Facebook ad formulas and actual ads that have helped me build to million dollar funnels. You could have this and even if it's five bucks, right? And then when they get that, say, you know, the thing that made it work, though, is a really good funnel software as well, besides the copy and everything. And so the next page, bump can be like, get all of our snapshots or templates, you know, here's some examples of some winning, you know, know, pages. I mean, that's what Anac Sentinel did. Like he at low ticket funnels. He's not the expert at it, but he just claimed ourselves a frickin' expert because he saw all the money in being a go-high level affiliate, right? So he bolted on front end to make a boatload of money on it. Like, there's sort of a joker down to 10x thing going. This guy never even made a million off of a lot things in funnel. Now he's like, but he's doing it. He's getting away with it. And of course, he's a great guy. He sells other stuff about information products. That's good. But uh, but anyways, so I was going around that angle, like, yeah. 00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You made me think of something now. So that's type of organization, that is what I've inserted into every company that has become a million dollar company that wasn't before I got there. 00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So how do we, and I'm not going to have the answer right now, and maybe you haven't, but how do you make that ? Because when I looked at it, my eyes glossed over little bit because I'm creative, right? 00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the results are what ? 00:23:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) The work is not . 00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's a saying that says something um, looks like work and dressed like overall success, something like that is success. Looks like work, dressed in overalls. I don't remember what it is. Hold on a second. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. 00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I love that quote. 00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that's the thing is I am not going to if you like sucking your thumb, we are not going to work. 00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) part together, right? If you're looking for passification, if you, I'm an I am a fast twitch explosive kind of person. 00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I cannot sit still for long. If you're and now I am also like, I used to think I was lazy because I was always looking for the shortcuts. I'm not lazy, but I get bored easily. And I want to do lots of things. And I want to feel that explosive energy. So I gamify everything. There is no faster, easier way to do and to grow than what I've created. Because if there were, I wouldn't go into companies and have their mind blown every time. just that is why it's a fundamental like a lever is the most basic kind of tool you have a fulcrum. like a rock and a plank and the lifting power is exponential based on the size of the lever. It is as simple as it gets. You still have to do the lifting. You don't have to get the pull from. You still have to get the lever. It still works. But the power that you can do once you understand the lever and you do it, is amazing. Let's imagine that this guy is like, I can't do this job because I got to hire five guys to lift this big old thing and Joe blow up over here and he's tiny. like, I got you $25 and he brings out a rock and a stick and he gets it done by himself. That's magical. He's blowing the mind of these early dudes and five of them do it and it was so much more expensive. That is the power of working smarter or harder. Everybody tells you to do it. Nobody tells you how to do it. This is how how you do it. So it isn't . The work isn't . The results are . So, you know, you have to decide if you want front or back, but you don't get both. 00:26:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Because if it's on the front, which means I don't do any work, you're not going to get big results. 00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not going to get big profits. You're not going to have a great company. You're not going on the front. You actually are smart and you do some of the work and you're organized and structured. Guess what you get on the back end? All this . 00:26:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And you get to keep it. 00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm not trying to convince somebody and try to sell them and let them hear what they want to hear. If you want to go buy a diet pill instead of go to the gym, I'm not a person. If you want to go buy a lottery ticket to make your money, I'm not your person. And I want to be very clear about that. Yeah. But what I will tell you is. I've got the best plan for the gym. And I literally, Maria, for real, I go to the gym, I spend about 15 minutes, I do a leg press, and I do this one movement overhead. But it works. of those movements get all of my core. 00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm sore from head to toe. My daughter went with me, she's like, that's crazy. 00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) My strength grows every week. I can lift more. only do it every couple of weeks. I have lost size. I don't eat less. I don't like, I'm not, you know, tiny or anything, but the power of that, and I found somebody else that explained it, but I have way less pain. I sleep better. I have more energy because I'm not exhausting myself going to the gym, building up cortisol. I still go to the gym. I'm just going to the gym way less and more powerfully than most people are doing. 00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's the same thing in business. 00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I'm doing. Project management like other people, but I'm precision about it and I'm getting the most out of the least every single time. So like, that's how you make it is that, you know, it is work, but it's the least amount of work that you can do to get the greatest amount of results. If you're not looking for great results, then this isn't for you. 00:28:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So, so, um, yeah, and essentially because if I look at my most successful companies, there's no doubt that at the beginning stages is because whether it be me or someone else, we had a really good project management or just more than that, everything you talked about because I remember I had base camp and even for every private client then that came to me, I actually put them on base camp and they had their separate workspace just for that, you know, um, so yeah. interesting, interesting. So I'm just trying to think and train of thought. And I might just have a bias that I need to remove. You know, the famous guy wrote the book Pay Yourself First, Profit First. 00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know that guy? 00:29:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Profit First, yes. He was a client. Yeah, he was a client of Emily Hershey's and there was another very famous guy like that in that same area too. Like a lot about like a little bit about what you're talking about too. And we never could get ads to work for them. Like it just wasn't at the beginning that to teach them that. lot of people were like, yeah, but I get it. So yeah, it's just not coming to me with that front end would be though what we call it and all that. But you're right. 00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Maybe we just 00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) need to do it a couple of times for some clients first. 00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I mean, we could call it a profit accelerator. It could be a business accelerator because accelerating is what it is, but it's also sustainable growth. So this is one of the biggest reasons I haven't created stuff because coming up with a hook is hard. That's where the longevity and the long play comes in, right? So people who are already familiar who just know, like this off, when you did a pocket CMO and COO, that created an immediate, there was an image that they could draw. They know what a CMO is, they know what a pocket is. They can imagine, I've got access, OK, that's actually really clear while still being incredibly ambiguous. Yeah, yeah. But they drew the picture in their own mind. So, using language that allows a person to fill in the blanks and draw the picture in their own mind is what we want to do, right? So, we want to allow them to draw the conclusions like, that's why we have words like blueprints and toolkits and accelerator that have been used in IM for, the beginning, blueprints gives you an instant thing, like, you know, like, that is the schematics, that is the line, that is everything top to bottom, you know, you like, I got to get work done, that's the thing, accelerator, all of these types of things, they, know what they mean, even if we don't know exactly the way that they would apply to work, and we don't even know that the person that's selling it actually. 00:32:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) actually has anything good. 00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is it a good toolbox or did you step from the dollar store? Like, you know, the power and the results are different. Is it a good blueprint or did you have a really bad architect and there are things missing and the measurements are off? assume that everything with those words are good. Yeah, that's what they were created for, but it doesn't. And so the value is a tied to that particular word less so than the actual product that's being sold. 00:32:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It does. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It does. can find that type of word for any of these offers that conjures up an image in a person's mind of the power. And by the way, it's a leverage power. So the leverage of a blueprint is clarity. know step by step what I have to do. leverage of a toolkit is is that when I have to put a name, into the wood. I know I have to do it, but how am I going to do it? I need the right tool, right? So that implies that I'll have what I need to accomplish the work. Accelerator means that it's going to go faster than it would if I didn't get this. It's an implied leverage to each of and they automatically kind of fill in the blanks of the value. 00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah. There's someone just message me that I know a little bit not super well, but pretty well from another group. She was there for the program. She just messaged me. This is include implementation of the marketing plan. I said no, but if I was consulting on it, as you implement it in team to hire and more, team is behind the scenes expert behind hugely names like that of scale, like Dan Meredith, and you can pop on a comment with me and Tina if you want. 00:33:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll just see what she was. But yeah, you would even say, don't know if they know him, but Ryan Moran of capitalism.com Yeah, 12 months to $1 million because I'll say that should name of capitalism.com. Yeah. He also has an event called Capcom every year. He gets Damon John. He gets lots of big people. 00:34:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) what's this book? 00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What's the book called? Pretty sure it's 12 months to him. Your first year, right? that. Yep, Ryan Moran, Ryan, Daniel Moran, 12 months to $1 million. Not that he bothered acknowledging me. 00:34:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And the fact that we put it in base camp. 00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, did all of that. And I was. 00:34:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where's. She said, I don't need marketing strategy. 00:34:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) For me, it's all about the integration at this point. Another word people call me is integrator When rocket fuel came out and that word came out that was like two people like you're an integrator. That's what you are Tina Is everybody likes labels? 00:35:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I Think because everyone knows me as marketing they're assuming it's marketing yet. 00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I thought the docket was pretty clear about Operations and team and stuff that is interesting Yeah, so then maybe giving a background of who I am and what I've done and that like if they've ever read Traction or rocket fuel that I am the integrator for several seven and eight-figure businesses or have been. Do I have it? 00:36:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, we'll see what she says. She's been planning with me for the last three months, so I don't know if she'll pull the trigger because I don't know what she's just shopping around and cheap, I'm just gonna say that. Because then when I say playing, I mean, asking me questions too in Facebook questions or before being paid a dollar for stuff, right? but that is a perfect example where I find that fascinating. And maybe we just need to get more you and I together on video, Tina, because it is like even the product boss, how do they really get to one million? besides my marketing strategy, I had them hire an integrator as their first hire, right? You know. Oh, because, yeah, that I just like, oh, sorry. 00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is what Matt said, um, just to make a correlation to things that people actually can know and do some research on. So he doesn't say share certain lives, but I get results. She came into our company when we were having some growing pains and needed help cleaning up our systems. that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month. Fast forward 12 months and we've increased our revenue 10 fold. Tina played a huge part and helping us do this. Robert released. took our ideas and visions and made them a reality. And we couldn't have grown this fast without her. Okay. So Matt, this is the partner of, oh, I'm not sharing that part of my screen. Sorry, stop sharing, share. Um, really not good. 00:37:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. What I can do is in the Google doc or if you want to, you can just put in some screenshots of more people, but this is all good feedback, by the way, right? To show, Hey, here's behind the scenes of these people, right? Um, I just know, um, like even Karina, how she got to me, she got disgusted with someone else. She paid 5k for. She didn't say the name. forget was, but this is like three, four years ago. She I bought it because included in her program was a, was a business plan. I really wanted the business plan, but the girls program didn't lead with that. The girls program was probably something like the 10k a month program, like it led with something like that. But the business plan was boiler template and she was so mad. And the coaches weren't the guru. It was $25 an hour. People she had hired, you know, so she was just like, ah, so, um, anywho, uh, yeah, um, I wonder. 00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Dan's always offering to share stuff for me, but he's also doing his own thing. So I don't know. I talked to my guy too, because they're business partners. Um, My guy is who got Dan Meredith to do, to even be recognizable at all. So I'm Dan's first coach that he ever hired. And then because we worked together, I introduced him to my guy who has, you know... 00:39:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hold on, I'm just want to make sure that Kat's not pinging so much. 00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) on. Okay. 00:39:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, it's okay. No, I think she must have just been playing with something, but you know when Kat kind of do the scratch, scratch, before they go pee? Yeah. So that's what I was worried so no I think she must have just been trying to get a spider or something in the corner. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That we might be able to get more. for eyeballs on it from a group that is familiar with me. 00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) what I do is what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also think maybe Friday, instead of a webinar and all that stuff, we're trying to figure out. Maybe it's you and I doing just a true podcast style interview. We're just talking to each other and I'll just say, Tina, why is having systems so important? And we just we have a little bit of a structure, but it's really just us talking saying, hey, we're doing this video because some of you may not know me or you, Tina, then we both share it with our audiences, something like that. Because my people, I think they're so used to me being, I'm just going to say, at low price and do stuff for them. 00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like remember the last offer was $2,000. 00:40:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'll create the whole front end. So I think they're having sticker shock, right? eight um so potentially because she hasn't um she said send me a link and i'll and i'd love to talk to you you too this is this on a girl amanda but uh amanda who hines hines she does wholesaling she's in my laurel portay seven dollar month ads group that i'm in um and uh so uh uh i'm definitely open to it send me a link to discuss and i can match it to my availability so um yeah i think i'll just have to send her a link to when you and i are available to to talk to us but uh i i don't want to fight from the business either oh i won't yeah so so it's like you know she's already trying to position herself you know i mean um so versus like i can just put up and nothing held back now like hey five hundred dollar run out of her one hour our strategy cash injection plan with me. So just to piece, you know, for the next week for casual, but I don't want to fight for her. Like, you know, she doesn't see the value. I'm not going to, you know, yeah. 00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I didn't even do like a one-on-one call. So here's the thing. What I would say is if you want to do a call with us, first you have to fill out the form. Okay, like I told you before, you don't get to talk to me unless you're qualified to talk to me. And if you aren't, if you need to be convinced, go convince yourself or I'll find somebody else, but I don't, you're not worried about you. 00:42:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:42:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Where I'm coming from is that all fairness, all these people don't know who you are, right? No, that's okay, but I'm saying for you too. Like, you don't need to be worried about them. So if they need to be sold on you, but for your time, like your one-on-one time, even... or like a sales call, look, before, because you don't want to sell somebody who's not qualified. 00:43:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, they just call it like, yeah, you know, she makes enough and all that. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in the same group, Laurel. That's why she wanted to hire me for ads because her low ticket funnel is really done well. She's done well and she sells a low ticket funnel on how to do wholesale real estate investing. And it's done really well. But she's still not the ideal perfect avatar, don't think, because the other ain't danger. 00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is a good conversation we're having because who we want to really help. 00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. The other day, just having someone who just started making money online and just, you know, started to have success with their funnel. So, they're going to be very, most of them, unless they've run real business before with people and stuff, they could be very, probably how you disrupt court and show. They could be very like, just like, yeah, you know what I mean? just, you know. Needy or cheap or whatever and so like you like like the perfect avatar and obviously he's a friend So he wouldn't do it right wouldn't make sense to be my friend Derby right who's run many companies He's in his early 50s or late 40s probably 50. Yeah, no, he's definitely was 50s. think but you know He's already made millions of dollars in the past. He's also lost it but he hasn't really Stuck with something he's a little bit like me So he wasted 25 grand on Russell Bronson's circle thing about two years ago Why did you buy that and then now he's struck it rich again because he's always striking rich He'll always keep trying stuff. He's making about 40,000 a month or recurring from his Airbnb He converted one of his apartment village in New Jersey It was like eight unit into Airbnb's and he's now making grants making 35 to 40 grand a from like 15 years ago doing SEO consulting for local businesses And he's still getting $500 checks from businesses from 12 years ago. So he has a funnel I created for him last year for it. And it was doing pretty good. But he got frazzled because he was trying to do everything. 00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Those are the perfect people that that's who needs me the most. Because I think I've experienced a little bit how quickly I can focus you. And so instead of like you, you still are thinking about other things, but you're staying in a lane and you're not letting it. So you're not doing the things at the cost of what's most important. That's generally what people do. And so I can literally just a text message, a boxer message, whatever, very short thing, get somebody anchored. So like my attorney's wife, my client who's an attorney hired me for his wife. And she is a nurse practitioner, but there's a business opportunity in community. and helping organize things and structure things. But she's never operated like this before. She is not native to America. She doesn't speak English, but it's not her native tongue. There's a lot of things that she's frustrated with, but she's very smart and she's very capable. And so she's had some issues that have kept her from doing the things that she needs to do. In simple text messages that took me five minutes to write, she shifted and shifted immediately and for the rest of the time. then so once a week I just text her, see how she's doing. She tells me the things that's stressing her out. give her a quick little, it's like an inspirational message. But it's tactical. It's like, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening. So now that you know it's happening and you're conscious of it, now you know why it's happening and you're conscious of it. Here's a strategy that should work according to what I know about your personality that you can implement. And then they get buy-in because they say... you're right, I will do X and now in a matter of minutes, something that because there was no clarity, they weren't conscious of it. They weren't clearly conscious of it. They weren't conscious of the cost to them or a tactic to stop the thing from happening. Yes, I can give that to people in minutes. So, you know, having a conversation about that, teaching people and that gets back to jeans, shorts, levels of awareness, right? What do you call that? don't know, but I know it exists and I know it can find it and I know it can be fulfilled. Yeah. Technically, I think that's what, like, so I've never called myself a business coach. Other people call me business coach. I hate it. I've said consultant, operation manager, project manager, like operations consultant, but I get called business coach. 00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) People just call me coach. Hey coach. Hey coach. 00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I need that yeah, and it's because you know, it's it's strategy. It's tactics but it's also look you need to do this you need to do that and and it's not a specific thing right it's business related so if you hire a soccer coach soccer coach might tell you how to eat might tell you how to think might tell you to get to bed on time I tell you it's a homework done so you're it's not in your head might tell you all kinds of things it has nothing to do with soccer per se yeah impact your game so the same thing with business coaching is you know but there are a lot of crowd people out there and there's not a lot that can do what I do and then there might be people who like well if she's so good why is she just doing this well because my priorities mom I'm serving the mission I'm going to school I'm not out here trying to get a yacht I'm just living my life and help you along the way so that's an uphill battle because people have scripts in their head about what people look like what successful people look like and that kind of thing. So anyway, that's all the stuff that we're dealing with. But once you start to get testimonials and come up with a particular name that has that word that conjures up something, right, like blue kit and blueprint, like toolkit, things like that. 00:49:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) if we get some names for that particular offer where they're like, this is what happened, this was amazing and they tell them Yeah, like really, when you think about it, and it might just be people just need more exposure as well. It's sort of a bit like the strategic coach. I think I mentioned that guy to you before. He's in Canada and like Scott Alford hires him, like a lot of people work at steel hires him. Let me see, like a lot people already making a lot of money, know, or , got to hire this guy because I don't have a life after I've, you know, done. I'm so well in my business, so let's see all these things, or if anything to Dan Sullivan, that's it, that's just a DJ coach, this guy, I mean they don't go in implement for people, like they're like, yeah, you know, Dan Sullivan, as in like the class, like the marketer and copywriter, like that's been around for decades business. He's picture of this guy. 00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know what he looks like, but yeah, no, no, I'm sharing screen right now. 00:50:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I know, I still don't know what Dan Sullivan looks like. Oh, got you got you got it. 00:50:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, but yeah, he's on par with Dan Kennedy and a lot of ways in terms of like how long he's been around and, and yeah, so. Business strategy is definitely a huge part of what I offer and do But I don't have a brand and I don't have you know a pedigree. 00:51:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So You're also not paying his prices. We have results. We have the results. Yeah, okay, so Other than that where were we so And that's just one person, right? 00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's plenty of other people that I just said the Google Doc too So I'm interested in in talking to Neil and seeing I mean I don't know what or your forum stuff and I don't know how he organizes his business. So I Don't know enough, but I know that he knows a lot about business I know he knows a lot about the market. So if he's interested in it, I would imagine there's I Know some need not being met for him and I'd be curious what what sparked his curiosity in it. 00:51:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hmm. 00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And one of the other conversations to start having is, like, raise your hand if you've heard of rocket fuel and raise your hand if you've heard of an integrator, like, has anybody looked at that go? I wish I had an integrator. Well, that's what Tina is, and that type of thing, because again, it's a correlation to something that they already have a definition for in their head, and they've already attached a value to it if they're familiar with it. So, by translation, by saying this integrator thing that you've already got, and it's established about saying she's that, and she's been doing it for these companies to go, oh, wait a minute, okay, I could have access to that, like, and Maria's standing, like, working with her, so Maria must think that that's useful and good. You could even tell any, like, if you have anything to share about anything that you feel like I brought value to you for, like, you will imagine. And we were just talking we weren't even like I didn't hire anything, but just in talking Yeah, I felt this did this and this is how I feel about it now and because not everything is going to be a like it's going to be an indirect financial game, so We had a conversation about your center and your values and I didn't say anything about Karina, but you Took what was said and you knew like this is where I'm stuck right now I'm not doing what I should be doing and I need to make a change. didn't know that I you knew that but I Facilitated a thought in your head that made that happen with clarity for you and then you went and did that and and that's the type of thing It's very difficult to explain how that happens unless you've had the experience. Yeah, yeah-hmm But you've been on fire since you let that weight go 00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, I know, I know, it gets down a little bit because that later I had to finish that 2K Final Four, which still burns me because she paid the 2K on Thursday and Friday and so Karina got like 1200 of the 2K and the next day Karina's like, I don't think this partnership is working, you know. I met with her today to go over her customer journey and everything, hey, this is almost done. She, so this is digital products, right, think she's going to do really well because she does well on Etsy selling some of these digital planners for co-parenting custody and productivity for months. And then she goes, well, no, I'm going to buy Karina's $5,000 one-on-one coaching site because I want to stick with, I want to also grow my e-com store because I started with her. I'm just like, oh, . She's never going to make that back. She's been with Karina for over six months and she's only broken even, you know. 00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I their lessons. 00:54:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) had to learn yours. That's true. theirs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I was just like, I really was shocked because, um, yeah, I, like, because she thought I could run her traffic for her for like really cheap, she goes, oh, next week we start traffic for this. So wait, that's not not in scope for the 2K, you know, and so I, I was just like, if you want that, I could still honor the traffic package I offered a while ago for, for people if it was just one campaign and managing the ad spend is $1,000 a month, which is like it should be like 3K month. 00:55:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) so anyway, uh, your effective hourly rate should never be less than 500. You, Maria specifically, know, shouldn't be less than 500. So I need you to engrade that, engrain that in your head, um, because that's the result you get. So if somebody is not qualified to pay that or doesn't want to pay that, that conversation can end very quickly and it's okay. 00:55:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yes. Well, exactly. And I think the issue has been because I've been around Crena's crowd, right? These are all people who who just barely can make paying the shop if I'm not paying You know what you should do is you should write a pedigree post. 00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is my history. This is who I am. This is what I've done. And for a little while I've been playing small. You don't have to say anything about it. Now this is not to say I don't believe in low ticket funnels. I do. I think that there's a lot of value in it, but because I think because I've seen them grow you know million dollar per year or whatever businesses, but I want to be very clear that I am not a low ticket person. This is the value. This is what I bring to the table. And somehow sometimes people make a correlation between the low price of an offer and the low price of time with me and let me make sure that you understand that they're not the same thing. 00:56:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I love that. Because it's not your results speak for themselves. 00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah and it's maybe or even rethink having the school group as free like I'm tempted just to put a you know whether five buck a month or 47 bucks a month on it right now because I notice it's attracting a lot of people as well that are uh do you want to do you want to turn that into something we do together we can split the school price and just start go let's go create let's start having conversations in there every week um we can have a couple every week if you want to and just go like gangbusters on learning them but them learning us because there's no way we start talking and people show up and they're not going to get that really smart I went to traffic conversions one time and Richard Linder was not a partner yet and he was teaching email stuff and I'd been managing email list for a while and I knew a lot about deliverability and sender score this was 13 years ago almost 12 years ago people didn't know this then um but I did because our emails weren't getting through and I needed to figure out why because that was costing us a lot of money and I don't like losing money. By the way, while getting paid $15 an hour to turn a company into a million dollar company and going bankrupt while getting divorced, like I got some issues. Anyway, so I kept asking questions and he's like, you're really smart, aren't you? then I walked out of that room and I could hear people pointing at me whispering about how smart I was in digital marketing. So this isn't about arrogance, it's a point like I stand out even in crowds of smart people. There are a few that I get around and I'm just like, they're their brilliance and I see that they do a lot of what I do but they're also very quiet. They're not out there doing big things like big things publicly privately. There is many like eight figures, seven, eight and nine figure businesses and they're the masterminds behind it that nobody knows about. But when you hear them talk, you know, yeah, you're like that, but you've been, you focus on the marketing so much. But when you talk about strategy, people are like, holy crap, every single time, but yeah, well, that's why Emily hers hired me to be the strategy director. Yeah, like it was I never heard of her until one of my clients hired her, but then they went back and because they undid everything she did because ultimately it didn't work for them. 00:59:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, she was I don't know if she's changed now, but back then she was pretty bad. 00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like it was like two years ago. 00:59:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, really? Oh, well, then it's just she grew too fast and like some of the ads managers are really good. So it's maybe some bad. But yeah, for her, basically, then a strategy director, I would be helping like not helping that be crafting the strategy for Amy Porterfield, Mary Forley, I look at Gabby Burstein, those were her clients, right? 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know that. 01:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think she still has those clients. 01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She kept in the referral because she started. you that's, that should be part of your, like your pedigree. 01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Seriously, Maria, just spend like the next week riding down the, the who's who, the stories, the money, the whatever. That should be a whole thing. Because the next time somebody is like, well, you know, it'd be like, hold on, go take a read down and then make it done. 01:00:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I think that's good. So, and, and then, so, yes, a member I suggested maybe we just share school group. So I think the freebie group, even though they say that's good, was like having a free Facebook group, because school, the nature of school, you're getting a lot of people who just want to spam others. We always have to keep spam. if we make it 10 bucks a month or five bucks a month, it'll keep those people out and it could become like a newsletter alternative. 01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Or we decided. So that was one of the things I was thinking about with the community. is rather than email because you also can email, but only like once a week or three times a week, something like that. I don't remember. Once a day school, you can't. So if you do a post, you can email that out. It will send an email notification to people, but there's a limitation to three days. Okay. Yeah. So that's fine. But either way, putting out content like that, right? So rather than not instead of email, but in addition to for people who don't necessarily want email, but they like the groups and they like socializing. But yeah, yeah, yeah. 01:01:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So what do you think? We could always just keep increasing it every month, maybe five bucks for this month, 10 bucks next month, 15 next month, or do you think we just go right to 27 a month? 01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, we could just go with the dollar. So we keep people there and then say, okay, month, and let's go just add value. 01:01:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So we immediately stop the spammers because you have to put in a credit card, right? Correct. Yeah, they affiliate markers and I'm I'm pretty sure we should be able to convert a free school community into a paid Yeah, you can you can and obviously we can we can just call this digital marketing or something like we don't I again. I never claimed the URL because we could change it whatever we want so Yeah Well that guy looks good and I don't let in people they don't have Anything you know what I mean and I'm almost almost tempted to not like guys in anymore Cuz all the free onboarding calls I've had that I stopped now the good ones were with the females But the guys just said just want to pure like what about this? about this? about this here? 01:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know, it wasn't enjoyable the energy was different Maybe just a business acceleration because it's not just marketing. We're going to be talking about everything business acceleration strategies or Something like that 01:03:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, looks like we can do that. 01:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yep. 01:03:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I'm making a buck right now. 01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Five bucks, 10 bucks, whatever you feel like just. So people that don't pay it. I don't know how that works. Like, do they get to stay? 01:03:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I don't know what happens, but. No, they all get grandfathered in. 01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Okay. 01:03:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, so if you do month and annually. they do five bucks a month for the year, usually five months. Five times five is 55, 55 for the year. 8%. 01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Just can't wait. Five times too long. Yeah, because otherwise it'd be 65. 01:03:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Whoa. 01:03:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So instead of 55, it's not making a 40. I just want to make it five months worth. Five bucks gets seven months free. But how do I. . Oh, that's. Yeah. All right. I think it just means that these people are free and the rest have to pay five bucks, I think. 01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Anybody else? 01:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anybody now? Yeah. So let's just go incognito and I have a call in five minutes. Is there anything else that you want to cover before I jump off the call? 01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. So if we're going to do that together, you can make me an admin. If you want, you can build me for half of the thing. Like, let's talk about the details and whatever, how, you want to do it. We can talk about branding and strategy. 01:04:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) know I'm $25 a month. 01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yep. then I think let's, let's build out a scale of like what is going to be next month and through the end of the year and just I don't know. Like, I think that would be a good plan. Oh, that's my love. I want to get him. 01:04:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) All right. 01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, catch up. 01:04:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) We'll catch up soon because he's like, oh, I love it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah, I'm Zoom now. 00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hi. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, there. That's funny. On Boxer. dog is barking her face off. 00:00:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No worries. 00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh my gosh, man. It's, but I'm not like burnt out or I'm like, I'm frustrated that I'm not keeping on top of everything, but only slightly because you know how much I put on my plate and I'm here to juggle it. So it's basically like drop the ball, pick it back up. 00:00:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's go. Oh, God, that's funny. 00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love though that you are like coming back to remember who you are and your power. And like, how did Joe, like, obviously you were putting things out and she was following you and I know that the bigger answer is divinity, just like God knows, God knows, he's like, okay, you're ready to step into everything. So is this person, you guys are perfect, I'm gonna put you together. 00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, she, I thought that about that this morning, how did she find me, right? Because, because when she first got on the call, I asked, hey, know, so what cause you have to call now? she said, well, originally she found me through, I'm part of Laurel Portay, $7 month marketing Facebook group. She teaches how to do face $5 ad, ad Facebook ads and video funnels. And so I was reporting some wins in there and stuff, because you know, the whole thing, right? When you're in other people's paid memberships and you start sharing success stories, people start paying attention. to you. So she reached out to me a few months back to actually have me run her ads for her because she was having issues with marketing agencies, which by the way is a red flag though. She said she's been through six marketing agencies. I get to recording. Anyway, so anyway, she then was interested to speak to me that her mom had a stroke. Her mom's okay now in recuperating, but her mom had a stroke. So I guess in the meantime, they found those two other when she got on the call yesterday to me, she says, in the meantime, the last three months, there were two ladies that actually went through our program breastfeeding and loves our program, and they're actually Facebook ad marketers living in Australia. So honestly, that is a better fit for her anyway, because I don't want to be full implementation anymore, right? That's what got really trouble. So I think it's great that she has that. So but she changed her scope during the call for yesterday, just so you know, because of the beginning. 00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll tell you what my red flags were. 00:03:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) after we talk, but yeah. So because at the beginning, when she said, so I feel I think I have the marketing agency and the Facebook ads issues down now, because she said she's always having issues with her Facebook ad account every time they try to scale more than $3,000 a day. By the way, anybody would. So since she's not, that's not abnormal, especially now getting an election year, there's no way I want to be hired by her to prove myself for the next two months. That you're asking for failure that way. But she did say, I always like to have a backup in mind, just in case, but where I think you can help me is I have a Facebook group, like our funnel is an e-book and then drive into the Facebook group and then we sell our course, right? stuff, but maybe it's the niche. I said, you know what, you might be right, it might be the niche, if someone's pregnant or trying to breastfeed after they've had the baby, they probably don't have time to spend in a Facebook group. She said we just I don't feel we've monetized it that well, you know, and so and she might be true We won't know till we do an audit, but in my mind, I'm thinking sell yoga for pregnant pregnant mothers Like there's so many other side things to sell them And then she was like then we also have a reseller program like we train them and certify them in our breastfeeding methodology We have 100 people train and I failed on training them how to get clients So I need someone to put together like almost a franchise in a box or like a marketing Material for them so they could be more successful and then everyone grows that way So that's how the call initially went that I was going to help with The reseller marketing materials for that now I gonna maybe do a quote for that and then second the I said well, I think you're leaving a lot of money on the table by not having a life cycle Of things to sell them because you know, there's I didn't say though You know good for pregnant one, but I said even after they've had their baby and they're one hundred, two or three years old, like, there's so many other things you could sell to them like about parenting and stuff. Like I just see so much your potential for your list. She did then talk about the Hillary swank stuff. And then she got really excited about that. And she said, yeah, we want to raise $5 million for this and want to share and stuff. And she did say she would pay a retainer, pay money upfront first, and then also share in the back end. So there was never a thing about work for free at first. But I'm okay to audit her stuff and everything because then everything was so big. I said, well, I think the offer with me and Tina is going to be perfect for you because we first will sit down for two hours to analyze everything to help with the growth plan. But then I'm like, well, let me get you on. And then you loved it too. Like you loved what she's all about. it was more than she really switched to the $5 million right away. That's where she made the switch and not talk about at all. And when she says she's got her marketing agency already. In place, she does it. They're just the Facebook ads agency. 00:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So unless she thinks marketing is just Facebook ads, you know? So here's two main things that I heard. And I'm OK with getting big on energy, but you should know I don't get sold easily. Even if it sounds like I'm getting sold. I'm also not excited about big names or anything like that. I don't fangirl. I don't I don't hear a worship or anything like that. I do check off of people's energy, but it's in check. So I asked her about her profit margins and $2.6 million and they only kept $600,000. I don't know if that's how much she made, but I would either way. That's terrible, terrible, terrible, managed. And the other thing was I have to think about this for a minute because I just had it in my mind and then I forgot. That was, oh yeah, and she said something about, because I don't, she, and it was while, you know, all the cross chatter was happening, and we're talking about, you know, her, when she switched to wanting to focus on that, because she's like, because I don't really have money to be paying for that right now, but simultaneously saying, I'm happy to pay. there are incongruencies that have to be defined, which is why I'm like, okay, so what I think that you and I should do is go through that, I'm going to come up with a pitch that 100% is we're getting paid for our time, and that time is going to be minimal, she can use her team to implement it, and she can take it or leave it, we don't need her, there will be more other people, it's the other way around, people need us way more, but what it gives us an exercise of being able to go through and break down everything together. and come up with plans and also to make sure that we keep each other in check remembering who we are at what we do. And we go into a business with a certain set of parameters with a person. The classic visionary is all over the board. They're very bad at managing their business, but they're not all so bad. Right. So the other thing is we have to, when we create a plan, there has to be a test period and there has to be, okay, do you do what you say you will do? And do you do what we say you need to do? If those are not true, we immediately cease working business together and we let them know that that's what happened. This is a trial period. We're trying you on. You're welcome to try us on, but just be clear. This is not a favor situation. You're not bringing something to us that we can't go get for ourselves just because we're open right now doesn't mean that it's because because we can't get this. You're not the first person to offer something like this. Like I told her, if Amanda said it, I flat out would have said no from the beginning. I'm only willing to explore it because I want to see what there is. But her language and behavior was just as all over the place and they drink their own kool-aid like all the guys have. 00:09:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So those were those were my red flags. Yeah, well, I loved how you did say, hey, look, we have things to pay for. have other people to pay for. have our lives. So we can't just do charity work. 00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You didn't say those exact words, but you made it loud and clear that we have to get compensated some way somehow. 00:09:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yep. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) we didn't plan that conversation. And I was just like, okay, I'm going to be me and we're going to find out if this is okay or not. But It wasn't a way to really tactically ask you and make sure it was okay, but that's that's how I show up. I'm just It's the way that we have been it's like everything's out on the table. Um, let's be clear with the positioning from the beginning We don't do charity work. This is not a favor to us You don't get our time and what time you do get is going to be minimal and you're going to pay very well for it that part I didn't say but Yeah, but that's that's that's how it's going to be and because maria We barely just set out and like a clarity sign and signal to god to the universe Yeah, what's already starting to happen. So all we have to do is remember that there are finite yeses You can only say yes to so many things and if you are busy with what you said yes to And the greatest yes of all comes along the thing that you really want to do and you're too full to say yes to it then you have to say no. So give out the nose plantively and the yeses very reservedly. 00:11:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah and that's sort of why I haven't just slapped up an offer that is a insanely good deal at the 2k dump or your lower ticket because I know then like that'll fill any growth. 00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm so glad that like you know because I when I was watching I was just the the last the first few months you know after um Dan had said something about you and I was watching I'm like uh I don't think that she is like leveraging herself at all and I yeah but but I see but I see you like I know what you're capable of I could tell because of what you were saying yeah you as some people can fake that but not really um not the way that you did it and not kind of responses that you got and so I knew I knew that you could get really powerful results but I also could see Your model was not leveraged. And so anyway, I'm just really glad that you're not doing that right now. Cause you, we can get you something quick and powerful. 00:12:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. And so that's why, like right now I'm going to go, I'm going to see this there. I'm going to way back machine. a while ago, I looked at it, one of my original websites from 2010, like literally there's stuff on there. I'm sure that I can repurpose into rigodalas.com thing, right? So, cause it's just, it's needed, you know, um, there's, yeah. Cause yeah, at the bottom, I have these logos, like price, what else? Cooper is Deloitte fusion.io computer sciences core, Lockheed Martin, you know, cable, transit system, like all these companies that I used to work with back in the day, you know, so I need people to, whoops, what's that? Oh, that's my site. me close that the way back machine. Like I shut the way back machine down, but anyways, so, yeah. So, so my long story short, I think it was good though, because at least it's worth it. a little bit that that's happening because she makes over two million and she reached out. 00:13:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:13:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, so, yeah, so where do we go from here? You were saying write out that pedigree post and then post it like tomorrow because today I'm going to post the success story I had with Joann, like I had a $500 call with her a couple of weeks, so I'm not going to say she paid $500. But she made like 4,000 in like three, four days, like from just the stuff I told her to do in the next seven days. 00:13:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. What'd you tell her to do? 00:13:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, she had a list of 700 people, low ticket buyers, and she was just saying I'm not really making enough money to survive long-term. I, you know, like she's making like me for $7,000 a month. I said, okay, well, you're missing an assumption. Something to listen to that's more scalable. You have all these low ticket, you know, social media templates you give to. your wellness coaches. That's her target market. Lovely gal. And I said, so here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do a seven day launch starting today. You're gonna three days of emails that are pre teaser emails. She's never really emailed her list. So I fixed her email deliverability on the call. I had her share screen and we got into her email and I created a bunch of text to put at the bottom of each email because that gets you through. She's going to the Google promo folder and now she's created like the mini launch like three days of teasers. I told her the first day is going to be, you know, a subject line test and just telling something big is coming, you know, and ask them, ask them a question ham testing out whether I should offer this. of you have asked me to teach you more about how I balance it all, being a mom and also being a wellness coach. If I get enough yeses, then I'll create the course on it. And then of course you've got yeses. And then the next day I said, okay, next day, gonna be a story post, you know, just story about you because you're not nurturing your list. Then the third day is going to be, oh my God, I got so many yeses that we're launching. going to be tomorrow and it's going to be a beta opportunity. It's going to be 997 when it launches the public. But because I'll be creating the course with you based on what your needs are and because you told me it's going to be this is this, it's going to be for only $297. Stay tuned for it to launch tomorrow at $12. Then there are five days of sales emails and I went with her. This is all during the call. This all happened. I went with her on to JatchyBT, can't let's write the sales page right now. You just modify it, make it better. But here it is and so she basically did that. And the best thing is she now has an asset that she can make money. I'm coining the term kind of everlasting earnings lately. I'm using, I'm not coining is not the right word, but I'm using, I like that term. So I said, hey, she's got everlasting earnings now because now she's created an asset that she got paid to create and once it's done, she can sell this every single month and scale it and increase it to $997 and she'll, and I told her this is your million dollar funnel. Keep selling your your low ticket stuffs working and very few people get that right So the fact that you're you know, but getting buyers to for your little, you know, whatever 17 or $27 Social media templates for wellness coaches keep that going and then keep selling this upsell and there you have it And if you want you can get into a high ticket coaching one-on-one with people if they want something for 10k But so that's what I did for him. She's praising me through the rooftop She's bragging about me in Allen's group because she's an Allen's 500 a month thing And she says Maria whatever you want me to tell people just once you make a post all I will go in and say anything All the you want just and I'll do a video for you or you can interview me on a video So I'm interviewing her next Monday or Tuesday. 00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's said she's available. So yeah, I Love that. just highlighted it. 00:16:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you have All of that written down because you basically made a playbook Um, you know what I don't have all that written down about the playbook, but I do you have a social post down and I can share that with you right now? 00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me get to googly googly drive. What we need to do is really organize and spend some time doing it and then make some assignments and some due dates with each other about certain things that we need to create. Let me let me go into Trello. We're going to start right now. 00:17:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And I have just so you know you have a call in 20 minutes right? Yeah and just so you know one other quick thing. I actually have the sales copy because I wrote it to my asset. I created for Karina you know what's going to be really good to sell in this funnel 5k and 7 days information product. And what it was is just the plan. was the I told her create this Google sheet of all the steps that you do that that can help someone who truly does your methodology, make 5k and 7 days, write them all down in here so that they have a plan that they know what to do daily for the next 7 days. And I made the sales copy for the actual page. So honestly, it wouldn't take much for me to recreate that for myself, but obviously for coaches, right? if that is helpful to tell you. 00:18:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm distracted creating like I was trying to create a place to organize the data and then like the last couple sentences I spaced out while I was thinking about it. 00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm so sorry. Oh, sorry, no worries. if you've clicked that Google Doc, that's the social post I was going to make and I might modify it a little bit, but Joanne's already reviewed it. She's fine with me posting it and she's actually saying she actually made more, she made 5k, not so this actually would change to 5k. So what I'm saying is because I created for Karina, I said, we need to add this in the funnel to increase the average order value for her e-com funnel. I said, we're going to create a 5k and 7 days product. So what I said is that I actually have pretty decent sales coffee for, but obviously not for e-com but for coaches, like just basically what I'm excited about. I'm actually doing for me what I did for other clients that they're now making money for that they should be paying me half of. 00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I just got an idea. I have zero filters. don't know where it came from. Oh, okay, sorry. Say stuff like that. And sometimes I feel something. So I feel like it's inspired, but a lot of times that means there might be modification needed anyway. I just talk to the preamble. But I was like, what if we do through the end of the year sprint, roughly 90 days sprint? it is, but it's more towards those mid level, like low level, mid level. And it's six 97 and it's 697 paid up front or 997 and whatever the whole whatever 1000. So 700 or 1000. I don't care what I am pricing a user or not. And they can have three payments if they want to do it that way. Because I think what we really need to do is while we're creating our own structure, we also need to be making money. I'm building people who can testify for us. They are amazing. They know what they're doing. it will also give us some give back stuff. I think it's a super easy offer. don't think it takes a high level person to be able to pay that amount. And so what would be the outcome? The outcome is that you should have a very clear offer. You should have a very clear marketing strategy. You should know what your numbers are. We will sit there. I'll I'll spend the time. We'll take the time with. Whoever, if we sell 100 people or if we sell 200 people, which is shooting crazy high for that amount of money, that would be, if we did 100 people, it would be $697,000. So we don't need that many people, 50 people would be amazing. And 50 people, the two of us could serve really well. Even in a group setting, it can be weekly calls, but basically homework assignments, and we will personally, you and I, pour over them, will be busy for the next 90 days. But we can still choose our time, especially if we're not making it phone call dependent. But it's more like, get us your data dependent, we can require that they send us an audio or video that gives us all the information so that in addition to the text information they give us, we can also kind of pick up on their energy and their confidence because it's hard to get that. We for sure should have like one or two calls a week. And, but the goal is you come out of it with, like I said, a solid offer, a solid marketing plan based off of your existing traffic and assets plus amplified like an amplified accelerator plan as to like how, how you could grow that. And then the goal would be for them that they get their money back, you know, within the 90 days after the first 90 days, but obviously we can't guarantee that, but we want to tell them that's the target. But, but the other thing is that we're helping them try to create an evergreen offer that should be paying them that amount and more month after month after month times times 10, whatever. But if we did that, then we wouldn't have to worry too much about the big fish that really we have to. The thing about the big clients is that it's very taxing mentally because you have to perform quickly fast. We could still offer the upgraded power plan, maybe, and we could possibly tweak it if somebody's like, we want one on one time, and we want the Vauxure access. I don't think the 697 people get Vauxure access, and you could talk about, and both of us could talk about some of the things that we've covered in just being able to have voice chat with people. Like, for example, I've had my $2,000, $4,000 a month client miss a call, know, one week, and they never, first of all, tried to get their money back. They never forced, like, we have to get another call because I just send them quick messages and they're like, I don't feel like I lost anything because of how great the talking is. 00:23:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So you took it at 697 one time payment or 697 a month? 00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No one time. Like, I said no brainer deal, but seriously, you do the math on that? 00:23:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) kind of consistency and made revenue who just is in same kind of person really there in the launch cycle, but they don't have to have net the same threshold for earnings. So maybe they've never even broken, you know, $2,000 a month. And for sure they can't go broke doing this, but $697 unless you're absolutely destitute shouldn't break you. 00:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what they're going to get is we will guarantee that we will personally look at all of their information and personally give them a plan, even if it's we deliver it through email, like it's not going to be given to anybody else, not delegated to anybody else. And they will get 30 year veterans on their business. You can't get that for that price anywhere else. 00:25:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, so I'm just typing in that. So similar to the offer we made but just less handholding. 00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah but it's really not less time like it's it's going to be more time for us but it's spread across a lot more people but what comes out of it though is way more testimonials that we can use for more marketing plus we will get to refine our plan. We could turn that into a do it yourself kind of program for like $9.97 for people once we've done it over and over again and then we could just literally we could just do that for a year but what will happen is bigger people will come and say how do I get you in my business. I won't be like well let's see if you're qualified. 00:26:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah yeah there's um I was looking at um this company here let me see if I found her on. I think she was a colleague of your client, she shoot. Come on, come on, come on, darn it. Let me go to Instagram, see if is still up. I was looking up, Dan Meredith was one of his co-workers or something. 00:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Leanne? 00:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Her brand is Strategy Co. Strategy Co. Dan Meredith is doing some events with her, and I looked at this page. Oh, that's kind of not, oh no, that's not it. 00:27:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Was that the one with the IDFS or something? 00:27:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I just like her page identified three areas you could be in. Dan Meredith. That's him, right? So I was looking up because, know, you I know of him, but I haven't really followed him and and stuff. So I thought that's cool here. How he talks about what he's done and all that stuff, right? And then I went down. 00:28:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He thanked me in this first book. 00:28:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, nice. Maybe it was this peak fest. A friend, no, Francesca here. Ah, now maybe I can't find it, but, uh, ideas, Lisa John. 00:28:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) sends us like a family gets basket too. 00:28:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, this is that strategical. So then I went to their site. Right. Um, because really, I just liked how we teach business strategies simply. kind of thought, this was kind of nice. she's got the Academy for online businesses and then she even got it CBD certified. So I actually looked at what that is and the get your digital e-learning CBD certified so they can get credits for it. Then they got the Growth Academy and then they have the Agency, Access to Online Business Experts offering a done freezer. 00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So she's got three levels here. 00:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I really like that because I thought, know, I don't like the color so much, the lime green, but it is what it is. But anyway, but I just thought that was kind of cool. And you they have a free challenge, get it started. So anyways, I just thought it was kind of interesting because what you're talking about, the 697 offer is probably more to, yeah, just like little beginners, right? Let's see what she's got here launching 2021 launching today. Is that all? This is not only one week, one week. Ultra Build, Scissors Events, Gamification, Uber, Offer Page, Cardboard, Mark. 00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I think she's describing what it was like to launch 2021. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you want to elevate your launches? not become a certified launch? Okay, so now she's offering, uh, to certify people as a launch manager, that's, I used to do a social media certification course ages ago, that's easy money. 00:30:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) thought about and wanting to do, um, uh, operation certification, but my way, like streamlines and, um, yeah, I don't know all of this kind of bigger than, than I really want to do. I, I don't know, I think a good portion of my life is going to just be spent serving and ministering. I'm basically getting to the point where my money makes my money, like, yeah, in business, so that it does that and then go wherever God calls me. Like there's a reason he has me getting a psychology degree. Um, I, there's, there's so many things that are happening and I don't know what they are. So like I don't have a 10, 15, 20 year vision of being, doing this type of stuff in business. I know it will always be that the, the business. and leadership specifically in business is a huge part of what I'm doing, but for right now, this is a for right now kind of thing. 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I don't. 00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't. Yeah. And I think that's part of why I hesitate to go and create content and create a particular brand and whatnot is because God is still shaping me and I don't even know what it's for. But I know where I can serve now and I know what my responsibilities are now and they require money and I know that I can serve that really well. So like behind the scenes has always worked really well for me because I can just serve and not worry and overthink that and get people amazing results. I prefer that to be for people who already get amazing results and know what their mission is and their mission is pretty much their life. my lifelong mission, Maria, is just it's to teach people about God who he is, his love, make sure that they know who they are. are and make sure that they live and fulfill their greatest potential in this earth and during this and that's not really business but it businesses the vehicle yeah anyway um yeah so okay but we still have a clock right now where you got to get something out that's making some money so now um there is always the first things first and I don't know what what point money starts to be stressful and how much you need to make like this week or next week or three weeks from now but I would like to know that and know that we're on track with making that for you but in that also I think that one of the most powerful things you can do is the history it's really a chunk like paragraph of each thing but with some bullet points and this is what it was like before I got there, this is what it became, this is how much money it made. And this is how it's continued after I left my influence, that type of thing. 00:33:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So yeah, so yeah, let me work on that. Like if I post this thing today that I sent you the Google link for from Joanne, and then tomorrow I'll do, yeah, I think that's a great idea to do the pedigree post, and I'll send you a link over to it before I post it and all that jazz. I think a fast path to cash though right now though, is for me to put up a $500, 100, one hour with me book a call, like I already have it with Calendy and PayPal, that they go there, it's five in a bucks, and I call it the seven day cash injection sprint. And if I post that in nothing held back, Alan's group, because I have so much edification, like Alan even edified me two days ago on one of his posts in the group. I'm pretty sure people will grab that up, and that 500 can be the foot in the door to bring in. into you know other things. 00:34:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There you go. 00:34:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:34:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That would be amazing. I just want to know that like you've got you've got some things. I just I just want you I just want to make sure I don't know if you're stressed out because you don't really talk about it but like I know what the ticking clock feels like and I'm just really cognizant of that. 00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah yeah no I'm not really I'll be stressed out in month if nothing comes in right like I'm not here's the thing I know I'm building something bigger because I'm saying no to quick cash that is not right because the path I've been on the last two years is saying yes to cash that I thought was good but clearly it's not like every asset I'm learning every asset that I've built for Karina has is now useless to me whereas it should have been amazing. million dollar asset and it will be for her now. Like she's got all like we're not talking to one sales page or one funnel. Like I've built at least three low ticket funnels with the sales pages with everything, even the VSL script for her what to say that are converting, right? She just overspent her money so she can't spend money on Facebook ads, but they were unicorn funnels like like self liquidating funnels that anyone would kill to have. So I know that now everything I told her to do or even product boss for that matter and stuff now just needs to be for me for my business, right? That's why it's like, oh yeah, why don't I have a 5k and 7 days product? Why don't I have a from a hot mess to million dollar success, you know, master class that I sell for 27 because that was a downsell I told Krina to create. all these things I feel good now that I'm doing, but that's why I'm not launching a 2k done for you, loading a funnel. a $500 one hour thing. But I'm purposely saying no to stuff like that lady yesterday while we were talking on the call, not not the Australian lady. But remember you and I were earlier on the call and that one lady, her name was Amanda Hines, how she wanted to get the offer. But she thought we were implementing the actual working thing. Yeah, yeah. Like for $6,000, are you kidding me? We're gonna actually like, so it's like, I'm sick of the bottom beaters. And you know, and if I have to, I'll get a loan to withstand the next, you know, month so that what I do launch, you know, is more about me because, or if I ever were to do a deal like that with Krena again, or you and I together, deal like that with a person like Krena, guess where the funnels are going and our accounts. if they think the partnership along working, then okay, great. These are our assets, our funnels. We'll just keep running as well. We'll find some other person to TGCOM, you know, like, I mean, I mean, I'm not a boutique person, but I've had better success in her and more testimonials than her with my income accelerator course that I launched four years ago. And I just taught pure branding and maybe some drop shipping, but it was really more building brand and slapping your label on it from some stuff that you create from American or Chinese people and storing it here and selling it. So, you know, I've attempted to do that sometimes too, but, you know, I don't know if that's in my, like God, in my spirit to do because I think deep down, I firmly believe it's harder for someone who's new and start to make money online to start with an e-com store. think deep down, even though there's a lot of money in it and teaching it, I think deep down, they can make more money as a VA if someone's, you know, yeah, or sell a service or create an e-book as well. I think the hybrid, ultimate hybrid business model for people who are New or even people who have money who are retiring and need site house of money is a hybrid where they consult or do a service. And then they also have a digital product. They're creating that the money from the cash flow of the consulting and service is financing the more almost passive income of the low ticket or mid ticket products like Graham Cochrane. He just runs a YouTube channel to a $500 course how to create a digital course and he's created a multi million dollar business. 00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's storyteller one. 00:38:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I don't think he's a storyteller. 00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, that name from something. 00:38:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He just published a book recently, think his first book and he's the real boy. I actually bought his course. It's decent like, you know, Graham as a podcast as well. That's funny. He's he's publishing himself as an author now, right? 00:38:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He just became an offer maybe a year ago with that book, but he's been around forever. 00:38:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He's got 66,000 followers on YouTube here. 00:38:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We could do a podcast because we can talk and then I don't have to be on video. 00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You have to go. 00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It should be tomorrow. I've got, I've got, I'm going to send you an email or a box or something. Um, now that I know you have a little tiny bit of breathing room, like you don't have to make it tomorrow. Yeah. you go, I love you. 00:39:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You're amazing. And I'm gonna rock. 00:39:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) See ya. Bye-bye. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:00 - mark sweet Can you hear me? 00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Shona's not here yet though. 00:00:06 - mark sweet Yeah. 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Everything okay? 00:00:17 - mark sweet Yeah, in Vegas right now. 00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I will text her real quick and see. Oh, well I said it was little don't I see it. 00:00:34 - mark sweet For easy like how important it is to go and meet the doctors face to face. It does take a lot of time, but especially in other states. 00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:00:46 - mark sweet Yeah, it makes a big difference because there's more and more of these California firms just like going through or doing what they're doing and just trying to separate ourselves little bit and put a case to a name and whatever. I think it spends some time with them because the people generally like me a lot once they meet me. 00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've noticed. 00:01:09 - mark sweet Yay. 00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's our trauma. I admit. 00:01:20 - Chona Sweet What? Hi. 00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi. 00:01:23 - Chona Sweet I was in Google. don't know what happened. 00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's um Um, sometimes the the events just have it there by default. Um, if I and if I'm not careful and don't delete it. 00:01:39 - Chona Sweet So oh, uh, yeah. 00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've had zoom issues all day. I literally just got it installed and marking it like 601 and had to uninstall it after fighting with it. So I'm audio only today. um, yeah. Okay. Let me go to my notes real quick. Oh, it was good. I've been exhausted all week after just getting back late and then taking my daughter to seminary. then this morning, she wakes me up at 4.53 a.m. 00:02:18 - Chona Sweet (3) she's like, mom, I'm late for seminary. And I get up and I'm like, my heart's racing and everything because I'm like, oh, I slept through my alarm. And then I look at the clock and I'm like, you don't go for an hour. 00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) there was no catching up on sleep. 00:02:33 - Chona Sweet (3) I tried to with their like little tiny windows here and there. 00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm just like, yes, that's been fun. But she's doing good. So anyway, how's your charting been going? 00:02:46 - Chona Sweet (3) It's, you know, it's still a challenge, but I feel like I'm getting better. I feel like it's really yeah. It's still a challenge. 00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's a work in progress. Whoa. 00:03:00 - Chona Sweet (3) show me explain to me what's getting better um i don't wait maybe more than two days to chart so i guess that's a like an improvement i thought you told me you were gonna do your charting at the same day yeah it was getting difficult um how many people are you seeing each day so like um yesterday it's just telemedicine but two days before it's um i have almost almost 35 and 90 i would say 80 percent of that is like new patients because of the new contract we have like influx of new patients and yeah did you just tell me you saw a 95 patients on one day no no no no I said 90, 80%, 30 plus patients, actually I feel like it's more than that I have to count because it's like 18 in the morning and I think I have almost 20 in afternoon and like 80 plus or 90% of that are new patients. So when it's like new patients I was just a lot more charting because they're new. 00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what's the average length of time to chart for a new patient? 00:04:40 - Chona Sweet (3) I honestly do not. 00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I feel like I don't really time it but that's the first thing that we need to do. And so here's what I'm to tell you, Chana. I said it in the beginning but now you're getting to the point where like we can really kind of feel it. This is tedious. 00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3) in the beginning, right? 00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is tedious in the beginning. But if you will do the things that I ask you to do, we will get through the tedious faster than any other way. So timing yourself and observing the things I'm going to ask you to observe is adding tedious on top of tedious. But the fastest way for me to help you systemize and simplify what you're doing and to speed it up. Is to be able to understand what the baseline is first. Yeah, and I can send you notes at the end of this too. 00:05:40 - Chona Sweet (3) Let me go make sure my note taker is working because I feel like it's definitely more work for new patients. I definitely find myself. So, you know, getting, you know, I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to, I know it's going to be all hard work. It's just that I feel, I know early on that when I get busy with the PI stuff, I know which one to cut. And I don't, and I know, when I say I have to cut means, I know what to tell Dr. E, which one I don't like. 00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What do you mean, like between what you're doing in PI stuff? 00:06:42 - Chona Sweet (3) No, because the PI stuff, because it's like, remember the one, two, three, I'm on number one, which is the main word. And out of the number one, there's three categories, I guess, if it says that, first it's the hottest. Hospital rounding and I haven't even get to that because I have yet to get the privilege from the hospitals So there's one the second one is the clinic work, which I Don't know I guess from the beginning. I already know that I don't like clinic Mm-hmm, but the clinic setting are like the bread and butter of a Pain clinic basically, so that's where the bulk of our patient population is and that's where the Remember if you if you remember the the contract that I was saying that he the doctor He recently acquired that's where the majority of patient will be and then the third category is the telemedicine Which is you know, just how it tells tell them medicine phone call, but it's best basically medication refill or ordering other treatments for the patients. And yeah, so the number one cat, a number two category of seeing patients in the clinic is my least favorite because I feel like it's just more work in terms of charting. Seeing patients in the clinic, it's not my favorite thing ever since I become a nurse, I don't like clinic work, maybe because of the charting and I mentioned before to you, I really don't like writing a lot, but the hospital setting is very much focused charting. I think that makes sense, oh, the patient have pain here, it should be the same, but for some reason that clinic charting has more charting and it's just annoying. However, I know that the PI or the pain or the personal injury cases are considered clinic patients, but obviously I feel that I'm putting a lot more effort on the PI clinic patients if that makes sense. Yeah. And I'm trying not to in a way because I don't want to be that person that I have to take care of the patient more because I'm getting paid more on it, you know, but I talked to Mark about this the other day and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me, but I know it's the reality of the situation and not just me. I'm sure everyone that gets paid more on PI patients, you know, day. It kind of like I have to give a little bit more I Just work on it. 00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I just find myself catering to them more and Kind of don't like it in a way, but at the same time I do I the reason why I said I don't like it I want to treat everyone the same I guess that's why I'm trying to say okay so Let me ask a few questions and figuring this out will It'll take a while it'll it'll take multiple conversations, which is gonna take multiple weeks But what do you like about your job? 00:10:43 - Chona Sweet (3) I like when Ever since I become nurse it's been typically A management, which was 11 years ago. I like that I Work as an NP, which is a different level of autonomy As compared to being an RN, a bedside nurse, I like that I can give what I think would help with the patient. I can order it right away and I can see the results right away, of like ABC type. I like that. And then lastly, I like it when a patient with, you know, the instantaneous gratification of saying thank you because it helps them. Eventually, the most difficult one is in the pain population, they're one of the most difficult ones because there's a lot of, I feel like, negotiation skills that I'm doing, you know, like, I can't give you more narcotics, but trying to convince them that narcotics is not the only treatment, there are other treatments. It's difficult, but it's fulfilling once they've Realize it themselves. 00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so like what, what kind of treatment do you suggest? I'm like sure you have all kinds of different types of pain and levels and options. But what are some of the non narcotic options that you suggest? 00:12:21 - Chona Sweet (3) So like, um, I guess I'll talk to it based on my experience. I can do things like my experience in the hospital, which is the bulk of my experience. Because I work in a hospital, you know, as a pain and P is in the instantaneous result of I can order IV tylenol and some people don't even know that exists or IV magnesium or IV vitamin C for pain. And some people would not even think that even helpful. Yeah. Um, or even can. I mean, ketamine is anesthetic, it's not narcotic. So that's why I like hospital setting a lot. It's very instantaneous that there's more access. I just realized that just now, maybe that's the reason why I like hospital setting more. But now doing the clinic setting, while I'm awaiting to work in a hospital, like doing the clinic setting, I feel like I'm limited in a way and it's geared towards more intervention type procedure, which I was not, that's a new thing for me. Anything like if the patient has back pain and they will look at the MRI and see, oh, you have stenosis, you have narrowing on the disc and that's why the PT medication doesn't work for you. So we may recommend you to have an epidural which is done by the anesthesiologist. So notice that that thought process is very much common in the clinic setting, and that also correlates with PI patients. 00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, and so do you imagine that there's a path where you can understand the nuance of the clinical setting and so I understand that the limitations that you have access to options in the hospital that you don't have access to in the pain clinic and when you know that something could be really helpful and it doesn't require an invasive procedure and it doesn't require a narcotic which comes with all kinds of other side effects and issues, dependencies and whatnot, that that can be frustrating. But do you feel like you can and work with the options that are there and just and feel any kind of like personal satisfaction, knowing that you're giving the options that maybe aren't the same as the hospital, but that you're giving the best that's available to them in the place that they went to. 00:15:17 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah, yeah, I do. And I know that it's temporary until I have the privilege in the hospital. And I think it's designed that way to not make us feel that, you know, like just set stationary, like, oh, we're just doing clinics every day of the week, day to day. So how it's, so I in my head, it's temporary, so I understand. And I know that I need to understand the clinic culture and setting anyways, because that's how I can succeed with my PI cases, which is this, Number two, out of the three source of income. But also, there's one thing that is new, that I haven't fully utilized by myself because I'm not an experienced on it, is I can do injections on my own too. That is intervention, but that is something that I can do, and it's exciting to explore because I've done it multiple times without the E, but I haven't done it by myself. So I almost did it by myself the other day, but Dr. E is available, so I'd rather him do it with me. Yeah, well, that's in and of itself, it's a procedure, but it's not as, I guess, it's excessive like an epidural interest, yeah. 00:16:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so what we'll do every week is try to figure out what are the, Because even in the beginning while you're still wrapping your head around everything and waiting for access and whatnot, there should be something that we can do. And even if it's just a perspective shift, like earlier in the week, we talked about writing your own story, know, that what you feel like your limitations are culturally, language, that's not permanent, you know. You, there are different things that you can do, and we talked about just the practice using, using translate tools, using chat dbt, whatever to help you overcome the language barrier. And then over time, because there's, there's only so many things you're going to have to write over time. Obviously, there's a wide variety, right? But eventually the repetition is going to kick in and you're going to know the same phrasing and you're going to know it in proper grammar and you're not going to feel embarrassed anymore, and you're not going to feel like you're less than for any reason. We know that the only way that's going to happen is over time. So we can't shortcut that per se, but we can kind of expedite it with the tools that you use. And then the other thing we can do is just you just remind yourself that your story today isn't your story next year. So and kind of looking forward to that. And a year is one of my favorite perspective tools. So it's really difficult to to map out significant change when you're evolving as a person, even more so than professionally. Sometimes professionally you can do it, but the the wow effect really doesn't happen in a month. It doesn't happen generally in a quarter in the six months, but the wow effect is almost always happening. Like I've never not had that happen with anybody I'm working with in the course of a year. You look back over a year, like, that was significant, even when it's just kind of. still subtle, you can clearly see some measuring points where this was, you know, significantly different or that was significantly different and then you can kind of add in the compounding. So one of the things I just want you to do every day is remind yourself that, first of all, define and I think I asked you in text but I'm going to ask you now as kind of write down what you want this to look like a year from now. How do you want to feel about charting? How do you want to feel about the way that you write? You know, I don't love writing. I hate it. I'm 48 years old. I'm never going to love writing it and now typing but if I could just automatically download everything I wanted to say, then I'd be happy but that's not going to happen. So anyway, you know, it doesn't mean that you're going to love it or feel like you're great at it but what we do want to do. Um, is at least not feel so much resentment or frustration about it and, um, if it's one of those things we just have to bear down, then you bear down, but there are dictation softwares. 00:20:14 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah. 00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. so are you using anything to help you with that? 00:20:18 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah. So, um, Dr. E actually just called me today and say that, um, he bought a, the, the dragon for healthcare. They, that's what they like. 00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah. 00:20:30 - Chona Sweet (3) but I can't use it on the apples. So, but he, he said he got me a lots of which I'll, I'll get it tomorrow. So, I'm excited for that. I'm sure I still have to be vigilant on editing it because of my accent until it, until it adopts, I guess, to my accent, but, um, I, I, you know, I, I think what I feel to do today. I feel okay. I, I don't feel like. It just waxes and wanes how I feel on, you know, feeling quote, unquote, less than, but I'm happy with what I've been doing. I mean, it's not perfect. It's a work in progress, but I, I feel like each part of the three, the streams of income, I'm working towards like the, like, I told you the Washington, I submitted that already. So I contacted my university to submit my transcripts to Washington State, and I'm happy about that. 00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) okay, that's an accomplishment. Yeah. Um, so I just did a quick Google search on how do I do new patient charting faster and I put pain clinics. 00:21:44 - Chona Sweet (3) So the first thing I came up with is use dictation software like dragon. 00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The other one it said was electronic health record can help you chart faster by automating tasks and allowing you to chart from anywhere. 00:21:58 - Chona Sweet (3) And yeah, we can. Yeah, which is what I do that I feel like being having the capacity to chart at home It's a blessing and occurs in in a way to me because I feel like I Have this sense of okay. I finished seeing the patient boom boom boom. Maybe do a quick You know jot down a few notes on each basin and just tend the note and then chart at home So that means I'm finishing my work at home versus finishing it at work Which I think I should not dab it as a good as bad. It's just how it's just what I I'd rather be at home And chart at home be comfortable, but that means I'm bringing work home at home And sometimes I push the limit on maybe I can do it a little bit later and then yeah I'm up till 2 a.m. It's a slippery slope. 00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so this is where you really want to define your values When when I talked about like writing your story what so this is this is not not. This is going to be an iterative process as well. So what I would like you to do is kind of map out your ideal week. Now, it's not going to be the same all the time. Some weeks you're going to have special events, trips, things that you want to do. Some days you might have an extra load of patience. days, know, we're women, there's an entire week that sometimes just feels terrible once a month. It's all kinds of things that can affect you and reduce your productivity, reduce your mental capacity. So you have to take that into account when we when we map out the ideal week. There are people that will call it like a perfect day exercise. There's no such thing, but the ideal week and you want to look at like what is your work day look like? When do you start? How are you starting your morning? do you want to feel in the morning? do you want to think in the morning? What do you not want to feel? And then a negative match list is really, really important because a lot of times it's easier to write the positive things by putting in the negative attributes. for me in the morning, I don't want to feel stress at all. It's bad for me physically. cortisol is dangerous. It's really difficult to capture goodness in the rest of the day and to be productive. But also the morning time and in the evening is when I'm with my girls the most. And so I don't want to spoil or even infect them with negative energy and stress. So I don't check email. I don't look at anything that could cause me stress. And also I'm most creative in the morning and late at night. So it's kind of the wee little quiet hours around the house. don't know if it has to do with timing or just has to do with around. But for me, those are the creative times. So in those times, I want to make sure that my schedule is not, I don't want to be having conversations. So I don't schedule calls until after 10 or 11 during the day because I want to do my creative organizational administrative tasks in the morning and in the evening as well. So I don't have calls during that time. So those are some of the things that I've figured out for myself in terms of types of tasks. other thing I've realized is that I have my best phone call time between 11 and 2, 10 and 1. Kind of depends on the day. But I want to help people. I have more energy during that time. My brain is functioning well at the time. And because of what my clients pay me, I want to give them my best brain for problem solving and also my best energy for other people's problems. So now you've got a different kind of schedule. don't have as much flow in that, but what you do have is what kind of home life do you want? What do you do anything in the evening that you want to protect? Is there a dinner time? Is there a snuggle time? Is there a you want to go for a walk? Is there a hanging out with friends? I'm like, whatever those things are, and maybe it's not the same every day, but whatever those are, you want to kind of plan how you do your charting and whether or not you take it home that night based off of the things that you want to do. And you also need to be aware of your discipline and your tendency to let the work creep into the most important things. So, and I'll tell you another kind of filtering process that I use to make some decisions, because generally the choice. that we make aren't between whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, which is easy, right? Because if I know it's bad, I'm not going to do it. But it's degrees. So a lot of times it's between good or better or best. But because you've only got 24 hours in the day, and you're only conscious for approximately, you know, 14 of them will say, allowing for the waking up and then going to sleep and actually being asleep. But and then there's only so much that you're not commuting and you're you only have control over what you're doing. If you say, if you give your yeses to the good things, to just good things, then you don't have yeses to give to the better things. And you don't have yes to give to the best things, because you're already committed by doing good. Well, it's not bad that you're doing good, but it's not the best. And you know, we get one life, we get one day at a time to do things. So thinking about, do you want to have your best day or You want to have a good day, obviously. Nothing wrong with a good day, right? But good days are just that and they're not necessarily inspiring or as fulfilling. So just kind of thinking about if you finish your charting at work, do you have your best chance at having the best night or a good night, you know what I mean? 00:28:27 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah, I mean our market's traveling right now, but we really are kind of like, I forgot the term used, but we like to walk at night or late at night even, like 9, 8, but I find myself charting, like if it's not here, if it's here I find myself charting. So I feel I'm not a morning person. So I like to do things in the afternoon or night time, so like the clinic work, it really starts at 9.45. So before I go to a clinic and if I have telemedicine, let's say I have 12 or 10 patients I need to call, I try to call that first while I'm at the house before I get to the clinic. And then Dr. E is like, oh it's a quick two, three minutes, four minutes phone call, but for me being new, I found myself talking to them for a longer time, that I don't think it's necessary, but I could have probably make it more necessary. 00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know what you might do, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but call control skills are a big thing. I've talked to Mark about it because his people could use it. Most people don't have have great call control skills. Some people do, but it is a skill to kind of finesse a conversation and keep it on track, especially when you want everybody to feel good and you want to make sure that they're happy and they feel taken care of. 00:30:20 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah, they don't feel right. 00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, but you can to accomplish isn't whether or not they feel rushed. It's whether or not they felt heard, seen, understood, and taken care of. The timing is not relevant to them. So if you can deliver an effective conversation where they feel heard, seen, understood, and taken care of, they don't care if it took three minutes. They just care that it was effective. 00:30:50 - Chona Sweet (3) Does that make sense? 00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right, right. That's true. If you have the ability to record some of your phone calls and have Dr. 00:30:58 - Chona Sweet (3) listen to them and say, Okay, what could I have? down to tighten this up then maybe he can give you a couple of scripting type ideas like say if this comes up this is what you should say if this comes up this is what you should say or he might say things like chon never ask this question because it's always going to lead to way too much like and if you deal with this type of person like i'm sure since he gave you that kind of time frame he's probably got some finesse type skills that he's picked up that he could give to you but he might not even know where to start unless he hears you and goes oh yeah here's where you're messing up and you could tighten this up does that make sense right it does um although i probably feel like in a way dr e is the quintessential doctors that are i don't know how to say it but i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying so it's like uh you're doing good no changes oh how's your kid okay great so Let me first let me refill your medications. We'll talk to you next time. Okay, that's it. So And I feel like in a way, I feel I need to ask more. I am sure because I'm still, you know new to the group and I don't usually call patients on the phone and end up just prescribing them narcotics, whether they're on it for a long time or not. Like today, for example, I was talking to a cancer patient. Cancer patients were more lenient with narcotics, right? want them to be comfortable, right? I'm talking during the phone and she sounds very, very sleepy. And I can hear there's family in the background coaching her what to say. I said, I can hear your family in the background, I can talk to them if you're okay. with that. And so I ended up talking to the husband and the daughter. And I was very, very clear to have to be clear that, you know, if you think he's being very sleepy, do not give the needed narcotics is the last thing you want is for her to stop reading. And, you know, things like that, I feel like there's just no way around it. I just need to make sure that they understand what I'm trying to say. yeah. And then the other day, there's a patient like, I'm done talking to with her. And then she's like, oh, okay. And I'm kind of like saying goodbye. And she said, you're the first person I talked to today. I feel bad, you know. 00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And if I told her, I told her, maybe you need to go out and talk more to your neighbors. 00:33:50 - Chona Sweet (3) I don't Yeah, those are the examples. 00:33:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, I I understand that there's a reason I'm a business for myself, and I make my own roles, because I want to do what I want to do and how I want to do it. And you have to operate according to the dictates of your own conscience, but you also have to realize where you're at and what's compatible. So one of the things is that I didn't get to a place where I could be how I wanted to be just because I wanted to be there. I had to create and I paid a price. I walked away from all income while I had four daughters to raise by myself four different times. It was terrifying. At one point I was on food stands because I just wouldn't take crap from clients that it was making me unhappy. So when I say I'll pay a price, I'll pay a price that most people would never pay in order to get what I want. But that's not, you know, but there are some things that I did tolerate because I just needed to and because of the bigger mission. required it and it made me a better person because it is important I think to learn how to work within certain parameters and not just give up or want to grenade everything. I'm really good at grenading things and just be like, you know, blow it up. So there are areas I think where you you might be like I'm I have an opportunity to serve and I feel like I need to and there might be other times where you feel that you have an opportunity to serve and comfort but this probably isn't isn't the time and isn't necessary and some of the parameters might be and it's going to be hard asking yourself so the conversation with the lady who's lonely that's a that's a whole therapy session right there it is and I feel 00:36:00 - Chona Sweet (3) Bad and to even say goodbye to her, but I redirected it in a way that gave suggestion, maybe a need to, you know, talk to your neighbors or call your family too. He's elderly. And again, I. 00:36:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm going to pause you just for a second because it you're not going to have the answers right away, but one of the things is you can kind of develop your own toolkit sort of thing. Right. So some of these scenarios that you run into and you know, this is going to take time. If I were to handle it the way that I wanted to handle it. But if I spend that time, then I'm going to lose my time with market nights because I have to spend more time charting because I spent too much time on phone calls. Or I'm going to be impatient with somebody else who also needs me because I spent too much time doing this and that's not fair to the next person. So there's all kinds of different reasons why it's important to. within boundaries because what they want and need most is is the medical attention that you've been assigned to give them. But what you can do is come up with some kind of scripted responses for certain types of things. So if you get somebody who's just lonely and you're working in a particular area, there might be resources that you could send to them and maybe you could say, hey, maybe you could get their email. Maybe you can just send them a letter and it's scripted and you have it pre-written. Like here are some things like I really want to spend more time talking to you, but and obviously there are probably things you just shouldn't say. Maybe you shouldn't have said that, right? You have to be careful what you say to anybody. Maybe you can say, hey, I didn't know. Maybe you didn't know about these resources and maybe it's a senior center and maybe it's a visiting program where people visit the elderly or or some sort of something where you've got a list. of resources for different types of needs that people might have. Maybe you have a cancer patient-specific type of list of resources like, hey, these are the things that you need to know and understand. For example, if they're too sleepy, here's the risks of taking narcotics. So is it more important to you that they feel absolutely no pain or is it more important to you that they live? You know, because sometimes those are the choices. again, just because I'm saying this doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. In the medical world, you have to be very careful with what you do. So I would run anything that you want to do and say by Dr. E, maybe by Mark, and just make sure that what you're doing is okay. But what I would say is try to find a way to satisfy that nurturing need that you have inside of you that loves and cares for people and why you went into that. 00:39:00 - Chona Sweet (3) probably. I think, yeah. 00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but also keep it keep it in perspective that if you give everything to one person, then it takes away from the other people that you're giving to you. And so kind of balancing it out and also that you can't fix everybody's everything. Right. You're not their therapist, you're not their daughter, best friend, sister, whatever. But you can be the person that takes great care of their pain and use them the resources and make sure that they know that there are other options, actually cares. Even if they don't feel that you care, Jonah, you know if you care. So that has to be something that brings you comfort too. Because if you took this outside of the pain management, how many times have you said something to someone with good intention and care and concern and they acted like you said something bad? or tried to hurt them or didn't care about them and totally took what you said the wrong way. It happens a lot, right? Yeah. Okay, so, right, so but you wanna make this personal and bigger when it happens at work because it's work and it's important and they have needs but it doesn't change the fact that people will take things the wrong way. People will get offended. People will project their other issues onto you. You have to be able to deflect that. There's no way that you're gonna be successful in this long term and be happy if you don't learn how to compartmentalize and deflect that projection and those issues that they're just not yours and it's not heartless. I'm like, I'm a bear at heart, so. 00:40:54 - Chona Sweet (3) Right. And I think it's just a matter of, I think I've been with him. for a month, but it it's only been the last week that I'm really on my own. Yeah. he, I don't know, I think he's just wanted to make sure that I'm supported and I said that I'm fine, but I do have, I still have, I still find it challenging or difficult to complete the charting each day. That's still, that's still an ongoing issue, but it's not a new issue for me, per se, like I tend to procrastinate, especially if it's something that I'm not, like, if I just, if I know I would, I'd like to do something, I can finish it in like a few minutes, if I really, really want to. So yeah, I'm gonna ask you a word question. 00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Are you cold? I Get cold easy Okay, cuz you're hugging a pillow and I want to know if it's because they're colder because they're stressed out and it's a defense Oh, I know the pillow is my comfort. Yeah, it's comfort. 00:42:18 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah Here like if I don't feel I guess It's like comforting because of other issues like You know with my you know other Insecurities with my body when I know that that's what I thought that that was and I just wanted to check if it was You just happen to be cold and it was warm or because Yeah, but when you got it And the way that you hugged it it kind of was an indicator that that that you that's that's this is trustful little comfort it definitely might comfort and I Get Well, I feel like the body image issues one thing, but this work, I don't like it when there's no, I don't have the flow because I just don't have it yet, it's beyond my control. So until I have that flow, until I know exactly what I'm doing in a week or two weeks, I would feel a little uneasy about it. But I'm trying to control what I can't control, that's where I'm at. Learning things about the PI and just, I feel like I'm trying to do things like simultaneously. 00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're doing a lot right now, it's a lot to learn and it's not just a lot to learn. I would imagine there's some things that go through your head like, I don't really have to do this because you don't have to do it. It's one thing when you have to make money and take care of your family. It's just not, you know what I mean? But you have bigger aspirations and you have goals about how you want to see yourself. 00:44:12 - Chona Sweet (3) Yeah, I definitely, you know, that's what I did the Washington right away and, you know, Mark is helping me kind of start the conversation about having clients from different chiropractors. 00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:44:28 - Chona Sweet (3) I know it may not happen until early next year, but at least I get my licensure and then hopefully we can start. I guess Mark is saying that I need to have a different LLC for Washington. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But, you know, that's like one thing and I definitely need organization with my receive. I don't know. What I'm doing now is taking a picture and putting it under my favorite. But with the upgrade updates of the iPhone, like I cannot see the favorites right away So I Just need to be more organized with that. don't have a lot of You know expenses right now, but the other thing that comes up is you know, I I need There's a lot of good things happening in my life my career like I really need to take care of my my body myself So I start working out and the instructor that I mean them The instructor that's helping me she have a scheduling system that texts people and I know markets kind of working on that as well But a keyword is mark is working on it and not mean I feel like like you're waiting I feel like I cannot it appreciates me that I have to wait for him before I can move forward I trust what he says, but it doesn't mean it doesn't frustrate me. Also, I understand that I'm not ready to eat my own in that honor itself also frustrates me. I feel like, you know, in my head, I cannot be super ready for this. I know I just have to like learn as I go, and I'm trying my best to understand as much as I can. And I also understand that with me doing this affects marks reputation. So that worries me, makes me anxious, but that's a conversation I have within myself that, you know, I know I'm new, but I have, I'm not new to what I'm doing medically. So that's just, it's like just all those things that I... My question is to Mark about this and you know, I'm sure it's just that growing process of this having a new thing. 00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's the biggest thing is the newness of adult, everything's new. relationships are new, the processes are new, the pressure is new, time management is new, the knowledge of some of the things including business and different responsibilities. That's all new. Like you're having to wrap your head around and your body and your energy and your schedule and your routine and your mindset around all of these things all at once. And that's a lot, but you can do it. And one of the things I would love for you to do is just every day tell me something that went good, tell me something that you're proud of. So like you've got the Washington stuff done, that's great. Every day, just every work day, just send me something that you're like, I'm proud of myself for this. If you're struggling to find something like that and you tell me tonight, I don't have anything I'm proud of today, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions until we find out what your product is, because there's no way you didn't do something that each day. 00:48:17 - Chona Sweet (3) Oh yeah, I know. I feel like I'm already proud of, I know I've been there for, I think, on my third week, I was able to get the electronic prescription that my colleagues that's been there for a while apparently took them two to three months to get while I get it in three weeks. I was proud of that. Good job. I was at the other doctor that came at the same time with me, that started at the same time with And he texted me, and he said, how are you able to get get the, the, he he he he said, He skipped fast, so I tried to help him. But anyways, I was proud of that. But I don't know if I'm too, I'm proud of how I get it, but how did you do it? So I can call them multiple times, and it's frustrating. And there's a multi-step process that they have to verify cross match with your credit score and all of that. And for some reason, they cannot verify me. So I created an email. I created a ticket. And on that ticket, I wrote a long email, basically saying that I do not understand why their company or their system cannot verify me while the other government institutions like the DEA. Okay, for the California Board of Nursing, things like that, I mentioned names, these bigger government institutions can verify me, and your system cannot. 00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And how hard is that? 00:50:16 - Chona Sweet (3) Well, I was, everybody, that's my favorite thing, is just be like, listen, so yeah, I kind of basically also said that, look, the way that your system is holding me back on taking care of my patients, so yeah, I was, I was initially part of it, but then I didn't know that Dr. E's manager can also see the text, and we talked to each other and she's like, man, I saw your text, I'm like, ooh, Jordan can be spicy, and it's like, I was annoyed. 00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Look, first of all, you're going to be able to take care of patients better, and maybe somebody got a little fire lit under them, they probably didn't, but You know, their apathy is a plague in almost every type of business and definitely inside of government institutions and good for you standing up, but good for you articulating. And here's the thing, because you keep talking about like what you can't do with your English and grammar and whatever, but your ability to articulate the, that's a good lawyer tactic by the way. Also, that argument was indefensible because you're like, wait a minute, like all these other people can verify me. The same information is available to you, yet you can't seem to be able to do it. I'm not going to tell you your inept, but basically I showed you your inept and also it's costing my patience. 00:51:47 - Chona Sweet (3) Girl, I was shocked when someone responded to me via email on a Saturday. I was like, I keep on responding to them back and forth, I like caring. I try it again. I keep on trying and then I kind of said it like not ultimately but kind of I said this is the third and last time I'm going to try this. If this doesn't work your system needs to override me. That's what I said and they did. So I was actually shocked it worked but yeah. 00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm not that's my go-to move if I have problems with people. I don't have problems with Mark because Mark is always nice and good and everything but like if I like teachers, principals, whatever somebody not handling business very well, accompanying. 00:52:37 - Chona Sweet (3) You know what this reminds me actually and I was telling Mark this that I really wanted to become a lawyer when I was in college but anyway that's a different story. 00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh it's your but it fits perfectly with what you're doing because patients need an advocate and an advocate is another word for what attorneys do right. They advocate for their clients. Well, you need to advocate for your patients and that's all that you were doing as you were advocating for all of them by being able to have this process and do that so good. 00:53:10 - Chona Sweet (3) So that what I was doing is Dr. E would let me see all his patients either with him or by myself just until I get used to it and then he has to order the medication for me and then the patient starts to get upset at me coming back or calling to the office saying you didn't set my medication but it's not my fault it's Dr. E's fault because he doesn't do it on time. So I have to do work around on that one where I said you're here, log in and I'm gonna order this and let you look at it before I send it so that's what we've been doing and I don't like that. I want to do it my own on my own my own time. 00:53:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I need you to time five new patient charts. and five follow-up patient charts okay okay just do it as accurately as you can it just will give us a baseline to kind of figure out what it's doing and and we'll see what we get from there okay you're using drag and dictation that has to train that takes a little while there could be some shortcuts some abbreviations things like that it'll take a little while to figure out how to optimize your charting system as much as can be done and then the other thing the other assignment is I really want you to map out and and write out what does your ideal week look like are there particular times of the day or times of the day on specific days of the week where you're not charting you're not staying up late you're doing something else going for walks with Mar watching TV, resting, whatever, like whatever the things are working out. 00:55:05 - Chona Sweet (3) You want me to think of like in the future or my ideal in the period. 00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So how about now like what is compatible with your life as it is right now and what you would like it to be a year from now? 00:55:22 - Chona Sweet (3) Okay because I feel like with the Washington it's gonna be busy. That's why I mentioned once that starts and you know took off then I will have to pick and choose what I do with Dr. Lee. 00:55:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's part of the benefit of this exercise is that we compare it with what you actually have to do and what's actually in your life and go do these things match up so either you're giving up some of what you ideally want in order to do these other things and maybe it's temporarily or you optimize your day and your time a little bit better because you want to do the work and also you want to have these other particular times. So the biggest part is just consciously evaluating what has to be done, what is wanted to be done, and how the two are compatible and where the compromises have to happen if you're going to do it all and what compromises maybe you're just like I'm not I'm didn't sign up for this this is not what I want to do but where you probably will be like instead of that and that extreme like okay I want to do all of this so how do I get more done in less time how do I and then it probably will because you're taking a lot on figure out which things are best for you whether because it's more satisfying to you it earns more money, maybe it's something that you and Marc get to do more together of in the PI stuff, even though you don't like that, like there's all these different things that have to be evaluated and they all have different pros and cons. 00:57:15 - Chona Sweet (3) Right. I think eventually when that time comes, and I call it as a retirement career, because I feel like I will always want to do something using money, is that I can travel, and Marc can never talk about this, I know that eventually our goal is to be able to travel and still make money. Yeah. Well, like if I do the telemedicine, even if I call a certain amount of patients finding that sweet number is the goal later on, that will still make me money. 00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah. And when there's also point where you make enough that your money can be the way that you make your money through investments and other types of things. So if you have any type of interest in that, that's, that's, and just how long do you work? Do you want to work five years, 10 years, 15 years? How much do you want to work? How much do you want to earn? How much do you want to have in your investments making money for you? not just because it's money, but because you, you had, you wanted to feel like you did something productive and meaningful. And the one thing about earning your own money is that you feel like you can put it towards the things that you want to. Like, it's a different level of satisfaction. It's not about the money per se. It's about what it unlocks for you to be able to do. It's just a resource. you have your own time. Sometimes you have your own energy, right? have, but, but money is just another currency exchange that, that we use. 00:58:53 - Chona Sweet (3) So it's not, but anyway, not the end of, you know, it's, it's, Yeah, it's not my, I want that so I can buy or do something that I want. make the travel and make money, think that's like the best thing I have. 00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, my work is portable. 00:59:14 - Chona Sweet (3) I can take it anywhere that I want to. 00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think about money for me and like energy. I don't, I don't want a lot of things that other people do, but beauty is important to me. scenery is important to me, experiences are important to me and they energize me. And with that energy, it increases my creativity, but also I take that energy back to my people. So, you know, being poor is not compatible with serving people the way that I want to serve them because I want to be thinking low level thoughts instead of high level thoughts. You know, there's a lot to take into account anyway, but so every day. Just tell me something that you're really proud of and that that and just celebrate the wins. You can tell me the things that you're frustrating. with you but we have to end it on this is what I did good or learned this is how I grew this is like some kind of something like that every day because it will just help keep things in perspective I need you to and I will write this out map time five new patient charts and five follow-up charts yeah every day just using dragon and getting a practice at it and just kind of seeing and observing do you feel like it's getting better just kind of just kind of watching the process and seeing what you can do and that's a start like that's a lot to do for this week and then the ideal week like what does the ideal week look like now and then a year from now knowing that it's going to change knowing that we're never going to have that picture exactly but that we have the greatest chance of creating something that you're really happy with by being intense. Intentional in terms of how you create it Yeah Thank you You're welcome. Do you have any questions or anything? No, I um, I just yeah I I need to that's a very you know like actionable I said like I need to tie myself Yeah, and don't don't stress and obsess but you do wanna always push yourself like you committed to giving your best and I'll so I'll tell you one last thing real quick before we go and this is kind of my own Tool that I use and I call it an energy sandwich So if I have to do things I don't like Anything I don't like drains my energy and it makes me in a bad mood. don't like doing there's a lot of things to do But so the first thing I will do is I'll start that activity before I start that activity I'll do something that I like um It could just be snuggling with the dog. It could be talking to somebody I like. could be I had a good lunch. It could be a nap. It could be all kinds of different things. It could be good music. It could be sunshine breaks. I like to go outside and just let the sun absorb into my skin. I get the energy from it. It feels good. And then the other thing is afterwards I plan something that will boost my energy as well. doesn't have to be long. Sometimes it's just putting on headphones and listening to something that without fail I cannot be still. It makes me dance. It makes me just feel good. So I use music really strongly like that especially if I don't have a lot of time. And the other thing is if I do something that's super stressful then I need to go do a physical activity because the tension is in my muscles. So like a little walk that might be when I go to the gym depending on how much time I have. I might do some housework. Sometimes I will just pace back and forth. but it still gets all the energy out. So just kind of noticing how your activities are impacting your energy and trying to sandwich good things in between bad things, even if it's just for five minutes here and there so that you're not staying in negative energy for any excess of amount of time. Okay, I know I've talked your air off already. 01:03:25 - Chona Sweet (3) I'll let you go. Thank you so much. don't know where Mark is but he's probably asleep now. 01:03:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com) All right.

00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) That's weird, it looks totally different. 00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What looks different? 00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) The zoom screen, like it never said. Host is joined or trying to address. That's rude. 00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Your audio is so garbled. What? I can't even try to figure that out. Dan? Is that Dan in the house? lose you completely? The hook. Are you Mark, you're in retrograding? Does it show you muted? It doesn't show that you left, but I can hear nothing. It also doesn't show that there's audio happening at all. Thank you. 00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) You You It's like it doesn't know whether to use outside. So it doesn't know whether to use the data or the laptop. Oh, so I got ready the data. See, I always do the opposite actually. I tried. at first and it would connect. But it's like, that's weird because I've got like nine bars or whatever. Fully loaded. Nothing. 00:03:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it goes. And who I am just counting down the minutes until I can take a nap. I am so exhausted. I am fully supportive of seminary because my girl is happy and it's doing good for her. But it is killing me. Those psycho 5 a.m. 00:03:31 - Dan’s iPhone (3) people. 00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's something wrong with them. It's also like, I will do everything to get into the flow of a proper schedule. will make myself stay awake for practically two days and wear myself out and have exercise and get all the sunshine. Do all the things for good sleep hygiene to get to bed early. But what happens with that fail is I will be exhausted that entire time. come eight, nine o'clock, maybe even 10 o'clock. My body's like, the moon is up, let's go. It's just, I don't know if it's a moon energy or just, but it has to be something circadian. 00:04:11 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Regardless. Yeah, let's go through. 00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but it is. And at night, since my whole life, my brain and my body is like, I got my second third, something just to win, like adrenaline kicked in. And it's not just a busy mind. Like it's everything. And I can, I can do my best to manage it, but I cannot make it good. 00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, not a little win. Anyway, it's weird. 00:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Body's bodies are like complex. 00:04:47 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I know. 00:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) there's this whole like spirit inside of it. And like, how much does that? 00:04:53 - Dan’s iPhone (3) have no idea. Nobody knows. 00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, nobody knows. Anyway, before I ask you all the business stuff, how is your darling wife doing right now? 00:05:07 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I think she's falling down. We didn't get the whole month. I mean, Mars able on birthday, so that's going to be a wound, which is so great that her birthday falls so soon after she moved out. But, you know, like, they're texting all the time. needs some hilarious. I sent her some shoes. 00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She wants you, she needs shoes. 00:05:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3) She likes them. And then she's always like, check and look by my iPhone. Where's my baby? Okay, she's at them all. She's downtown. How is she getting to these places? Is she alone? like, why are you asking me? 00:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I can't relate, so. 00:05:56 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. She does it with both of us, Mariel's got the day off. from school. She was just doing that. Where's burial? It's out there, Travis. 00:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have Verizon and they have a smart family. 00:06:09 - Dan’s iPhone (3) So I have find my stuff, know, that, because we all have iPhones. 00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Verizon's smart family also has trackers and alerts. like, I know all their haunts, basically. And so I have alerts for like a school and home, especially in their dads and particular stores that I know that they go to a lot. I get these notifications every time they go, or they leave and I'm just like, okay, I know where you're at, you're good. it's not a, it's not a talking, no, but it's not even a trusting. It's just, uh, your head case. Not there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 00:06:50 - Dan’s iPhone (3) what's funny was it didn't exist at all. That was what I pointed out Yes. Do you have the benefit of that? mean, don't know if it is a benefit, I don't know it is. Um, I don't use it. I never said they're going, where's Evelyn? 00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I do. It makes us new product. 00:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. I do. I do it like when she's out late, when she's supposed to be home. like, girl, she's she's around. 00:07:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I think I've done it at all. 00:07:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3) What did you say? I don't think I've done it at all. 00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I would I would do it once in a while. I do it once in a while. 00:07:27 - Dan’s iPhone (3) just to see she's on campus. 00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's hard though. Like, hold this person inside your body. 00:07:35 - Dan’s iPhone (3) don't. 00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We do. 00:07:39 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Well, I got that. 00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's totally different. All right. So what was this call I got ditched for yesterday? 00:07:49 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, it was David Kannick. I totally do not remember if it had a new schedule. And then I'll put my coffee alert and I was like, oh, oh, he's fine. Yeah, maybe I agreed to it. I don't remember. 00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It did seem familiar when I saw it, I like hell's crap. 00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Uh, because he's like, obviously that poor that's it. The business is imploding. You're getting garbled again and I want to hear this. some of the time. 00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What? 00:08:20 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Somebody's calling you. Somebody's calling you. Somebody's calling you. 00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Somebody's you. How is my audio? 00:08:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Does it sound any different at all? It's louder. Sorry. No, no. I mean, I turned it down on here, but it'd be just in general. 00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's louder. been playing around with audio and microphones and stuff because I'm a nerd and I like tech and light audio. 00:08:53 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Are you like on a microphone? 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. It's a road podcast, a USB mic. 00:08:59 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. 00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would not have guess like yes, see that's the thing that I think a lot because actually here's what's the real thing is that Apple's speakers and cameras built into the iMacs and the Mac pros are really awesome. 00:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. 00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, okay. So David's businesses imploding. Wait, which one? 00:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, yeah. The resume. Like he hired somebody else and now they're like restructured. He had the amount of pocket and pay severance for like a time off that the person had a crew because whoever their boss is. I don't really understand the structure. the boss is didn't actually track the days off that they took. So this person was like, I have all this pay time off that I never used, but they did use it. There's just no record of the music. So he had to come out of pocket like 8,500 bucks after they let her stay from mom. Let her know that she was getting laid off. Let her stay for a month. She promptly stopped doing her job and or doing it well. And then after the fact, was like, oh, p.s. made a bummer of Fox eight time loss. So he had to write a personal check for that. But I guess. 00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is she related to Jamie? 00:10:26 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, right. I guess that like in the industry, we'll call it, right? The whole entire industry is taking a dive in the last 60 days and they believe it's directly related to the election. Because the anxiety, the fear anxiety, industry. that's spiking. And he said, yeah, I've heard from, I talk to people and they're saying they're down 30%. And that's the number he's seeing. So, yeah, it's not a good business, it never was. 00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's so weird to though, like here's the insight into that, the way that the election impacts certain aspects of the economy, it really shouldn't, because like go about your business and live your life, you disrupting everything by you just sitting there and waiting for this thing that has such a delayed effect, first of all, just, it makes no sense. But that is the, that's the power of it too, and that mental, like how much fear and how much power we've attached, not I, not you, collectively, those community people, to all these things. 00:11:50 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Well, here's the thing that I, I didn't say this to him, but I'm like, um, me cynical, you know, whatever do that. 00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry, I thought that was your first name. 00:12:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, uh, most people are not that plugged into the election. So I can like, I don't think, I don't see how that's true, like maybe, maybe that, that index. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) mean, who is that index based on? Is it his ads not working as well? 00:12:20 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Because that it does change a lot whole, the whole thing, like it's just down across the board, but with leads. 00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So it starts with leads, right? But, but that's what I'm saying. It could actually be more that they're not aware that the basically so much of the media spots get taken up by. 00:12:38 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, well, there's that too. 00:12:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. That's a good point. 00:12:42 - Dan’s iPhone (3) That it's not actually that the market has changed. 00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's just his access to the market has changed. 00:12:48 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, I don't, I don't think he's actually seen, I don't know about, I mean, that would show up impressions. I don't know if he dove into that, but I mean, the reality is that like they're selling way less and there's way less. it's way less revenue. And he's just, he's like, Mark, he's, it's, it's overhead, intensive, and it's labor intensive. I would argue in a way that it doesn't need to be. 00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:13:13 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It was funny. was talking to Lisa, and I was like, she's like, have you talked to David later? know you're still talking over two weeks. he, like, she's like, how's his business doing? Like, not great. I was like, you know, he's, he's a pretty smart guy. But I'm like, you know, he just doesn't see like what's going on there. And Lisa goes, is he that smart? 00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, when you do the math thing. Yeah. 00:13:40 - Dan’s iPhone (3) And I go, well, I mean, he is, because yeah, but she's like, he doesn't have any foresight. She's like, he talks about it. But he doesn't really have it. Because he does, or he doesn't really look forward. 00:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He has theoretical intelligence, but not practical intelligence. 00:13:59 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Right, child's like, Okay, boy, because he should have seen firing the number one salesperson having a detrimental effect. Like I literally was like, how did you not think this through? 00:14:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, and this other thing happened. Internal sales team, instead of I don't know, hungry people who are earning it on commissions that he doesn't have to pay all that stuff for. 00:14:22 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I was a person. There's no benefit in having an internal team. 00:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but that's an ego thing. And David definitely has a big ego. It is not obvious, generally, but because he really does a lot to try to pretend it's not there. But if you look at what he does versus what he says, he's very much protecting ego in a whole lot of things and trying to inflate ego with a lot of what he does. 00:14:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3) And I think that he thinks or thought he might be past this. I think he thought that it's the it's the real company curse real company out of staff, right? So if he's going to get acquired and I'm like, dude, they don't acquire, they don't want to acquire bodies. They want to acquire cash flow, right? So like, if your big goal is to sell it, create a cash flow business period, recurring revenue cash flow business, the less bodies the better, the less moving parts the better for the acquirer, right? They just want to get all the systems in place. And to your point, if they're outside centers and outside closures, that can just be replaced on a dime by that, that, you know, and any even better. But yeah, he could do that. He won't. And it is ego because he wants to make everybody go out. He wants to be able to talk to him like, what benefit is there in that? If you focus on the goal, get the close, then you better watch it. 00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But I think he's one of those people that company size and I have these many employees and we're this big. They're a really big thing for him and it's you surround his neck. 00:16:19 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yep, I don't get it. I told him on the call, said, dude, I have 14 employees, health insurance, payroll, and I did that. And my takeaway was I will never do this again because he was asking me about like mom and red 13. I go, there will be no employees. Like, no employees. He's like, you can't do that. I said, watch me. Watch. I go, the only people that will be employees are guys eventually and maybe me, maybe not even me. But I'm like, we're going to be stakeholders. And I got the only way that they become employees is if it makes so much money. that it makes sense to get health insurance for them and me. Get health insurance, get 401k plans, because it's just kicking off so much cash, I don't want to give it to the government. But I'm like, other than that, no. They said, about Eric? Eric your employee? said, no, he's not. He said, well, you're going to watch out for the government. I go, I already did it. He's like, what do you mean? I go, I told Eric, you've given his wife I a business and I said, you need to make sure that you make money through that business or you can't work with me anymore. I will not, I will not get tapped up the shoulder by the California government. I'd be like, this guy's an employee. I go, they have their own business. It makes revenue off multiple clients. Eric got you just took on a freelance client this week. I'm like, there's no threat of that happening. And he's like, oh, okay, wow. I know exactly what I'm doing, not that. So anyway, yeah, he's probably going to be out of business by the end of the year, to be honest. 00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, I know what I going say is that that right there is the reason that in the course that I am still working on, is that the first thing is principles and priorities and establishing values, and the reason is, is because if you have defined what it is, and I don't think anybody is right about it the first time for the most part. It's not until they come up with what I'm about to describe that they start to realize, oh, that's not right, because you have conflicting values and you can't keep conflicting values, have to choose something. And it is come up with Mark a lot where he's like, well, yeah, but I want to grow as big as fast as I can, but also I don't want to come into the office. So which is your bigger value? What's the one? you want the most and or like I want to have as higher profit margins as possible but also I want my people to be happy so like you have conflicting values which one is the one that rules and so David has an unspoken value of I want to be king of a domain and I want to have people that I Lord over yes yes that's that's really what it is and because though he wouldn't be able to admit that to himself but it is the driver he'll never and and so number one it's great because somebody like you can go look at anybody that you're talking to and figure out one way or another either asking directly or indirectly what are your pay attention to whether or not that's actually you know, their actions support that or not, because as soon as you recognize that you're working with somebody who has a value that they won't even consciously admit, you cannot work with them, not not wisely, because they will implode. They will destroy whatever they're touching because they're not even honest with themselves about the thing that defines all of the choices that they will make. 00:20:24 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. Yeah. And then it's like, if, right, and if you look at those values, this what I thought when you were saying, I was just imagining the values as gears, right? So it's like, hey, if you're, if you're a value of time at home in this gigantic gear, it's taking up like, yeah, it can turn the thing, but you have to recognize how it works in relation to the other gears. And it's like, yeah, that machine works, but it's not as if it can't necessarily get you where you want to go. You have to restructure that machine. The design can only do a certain outcome or a certain thing. so Mark wants to be at home. That's a cap that there's a cost that comes with that. But then if you really value that, is there a cost? The cost is, yeah, you're not going to be as big as you'd like. But your values are saying that you don't really want to do that anywhere. 00:21:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. You're actually happy because you have enough money to do the things that you want to be, to be where you want to be with who you want to be. That's the definition of success and freedom, really. So, yeah. 00:21:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3) mean, if Mark wants to grow more, this is what I was thinking about this yesterday, the day before. He needs to, I think we talked about this before, but maybe not. And this is like a full on Dan Kennedyism. And it basically is, you know, he who can spend the most wins. Mark needs to be like, I can pay $7,000 a retainer. And how does that fit into the model? Well, It's in. You got to lose some overhead. 00:22:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:22:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Period. And you can shift that money to say, okay, the same amount of money is going to come in, man. can put it towards getting buffering throughout the business. And the story, right? There's 3500 goal or 4500, whatever it is, it's, it's happening out, right? And so this is interesting because we hadn't figured this out before, and I'm realizing this right now, that before he was looking at the cap as like a body's cap, right? Oh, pods are over done. it's like, these, these are where the things are happening out, where they're capping out is the retainers and the costs that you're allowed to pay for. If you can't pay more than 4500 bucks, you can't get more. it's the ultimate thing. It's the ultimate showstopper. Even if he goes and gets more money, if he's... Not get that number, you can't, but the minute you lift that number to like seven grand or whatever, or up to whatever it is, right? 00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's why things are changing, though, because he is shifting and he's carrying more about that overhead a little bit more specifically. But here's the thing that happened in his life that is allowing for that change. He has friends and he's going, And that was Salko. 00:23:25 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Salko made him do that, but him going and having actual friends means he doesn't need the business to be romper room. 00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the disruption is coming, but he still, you know, of tend to hearted and does care what people think and so it won't be a rapid thing, but knowing that and being able to observe that the values are changing more because the needs are changing. So the value didn't change. value is Mark wants to have fun and needs to have fun. on fun is a big part of his life and fun with people and socializing is a big part of it. So it existed and was fulfilled by Sweet Law. And now it isn't and doesn't need to be. And so now Sweet Law can behave more, you know, on a business basis with actual real values. But that wasn't like we couldn't have first of all known that or made that happen three years ago, two years ago or one year ago. 00:24:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3) So anyway, there we go back to the gears. The fun here is being taken out of the machine. 00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that's kind of the fun. 00:24:36 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. Right. If the fun gears were moved, then the machine can operate differently. Yeah. 00:24:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, so that's also there are two machines, right? So that's a cog. There's the machine, there's a machine that is the visionary. And there is a machine that is the business. And where we work together is where the two combine because they are separate and to. But the business doesn't exist without the visionary, and so it's like this kind of, I don't even know how to describe it, but No, but it was like he was, he was trying to get everything out of the business, and he was everything, everything for his life. 00:25:16 - Dan’s iPhone (3) He was getting out of the business. And now he's there's a by application, and he's like, Oh, if the business is just about the business and I don't need to get from there. Well, that that alters how that thing can function. Right. I was talking to Sal, and he's like, I don't know why Mary even works there. And I was like, neither do I. He's like, she's overpaid and she doesn't do anything. And she's like, she's been on maternity leave for like two years. And guess what? 00:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nothing's changed. Because she does a little bit, and it's just it's access that for Mark to not do more. So Mary is there as to take a little of the burden off. That's it. And it's in it and it's a convenience expense. 00:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (3) And it's an inherited thing that's like, it's, it's, it's part of this thing that I carried through that he's gonna have to reexamine and be like, sorry, like, it's time to, time to move on, like greener pastures. 00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and he, but before you, or you hang on to her, but I'm like, here's his cognitive dissonance is because he calls her his right hand. And she's really not and she really hasn't been. But it makes her feel good. And I think that he's just, I don't know, complimentary and uplifting of people he cares about and likes and also knows that it's a, it's kind of, it's psychological. 00:26:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I think he believed in it. 00:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, that makes sense, though, too. 00:26:57 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yes, I think absolutely. And I think maybe she probably really done. 00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, and so way more than he does now. 00:27:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3) And she might have been right for that version, for that size of the business. Right. At the very beginning, she could have been integral. Well, I know. 00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:27:11 - Dan’s iPhone (3) don't The gross in three years is kind of phenomenal. Yeah. 00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You look at every aspect of it. 00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (3) So I was like, uh, you need to start calling me your right hand. I'm doing more than she is. 00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What did he say to that? 00:27:29 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I don't know. 00:27:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Those two, it's like, they're like an odd couple. Are they like Oscar? really are. And they talk constantly, constantly. I'm going to ask. I'm going start calling Mark Felix. And then wait, so he's like, wait, what? 00:27:45 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, totally. 00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was the nice one. 00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yes. 00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They are the odd couple. Yes. Oscar was the mean one. But it's funny because they're both kind of grumpy. 00:27:55 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. No, no. Salka's mega grumpy. 00:27:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my gosh. 00:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah. 00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, okay, let me, so I forgot to save my notes last week, which means my notes to see if you didn't go. One of them was there was that Van Floey should be brought up on the Monday call per Dan's request. 00:28:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, we did it. 00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) then what? You did it. Oh, yay. And that... Nice. Yeah. wanted to see what Sean had mapped out for the SaaS tier pricing. 00:28:35 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Uh, that I do not. I'm actually meeting with him, like, at 2.30. awesome. 00:28:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, why do I have JD funnels guy? What's that about? 00:28:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Well, they're doing the Spotify app, and they're going to change the look. Oh, okay. Or they did the Spotify app. 00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So how's your... um, martial stuff going. 00:29:03 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I've taken a break. 00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh, not a purpose. 00:29:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It's just like, I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get back into that. But I've been working on, like, fan flowy and mom a ton, like, mapping out all the stuff, like the books written, Greg, Greg and I are doing the cover and the worksheets right now and I'm mapping out the community funnel and strategy and the ads and the ad copy, like, I was literally just doing that. lead magnet, I think, is going to be this fan growth thing that I just came up with, like, this super fan system. then when the book covers done, I'm gonna take that into all software and then eat it from bark and then she'd spit out, you know. 00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, that, um, design or whatever it's called. Yeah. 00:30:01 - Dan’s iPhone (3) So hopefully Greg will have the, I mean, his first cover looks cool and then I, I just got this morning. So I had said Greg a bunch of stuff and I was like, he was looking for work and I'm like, here's all this stuff. You, you tell me the order in which you want to work on these things. 00:30:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, I'd like to do the mom stuff first and grow. sorry. 00:30:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Go ahead. So we're doing with that. 00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) okay. That's, I, the seasons, I was just thinking about like the seasons and the, is a thing when you have like so many different things going on. Sometimes they're, they're just is, it's almost like, it's, it's a self initiated sprint of sorts. Like all these things kind of coalesce together at the same time. And so like, there are certain things though, like you have basis is. always there but there it has different seasons where you work on like that's that's me in my course like it's uh it kind of keeps building itself but it's it's the thing that will happen but it's not the thing that is the most important it's basically my product of I'm doing all of these things so I want to capture it and and share it but the biggest thing always has been to me has been the real time service whatever it is whether it's mom or being you know jauncee or daughter or sister whatever all those things are always like top priority mission student oh my gosh you know I'm so busy right now but I'm so happy with it I'm exhausted but I'm like happier than I've been in maybe or cry maybe my whole life exhausted like happy yeah yeah yeah but but you know there's there's always been something to that like the happiest I've ever been I've always been the most busy not busy but doing things like giving them high school 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. going to school going to my favorite classes going to my sports Well, but Maria, I don't know if you've been watching her and she might email her she She sent me a couple messages this week She she was like she is not emotional, but she almost got choked up and she was like thank you for coming into my life She's like I can't believe all these things are happening and you're welcome Maria I Dan and we like it would not exist without Dan, but she and she's equally blessing me just because I get Like I feed off of everybody else's energy. So when I grow their energy there that energy just comes right back to me And so it's basically like I'm creating a battery pack in other people that I just plug into so like they're like you're helping me And I'm like yeah, I promise you. It's mutual But things with cool people She's so smart like it she she can write things down very quickly and she can come up with a very quick tactical approach. So not just, oh, we should do something, but she's like, and I would do this, this, this, this, like, she will come up with a step-by-step plan to do something. But what she's amazing at that most people aren't is if I point out where she's sabotaging, if I point out what's going wrong, she will just, you can see it on her face, she's like, oh . And then she, it doesn't feel good, but then she comes back and she's like, you're exactly right. 00:33:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3) That is what is wrong. 00:33:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that's what I need to do. And then she fixes it like immediately. And as all the people that I've worked with in my life, I can think of, I mean, it's less than five people for sure. I want to say it's close to three or four people that are like that. So she's exceptional in that way. And, but she loves to do all the things I hate to do. She loves making videos. She loves talking about stuff. And I'm just like, you know what, let's come up with this offer. this This the thing that popped into my head. I was like, what if we just, because she needs to make money, because she spent all her time making everybody really rich. And then when her dad died, she just, she wasn't doing anything except making other people money. And that's why her offers were all over the place, not for her, but because her partner needed, this is between us, really shouldn't say that. Anyway, her partner was desperate and needed money. And so Maria was like, I'll save you. And she goes and puts out offers. So she was being reactive partner. Yeah, business partner. 00:34:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, she called one. 00:34:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, they do this boutique thing together, but not anymore. Anyway, ask her about it, because I don't want to be like, I told everything. Emma, are you not thinking of my door? I thought I heard her not getting on my door. was like, I'm not ignoring her. Anyway, so what I was thinking. I was like, you know, there's a no brainer offer to me if people actually knew the value. But she's got all these eyeballs. I think that it's... if we can figure out the words that help people understand it quickly, then I think it's a no-brainer offer. But this, I'm getting ready to tell you. It would be she and I creating a marketing and business plan for somebody. So this is kind of like a person who has been making money, who has made money with a good product, a good service, but never done it consistently. They're either caught in a lunch cycle or they're just doubting themselves or maybe like the economy disrupted them, maybe something unlike just happened. either way, they're not consistently good at it. But they've got assets, whether the assets are their knowledge or things that they've created. And so we would come up with multiple types, like versions of offers, right? We'll take all the things that you know can do, all the assets that you have. and package them in different ways, and you can take which ones you want, and then either offer them in different ways, maybe it's low-mid, high-ticket, if that's something applicable, maybe it's a recurring subscription, basically just showing them all the different ways they could use what they have to create no-brainer value, and they'd have to be pre-qualified, but then the second part would be, so that's the offer. Then we would come up with the basic marketing plan, which Maria can do in her sleep, so can I, and that would be, first of all, whatever the hook is, which means we've defined the avatar, she and I would do the market research first, which we can do very quickly and well. Come up with a plan for one or two avatars, a hook for that, and then a plan, we won't create any of this, but just the structure, we'll write it all out, so they'll have the plan, and then there will be a business plan. create a project management thing like so Trello, in a PDF that take a plug into base camp or a song or something like that, that is custom for them based off of the things that we said that needs to happen. So if they have to go create some copy, create PDFs, create content, create videos, whatever that is, we will include all of that detail in the plan so they don't have to figure out all of this, right? And we're not going to fulfill it for them, but we will give them access to people that we know who can do these things well and do them inexpensively, and then support them through voxer and email so they can get like a private voxer room with us, ask questions, we're not available during the weekend, but then get like personal one-on-one mentoring, we just don't have to lock down our calendars to do it for $6,000. If somebody had offered that, 00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) And I don't know, I don't know why, I don't know why Seth isn't buying this off you right now. 00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Seth already has me though. 00:38:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3) No, no, but it sounded like him. Hey, you need to take a note here and go back and that whole part of the transcript out. And then feed that into chat. You can have it turn that off that into an offer. just laid out the whole thing and I was like, oh, she's laying out the whole thing. In her own language, I was like, she's got to go back and grab this. And then and then have a chat to turn into an offer and the name. Yeah, no, everything you just said, I was like, this is make a great ad. For sure. And you're calling out a very specific avatar. And I do think that they're out there and I do think that and you called out all the different ways that could have gone sideways, which can then pull in more people whether it is that they're stuck in a cycle or it is the economy. Whatever. 00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we've had multiple conversations like this. I should actually go get those out of the transcripts because we've written some stuff down, but I, but I know. 00:39:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, you and her. 00:39:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:39:10 - Dan’s iPhone (3) We've been talking three times, three to four times a week. Yeah, you should absolutely do that. So I actually, uh, just weirdly. I think the reason I thought of that, because I've never considered this before, but I'm listening to a book on songwriting. And the guy was like, which is kind of weird, but he was like, record your conversations and then go transcribe your conversations and then read through them and highlight things you say that are interesting. I was like, that's weird. And then he gave an example of one of the songs that he wrote and he, him and his wife fake the conversation. I don't think actually recorded the conversation between him and his wife. I think he's recalling it, but then he took lines from their conversation and burned them into lyrics. I was like, God damn it. that's a great idea because he's like you're going to talk like you. 00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have a whole library for you so because I have all my fathom recordings and I made a custom GPT that sorts all the transcripts because it can automatically tell who the speakers are where the timestamps are so it's job is like I put the transcript there and this job is to strip out everybody but me and then strip out any of my personal communication and keep all my business conversation and business strategy which then I had my friend go and she's putting this into a massive master file to build a Tina custom GPT because you can only put in 10 files and so all of my calls are spread out but I could run them through and give you a whole bunch of your stuff if you wanted I'd have to have her do it and I'd do it because I can't automatically I don't have a script for that if you had a script for it I've got 00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) the transcripts, but I don't know if I need it. 00:41:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, no, because then you would have all these lines like, you would have so many things you could pull out and you could go if we stripped out everything and it's just down and you'd be like, what are some cool things that I said about this? 00:41:16 - Dan’s iPhone (3) what have you spoken about? No, no, yeah, let's do it because I always think in the other day, I was back to thinking about writing a book. Now that I wrote a book with GPT, I was like, I could probably take myself put it in there and then I kind of know my ideas, right? then like, I used it again on some of the other day where I was saying idea, money, execution, I said, but you have to realize it's fractal, right? within the idea or other ideas. And then you have to look at that in the same sort of three ways. There's the idea, there's the money, there's execution. So I was like, Oh, yeah, if I told that to chat, GPT. So what I've been doing lately. he is. I did this with Maria. So Maria had her emotional opera thing that she saw for 27 bucks. I bought it. Feel free to tell her this. I bought it, downloaded her video, put it into the script, then took the transcript, X worded out of that to PDF, then fed the PDF to chat TPT and I said, analyze this and tell me what it's about. And it was like, you know, was Maria because I told the script, Maria, like this is Maria talking about the emotional offers. go, great. Write me a framework based on what she's talked about in a road of framework. I said, I want to make an emotional offer. What do you need for know for me? you're buying an offer like this? It's like, I need you to tell me all these things. And by the end of it, I had an emotional offer at all. And then I set it a sales page, the sales page for the book that I'm emulating from mom. And it was like, it put all this together. And I was like, what, what is the sales page even? Which emotion? In fact, there's the emotion of helplessness. That's is. I was talking about it. I was like, okay, so I've been doing that a lot, like downloading, downloading people by people's training and I'm running a crew and then having it and last for me. So not to spend an hour. Super helpful. And then I'd also, I mean, when I wrote the book, I gave you an example, an example book and a bunch of stuff that Mark wrote. And I realized that like, oh , I could give this thing other people's books. Like, I'm super into what's my book, the automatic customer I love, then there's a lot of stuff that we do, whatever it is. I could get those books and upload them and then be like, these are things that I reference all the time because people do that in their books. They go, oh, well, from this book, I could be that and then put it into the context of the thing that I'm talking about. So, it might be interesting to get myself. 00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm wondering if. 00:44:01 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, so can I have this idea? I haven't extended it to Facebook, but it would absolutely work. It would absolutely work in Facebook groups, particularly. So David Kefaneko there, he is sorry in the thought leadership business now, because you know, we've started business. And anyway, so we were talking about that at some point. I was like, and then I was doing my whole. Oh, I'm going to sell this to you, by the way. I finished it, but I didn't send it to you. So I did the Reddit's great. And then I used chat TPT to like come up with categories and then categorize all the posts in that music thing. And now I have a breakdown of like, hey, is how this these 1000 or 800 questions break down across these categories. And now I might go when you're like, add some categories into that. But I. Get all that, and I was like, oh, this is interesting. And then I started thinking about David's thought leadership thing. And then I started thinking, what if I hit subreddit, right? this one. I created categories for it, but the data from it. And then I just started monitoring that with AI, with the API plus AI. And what I do is say, hey, when there's a post on mixing, I want you to recognize the post on mixing. The title of the thing is the question, right? But they could also go into the script, like the actual post exit with it. And then it comes in, and let's say I'm Sean. So Sean is monitoring this subreddit I was on. Hey, there's a post on mixing. pulls it in. Then it looks at its Sean resources, because Sean is uploaded. We've uploaded Sean. We've uploaded Dawn's answers to other things, and we have the AI write the answer for the Reddit post, and then it alerts Sean that says, hey, have a new comment for you on Reddit, and if he goes in command to go, yep, that looks good, it's submit, and then it schedules it to be reposted on Reddit. All of a sudden, having this very active person in these subreddits around very specific topics that you're choosing to comment back on, in a way that doesn't occupy all your time to sit there, go find the thing, read the thing, write the answer. Instead, it allows you to become like this bot leader in these subreddits, then you do the exact same thing on Twitter, you go, okay, here, I'm looking for tweets about this. When you see a tweet about this, grab the tweet, bring it in, write a retweet, tweet, or write a reply, and then I look up and go, yep, that looks good, submit, and then it just schedules it to go out. No one would ever know that you're using AI or it's like, it's not a bot. It's more like, it's more like when you get in the robot, right? It's like, it's a person and a bot. But if you did that, every day, if you just started all of a sudden showing up and displaying your authority, dude, you become, you become a thought leader, you would absolutely get leads. And I'm like, oh my God, I could have built this thing. Just even if we just use it like, I had Daryl Thorpe go into this recording thing and read it where there's 3.4 million people. And all of a sudden the eight time Grammy award winner is responding to your . People would be like, what the f except it's it is him. Right? it's not him. So imagine doing that in Facebook groups, right? you go join these different Facebook groups and it's just watching the group. And it's like, Oh, Tina, you're commenting on this and you go, yeah, that looks good. 00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Boom. So no. 00:48:03 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It's great. 00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I can't even like really wrap my head around that though. 00:48:08 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It's great. know. I told someone and they're like, dude, that is such a great idea. Are you gonna make it a product? said, no. 00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be cool is? 00:48:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Yeah, I just need it for me. I could get Mark, Sean and Daryl in Reddit consistently posting their no, no, their expertise. It would translate into and then they'd be doing it in the context of the mom brand. They'd be make references to that. They'd make references to fan flow. But it would be in the context of answering the real question. And then the split, like the slang authority tapping into reciprocity like all those things. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I can't possibly do that. 00:48:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Hey, no. 00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Doggy. 00:48:58 - Dan’s iPhone (3) No. I'm up on the protein, she goes, I'm on the protein and comes out covered in dirt, what are you doing? You're lying, you're covered in dirt too. 00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let me show you some of that. Oh, I'm feeling that the job that I asked to be done did not completely get done. 00:49:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Good job. 00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, the extraction process goes ongoing through all of the conversations and literally all the traps. And I'm also looking at the output and it's only 180 provides where all of the calls total. And obviously I didn't talk in all of them. All of them. I mean, yeah. I'm pretty sure the job is not done. got built eight hours for it. Very close. I knew I might just not be able to. All right. right. All right. right. All Okay, so anyway, I do have, because, so what I did was, because all of that stuff should have been pasted into chat GPT, and she has a different account that I gave just to her to use just that custom GPT and put all of these transcripts. And so anything that had you in there, I could say, now tell me everything that Dan Ryan said, and all of them except one says there's no instance of Dan Ryan and the one that did have it, it was all- That's I don't exist, Tina, I am just a space invaders graphic, we all know this. I know, oh my gosh, that was the wildest thing to be, like when you reached out after Dan, or yeah Meredith, shared my, 00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) like you're just a space invaders guy like you're real what so I wear a by shirts in this company called Dixon and their thing is like everything is limited edition so it's like they make they don't tell you how many they're making but they have a they have flannel they're short sleeves and these other things called party shirts they're like this sort of blend material anyway so you buy them and then it's they're limited edition right so they're never going to make them again which I didn't know at first so I'm eric bobbie when i'm like oh my god I love the shirt because you don't need to iron it like the ones are made of bamboo and the other ones are made of this stuff like golfing that were wrinkled ton I'm in three weeks ago they put out a space shirt I was like who bought it it's like they're making close for me the space invaders centipede those were my two favorite ones an impact man in this pack man and really only I miss Pac-Man because of that scene in the middle where they can oh yeah for the basis update basis is done and they are building their building wolf are on it uh Frank said we're done we're we're building a site like we're not we're we're gonna go build it we're gonna find whatever is left the wolf are will be on basis 2.0 october 20 third second fourth 24th 24th that's what we did that's what yesterday awesome yeah frankly no we're done we're done we're doing it we're building I love it um I just like I'm flabbergasted I'm like wait what that's so I was almost anticlimactic because I didn't ask the question 00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And yeah, that's wild. So that's a thing. 00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It's like, I don't work on it. It's like, there's nothing for me to work on. I used it the other day. And I was like, hey, I found this list of this. It was so funny because Eric's like, oh, it's great. But I was like, hey, business and it's going work with like, oh, it. I was like, it's not that bad though. Not right. It's just a little tiny thing. And then I pointed out a couple of things. And they were like, fixed on the good catch on the ground. 00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, OK. when will you get back to the Google Analytics stuff? 00:53:36 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Because we've got another 71 goals that depend on that. I got to actually submerge them on, hey, they move to circle. And it's actually, I'll go do it right now. I don't know where to send them stuff now. Like, is it a sporting circle? I'm going to go with this. But I need to ask them a question about one of the things that doesn't appear to be working correctly. And then I need to also. who's one of the things that I made, it seems like the numbers too high. I need to go and match up that number with me, meta-rich and see if they match. They should match and if they don't match, then I got to send that to Mushy, though these are matching, so I'll say things off. Yeah, so if they answer my one question, that'll fix that thing. And then Mushy, if Mushy is things working correctly, then I can start to use that to make sure. I mean, that actually might be done as far as the stuff that I've wanted in place for most of the new ones. No, I still have to add I got to add the custom meta thing to the leads. So that's working, that's been running for like two weeks. So now I got to go back to the background and Mushy will be can I do this custom meta thing? And, uh, that she will, yeah, I don't, I don't pull together to stop it, don't, then I decided already that I'm not, we have to build a container from scratch. We're not going to use the one that until a bill because it's too complicated, which is fine. It's not a deal, but I'll put it up over. So that would be a good plan is to have the container ready for the new wolf. Boom. Okay, so what was like that? Uh, the 24th. 00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I got the, okay, that's when it's going to be ready. So what are you, you're going to have your container. 00:55:42 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Your I would like to, yeah, I'd like to have, yeah, then use it on that site. 00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's the C Dan has a self imposed task. 00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Just so you know, she's out of town. 00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's what out of town. I kind of guessed that because my invoice goes out, but it goes out automatically and then I get an email about it. But then PayPal's like, just to know your invoice has not been opened yet. 00:56:14 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I'm like, this is either sick or on vacation. So yeah, she's like this. 00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The lamb. 00:56:22 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Okay. 00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I don't even really know actually if I was like that. I'm supposed to have to complete his GA for container by the time Wilfer goes live. Nice. There's 2.0. October 23rd. 00:56:43 - Dan’s iPhone (3) 2.0. 00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, that's wild. Okay. Um, but I'm, um, hold on. Okay. So that's the problem. But that is the problem. 00:56:54 - Dan’s iPhone (3) why is your face all dirty? What? dog. like space it's like just covered with dirt. I don't know what they're doing. Somebody's digging. have a puppy. 00:57:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You have a puppy and a puppy probably found a whole dig in for me to hold the dig in. All right. Well, everything that I have to ask is either dependent upon something else who status I already know about or isn't in the area of working on right now because you're full with other things. don't have anything else right now, but I will say these notes. They actually go to Stacey this time. 00:57:41 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, the other bit with Maria was so she even went by about the film. And it was like she has like a follow-up email that's like I'm just checking to see if you got the thing. Can you apply gas? Of course, I'm like, I know this is you're just it's like an engagement thing. I'm like, I know. So then I read her an email. 00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. 00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Oh, yeah, I will not respond to your email. And she wrote me back this long as he was like, oh, my God, I've spent my copy out. You're so funny. A bunch of Star Wars references, I was like, yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I actually got her back to tell her her sales page is finally going to go live and only took eight months. You're welcome. 00:58:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) See, she's awesome. Like, I wouldn't say like that kid is awesome. she's like 10 years older than me, but she's still like, I don't know. I pretty much feel like mom around almost everybody. 00:58:37 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Well, I mean, my plan is still to like, I'm going to give Greg Greg's going to dissolve the AC funnel, right? going to be back to Eric and Abish, I can DJ him like, no show tonight. I'm like, Hey, needs to be built with blocks this way. Oh, can it be done? And then Frank is telling them like, Hey, look, if you need a block, like go. find somewhere else and just and then make sure you're going to need that block and then build it. He's like, just we're not going to build new blocks. He's like, we're done. 00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're done building blocks. You guys sound good. There's a puzzle. 00:59:26 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Ayo. 00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Thank you very There is no audio on your side. 01:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (3) There was music. 01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know what's happening. There is music or was music. 01:00:38 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Was you didn't hear that? 01:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. 01:00:41 - Dan’s iPhone (3) It was crazy. It was like some dance song drum beat. 01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the soundboard was working. 01:00:52 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I just can't hear it. The output must be like, it must be a monitor setting and it must be. Oh, wait. I know what it is. I was like, man, team. This map music is not what I thought it would be. 01:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What music? 01:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Your map music. 01:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) My map music is brown noise mixed with green noise. 01:01:10 - Dan’s iPhone (3) You don't hear that. I'm here and clapping and audience-like-like. 01:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what you said here. 01:01:17 - Dan’s iPhone (3) No, I didn't hear that. Yeah, I heard. 01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Damn it. 01:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Well, that was- Oh, so you have that thing, that road thing too? 01:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, the road caster. I got that like last year, and so the reason, the only reason I actually got it out was because this this mic has a USB port, right? So I was trying to move the microphone and it broke the USB port because I didn't realize it was stuck there. Having to find out, lots of people have done that. It breaks the connector on the inside very quickly. Both looks. But it also has an XLR cable. Well, I have XLR to USB, but I don't have the cable for that. And so I'm like, well... I wonder if the Roadcaster Pro could connect to it, because I've got the XLR cable, so I plugged it into that and it plugs into my Mac with the USB and I'm like, I'm just gonna go with it, so I have a little bit of it. Okay, oh that was it, oh yeah, the Halloween text, that was funny and then I just totally disappeared in this. Let's do it though, but the body of stuff I could hear, I'm so fine. 01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (3) Also, why is it not coming to right now? 01:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) See, mentally stable, nobody was racking. All right, Daniel Son, you go have a good weekend, take good care of yourself, don't forget the GA4 stuff because now you have a deadline and also another 71, we got a percentage to overcome, which actually I think that you already did, but anyway, whatever, that's what mean. 01:02:58 - Dan’s iPhone (3) no, I think I think we're hitting. I could tell you he was bummed because we lost subscribers this month or whatever, but we didn't. I'm like, the math is right. That's sealed. I'm right. We overshot and now we're going to come down. We're over the ceiling, but I'm like, the average is going to be the ceiling. But that's good. like, this is a good thing. Then it shows me, yes, all right, now go add new customers. That's the only path forward is to have new customers period. 01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can you shatter the ceiling? That was a question still, right? 01:03:37 - Dan’s iPhone (3) I mean, that's why I'm building all this stuff, right? It's like, this is why we're getting the tracking. It's like, now we know I never had that formula before, like I said, glass in formula. I do think it's accurate. So if it is, then it's like, okay, now change 30 to 35. It's like, okay, we have to change 30 to 35 or 30 to 40. And then figure out what tactics create new customers or not. Or it's like, or it's like with March business or whatever. like, you know what? is what it is. It is no path forward, but I don't think that's true. I think that we can go. We've never really tried to require customers. Or we could figure out if it's a reality or not. 01:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Well, we need you to do your math magic. 01:04:27 - Dan’s iPhone (3) So all the math because nobody else does it. Yep. 01:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. On that note. Have a great day. Great weekend. And I will. the calls. dan@danddcompany.comTina MarieD&D Co & Profit Drivers - Weekly Review
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, hey, can you hear me very early turn that volume up really good. How are you? 00:00:36 - mark sweet I'm still pretty tired for me, but that's okay. 00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Just tired? No, but that's all you're saying. Let's see, 14. Where is that? I paste? I don't 00:01:00 - mark sweet I don't know Arizona, which is just odd. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, like 14 period, but yeah, that is rare. 00:01:09 - mark sweet 14 period. mean, it's not great. It's not terrible. It's just not great. If we had five more out. So, you know, if those all came in and whatnot, we'd be at 19 and we'd feeling lot better. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's okay, Ish. Well, that was more optimistic than you generally are, though. You've been leaning more that way lately. Yeah. Hello, Daniel. 00:01:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) What's up? 00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Allergies. I'm gonna mute my phone. not bad. Sorry about that. Do you not disturb? Okay. So, how's your ads going down? Oh, wait, your accounts were shut down. 00:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I got a rap whose name I can't pronounce some feeling very confident about how this is going to go. And I sent them all the screenshots this morning showing them that everything on my end says this should work. And it doesn't, no matter what I do. It looks like four accounts. think they reactivated the car accident one payments don't work. The new one I created for this other project payments don't work. This other project that I've had for years payments don't work. And they're all tied to D&D, which was approved. Whatever verify whatever this 's called over two years ago. And work looks like the last time it worked was between August and March. But I just I'm in like this loop. keep going around in a loop. I'm like, I don't need, and I even resubmitted everything, still didn't do anything. We'll see what Mogemchi or whatever their name is. It's very interesting. Mode mode, can't even say it. M-O-D-U-B-E. I feel like it's a dupe, M-O-D-U-B-E. 00:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Somebody else in Arizona had their GMB just shut down for no reason with all, that's where all their leads came from, reviews on that account. 00:03:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Just nuke. 00:03:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and it was the thing that the business hasn't been built on the last like three or four years, primarily. So, yeah, that is the whole point of on your race course, but you can't really. 00:04:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) That's not your, you know, it's not your race course. 00:04:03 - mark sweet What do you race courses built upon Google's lens? 00:04:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah. 00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, the thing is everybody's is built upon other people's stuff like if your vendors shut down. We're done, but that's the thing about diversification and why we have to do it because you can't actually own it. It's everybody else's platforms and eyeballs that we pay to get access to and they could just say, we don't want your money anymore, and that is the nature of the beast. Okay. 00:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) So you'll keep us posted then on what happened? Mode two? 00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'll keep you up to Mode two. 00:04:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Mode two. Because like I can't even it's, so this is now it's applying to two different accounts. So both of them are, I don't, so I'm like, I don't know why they're both two different credit cards to like both same thing. Luckily, I don't have anything. Yeah, it's it's only affecting accounts that are associated with my payment methods. Other accounts that I managed, I didn't pay methods, unaffected. I don't know. I don't know if that's the issue, then. Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what it is. It doesn't, it shouldn't be happening. But it is. 00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we'll see. are good. 00:05:38 - mark sweet Yeah, but especially someone that's pretty easy to do. 00:05:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Well, you won't see it's they don't have like credit cards anymore, right? So you have, I mean, they do, right? So you have a payment profile. So can I don't? I don't think I have access. don't know if I can access someone else's payment profile, but. So yeah, in theory, you could. attached a different payment profile. I think if I made you the admin, you might your profile might command. We could try that. I just don't want to up your profile. don't want it to be like, it's happened to both of my profiles in the same account. So I'm like, I don't want to bring in another profile. I'm like, is there something they don't like about these accounts? That's why I'm like, but I will admit, I did use Ninja to get to this person. So I was like, oh, what I really have is a problem over here. Because they can see that I am associated with Ninja, but not my profile. That's Jeff's profile. We'll see. mean, I literally just gotten touch of them this morning. So. 00:06:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We just need Mark to go ahead and with mail nor. Right. Yeah. Just writing Google. Fix it. Um, Tom, California marketing group, what up with that? 00:07:07 - mark sweet I didn't connect with them. 00:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's just, it's just made a smart . I know you were really, really, really busy. was just, um, mode activated. There you go. Back out when you're working. Oh, yeah. I need to send a shout out message. Um, how about there? 00:07:33 - mark sweet Yeah. I'm so allergic to this place. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's like the right side of my face. That's it. But it's like needles stabbing in my eye, my nose, my ears, my throat. And I just wound up. I'm at aggressive. Everything's fine. Okay. And with the good. Oh, was there a mixer with it? Um, how? Let's see. Working to ask about how these are fine. Oh, yeah, how did that go? 00:08:04 - mark sweet I have no idea what you just said. 00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is there any expert? 00:08:08 - mark sweet There's been so many mixers. Um, and everything was good. It's, you know, look, we have to do these things. Because, especially in the other states, just put a face to a name. So not just, you know, the California firm or what have you. So, you know, they're good to do. 00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Well, do you feel like you made some connections? Because you keep getting your cases taken away. 00:08:34 - mark sweet That's why attorney is not my doctor's. 00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but, um, yeah, I guess that's it. 00:08:43 - mark sweet So it's more just getting other doctors so that way they start sending us referrals rather than to the local guy that they use. 00:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I still feel like there's a secondary cause and effect in the background there. Like the framing of them sending it to you. you probably has something to do with the solidity of the just the case and whether not it could be referred out to like why would they go somebody else. 00:09:14 - mark sweet But what do people tell you someone they've worked with? So, you know, yeah, that takes time and energy, of course. 00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How's all of it been people they've worked with before? 00:09:25 - mark sweet I mean, it's generally who you're gonna send it. Sorry. When you're talking about a doctor referring to case, right? That's what we're talking about. 00:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, your cases that you've lost, what reasons did it give you for going to the other attorneys? 00:09:39 - mark sweet So, we don't we can't talk to them, right? Yeah. So, some of it's conjecture to some level, which is, you know, I want to be able to walk into a place or I don't want to go to a lawyer or we can't find anything online about this person. So, I know we kind of talked about building up a little more of a Missouri. in in Washington. Washington's got some profile at least, but at least New Mexico, Colorado, and Missouri to start just getting something out there. And that's one thing that we haven't pushed forward too hard with. And I get that if you're a client and you're looking up and all you see is California stuff in your Missouri, you're like, do they know what they're doing? 00:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so what does that look like? Is that just a website that says that you're in that state? 00:10:36 - mark sweet couple of pages usually on our website and then putting some sort of a CO juice behind it, because it's not a heavy search for a term, right? Like, sweet lawyers, St. Louis or St. Louis, it's not going to be that hard to get on page one. So we're trying to be like St. Louis' car accident or anywhere that's going to be really, really Have those pages been commissioned yet? I don't think so. 00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And who would make that happen? 00:11:02 - mark sweet I don't know. 00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're the boss. 00:11:04 - mark sweet Yeah, I honestly don't know. 00:11:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) And then Isaac submits the ticket. 00:11:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You don't for it. Hold on. Just make this really clear. If you don't specifically ask for something to get done and commission it, it does not get done. That's clear, right? You can't allude to it. I don't know. For you and like for your goals, not, not actually being the jerk that I sound like I'm being. 00:11:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) You know that, right? Well, mode was activated. 00:11:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) think we all heard that. 00:11:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Okay. 00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I didn't feel like it got deactivated. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) didn't hear the. 00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But intention is still advocating for you to get. the results that you want to unless you say like we nobody can do that unless you say I want to do that I'm paying for that whatever that's how that works so you need are they separate domains or separate pages on the existing domain can we just like separate pages on our existing like we don't need to launch entire new domains for these things so I just want to be very clear so the page so you know the scope of the work needs to be clear so that it can be accomplished um so what's your suite law.com right okay um about us would there be anything on the about us page also no you need 00:13:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) It just a standalone page to try to rank for the one keyword. So like if you go down and is it linked from a menu or is it just? Well, there is a page that already exists, but it's not ranking. It could be because the keyword, well, it could be because it's new. I don't know how new it is. It's like you want right we assume it's sweet love, sorry. Oh, well, the problem is we can't really do this because we're not in Missouri. Yeah, we got to do it. I forget how to do it, but there's a way to do it in Google Chrome where you have to go in and appear like you're in Missouri because we're not going to get the right results searching from here. But the page. is based its Missouri personal injuries basically sort of the keyword it's targeting. We could, which is actually not a keyword, but I think it's just based off of the pages that already existed. Well, we could make those, the foreign one should be foreign. The out of state one should be probably like Mark saying, targeting the city name or the state name, and then the brand. So it's wheat law Phoenix, sweet law, Spokane, sweet law, Missouri, we law New Mexico. You say Spokane? 00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Spokane, Spokane, I don't know if anybody says, okay. It does actually look like that, but I've never heard anybody say it's okay now it's again. 00:14:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Sweet law, Tuxon, there you go. 00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) For each city, there you go. exist. All right. 00:15:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, all these pages exist. So that we, this was something that I asked them last week. So they, I went to the SEO people. So all the pages are there. I'm now saying we should probably change the target keyword on these pages to be brand location instead of location personal injury attorney, which is basically what it is now. Yeah, except for California, California will do something we would treat differently. Because I don't think people are, it's obviously said California, but they did purposefully link the GMB's in the one area, and then the internal linking to the location pages are the links in the footer. that's, that's all on purpose. So they confirm that for me. 00:15:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so, but do we have one for Missouri? Yep. Okay. So then the issue is just that it's not being bound, it's not ranking high enough? 00:16:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I don't know the answer to that because I can't search from Missouri at the moment, but that would be the next step as to whatever spoof myself or spoof that you're in Missouri and see where it ranks. 00:16:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Then let me figure out this a little bit. So if we already have the assignment and have completed that there are pages on the process. 00:16:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) don't know where that came from. I don't know how these pages got built. I'm assuming it's Isaac, but we never talked about it on this call, but somehow there's... No, not to the point. I didn't think this page existed until right now, because I didn't scroll all the way down, of course, right, I scroll to the bottom. So I asked the people, hey, are we supposed to? And then they're like, you already have, they're already there. And I said, oh , you're right. I didn't even scroll down that part. I don't know when this Missouri page got created. I don't know if America did it when the office got, like, I'm assuming it was done probably in some sort of coordinated effort with the launch of the office, because it's definitely not new probably had to also do it with the GMB to show the address because a lot of the states need that. So the only issue I see is that they just duplicated a page and changed everything, and therefore they, there was no real target keyword, your key jury, until this fall right now when Mark was like, oh, we should probably make it bleep law, whatever not here. Okay, yeah. But we can go change, I would change that on all of these outside California pages. 00:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How did you get a Google rep? 00:17:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) They emailed me. 00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What? 00:17:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I knew that they emailed me and I searched my email and I was like, three, so I reached out to the most recent one. Yeah, to get there and talk. 00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wow. 00:18:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Um, so then do we need the mark to do anything or do, is this, no, this is more like a Stacy through the SEO people, like we should just go, Hey, we want these outside state pages to rank to switch them to ranked or brand location. And then what do we need to do, right? So, and the they did have not worked on these pages at all. These are definitely carry over from whenever, whenever these pages were originally created, you know, six years ago. 00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so what, whatever pages that we have that are external, I like that our location specific need to be ranking. And we don't even know how many or what they are right now. 00:18:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, no, it's one for everyone. 00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) location. 00:19:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) But I wouldn't do California, just outside California locations. And we want them to rank for brand locations. 00:19:09 - mark sweet Not necessarily meant to generate cases, maybe those fantastic. It's more just to prevent people from thinking that we have. 00:19:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) It's their research to be like, okay, they're because that one's not approved. Isaac is still, but they're not going to approve according to the B&B people. They're going back forth with Isaac. Like Isaac couldn't get Regis to put the name outside on the monument or whatever it's called, listing and the lobby. And they're like, we literally, for whatever reason, they said it's Missouri. Like, we're going to have to provide photo. the evidence that you have a physical office. So now Isaac is looking to rent a different place for that purpose. 00:20:07 - mark sweet Yeah, like do we need an actual storefront like we do not need actual storefront? 00:20:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, it's like you just need something that you can put your name on and go here you go. There's the sweet lot of us. 00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the states that we now are we doing the state specific or city specific? 00:20:26 - mark sweet Well, let's start with first because there's a lot of cities. 00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I want to be clear for some creating a task. 00:20:33 - mark sweet New Mexico, Colorado, Missouri, Washington, Arizona, Texas, So, yeah. 00:20:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, Texas. No, no, no. 00:20:41 - mark sweet No, no, no. 00:20:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's why I had a question mark with Nevada. 00:20:45 - mark sweet was like, do we even want to draw attention? 00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. Okay, what about Texas? 00:20:49 - mark sweet I don't know. That's on the site. You check this alone. 00:20:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Don't mess with Texas. 00:20:57 - mark sweet I don't really want Texas cases right now. Yeah. I'll take them if it comes through like the new sources, but I'm not trying to generate that California. We're like pretty solid with it. don't really need to do a lot more. Okay, so New Mexico, Colorado, Missouri, Washington and Arizona. Yeah, and we already have the two Arizona addresses. So really the primary one is going to be New Mexico, Colorado and Missouri. We can pick the two or three largest cities in those states. like Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis. So these show we've got things in those cities. In New Mexico would be Albuquerque and Santa Fe. And Colorado, we can just do Denver to begin with. 00:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, hold on second. Mexico, Santa Fe and what? 00:21:51 - mark sweet Albuquerque. Good luck trying to spell it out. 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, um, and then Missouri, what would be the St. 00:22:06 - mark sweet Louis in Kansas City? 00:22:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Was in Missouri for a little while. The biggest fog I'd ever seen in my life, where you literally could not see your hand on your face. 00:22:26 - mark sweet Yes, that's for the audience crazy. 00:22:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, um, let me show you one note. That's what triggers the task. Okay, um, all right, so we will work on that, which should be helpful and average and long play. Ah, let's get these news. What is. Oh, valiant. No valiant this month yet. Are any of retainers that are not used to rocker one, let's say. And it's this seven that we've only had. I don't know, that seems kind of odd. Maybe not. Not to him at all. 00:23:32 - mark sweet Uh, yeah. Everything looks okay, I'm not increasing it, should we get it? 00:23:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And Felipe has got three and none of them, the ones that are out of them, have you had to chat with them? 00:23:52 - mark sweet Yeah. 00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I don't know why I always laugh because it's pretty much the same every 00:24:00 - mark sweet I know like they it's in seven days like we need more money. I'm like the you do like you we're not producing where we should know here's the leads in the cost keeps going up, which just doesn't make you make a lot of sense, but we need some of the cases for the moment. 00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, do you know, I'm going to send the email to Stacy, but do you know where we're at with the Josh reports, Dan. 00:24:30 - mark sweet Because there were 1800 a lead and they're charging per person, not per incident. So we need to be like 50% sign up rate and like we've signed. One, two, two incidences, technically three people off of one, two, four, five, six, seven leads. So they're not that far off, they're just. Really expensive for what they are. Um, they said how many leads and you've had three three out of seven, which is close to the 50% but two in the same car. And like, even still, it's high. 00:25:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh, we really need to do the numbers because, like, you were having eight and $10,000, which we have to get this report. Do you know anything about it, Dan? 00:25:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I have no idea what you're talking about because there's a bunch going on. 00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I just said, well, who Josh is. I don't know. First source. 00:25:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I don't have enough data. I don't know where he's at. I know that you, you sent a bunch of stuff to Stacy. And then she wrote you back asking you a bunch of questions about your questions. And I don't know if you've responded to that. And then she's gonna send that over to Josh. But I think your stuff has to do with matters, not the cost per lead stuff. So yeah, no, I never talked to him. Last time I talked to him was with Mark. But he said he was busy and he wouldn't have it to us till the beginning of October and that's the beginning of October. 00:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So. Okay. 00:26:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I mean, I can get him up. 00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is that? Oh, what is the 40% in reference to? Okay. So 40% is reference to policy limits. Max policy. 00:26:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Wait, 40% is in reference to policy limits? 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:26:48 - mark sweet We're getting paid our full, no, not policy, it was 40% No. 00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. How do I answer this question then? What is the 40% Or in the reply. I can't hear you, Mark. 00:27:05 - mark sweet Oh, I said with the riddle. 00:27:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Okay. 00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's the. 00:27:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Oh, feet. 00:27:13 - mark sweet Trying to make you laugh a little bit. 00:27:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Yeah, but I'm trying to not. 00:27:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Is that what you want? You want to know the full fee or do you want to know something about policy limits? 00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's the question. Well, that's part of it. 00:27:27 - mark sweet So we did have the checkbox. Remember where they can check policy limits now. 00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that was new. 00:27:33 - mark sweet Because it's not always just based on number, unfortunately. 00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. So effective 40% by team. Okay. So then policy limits isn't even in this report. That's what I thought that 40% was, but I get it. 00:27:48 - mark sweet Because it does say fee. Because like sometimes we have. Eight people is hard. It's not. 00:27:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So. Maybe not go. That's the attorney fee, um, target that year. Is that in little five mark 40% like how we're getting you. It's in our current report right now. So 40% of the total settlement, right? want 40%. Yes, Thank Oh, so this was something I put in because so I was talking to Patrick and Lorenz about their follow-up and sometimes they'll send several texts and they'll get no replies and I'm like well is it because they don't want a text and they don't want calls and Lorenz said that he thinks that most people in Arizona want phone calls not text messages and what I was wondering is if during either well probably the introduction call if they could find out what their preference is like do they prefer text email phone calls whatever so that we know like if we're not hearing from them on one particular path that maybe we prefer text let's go for text but we don't hear from them then we know and we can we can try their preferred method Is that something that you'd be okay with us? First of all, trying to set up and mark that and let it apply, which I think that they said they already do, but it's not something that is easily searchable and also not something that we can kind of collect any data on and go, what percentage of people say that prefer phone calls, whatever, just so that we can create our systems around and actually, I don't know, because sometimes people say things and then they act differently, so there's that. anyway, I was trying to figure out how we could get more consistent conversations, because some cases just, you don't get replies from people and your team is following up with them, but they're not responding back. And they're not always trying other methods to get a hold of them. Like, they could just be. be sending a bunch of text messages and get no reply, but they didn't or like one example. And this was Dom and I caught Lorenz with it and he was like, I should have caught my team and noticed this. But one client had said that they were getting their phone shut down and they kept sending them text messages and calling but getting no response. And he's like, we should have emailed them on like, yep. 00:31:27 - mark sweet We're called our emergency contact, which also does happen with Ryan's team today here. that client was MIA, probably emergency contact. Actually, Jose, from the day called the emergency contact who picked up and said, yeah, his phone's not working. 00:31:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so just taking that next step. Anyway, what do you think about making that part of the process of asking people what their preferred method of contact is? 00:31:57 - mark sweet That makes sense to me. 00:31:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Okay. then. So then. In Yeah. I mean, definitely not that many. would think because it's if each of the widgets of the block. that's eight and if you're looking at two there of course and potentially 10, 11, 12. 00:33:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I think each one is a widget or yeah, I think that's the word. But yeah, and that's just for you, just so you're aware, right? when you're looking at these things, it's like, okay, some might need to get broken up somewhere. 00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I sent that to Stacy. All right, so what is it? 00:34:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) We also need to do value of retainers by source is what I was thinking over the weekend. I don't know if we actually have that in there, but, and we should also add. We have this either. So I also thinking about this. It should be like dropouts and subouts should be part of that report. So like the cost is the cost based on retainers, but then in that same view, we could see like a monkey this month had 12 retainers that cost off. And then you just have the other method of and then this many subouts percentage rate. This many drops percentage rate, which have no value. whatever cost and or value say that again sorry I was the we probably want to see like what's the dropout and sub-out rate per source per state same thing and then I don't think we're doing this but I just did this for that certainly well I didn't I did the cost per for that certainly oh and the other one would be because this is from uncertainty like how many although this is not done yet but it will be according to Isaac we also wanted to have for each source the referred out how many were referred out and then a rate because with that certainly it's like hey they were like almost one for one but the referred outs aren't real so I still can't know I there's still no way for me to truly get a row as on them because okay well if five will refer it out they are going to turn into revenue but if none will refer heard out right? Isaac is still working with Lidify. He updated Eric and Thursday or Friday. He's waiting for something from them. 00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I forget what it is. But I'm just glad you found Josh because that question has come up. I've asked it myself. Probably once or twice a year over the last few years. And it's all just kind of convoluted to be able to get it. So we can have somebody driving that and actually get to those numbers. That's great. And I also feel like it helps slightly give Mark a little bit of an edge in the conversations with the vendors, because here's what they should take that as a signal. If any of the attorneys are able to track that data to that level, then eventually more of the attorneys are going to be able to track that to that level and start to want to negotiate with them better results. 00:36:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, no, that's never going to happen. But I love the idea. 00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But yeah, trust me, not going to happen. All right. 00:37:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Which opens up my bigger conversation. I was driving, thinking about Mark's business conversation. So I mean, it dawned on me that right now, everything we do is built around like a target cost per retainer. That I assume, and I believe this is true, but I don't actually know the exact parameters or whatever. But it's like that cost per retainer is sort of like built into the model. Like, I need it to be this cost per retainer because of this, this, this, this, this, You know, the overhead cost of this and not everything. Whatever that is, right? profit margin. So A, what is that? Exactly formula. I would, we should know it. It's pretty straightforward. And then it's like, well, why is it that? Is that is your cost? us per retainer. So if you think about the constraints in the business that we've talked about before, like a constraint or perceived constraint was like, oh, pods, we need more pods. That's a constraint. We're being constrained by lack of pods. Another constraint was intake. Oh, we need, we'll go to this outside intake. We do more intake because there's a constraint in intake. As it turned out, there really wasn't a constraint in intake, right? went out, worked, whatever, but now we've bundled more of those leads back in almost all of them. So it's like, that constraint wasn't necessarily real. But the thought behind it was like, yeah, I mean, there could be a constraint there. Is the constraint in the business? And this is a constraint. If you're fixed on, if there's a fixed cost that you can pay for a retainer and you cannot go higher than that, that's the ultimate constraint. I can't acquire customers because why? Because it's going to cut into my profit margin, because my overhead is too high. I don't No, right. But if that is no longer constrained, right, see who can pay the most for a retainer wins. So it's like, well, what if the model was built around, I can pay $8,000 for a retainer? Like, there's an example, right? So then you're going out there and you're like, I'm just going to buy retainers and make the model work around my cost of retainers high grade. It doesn't matter because it works in this model. But then it comes back to, well, what is that model, right? And then there's also the idea of if retainers equal outliers, are you then increasing your outlier math? I mean, and at the core, yes, you are. If more retainers therefore more outliers, if that sort of thing holds true, then you'd realize that over time. So then the question is like, What is that? What could that number be? I don't know. But like, if you can go and if you can go acquire a customer that someone else can. And that might be part of the constraint of what's happening right now. like, Steve can pay $10,000 for a retainer. Well, that's hard to compete with. But what if you're, what if you can do that too? And then what does the model look like in that scenario, right? yeah, maybe your profit margin goes down, right? But what is a lot? What is allowable there? I don't know. But then also you look at the long tail, there's two long tails. One long tail is this outlier possibility. The other long tail is, okay, well, we already know that X amount of past retainers turns into this amount of referral business. Well, then you're also feeding that as well. I'm going to get more retainers. Therefore, I'm going to my increase in referred cases. cases and return cases is also going to go up. But I know that that is a five year horizon. It takes place over five years. I'd say if the business has been open for six years right now, mean, we could probably actually go back and sort of figure that out and go, when did referrals start? What is the arc of referrals and then repeat business, right? That data is in there. So you whatever that looks like now, it's probably gotten to a point and it's probably pretty static and it might just stay there. But it's like if you change the ends, then you're going to change the outs. If you get more retainers now, then that number will slightly bump up a little more slightly. But it's like, it's this whole Dan Kennedy thing. Dan Kennedy's one of his things is like whoever can pay the most for the customer wins. It's true. But as soon as can you do it? 00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, and you can you go without another Porsche? Well, well, can you do that and you the kind of side model of sweet lot that we were talking about which is run the business differently where they're getting a different incentive program and you can still do that too. Yeah, totally, but it's also like, but I think that that's it's not a two. 00:42:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) It's a together thing. Well, yeah, I mean, it can be a you've run it around car models for sure. 00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You can pay more for the case to obtain the case if you're not paying as much to have the case fulfilled, right? 00:42:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) But it's like, what could could you just change it now and not like it's the only change where, hey, you know what, I'm going to lower my profit margin. Like, I don't know how much money. arc lives on above what we're right. So obviously part of it's that I don't need to know that, right? It's just like, this is from Mark, but it's like, if let's say that Mark, like mine's all passed through, right? Like I have a salary and then I get just a bunch of pass through money. The mark price is the same thing or not. And so it's like, okay, well, I'm going to limit my pass through because that money is going to get spent getting retainers. I just need to know that. I need to know, hey, my income's now going to go down by whatever, because I'm reducing my pass through, because it's no longer going to pass through. It's going to get spent in the business. Obviously there's tax implications, right? going save money because you're not going to make it, but whatever. It's just really about what, how do you like, it's reinvesting in the business, but it also has to be like, you want the business to still be profitable. You know, you don't want to, it all falls on. Mark in the scenario, right? 00:44:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) the end of the day, but he's the one that I'm giving. 00:44:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, but he'd be the one that's getting that money, granted it's his money. And it's you're pumping it back into the business. But it's like, what, what does that look like? 00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) considering? 00:44:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, no idea. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So Mark, did you know how many of these cases referred out? And is this accurate? I can't hear Mark when you speak down. 00:44:33 - mark sweet What'd you say, Mark? We try to refer out whatever we possibly can. Yeah. number that actually gets signed up from referred out is very small. Because I would be these, right? Necessarily, that just means we tried to refer it out. 00:44:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How do we track the ones that actually can't bark to you getting paid something? 00:45:00 - mark sweet Yeah. So, okay. Well, that's a two fact, not a two factor, a two step question. Um, one is someone has to accept it and work on it. Step two is that actually needs to settle. 00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that's a long time. 00:45:13 - mark sweet Just because someone signs it up doesn't mean they actually like settle it all the way. Um, because there's a reason we're taking, uh, I won't say a fly around. There's reason we're saying no, right? 00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:45:25 - mark sweet Um, the first question is how many of these refer to actually getting signed up and. It's less than 10%. It's not a huge percentage. And that's okay. Again, I'd rather at least try, then, you know, just say, yeah, screw it, forget it. Right. And it does generate, you know, decent revenue as the year goes on. 00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you have any idea what that is? Because how do you quantify it decent? it a line? Not among P and L's. 00:46:01 - mark sweet Yes. 00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Can you go look at one real quick and tell me what that was for a quarter this year? 00:46:11 - mark sweet So, well, let me let me take out 2.2 million because I think that will that kind of screws things up a little bit. 00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, was it a big case I got referred out? 00:46:24 - mark sweet Yeah, that was a panic case. That was one. Yeah, I don't think it works for 166,000 dollars, though it's not a small sum. 00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, do you get an outlier case once a year roughly? 00:46:44 - mark sweet So how many how often do want to call it an outlier case because this case is we choose to send to like a partner firm. Okay. you know, as our litigation internally gets better, we should be doing less than less. That's about meaning keep them instead instead of giving up 50% of the fee. 00:47:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. So the punish how much of the 2.2 million did you get? Or was that it? 00:47:11 - mark sweet That's what I got. 00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the total okay, the attorney was 4.4. So I realized that these things are outlier. Well, whatever you want to call them, they're not they're not the usual thing. But this is part of the business model. And at the end of the day, it doesn't impact your gross profit margin, your net profit margin, net profits, your margin, your margin, my brain. Okay. Geez. Anyway. yeah. But your P and L's don't track anything by like sources and states and stuff like that. It's just overall retainers and expenses, right? Not like attorney fees and expenses. 00:48:01 - mark sweet As far as revenue goes, so I've never been out by state. Yeah, but not by, I mean, I can pull from case, obviously, but I like going to a quick books and pulling out every single case. 00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But there you don't, it doesn't tell you like quick books doesn't have a report by state, right? 00:48:22 - mark sweet I mean, that source. 00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, your source. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 00:48:28 - mark sweet And I mean, part of this is one source. We don't necessarily know what we're setting up a case if it's going to be a huge case or a small case with limited exceptions. And so I understand what you're like hinting at, right? Okay, if this source in general, we get higher quality cases from how we grow that source, right? 00:48:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, not necessarily. What I want to know is like, who should we, like, because sometimes you're like, well, I'm not sure I'm even going to give any more money to them. you never really have. enough map to know that for sure. And when you throttle them, then you don't have the cases. And there's a whole lot of start, stop, whole lot of start, stop, like just, that doesn't help. You grow the business consistently. So we need a really consistent source of accurate data and numbers to understand what our true average cost per retainer is by source, and then stop doing the start, stop, and pay. But I'm not paying you because I don't think that this like, I don't know where you're getting your numbers for sure. 00:49:38 - mark sweet I've seen a big case come from a fully fake. 00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We have the biggest cases have come from month. Okay, but your business lives off of the fact that all the vendors bring you cases. If it wasn't for all of those, that diversification and you'd be screwed many times over but you start stop start stop with them and I think that's that that's hurting you. 00:50:08 - mark sweet We haven't stopped any of them. 00:50:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well but throttled for sure. 00:50:14 - mark sweet Yeah definitely throttle walker here and there because they're seeing the expensive. 00:50:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Based on what? 00:50:22 - mark sweet We can look what their sign up is at the end of each month. 00:50:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay we don't talk about that like we don't talk about like how many leads you get. I think we need to start having that conversation so I can understand that better. Okay. I mean it's never perfect because we pre-paying. Yeah but still let's let's I mean each month we have a pretty darn good idea of what it costs. It's a significant part of the conversation that we have here and it's not we're not talking about that but it it should be part of the conversation because it's relevant. which is the conversion rate, which is something that we've been talking about. How much of a pain in the butt would it be? And maybe there's a little bit of report we can just look at instead in real time. Two on Mondays when you tell us what the retainers are by source by state. 00:51:46 - mark sweet Also, how many leads we've had by source by state. That would mean seeing the family. I feel like Josh is working on that. 00:51:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The second part. what we're asking for. just don't know when we're going to get it. So it's it's fine. Another thing, so I've brought this up several times and I've looked into it. There are companies that can help train this, but I think all of your people would benefit from call control skills. It's more than just sales calls and like Chris Voss never split the difference like all that stuff negotiating. It's specifically handling because because that is that tactic is really only best applied for the negotiation part of the conversation where your people seem to get caught up the most and this is second second hand information basically about all the rest of the team that not talking to is People are lonely, they've gone through hard things, and you've got these kind-hearted people that just don't know how to handle the call, and they think that the best way to serve the people is by giving them more pheasies, and I'm trying explain to Patrick and Lorenz who can then go explain to the rest of team, that what those people actually want most is to get their case resolved and get the money that they need to to take care of their issues. That's, and that's what Sweet Law is doing for them, and your people get as human beings do, not just because it's your people. Distracted, and they get caught up in the emotion, and they need help, learning how to kind of disconnect from that emotion, and focus on the actual outcome, and the actual service that that the client needs rendered to them and I think until you get some actual training on that for intake as well as everyone case managers attorneys and assistants anyone that talks to clients really should have this you do not have optimal conversations happening and it is a massive lever you could save hundreds of hours throughout the year across all the pods if you train them how to their conversations better you have a recommendation I can't you know I do not have a recommendation I can do research but this is not typical kind of stuff this is this is things that call centers know to do this is the things sells floors know how to do but this would be innovation and an turning situation. So you would have to be willing to do some research and experiment. But if you're going to innovate, which the kind of model that you want to have, the kind of leverage that you want to have, the kind of freedom that you want to have, that's innovation because that's not standard for an attorney office. I can do some research and say, these are the ones I think you should consider. 00:55:25 - mark sweet I'd be happy to do that. If you got two or three, mean, might run through their basis, but it makes sense. 00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I will do that. Let me send myself a note real quick. Because I've had this for over year and would like to see it happen. If it helps and you'll just try something, I will go do some thorough research for us in that one of them. 00:55:55 - mark sweet Most training is good. Most training is good. more skills are always better. 00:56:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I will do some research and I wouldn't make any recommendation to you that I wouldn't be willing to put my own money on. Oh geez, I'm bad at word, I need to do this. Dan, do you have any updates or anything to share about the pivot table that Stacy was working on with the Turndown Reasons, Month, Turndown Reason, Percentage, et cetera? 00:56:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, that's tough, weeks and weeks ago. 00:56:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Where is it? 00:56:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) It was for Isaac, so I sent it to Isaac and he updated all the Turndown, he came up with implementation, because I didn't know that that's live. 00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I feel like that would be something we could look at and get some insight from Nope, because it's not that accurate, right? 00:57:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) They were just the pivot table was on all the stuff that they were Classifying other right so they were just using the same words Really be a thing But then I came up with new categories and gave them to Isaac and then he implemented them and litify Going forward it will be going forward. It should be that when we go look at other. There's very few others Right, so it was other and then hundreds upon hundreds of variations of whatever Right, so I ended up coming up with some new categories with mark. Like I said send remark. It's a Sometimes, and then I gave it to Isaac and then he told me that he basically kept the old ones and then you put do not use next to them. So if you look at old data, you'll see those are selected with a do not use, but they're hopefully not using them going forward. So if we run a report, it should be none of the do not uses are from whatever, we don't get the data implemented every But now going forward, it's they're more specific. So it's there were lots of stuff like like different ways of saying that there wasn't enough insurance. And now there's just a category for that. There were different ways of saying that there wasn't enough treatment or a gap in treatment. Now there's a category just for that. So it should be going forward when you look at the turn down reason, like it's a more legitimate representation of that. And then you could start to look at that. herb and herb, is what I just did with adswordly. I showed those guys, I did this manually, but I showed them, hey, leads break down like this across five states. So your top two categories are, I might get this wrong, but it was something like this, no injury and gap in treatment. And I said, therefore, my theory that your people are signing bad cases is true because they have to be signing them from some chunk or those chunks, because that's the most likely place that they would sign them from. So whereas we don't sign them, we send you back the data that this is why we're not signing it, because 15% of your cases have no injuries. So now you could be able to run an important future on monkey and say, show me the breakdown reasons monkey generate and it will be interesting to see how these vendors go across compared to each other and It was very consistent, like across states, there's slight shifts, but for the most part, the same sort of hierarchy remained across states. 01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I don't have any other questions. We have to get to another call, but first, Mark, did you have anything else? 01:00:20 - mark sweet Have we started on the go-high level for Chona? 01:00:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Not really. And do we want to just start building it out? 01:00:31 - mark sweet Is that what we want to do? Yeah, or at least I know she can use as a basic scheduler because. 01:00:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Oh, is she in the office now? 01:00:38 - mark sweet She's currently in the office. She's been there for about 30 days and their office is about as much of a show as you can imagine. 01:00:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) So, are the docs that you sent over from the office that she works in or that that was some other places? 01:00:53 - mark sweet That's from other places. But right now what she needs to most help with is scheduling in follow-up. Mm-hmm. And then I know. Okay, let's get you on the calendar and, like, basically here's the open dates because it does a really good job. 01:01:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah. So what I've, Eric and I have been, are building like, uh, I did a shitload of this last week, so it'll apply to this. I went and started building out like the things that we reuse over and over and over. So I swipe stuff from your account that we build and swipe stuff from other accounts, like a follow up sequence, but we're implementing that in a, in a, a, just like another site that we're going to turn into a snapshot. Um, so it's not done, but it's close to done. But if she tells us, I just need to communicate with her and be like, what are you doing exactly? Cause yeah, we have like a calendar thing and a reminder thing. The first is like just a straight book or call, we'll call it, then yeah, there's one built for that. And then you just sort of use it for the, for the business of me being. And then she needs to, well, she doesn't have to be on. a Google work thing, but it's better if they are. We can dig into that. 01:02:04 - mark sweet And they use Outlook before they have, but I can set her. I can fill the website for her and do a Google account, so it'll just be clear. 01:02:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, it might work with Outlook. I don't know. I've never used Outlook there, but it might. 01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Oh, we're still late though, but I'm going to send an email. I'll CC down and mark so that we can just get this conversation going. And that can be a reminder of either setting up a conversation with Chona, or if you can give me some of what you need, then I'll ask her because I'm talking to her anyway. 01:02:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, like do we want to get the leads into high level would be my first thing. So like where are they coming from now? 01:02:45 - mark sweet How will we do that? Right now, it's from the doctors directly. The biggest thing that she needs help with and that their problem is the following up with the patients who like don't show up or don't have reminders or like don't know where to call her. That's their most immediate issue that needs to be solved. 01:03:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Right, but how does the doctor get to lead? 01:03:11 - mark sweet From a different doctor, usually from a chiropractor or from a law firm. 01:03:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, we'd have to solve for like. Automating those in ideally automating those in the high level. There's probably way. Or a two step way. 01:03:26 - mark sweet there's probably a two step way. My guess is having a dedicated email that it gets forward or sent to. 01:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yep. To say here. 01:03:34 - mark sweet Okay, I know you guys are really late, but just work. right, cool. Thank you. Okay, sending email. Bye you guys talk soon. mark@sweetlaw.com,dan@danddcompany.comTina MarieBasis Integration/Sweet Law
00:00:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) or emails over 10 days. 00:00:02 - Bobby (Basis) So I was going to load her up. All right. 00:00:06 - Eric That's awesome. 00:00:08 - Bobby (Basis) And that one, do we have individual location pages for Sweet Law? 00:00:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) We do. 00:00:14 - Bobby (Basis) All right. 00:00:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) talk to Mark and we're going to change the focus keyword on them so that it's brand location. Sweet Law Missouri for the Missouri page. Then he wants to add like city specific pages. So like there's like it's like a flippity block, right? So you have, he already has like Tucson, but he doesn't have an Arizona page. So we would add an Arizona page. And then similarly in like Missouri, there's a Missouri page, there's no city pages, but he wants to add city, two city pages to Missouri. So it's, but it's like a flip. up. So we're going to add city pages, others we're going to add a state page, but the idea is to cover each state from both sort of from both views. So like for California, he doesn't have a California page. So we would add a California page. 00:01:18 - Bobby (Basis) Okay. 00:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) And then make the focus keyword brand location. So personal injury which he just wants to show up for the brand brand city brand location. Yeah, whether it's a city or state. 00:01:39 - Bobby (Basis) Okay. All right. And so do we so I guess we just have to determine which ones are missing and then active core fill in the blanks and then change the focus keyword. All right. Cool. All right. Um, figure out why Lidify isn't updating correctly determine why all of the old data is no longer there for GMB leads. 00:02:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Uh, I think Eric and I stumbled on something Friday, but then we didn't follow it all the way through, but we did find there was like a duplicative automation that was running that right at the tail end of it, like the end of the day. Right, Eric, you were like, wait, this is GMB. 00:02:31 - Eric I was like, maybe that's the cause. 00:02:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, we haven't figured it out. Yeah, we haven't stumbled onto it. 00:02:39 - Eric Yeah, I don't want to say no, but I don't think because it was, I don't know. We didn't fit. Yeah. 00:02:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, so we might have found a breadcrumb shooting it. All right. Meanwhile, a hundred percent on the duplicative automation that we didn't know about. 00:03:00 - Bobby (Basis) Oh, go ahead and check it There you go. Let me add it and then go out. 00:03:03 - Eric Check it off. 00:03:05 - Bobby (Basis) I have done that on my own to do list before. 00:03:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Good job, self. 00:03:12 - Eric Yep, exactly. 00:03:14 - Bobby (Basis) Just seeing that right through. 00:03:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Looks good. It's meaningful. 00:03:20 - Bobby (Basis) Mirror-valiance keyword strategy. 00:03:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I cannot get, I just have an email to Google rep this morning. There's just something wrong with the account. I don't know what's wrong. They're telling me that it's not approved. It's approved. I'm going to credit cards not good. card's good. But I've dug through my emails and I emailed this Google rep that emailed me. we're going to help you with your account. was like, great. Help me with this account. Let's see, does that work? 00:03:50 - Bobby (Basis) Yeah. 00:03:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) But yeah, accounts the card. can't run cards at all. Basis or D&D. Crazy. 00:04:00 - Eric And I'm paying the house. 00:04:02 - Bobby (Basis) All right. Implement the strategy that we're sent to us. 00:04:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) So what's her name? forget her name. Sent me all the categories for the things. I think I just sent it to Stacey, where I'm about to. This flag might not be sent yet. Abish, I can DJ to build all the category pages based off that templates that they have. And then Eric and I, this is the new task. We need to figure out how to back-categorize accident posts, which I'm guessing is a thing, but I'm not sure. 00:04:50 - Bobby (Basis) Back-categorize, which post? 00:04:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) The accident news posts. 00:04:57 - Bobby (Basis) OK. 00:04:59 - Eric Got it. And. How, uh, what are the categories going to be? Just like, no, yeah, it's like bike accident pedestrian accident. Okay. So, so we'll, okay. We'll need to go through them individually then to see what kind of topic it is. 00:05:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, there's like 20,000. That's not happening. We're going to, we're going to do some sort of is keyword in title, is keyword in blog, but like we got to have to figure out a different way. Gotcha. Okay. There might be tags like I haven't dug that deeply into it, but. Yeah. So this was always the part that I was like, how are we going to do that? We can't be the first to do this. 00:05:41 - Bobby (Basis) Then again, have them before. So your chat GPD says, yeah, we can be the first people to figure it out. 00:05:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) We can probably like get the post IDs and then get, like, I'm sure there's a way. to do it programmatically that it's not, you know, click, click, click, click that would take then we had to train the blog writers to use them which is identical. 00:06:13 - Eric Should we make a list of categories or do we already have those? 00:06:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, I got those. Those guys sent them over. I've got them right here. I'm actually adding the categories to the categories of WordPress and then I'm going to send it to Stacey's to those guys. I've changed a couple of the names because they're not quite written. 00:06:32 - Eric To be more, we add more SEO. Yeah, like hit run. 00:06:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, hit and run. Yeah, hit runs not a good one. 00:06:41 - Eric Okay, awesome. Awesome. Then they'll be in there. 00:06:45 - Bobby (Basis) All right. Okay, so we've got those two for Sweet Law. 00:06:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Anything else this week for Sweet Law? 00:06:59 - Bobby (Basis) All right. right. I'll quiet on the western front with Empire. 00:07:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Well, quiet, all right church, church miles. 00:07:08 - Bobby (Basis) Um, strong marriage now. think it's just waiting to get built, um, and brain and new. So other than, yeah, that sequence, I might have figured out. 00:07:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Well, yeah, so I'm going to do this sequence and then having chat GPT. I got to confirm chat GPT is right. But I asked chat GPT, I want to make a private podcast, blah, And it kicked out the name of some company I've never heard of. And it's specifically said for delivering lead magnets. 00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, what? 00:07:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Um, so I got to go find that in my chat. 00:07:46 - Bobby (Basis) You put my many chat GPTs. try to separate them. Yeah. ask chat GPT. 00:07:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Hey, you remember I do that all the time about the thing we're talking about. Yes, matter of fact. It spit one out, and I was like, oh, I got to go. 00:08:02 - Bobby (Basis) I know a bunch of people are going to say that they have this problem. 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) But then it's going to be, there's three things. This is what I wrote the email sequence around. It's got to be one of three things, software tech. How do I get it from here to there? Software, like, how do I build a playlist or hardware? don't have headphones. It's got to be one of those three things. just don't know. Is it going to be all hardware? it going to be hardware in this? Look at idea. If you can't use the thing, you're not going to buy the thing. 00:08:40 - Eric That's right. 00:08:41 - Bobby (Basis) All right. OK, cool. So that sequence will be loaded. So hopefully this time next week, we've got some, someone has responded to us to tell us how. 00:08:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah. Hopefully, yeah. I mean, yeah, people are and it's only going to people that say they've done. Right. So they're. It's like that's going to next year. They're all right, they're all Funnily enough, I got a testimony about Jodie's beats over the weekend. 00:09:08 - Bobby (Basis) Oh, nice. 00:09:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Someone just texted me, they're like, I used those beats you sent me, when did I send them to you? 00:09:14 - Eric Like, I even remember doing that. 00:09:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) They work. Yes, they do. So we don't all get more. 00:09:21 - Bobby (Basis) You got that down? 00:09:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Oh, nice. Yeah, go to brainandnew.com. 00:09:30 - Bobby (Basis) All right. Yeah, cool. Anything else for this week? 00:09:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) I got to get Eric. got the same. I need you to send the color coding thing to the dudes for the family. 00:09:51 - Bobby (Basis) But I've mentioned that then, to the super point, you'll be like done. 00:09:58 - Eric Yeah. Yes, sir. 00:10:00 - Bobby (Basis) So is that task I'm hearing? 00:10:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) Yeah, I'm going to send them basically, what do they call it, design book? 00:10:09 - Eric Yeah, yeah, it's like a style book. 00:10:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) We need like a style book for bamply. 00:10:19 - Bobby (Basis) So who's that go? Is that? So would that go to Greg? 00:10:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) No, Eric's going to, it's in, I'll send him what they asked for. It goes to, I don't remember, there's a whole manager thingy. 00:10:33 - Bobby (Basis) All right, cool. All right, all right, we'll get those in. I think that's it then. Hey. All right, cool. Have a good week, everyone. 00:10:48 - Eric Thank you. 00:10:48 - Bobby (Basis) Thank you. 00:10:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com) All right. Yes. Thank you. dan@danddcompany.com,bobby@basis.rocks,stacyedwards425@gmail.com,durosewebdev@gmail.comTina MarieBasis PM/Ops Meeting
00:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Hi, how are you? Good. 00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I am not. Huh? 00:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) COVID number three. 00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no. I haven't had that for two years, but I've got asthma and terrible allergies and I'm allergic to everything around here. And yeah, just trying to figure out, but I think I'm gonna have to do shots. 00:00:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I've been avoiding it. Oh, allergy shots? 00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Well, I kids immunotherapy can backfire sometimes. so, but at this point, the the benefits are that the medicines don't work for me. I've done everything I can home you pathically. But anyway, I'm physically miserable. I can't think about anything else. I haven't been able to sleep. So I'm grumpy. Hi, Fujii. 00:00:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) You know, after you told me you got was it COVID and then it like wiped you out for I actually went and got my COVID vaccine because, you know, my whole family had COVID about two months ago. but yeah, I was around them. never got it. So I was like, okay, time to get another booster. 00:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:01:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) After you told me your story, was like, oh man, I better actually do this. 00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Everybody goes through it differently. But because I've been hospitalized with ammonia four times in my right lung is almost collapsed and it scarred like, you know, you just do some basic math and go, I'm probably one of the ones that is better off getting it, whatever's going to happen. Okay, so let's go over your homework. And get some traction for ya. Allergies are a . 00:01:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I've gone through periods where my nose runs and yeah, just so thankful. 00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) never had it. Yeah, some of my friends, because I grew up in the country, you know. 00:01:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. Some of my friends had to, yeah, do the shots and it was terrible for them. 00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) My brother does it. My mom smoked the whole time she was pregnant with me in the 70s. I have a spine of But I asked your throw this arthritis, my skeleton looks like I see cucumber with all the spurs, I had cataracts and seven, like, I have fibromyalgia. It's just a mess. And I don't like thinking about it. 00:02:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I'm like, I got stuff to do, man. 00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't, whatever. I try not to talk about it, but like, it is work living in my body. Anyway, okay, are we in the one document to roll them all? 00:02:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Like, where are we at? Yes, let me get that open. 00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll open it too. One. It's time to get the humidifier and essential oils out too. It's at the bottom of homework recap, you know. All right, all good. I had that open anyway. 00:02:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I just got back from jujitsu. Oh, yeah. You encouraged me? We're gonna do... That's right, love it, felt good. 00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good. 00:03:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I've beat up today, but you know. 00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's not too bad once in a while too. Sometimes we need to, we need to, we need to have somebody like, you know. 00:03:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) That's about 50-50, like half the guys I beat up and the other half beat me up. How it should be. 00:03:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) At least 70, like, 40, so 30. I can do math. Anyway, you know. Got to up that a little bit. Come on, Fuji. You do it. All right, let's see. Okay. Number four. Good job. Personal change. I have to look at all the headings first. 00:03:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) RPVs completed. RPVs are. 00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Return visits. 00:03:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) All right. 00:03:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Visits. All right. Um, so it's change from the month of month. Number. I told you this, it's from Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, good job. 00:04:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Bless you. 00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Missouri. Revenue expenses profit by the month. My job. Elizabeth expenses. Rough number of visits. Wait. Rough number of visits. 00:04:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Like for what. This is. So I looked at how much I paid her, and then I divided it by her salary, which is $35 a visit. 00:04:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:04:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Elizabeth's visits. Yeah. I should have, she should have seen about 186, which if you look on the left column H, like he loved one 79 and we, we think the differences is because she does work notes and work notes paid $12.50 per. 00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Worknote. 00:05:01 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So I think that's why it looks like she billed for more than she did. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:05:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. 00:05:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So can you track work notes? 00:05:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Not easily. I have, I'd have to, we'd have to pull like, my system still uses Google Calendar. So I, that's how we're counting these visits. 00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, you could create it as an event in the calendar also, like performed work note or something like that. If that's your current system. Or put it in a spreadsheet or something. 00:05:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. So put it like in the calendar. 00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) me ask my manager where he's counting the numbers and then we could just put the work notes there. Yeah. I mean, none of that is a really great system, but if, at least start tracking the relative data. So because what you don't want to have is doubt, cast in any way. and not not for the benefit of your relationship and not also for the benefit of the finances. And so once we start digging into things, you're gonna you're gonna want to make sure that you can track everything just for those reasons as well. It's human nature sometimes to just wonder. 00:06:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to my manager about that. Okay. Everything else lines up like so Jasmine here, she had 27 and then that correlates with how many we counted on her calendar. She already had 82 and then it shows that she had 81 visits. So that was probably counter-core by two work notes she did. Okay. Yeah, so everything else works pretty well. 00:06:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Awesome. 00:06:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And then Diana hasn't gotten paid. So I think she's gonna pay me. She won't. don't know. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So. Hey, this is Henry. Yeah, I should ask her. 00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm going to highlight this one so I just remember like this is where I want to look at most. This should have a conditional threshold too. See if I can do this quickly which is make it red if it's over 400 or do we want to make it over 500? 00:07:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Can you walk me through how you do that? 00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You highlight F. Okay so hold on second I'll show my screen real quick. You see it? Yes. Now I've got to get the zoom out of my way. 00:07:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Hold on. So you right click on F you know. 00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah hold on. Okay so um not the whole column I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like take a section that's gonna cover a few years basically. I'm going go to, I'm sorry, conditional formatting and then is greater than, what number do we want it to be? 00:08:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, 450. 00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 450. 00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Right? 500 marks says that's starting to get 47 and 400 is probably right on. So I think 450 would be a good like middle ground to shoot for. 00:08:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's, I'm going to change it to 400 just so you can see it. 00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. 00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Format. So format, conditional formatting. 00:08:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Mark didn't have like a, you know, a, you know, scientific way here. Right. working days. can see 20 patients a day to most people. 400 would be the max one doctor to see. And I was like, okay, yeah, that makes sense. See? Okay. 00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, um, we can change this. Did you see that? hold on. Oh, close that. I go over here and then I click on this. No format, conditional formatting. It'll show me this one that's already there. And I can change the range if I wanted to and I can change the number here. 00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I think if you change it to f2 colon f without the 63, it'll do the whole rest of the row. Without the 63. 00:09:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's cool. 00:09:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I think that's it. Yeah, it's an out of it. How long are you going to thousand? Okay. 00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like that. 00:09:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I did not know that. Good job. 00:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's quite each other things. 00:09:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I did last night. Good job. Well, that's interesting. Okay. So my goal then is to get 450 visits a month and I or 400 say and I only did that in August when because I think in August we had the prior month we had 373 referrals. So some of those got booked. August, I think that's probably why that number was so strong in August, because the trailing month had so many referrals that we pushed to August. You see, like July, I had the strongest number of referrals ever, 370 down referrals. Yeah, lot of those we pushed to August to just to fill the dates. 00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That makes sense. 00:10:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So I think maybe what I need to do is I need to start shooting for another like 50 referrals a month. 00:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, and maybe also that the target be roughly 375 referrals a month. Yeah, 400 referrals a month. Yeah, something like that. 00:10:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, okay, I know how to do that. just, I need to, I need to, I need to make myself do it. 00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) could get that. Okay, what do you have to do to do that? 00:11:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Well, When I got this incredible number from zero or my 87 that first month and 120 from zero, I was literally cold calling like probably eight hours a day. was calling like four people an hour or five people an hour and just talking to people at law firms. That's how I did it. So that sounds fun. Yeah, there's lot of denials, a lot of secretaries that when let me talk to their case managers, but I don't know, I got through to enough and yeah, it was pretty incredible. Like from zero, I thought so. And then I did that pretty much though all the first months, like all these months, was cold calling and I stopped in about October November. And then I hired the management companies and it got me to where I am now or not management companies and marketing companies. But now they're just flat. 00:11:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like it's not really doing anything. Have you talked to them about it? 00:11:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Like what can you do to get more? Yeah, and again, it goes back, they're just like, you know, we put you in touch with these law firms, it's up to you to close the deal, you know, we're trying, but you know, sometimes having the doctor talk to them closes the deal and they'll start sending it to you. Honestly, I just haven't done it. So I need to get back. 00:12:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's some targets, let's get some targets about what you will do each week in volume rather than a particular day. It'll be up to you, but I would recommend though that you block it in your calendar on a particular day. However, those types of conversations are our specific energy types, right? 00:12:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Like if you're not in a good space, you're not going to have the best results. 00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The thing about time blocking for me is not that I'm rigid about it and not that it exists on my calendar in a rigid way, but that I'm aware of roughly how much time I want to spend on it. And so it flew it in my mind. At this point, I don't even put them on my calendar anymore. I just know that that's how time much time that I need. And also because I, I create so much space on my calendar. 00:13:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So it works that way. But basically like whatever my big rocks are for the week, the most important thing. 00:13:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, if I want, if I think that to be effective, I need two hours, then I'm, I'm making sure that I've got two hours and it's going to happen sooner in my week rather than later. Oh, and, um, to get it done. Yeah. 00:13:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yes. So then nothing. 00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And because, because you don't know what's going to happen throughout the week, you could get sick, whatever. And then you lost that opportunity. But if that was a leveraged activity and that if it was important to growth, then, you know, you've kind of missed the boat and now you're delayed and you don't know how long you're going to be delayed, whereas you could be reading the benefits of having done that work. So you, you definitely want to put the, the things that are most important first. 00:13:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Well, I would like to, I would like to do this more intelligently. So I think what I'll start with is maybe I'll commit to one hour twice a week. And that should be, I I call it one person every 10 minutes, sometimes faster if no one talks to me, but I feel about six patients, six law firms an hour. So I'll try to call 12 law firms in a week. And I think my strategy this time is first, I'm going to look at people that have referred to me, but haven't sent anything like they referred to me once, but then they never sent the second one and follow up with those people like, Hey, what happened? Is it just a matter of me reminding you that kind of Yeah, speaking of that, I wonder like, how much a direct response type of approach might work? What do you mean, like, actually, is going up with their door? 00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, direct response is something definitely to look into. It just I'm trying to think about how I want to do this. So if you're going to be in business for yourself, all business needs new business needs new sources of business needs new It's all different even if you're, but even if you're B2B business to business or B2C business to consumer, you still need lead sources. So understanding, marketing and persuasion, but also understanding what makes buying decisions. And buying decision could also be applied to whether an attorney refers somebody to you or to a different doctor. So it's a dense read, although it does have a companion that was written by one of my clients. It's a book called Breakthrough Advertising. Breakthrough Advertising is a study of over a hundred years worth of marketing. And it was written in 1996, the author actually passed away, but his works belongs to one my clients, who pays his wife. anyway, but it's referenced repeatedly by marketers and copywriters. But what he did was like, like some of the old ad campaigns, he just studied. so many of the ad campaigns and you could see the psychology, you can see what are, why certain calls to action work and it was just, it would be worth the effort on a lifetime value, by the way, to kind of look at that and see why people buy what they buy, do what they do. It'll help you with it, it will help you with this, it'll help you with the test prep stuff, oh yeah, and it'll take, it'll take time but learning marketing psychology and buying psychology will be really useful for you. Marketing is everywhere, you'll start to see it in schools, you'll see it in businesses, you'll see everybody's using propaganda, right? Propaganda aka marketing for your particular topic or or thing or whatever. So anyway, if you've got Edit. You should get the companion companion guide. think it's BreakthroughAdvertising.com. I don't want all of this. Because the whole reason, I told them to write the book, this thing on the left, Breakthrough Advertising Mastery, because this is so dense, people don't finish it. And so this has like glossy pictures and breaks down the stuff that you actually need to know like levels of awareness and the whole process. What do you call it? Kind of just the process of rising through, so becoming aware of, especially for Delta, right? They're not most of your people are not even products aware. They don't know that there's a thing that exists where they can go get a brain scan report and use it to kind of help them map out their longevity. Anyway, but yeah, this would be really good for you. I think it's a long term assignment. It's not a hurry up and get through it. It's kind of wrapping your mind around things, but yeah. Because so direct response to this was like I was thinking about maybe postcards, but in addition to your phone call, one thing Mark does is he has Jasmine, I think, go and meet doctors. But he goes to their offices. She goes to their offices. And rather than meeting with the doctors, meets with the people at the front desk because they're the ones that actually are doing their referrals. and they buy them lunch and do things like that. And it gets a return. We're still trying to track the return because it doesn't work equally across the board, but there's 00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) definitely some lift that has happened. 00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) learning how to like measure things would be good. And there's so many different reasons why somebody would choose you versus not. Maybe you're at the top of the list physically and or maybe somebody else pissed them off that day. Like there's so many reasons it could happen. But what you want to do is increase the likelihood that they'll choose and why. And people whether it's consciously or subconsciously go where they like somebody most. So like ability has a lot to do with it. But the other thing is just simply being top of mind. If you're at the bottom of their mind and somebody else managed to get there at the top. And the thing that can cause being top of mind could be just frequency. 00:19:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) That's why we do repetition right? 00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because it gets stuck in your head and you can't. So how do we create that? Is it through any kind of like targeted ads where only only those types of doctors would say, hey, don't forget, that would be rude. Anyway, but postcards just, I don't know. So the logistics of it are not something I know or can know, that would be what we have to discuss, but I'm giving it to you to kind of like mull over and think about how could we apply that type of understanding about why people make the decisions they do, which is just being top of mind and then also like ability. 00:20:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, it was one of my friends that he owns a tree company, like tree trimming company. And he's like, he's like, don't even worry about telling them about your product. He's like, just ask what they do and find out what they love. And just, if you can get to know what they like, they'll remember you for asking them what they like. So I actually have to force myself to do that when I'm cold calling like, you know, Secretary, she's like, oh, OK, I'll go back and look great. So if you have a second, what do you do? And so now I try to do that. And the thing I struggled with back then is keeping track. I just, as soon as I hear it, I forget it. 00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) then, yeah. So you know what you can use Chat TBT for that? 00:21:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, I don't know. 00:21:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, somehow record my interactions or something. So what you could do is just open the app. And you could basically just wire talking. First, open it and say Chat GPT. Like, I'm going to have this conversation with this person. 00:21:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I need you to repeat this data. 00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, interesting. And so when she says this, you said, oh, OK. So you like blah, blah, blah. And then you say that, Chat TBT records it. And then when you get off the call and case, so and so, remember these things. And it has memory. So you can ask it to remember that and then go back. 00:21:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And then be like, summarize. I'm trying to keep track of, or I want to remember what we talked about, please create a one pair of summary about what we talked about, so I can give a 100%. 00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then like, if it doesn't give you a good summary, say, okay, but you missed this part and you missed this part, these are the types of things I want you to pay attention to. 00:22:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) These are the types of things I want you to ignore. Oh, that'd be fun. Okay. Yeah. fun doing that. 00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:22:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Game of thought. I just, I just sent you a new invite, my, my manager made this, it's called Canteo Sitas Sitas. 00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't know what it's got, I think it's a lot of firms. An email? Okay. 00:22:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) We shared it. It's a Google sheet. And look at sheet two, I'll call it summary, summary sheet, or look on tattoo, I'm sorry. So what my manager did was he looked at the prior month. So these are September numbers and he showed me how many each firm sent to. So, like, La Lazari, these do the same, but they are my bulk, right? sent me 86 in September, sweet lawyers was number two. That would be, I all Morgan sent number three, right? And Toronto Law sent number four, so solution now number five. Anyway, when I was my thing that I was thinking when I target those, when I do these calls, is I was going to go after these people that have only sent me one or two and essentially be like, hey, how was my service? You know, what can I do better? How are you? Can I get to know you? 00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I don't know. I hold on, let me just do this real quick. Data, source, column B, one, two, three. Whoa, I just did it, and then I undid it. That's weird. 00:24:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) It's possible that my manager used a formula to bring these numbers in. 00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, I do undo then. Let me see. 00:24:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, he was using count a function, I think. 00:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, let's see. 00:24:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So I think he dragged all the referrals into this cheat one, and then he used a count function. To bring in these other numbers here. I don't know. 00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) can ask him how he did it. Okay. Well, then here's what I'll do is copy. Okay. Okay. Special values only, and then sorry. I just want to sort it right now. Yeah. Oh, what is it? G. Okay. 00:24:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) That's what I want to see. 00:24:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, cool. The majority of your cases. 00:24:57 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) These are the same. I should just go to 60. 00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Plus 26, it's 86, right? 00:25:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Change that really this guy. That they're the same. OK, there you go. Cool. Thanks. Looks so pretty now. 00:25:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's do this. OK, so this number is 37. This number is 25. That's 36. And this is two hundred and fifteen. 00:25:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I've met these case managers in person. I've met suites in person. met ILS in person. Never met these people at all digital solution. I've met them. I've met them. I've met BD and J. I've never met these guys. I met these guys. Everyone else said all digital people. So these two. 00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've met these guys. 00:25:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Actually, met these guys in person. 00:25:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's do it. 00:25:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) But wait, how many of these have you met? Do you want me to like mark them in green? I met these guys, met these guys, these guys. 00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That was a painful green. Does that not hurt your eyes to look at? You're young, so probably not. Well, that's better. No, it's like your question though. 00:26:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) it not? I like to make it to me. 00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) see it wrong. 00:26:41 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I met this guy. Okay, yeah. That's a little crash. Wait, there's a same one? Oh, crash and crash. should be 11 then. I'm going delete this one. is my preventable choice. Okay, yep, that's it. 00:26:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What about these two? 00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. Oh, yeah, that's the same because they're reported to 13. There you go. 00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you always want to start with the win first. 00:27:27 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) You know, a lot of those areas actually has case managers that are like, you know, they rotate. They actually have, I think 34 case managers. I've met 20 of them, but I could start reaching out to the other 14 that I don't know. Yes. 00:27:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, but what you should do is ask a case manager that you have a good relationship. Say, Hey, I was thinking about reaching out to some of the other case managers. And seeing if we could get, you know, more going, who do you have any recommendations or somebody really? like that I could talk to and kind of warm that up because, again, it's a like ability and a know ability. So if they're talking with each other, you like it. Anyway, we don't know that that would work, but the likelihood because it's a human being, right? And we like who we like and we help who we like. So I would take that approach first. 00:28:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. So I asked for like a warm referral essentially. Yeah. Okay. How many should I do that and how many should I do just like? 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would literally work that whole company and then go down the list of all of these things. 00:28:42 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So Mark, when I used to get like closer to 100 when I was starting these guys and Mark was like you need to be very careful that, you know, all your referrals aren't coming from one source. 00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's okay. 00:28:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I'm wondering if maybe I should start like a little lower down. 00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) on here, like maybe in the middle. Well, yeah, you could. So this one, then by that logic, anything under the threshold of 21. Because percentage-wise, so let's figure this out. So this equals this divided by And then format number percentage. Whoa. Oh, don't make me do that, pay special. don't know. Man, you want that. Okay. if I do it twice. 00:29:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Thank you to put dollar sign, right? 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) divide it by two 88. 00:29:50 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. You have to put, I think you have to put dollar sign to lock the second value. So I'll ever change. 00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, Nora. 00:29:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) you. let's say you do it. 00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, like where? 00:30:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) It's like there. 00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:30:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) 30. I think it's dollar sign before the G and a dollar sign after the G. I think you put one dollar sign in front of the dollar sign. what the dollar sign is. In front of the 30, I think. 00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, oh, got it. 00:30:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So fixing the column and the cell. believe. 00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because you want to keep dividing it by two 88, right? Yes, I don't want it to keep dragging down the cell below. Okay. Which is what the formula would have done. 00:30:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, there you go. Oh, thanks. 00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Great. 00:30:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. 00:30:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:30:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So this is a bad mark. Yeah, this is actually about the number. Mark was like, make sure you're not getting more than like 25 to 30% of your pearls from one place. Hey, we're right there, actually. Hey, okay. Good. 00:30:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I don't to earn her money every week. 00:30:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So I'm like, how do I offer value? I know solution now. They're pretty small. Beverly's pretty small. So I I actually think I'm getting most of these guys's referrals now. and Jay, these three are massive. I know I can get more from them. Hillstone, I can probably get more. is about all they're going to give me. JT is big. I should really get more from them. Wilshire, Marques, I probably should not take any more from Wilshire. Alpine, I don't know. MNY is giant. It should get more from them. Barnes is giant. I should get more from them. Okay. 00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who? I didn't start this at the beginning. 00:31:34 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Did you say Morgan and Morgan? Yeah, they're gigantic. 00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) KJ. 00:31:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Let's mark all of these so that you can start going down and you can just have a list and you don't even have to think about it and just come in here and start working the system. Okay. Oh, yeah. I don't know why they're not sending me more. 00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm seeing a little Benji. That's gigantic. Boom. Is that? 00:31:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Or is it? 00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How do you say it? I'm sorry. Fung. 00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Is that Anne? Yep, something wrong, caught and fung. 00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mark was trying to get her to work with me, but he's like, she didn't want to. He's like, she needs you, but no. 00:32:12 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So funny. Um, I know her husband really well, TJ. 00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, he said that they've got little kids and I'm just like, man, that's that's rough when you're trying to grow. 00:32:27 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I think because I'm just turned 40, so they're going to be true. You know, they, uh, I think that was their third or fourth. 00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, they're, they got their hands full. Yes, they do. That's a lot. 00:32:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) A lot. 00:32:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:32:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So it's now 50 mil, so they're getting up there. 00:32:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's what he was saying also. And that starts to come with management headaches and managing poor kids is a lot also, even when you get help. As you know, with. 00:33:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Ew, huh? Yep. 00:33:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, okay. 00:33:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) right. So B, A, D and J, I actually know one of the case managers really well, so ask for a warm lead. 00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Before, let's see. Yeah. 00:33:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. So I don't know how I divide. Some of these, like, I don't know. I don't know, like JT. I don't know. 00:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Alpine M and Y and cool. Before you write anything in here, what I'm going to do. Is put a goal to if we doubled. What we got from each one. Yeah. So I'm going to, um, double. So. Where's the yes? Okay. we're going to, I'm just going to do this. Equals this times two. And then I'm going to take these out. This, this, this. Holy crap. That can't be right. Oh, what is this number? I need that. to be some. 00:34:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Let's see this. 00:34:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So currently we have to flip over. So we're at 300 and we want to get to 400. So if you were able to get double from each of these existing law firms, which would be easier to get a more yes than a new yes. Yeah, it's true. You would be able to hit your targets 50 more a month. Yeah. So just massaging these existing businesses would strategically make more sense than trying to go get new ones. Okay. Because you have, let's do that first. 00:34:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And it's less painful for me because I because when I call someone that's already referred to me, I feel better because I'm actually just showing my gratitude in instead of asking for something necessarily. So yeah, it's an easier call for me. It's like less painful to do. 00:35:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So and think about that and everything that you do, there's all different ways that you can create leverage. Right now you're leveraging existing relationships rather than going out and creating new ones. And it reduces the friction on an emotional level for you but also on the barrier level for establishing a new relationship, which is significant for it. So anyway, but good job that he already had done this. 00:35:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I'm gonna have my, I'm gonna have my manager. I just changed the first tab, the raw data. So I'm gonna have him do this every month, essentially just drop in like October's data and then make us a new tab, know, for October. Make us a new tab for, know, September. Yeah. 00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, let's do this. This is great. Thanks, Gina. 00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And so what do you, what do you think I should do for like, like, for BD and J? Actually, I, I text with this case manager that sent me all 13 names, Grace. So I should just ask, hey, Grace, I'm trying to expand or I'm trying to get a few more referrals from good sources like your firm. Can you put me in touch? Like, do you think you can put me in touch with one of your coworkers kind of thing? 00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Actually, I'd go about it two ways. I mean, I would, I would say two things. Say, hey, guys, there's couple things I want to say. First of all, thank you for all the business that you've sent me. know, just, just kind of a one-man show trying to take care of family here, whatever. 00:36:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Your, your version of this, right? 00:36:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sincere. don't say it if it's not real, but just like, just wanted you to know, I really appreciate this. I so, and then go, well, okay, maybe it's three parts. So one, want to thank you too. wanted to actually like, I don't know if you can do this. I don't think the attorneys can do this. is whatever, but can you like send her a lunch some year? I did that for a lot of Zari in the first month. I was sending them DoorDash. 00:37:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I sent like 15 DoorDashes to their specific case managers once they sent me a referral. stopped doing that because it was just a pain. 00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, then you outsourced that, have somebody else do that for you. But those relationships are huge. And man, people, food, it's not just a way to a man's heart, right? Like, know, was just like, feed me, please. Thank you. Um, yeah, DoorDash is a great way. So say, so one, thank you. Two, I was wondering if I might be able to send you something, like, do you ever like get a craving for a dessert in the middle of the day or lunch or something? I could DoorDash it to you and, and, uh, whatever, like, I could just have it, like, you just either plan it right then and there or say, here's, here's. to my guy, he's going to reach out to you. you just be like, Hey, whatever his name is thought I take you up on that offer, like whatever doesn't seem the most awkward. I don't know. But then the other thing would be like, and because because I'm looking for growth, I thought that I would also and and I would say, you know, like, I don't want this to take away from my thanks. But I would also want to know, is there anybody else that in the firm that I may talk to or any other thing that you might send over? And like, I'm still grateful for all you do. And I'm still going to keep checking in on you and taking care of you, because you make a difference in my business and my life and my family, like, because that's my approach. Like, when I think about my family, I think about their families, like, we're all people. And it's real, like, and I can be authentic about it. So it has to come out whatever is authentic for you. 00:39:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Anyway, It's not true every time every time I get a referral for July. It's like I think every time I get three referrals I'm like that is one less day of anesthesia. I have to do I mean, I don't know anymore, but like it pays the same So that's why like I tell the case managers every time you guys send me a couple like thank you I I yeah, I get home with my kids for one extra day a month, so That's what I'm talking about and Like maybe I can't do that for you, but I can feel your belly and I feel like give you some happy food or something like that like Yeah, what do you think about I used to send them lunch and it was hard to coordinate because you know They had to not bring their lunch on a day. I had to get it at a certain time, which I did But it was just it was a lot to coordinate. What do you think about like you said just sending a snack on DoorDash like What do you think about just like cookies or? Something sweet or coffee because then I don't have to necessarily have it on a day where they deliberately don't bring their life lunch and deliberately during their lunch break, you know, hour. Sometimes I get got there late and then I missed their hour and then they're like, oh, I had to eat it later. Yeah. 00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What about me? 00:40:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) you mentioned like just sending a dessert. Okay, so you think a dessert like cookie or what do you recommend? 00:40:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Cakes, pies, but you can you can ask them like, what's your favorite kind of dessert? And then find something nearby that offers that or like, what's your favorite dessert on DoorDash or whatever, just randomly send it and be like, it'll keep until you're ready for it. 00:40:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. 00:40:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But it doesn't have to be like that hot kind of thing. But you could do like, dessert. I like, I like fresh food anyway, better than some of the gift baskets like Harry and David's. I do like Harry and David's gift baskets because they've got good quality food, but a lot of them are garbage. But I wonder if you could do like a DoorDash code, like if they were really smart, they would have like some corporate account where you could just give a one-time code with a certain kind of limit, like, and it's almost like works like an Amazon car, but it's a right? dash card. Door dash card. 00:41:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I hate your cards. They all expire and I hate them, but I see what you're saying. 00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, okay, so what is harder? Is it like coordinating or doing something like this? So there's door dash gift cards. When do they like how long before expire? 00:41:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Also, who's going to let that expire? I don't want to let them expire, but like I forget to use it. 00:41:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No door dash. Okay, gift cards do not expire. So then you could also have your guy or anybody on your team be like, hey, so I just wanted to see if you use your gift card. Don't you know, because we might send another one or whatever. 00:41:45 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I don't know. But you look up that first link down there. 00:41:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says send an e from door dash. Yeah. I mean, that's what I was talking about anyway. I'm not an actual physical card. 00:41:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay, so I could like just get these and then just send it. I'm kind of afraid because technically anything I send email can be audited, but maybe my manager sends it to them, then I can like kind of skirt around them, I don't know. I don't want show that I'm buying the case managers. That's why I would do it through my phone, but I guess it's a peanut my phone too. 00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, anything that you do anywhere, anytime could technically come into something, but it could be sent from a Gmail account, Yahoo account, an AOL account, like. But if it's unethical, I don't think it's unethical, doctors think they're referring sources all the time. Managing sources that be are overreaching as they are, you know, not bad. 00:42:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) It's like if I get subpoenaed. 00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and managing kind of like, whatever, it's a little bit. 00:43:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:43:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's when I'm getting that. 00:43:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Oh, I see. 00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's overreaching. Okay. 00:43:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Um, yeah. Well, me try with Grace. And let me just do the standard where I'll just be like, hey, my, you know, oh, But then Paul's going to need my door dash code. 00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, set up a separate account. 00:43:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah, but I have a really nice account. 00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have. 00:43:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Oh my gosh, Fuji. 00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the point of the system is getting new leads. 00:43:30 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So you want to keep it as simplified as possible. 00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So don't, don't like overthink it too much. 00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. I'll pay for the, I'll pay for the dash pass on the new account. We're paying for access. Remember? Okay. And one client is going to pay for all four years. Yes, you're right. Yes, I get it. 00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) One referral pay for the yes, I get it. 00:43:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. Yes. Okay. 00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's very good. Thank you. I know we all get into our miserly. phase from time to time and don't do the big picture math. 00:44:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) But yeah. Thank you for reminding me. OK, so this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to first get Paul, my manager, and account. He actually just messaged me. He's like, hey, what else can I do to help build the business? I was like, well, you're doing great on tracking the numbers. That's very helpful. But now we can actually go after new business together. So I'll give him a door dash password and account. Now, I'll trial this on the people I know, like, Grace. And then just be like, hey, Grace, my manager is going to reach out to you to buy you a little snack. 00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then let's set it up. What you could do to help him kind of do this is have him go do this retroactively. 00:44:47 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So wait, is this all time? So if you look at the raw, look at raw, the other town. 00:44:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. So when he did this, he copied all the September inbound referrals. OK, so what I want What we're do is do this retroactively for everything. And then what we're going to do is we're going to get the existing pace of increase, right? So that we have month over month the average increase for this firm, for this firm, for this firm, because you can take into account that that was probably already going to happen. Then what you can do is give Paul a bonus when that threshold goes above and beyond what the projected increase would be. So this is minimal, right? Pretty much any increase here is going to be good, although I don't know the previous number. So we don't want to say that until we've got the previous numbers, but does that make sense? So like whatever our original rate of increase is, you don't get a bonus for that. But anything that exceeds the threshold of the existing rate of increase, then you can get a bonus for it. And maybe it's $20 for every 1% or something. 00:45:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) That makes no sense. literally throwing out numbers, but so you can see the math that I'm thinking that we can use something to apply to. He's very happy right now because remember he lost his other job, so I had full time so now I'm paying him 3000 a month, which in Guatemala, he's like, oh yeah, I see like definitely figure out a way to incentivize him for like next year or or even just incentivize him in general to keep working hard. 00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, and you have to keep in mind too that whatever I can show you on my screen, my master list. 00:46:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yes, actually I need to share with you. I'll just put you on, this is the one we can't mess up, but I'll put you on. 00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Peter, don't touch it. 00:46:40 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Got it. I'll put on email should be coming soon. 00:46:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, there it goes. 00:47:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So this is how I run, this is like essentially our, our database, it has column A, the name, second column is data birth, third is the data of the accident, and then so on and so forth. And then on the L, M and N, it's the data referral, the data service one, which is like sometimes too. This is where I was extracting the other data, like I did, I did that mirror, so I said mirror data, and this is where I was getting it. But I think there must be a way that Paul could mirror the data, and then essentially just pick September's data, and October, like if he manually sets the rows that September, October, and then he could pull the data without having like copy pieces. Yeah, it would be a range. Oh, yeah, range. at the range and then just be like, hey, I want this data, put only the offer name. 00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And the range could be like 10, 1, 0, 24 to like 10, 31, 24. Yeah, October and so forth. Yeah. Yeah. 00:48:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay, I'll work on that. I think that that might make it more efficient. So I'll pull this data into another spreadsheet. And then from there, like tab number two could be September, number three, October, and then you and I can set it up with that, those formulas you did. Okay. 00:48:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. remember, we do want all the historical data, have him do it. It's worth the effort because then we can see the trajectory and the rate of increase if there is any. But then if we keep doing it, we can also see what stalls and as you've seen, every time we look at the data, there's some kind of, oh, I didn't know that, and oh, I didn't think about that every single time. the new thoughts create, first of all, new questions and new thoughts on top of them as to what's the lever, right? What's the thing that you could leverage? for example, automatically just sorting the firms and seeing how drastically they compare to everyone, and knowing that Lalazari, how do you say that, I don't know? That they're at that 30% threshold, but nobody else is anywhere near that. so just reaching out to those existing ones and targeting for more if you can do it, all of this, right? It's just you have all this information, but it creates instant clarity as to what is the best logical next leverage step to do in order to get where you want to get it. So one thing I would like to do though is Let's see in the one document to rule them all probably. So revenue is not directly proportionate because it takes a while for the cases to close. 00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) That's why I really like tracking it with the number of referrals and, you know, for the month. I think that's just a very solid way. 00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So I guess just because normally what I would do is do a projection and be like, okay, if we increase this by 100, then what do we get, but we can't do that because that correlation doesn't really. 00:50:35 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) On two years, we'll see the benefits. 00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) For sure. For sure. definitely going. yeah, just maxing out that threshold of how many people are coming in and then also creating the system and whether it be some sort of automated or at least delegated system of contacting people so that you get them in per second and third visits. you know, necessary and it's ethically makes sense to try to get somebody to do that, but those are the biggest revenue levers you can use. 00:51:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) You don't have to worry about ethics, Tina, just say what you think, and if I'm like, oh, that's pushing it, I don't tell you, but I want to hear the unfiltered things that you would do, forget about I know what you mean, I don't know what ethical or not, so I always want to put that caveat that I'm not suggesting to do anything unethical, but sometimes something might be according to your business model and things that I don't know, so I want to hear the unfiltered thoughts that you do. Okay. If I think it's fishy, then I'll be like, okay, well, probably shouldn't do that, but if not, I love the idea of creativity. Okay. Oh, this is great. I love this call. All right, this is. All right, so what I am committing to is I'm going to make a new spreadsheet and what we're going to be looking at is law firm data. So I'll work on that. I'll finish that before the next call. I guess I should bring it into this one though Paul is going to be using it too. So I don't want Paul to see this. Okay, so I'll have it on what Paul can work on. And then from there, I'll pull it into this one document to rule them all thing. Yeah. Okay. 00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then we'll have and this will be kind of like our dashboard of, you know, KPIs that we're looking at to see how we're doing and what we could be doing better. 00:52:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Did I have a second tab on this one document or should I try to put the law firm data on the same tab. 00:52:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, and not put that on the same tab. 00:52:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) would definitely put it separately. So once Paul processes the law firm data, then I'll take that. and mirror it onto any other tab. 00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Yep. 00:53:04 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Will you set the notes this call? 00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, I will. 00:53:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And my homework, I guess. 00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I will do that as well. This will be a really good use of time. you're going to commit to one or two hours a week next week starting. 00:53:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) six patients, six fluffers an hour for two hours. if I don't have a response, I don't want to let myself off the vote. if Grace doesn't get back to me, I still want to, I still think I should be calling. 00:53:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I recommend that we make this and the other homework assignment, the penalty homework, because that's how important they are. 00:53:54 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And I don't want you to not do it. Oh, I'm just saying I don't want to not do it because I'm going to tell myself. My head, oh, I'm just waiting for Grace. But if Grace doesn't get back to me, I should start calling another law firm, just cold calling. 00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 100%. There is not, I'm done until you've actually had a conversation with somebody. 00:54:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) OK. 00:54:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let me just choose them right now. 00:54:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16. OK, I'll finish these. So I'll call at least one case manager from each of these 16. 00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK. Well, fill up your hour. 00:54:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) So if you can't get a hold of somebody and call them all, what would you do? In my hour, I just move on to the day. Or, well, if I've already called on 16 in the hour, then I'll start going through the people I know, like, hey, Grace, I'll do this message. Or no. Maybe I should do the message first, is that what you're saying? 00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know. I'm asking you what will you do with your time once you've used it all and didn't have enough conversations to keep the two hours busy and you've gone through the whole list. 00:55:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) What would you do? Well, I should, I want to, I think I would probably do this buying people lunch thing. 00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So set up the door dash for, yes, that would be an excellent use of time and towards that single. 00:55:25 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. Well, should I call first or should I do the warm leaves first? Well, wait, wait, on these, I already know the case manager that referred, so it's, it would be warm lead already because I know the case, so I'll just call him to say, thank you. I saw you said one, I wanted to see how it was. 00:55:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what I said was that one, you should say thanks to, you should do the door dash offer three, you should ask for the introduction or more cases from the height, from the high first, like this one. 00:55:57 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Okay. Yes. Oh, that's good one. So number one, get door dash. for Paul, bite the bullet. Number two, thank these people that have done one-offs and offered to buy them cookies or dessert. Three, go after the case managers that I know personally and then ask my ask. Okay, I can do that. 00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and then in addition, get disorganized so that we've got all the data from all the months and then we'll create a formula where we can look at the rate of increase month over month and then you figure out and bring to the table next week unless you already have put it into place and let me know what you can do to kind of deputize Paul and help him, have him help you accomplish this so you're not having to do all of it and you're leaning more heavily on him, allowing him to improve his value and also maybe earn a little bit more money. 00:56:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) No, mean I totally expect him to do this because I am paying him. ridiculous amounts for what I'm all intelligent, so I will try to assist him in making it clean like this for us though. 00:57:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, the biggest thing is just that it's optimized that it is Kind of like error-proof the better the system is that the least likely it will be to make a mistake But also the clearer it is and the better if he can understand it, then he can know how to be successful Faster and then also that takes time off your plate So you have more time for higher level activities like this, which is creating the strategy for what you do next Okay Good job, Pudgy All right, that's it. 00:57:46 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I will send you the notes. I'll go. I was gonna tell you one more thing that I got excited about You know the position referral thing. Uh-huh. And the rest I don't that thing was where would I see this I think you gave it the homework it was called Fujinaka Growth Forecaster Spreadsheet and the physician recruitment where's my drive that's called Fuji Growth Forecaster there it is yeah and if you look August 2024 there was a big drop-off between July and August for Renbaum recruiting went from like 9,000 to 4,600 and that was because for the contract I made 5% off my recruitment for the first 18 months and then it reverted to 3% so that's why there's this giant drop-off in the amount I made so what I was thinking was asking the owner of that company hey when you put me back to my original 5% in return I will do what's called editing work for your for your doctors like when they submit their med that legal report, I'll edit it, I'll read it, fact check it, make sure it's okay. So my wife and I were exploring and obviously I wouldn't be doing it. I didn't tell this, but I would, I would have, I would train a couple of Guatemalans to do it for me and using my chat TPT thing that I was just going to ask you what would that cost you to do? Yeah, essentially it would cost me about the Guatemalan, each Guatemalans about a thousand a month for full time. So I would have two, so about $2,000 a month to do probably two to four hundred reports. So I think it would make, like the margin would be about 70 percent, we figured. Okay. So like if I made, like just this account would make me $5,000 off, I don't need, I don't need two of them to do it, I just need one, but it made me about five extra thousand a month off of $1,000 of cost. 00:59:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think that that's a great plan to do that. Yeah. 00:59:58 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. is like this other column. Here at CME, this contract is fixed at 2.5% and this is how much I'm making, so for these guys, I was going to go to them and be like, hey, can you give me 5% and I'll do all the editing for you, and hopefully this will double. 01:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's really good. 01:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I would expect this to double, and then I would have to hire second one at that point. 01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I love that. So again, I just want to reiterate. So getting all this data organized and it not seem tedious, but every time we look at it, it marks a question, which returns revenue very quickly. So when we looked at what's his name's face, and I still don't have an answer yet, and then you probably don't have it as to if he's happy with your reports that you went to chat GPT because he was yeah, he's like, I'll let you know. He hasn't complained yet, so that's something, but almost every week we find something that can be. that you do very quickly to get you thousands of dollars more, if not more. It all comes from analyzing data that you already have but haven't been looking at or organized and then looking at it. So just a reminder that it's the same thing with Mark and it takes him months to just do it and then one day he'll be like huh and he'll finally just go get some numbers together and we've got a whole new plan. So if you were to do stuff like this every week, which by the way we're not finished with all of the homework because one of the things was to basically do the level of work that we just did with July for all of your businesses. But when all of them, when we have that understanding of their data inside out and what the leverage points are for every single one of them, your ability to double your revenue without increasing your time spent working. Just we just get their songs. much faster. I really do think that that's possible, especially because of what happens every time we do look at your data, you're like, Oh, we can do this. And like, that's brilliant. 01:02:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Love it. 01:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So let's keep doing it. All right. Well, you it's Monday. Have an amazing week. 01:02:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) I hope you feel better. 01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Thanks. I will send you the notes and the homework assignment. 01:02:23 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) And I will talk to you Monday. Yep. Next Monday, we're good for the same time. And then just confirming the following one. We are good for the same time as well. 01:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so 14th and 21. 01:02:36 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) We are good. Do you need a movie day? Oh, wait, maybe I need to reschedule movie. We're moving to a new house on October 21st. 01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I remember the house that just popped out of nowhere. 01:02:48 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) Yeah. 01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You guys like on a walk or something? I'm sorry. 01:02:52 - Fujinaka, M.D. (3) What you want to walk or something? 01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no. You definitely have to help us. Can't sounds good.

00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hi, how are you? 00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning? 00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it. 00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's the tourniquet on this one. 00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's bruised from the tourniquet. 00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did. 00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today. 00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail. 00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool. 00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things. 00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business. 00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur. 00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop. 00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill. 00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And so we'd have this emergency meeting. 00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck. 00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever. 00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things. 00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire? 00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I quit working for them. 00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right. 00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this. 00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do. 00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress. 00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan? 00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work. 00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anybody else will lose their mind. 00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before. 00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed 00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that. 00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah. 00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have. 00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay. 00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) because I have a three o'clock. 00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already? 00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over. 00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's been crazy. Either by either by. 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll let you share. 00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant. 00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago. 00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation. 00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro. 00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that was great. 00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum. 00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, that had been costing though. 00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp. 00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area? 00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry. 00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's so much. 00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020. 00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, is that what made you post the... 00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels. 00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day. 00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today. 00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep. 00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive. 00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are. 00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way. 00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com. 00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap. 00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here. 00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you? 00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did. 00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend. 00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay. 00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much. 00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time. 00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO. 00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) COO's thing is that it hates 6,000. 00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way. 00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, what's the common denominator? 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know. 00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator. 00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both. 00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either. 00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business. 00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off. 00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's 00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic. 00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense? 00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number. 00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled? 00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no. 00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app. 00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do 00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community. 00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person. 00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators. 00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem. 00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work. 00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) wouldn't want it. 00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize. 00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah? 00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway. 00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart? 00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten? 00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you want me to ask her to do that? 00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with? 00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are? 00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work? 00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone. 00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell. 00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What are the roles and responsibilities? 00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes. 00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do they work? 00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job? 00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anything else? 00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now? 00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So what has your team consisted of in the last two years? 00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now. 00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Who's missing? 00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues. 00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger. 00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships. 00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) know you care about people 00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate. 00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea. 00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask. 00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let her answer the questions. 00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay. 00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Bye. 00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align. 00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut 00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby. 00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to 00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum 00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is. 00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call? 01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right? 01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine. 01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her. 01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work. 01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead. 01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that. 01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you? 01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay. 01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know what I mean? 01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you. 01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so. 01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever. 01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, cool. 01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hey, hey. 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name? 00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having. 00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like. 00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Got it. 00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ. 00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. 00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute. 00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It could be a dog. 00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth. 00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God. 00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome. 00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book. 00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy. 00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business. 00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people. 00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with. 00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything. 00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some 00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) but nickel and dime you. 00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, try to be miserly with you. 00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows. 00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there. 00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community. 00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's worth $10,000, it's not. 00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in 00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) in that connection is, right? 00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina. 00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah. 00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah. 00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) that make sense? 00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem. 00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his 00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You 00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away. 00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that? 00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food. 00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right? 00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that. 00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it. 00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo. 00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you know Brooke Castillo? No. 00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller. 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board. 00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this. 00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is it currently like, does it lose money? 00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you. 00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So how where is his current lead to coming from? 00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads. 00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it? 00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, I don't know. 00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay. 00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah. 00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever. 00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And also it helps create the kind of scope. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle. 00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks. 00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity. 00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before. 00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads. 00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel. 00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500? 00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product. 00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How much did that, would you, have to do. 00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%. 00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise. 00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This is a lot that's happening. 00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it. 00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads. 00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes. 00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What's her name? Cara. Sure. 00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree. 00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years. 00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she? 00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right? 00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive. 00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified. 00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me. 00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl. 00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel. 00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It was funny, but it has universal applications. 00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't. 00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors. 00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I can do this better. 00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up. 00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You have so much to bring to the table. 00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down? 00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school. 00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So you can just be like, Tino can wait. 00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on. 00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well. 00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document? 00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine. 00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah. 00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) All right. There it is. 00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence. 00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) if you try to force it, you're going to break things. 00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it. 00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Was that me too probably as well? 00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) that me? 00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants? 00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now? 00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me. 00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way? 00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps. 00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps. 00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time. 01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%. 01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support. 01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60? 01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay. 01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, here, start capturing. 01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it. 01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section. 01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things. 01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine? 01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it? 01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Cool. 01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale. 01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Any eye chatbot? 01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it? 01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems. 01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow? 01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days. 01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two. 01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Is it you just call it optimization or scale? 01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are... 01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one. 01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll hear you. 01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them. 01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama? 01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Amanda. 01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly. 01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well. 01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two. 01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources. 01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels. 01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels. 01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it. 01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I totally agree with that. 01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it. 01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see. 01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week. 01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Everybody do their stuff. 01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But I love using my brain. 01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases. 01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, we are magic together. 01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree. 01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right. 01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy. 01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business. 01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing 01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her. 01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and 01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like 20 minutes. 01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets. 01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I really like bullets too. 01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads? 01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay. 01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link. 01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in. 01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Either one without profit drivers. 01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay. 01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And then I could also put the link in the chat. 01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at? 01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too. 01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There. 01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it. 01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot. 01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That is not a good color. Sorry. 01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway. 01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go. 01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right? 01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter? 01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope. 01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope. 01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support. 01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support? 01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think I can help strategize to chatbot. 01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed. 01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I know, yeah. 01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it. 01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I 01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it's awesome. 01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, that's smart. 01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later. 01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops. 01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like one idea. 01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anything else on a screen? 01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes. 01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so like I'm not available via text. 01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call. 01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire. 01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever. 01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads. 01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. 01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but. 01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to. 01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional. 01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support. 01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry. 01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant. 01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay. 01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank 01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions. 01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck? 01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. I know. don't. 01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here? 01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No. 01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay. 01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment. 01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that. 01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer. 01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself. 01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Director, how's that? 01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. 01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well. 01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, for sure. 01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think that sums it up. 01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront. 01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan. 01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and yes, and that has lots of value. Okay, so you're amazing. You maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sorry, was that a good morning, but then I remembered it's not morning for you. 00:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. Yeah. and let me see if I can switch this story. No, I feel like crap today, I'm back at bad breakfast, and I just had way too much blooming. I made the mistake. There's a new pancake house I got opened up and I had some eggs baking and two pancakes. I only had one of the pancakes, but I'm still feeling like crap. So I'm even sweating, like, and at 70 degrees in the house, it's not even that bad. 00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I can teach you some things that'll make you feel better, because I have those issues too. 00:00:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And yeah, I've spent thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, and my sister says I'm a walking science experiment, which is true, and I'm also cramping really badly today. I wanted my Maria time. So I'm glad that you don't know, of course. Yeah, I know I wouldn't cancel. And but I probably will after this not work because I could listen to my body, too. And, you know, just not work. Just relax. And then, you know what? I'll wake up tomorrow morning, totally rejuvenated, fresh, ready to go. 00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm just, I know I wanted to take tomorrow, because it's the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend starting. 00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I'll just at 1230 go with Amanda and my mom and we'll go to like parks, blueberries, and do a little mini trip in the fall, because all the fall colors are nice and stuff here. 00:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So it's really cool. Aw, that sounds awesome. 00:01:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Now, isn't that like a friend, a sister, who's a mini? 00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) is my partner. Okay. I didn't know that. 00:01:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I didn't. Yeah, because I hadn't really talked to you about her when we started and we lived together. And she just got back from Wales. She was in Wales visiting her dad and mom. She's from Wales. 00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I have loves in my family. A lot. No way. 00:01:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Uh huh. 00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That is wild because I feel like it's like 12 or 14 something. 00:02:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, I'm gonna look it up. Keep talking. Yeah, no because years and years ago I Just enamored with everything Celtic and I traveled through Scotland and that area and bought myself a really cool Celtic ring And I was just always attracted to it like From Welsh area like yeah, yeah, it's very much so well the whole Scott is Welsh area, but yeah The actual original high priestesses like which you really stuff is like from Whales and Merlin Merlin's from Wales Yeah, yeah, the whole King Arthur stuff Merlin. 00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's there's yeah. Yeah, I get goosebumps. Okay. 00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like I I I've always No, did and I even traveled north of Scotland to Orkney Islands where that's like the original human We're found or something really it's just so such I've always been drawn to that area and I know I married Rudy a guy like like While ago, but he also was from Europe. So I just think there's something about the Europe stuff. 00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And my parents were Lithuania and they're born in Lithuania. 00:03:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. But yeah, but we typically don't talk a lot about it because she's really high up at the hospital here in Ontario. Like she's in charge of the whole woman's department, like big time. And so she just for her business too, she doesn't really, you know, come out even though she was married to another woman like ages ago. So I'm bi, like I'll just say it on bi. And so it was funny because when I divorced Rudy, lot of my friends like, you you need to be married to someone probably in health care, because everyone just takes so much from you. You need someone who's like a doctor or some kind of conversation. know, I know, I know that funny. And then my friend, my friend, you know, as we're drinking a bottle of wine, me and my friend, Siobhan, that I've known since grade six, and we've been best friends since, and I was her maid of honor wedding and all that. She we she just said, we're going to get you on elite singles, which is a more dating site, more for professionals, right? I don't know if it's in the US, but anyway, it's called lead professionals. Yeah, and then, yeah, and then that was about five years ago, and then we just started dating and like she, yeah, so she's so, she's the opposite of me. quite funny because I come from a conservative family as well, and all my dad and everything, like I vote liberal now, but my dad and family vote total of conservatives, their oil and gas executives, everything. So she even she's like, I never even dreamed I'd be in a family that's more like progressive conservative, like PC, like because she's really, she'd be the one that was out of all the protests, right? And she'd be the one like having with unions, which is younger, you know, because she wasn't a union before. But now, but now yeah, she's in charge of like a $25 million budget, like wow, 50 staff, nurses, you know, and smart and amazing. Yeah, and she's a very strong leader and a really good coach. Like she's just a really good, she's very, her emotional intelligence is off the charts super high. Yeah, so it's good. 00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How long have you been together? 00:05:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Uh, we've lived together about four years now. We met five, six years ago. So yeah, yeah. 00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) don't know if I'm the one that's supposed to propose or whatever, like, because we're not really waiting stop, but I sometimes wonder if I should. Yes. 00:05:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But we live in a house. We could have our dream house like a couple blocks away from the water. And that's sort of maybe why, thankfully, but I don't ever want to use it as my crutch. I don't ever have to worry that I'm going to be out on the streets, right? she makes like, know, pretty, very high executive salary at the cost of stress, though, too, because so she's, you know, stressed out. 00:05:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) in the hospital world is massively stressful. 00:05:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's so much beer. Yeah. Well, yeah. and stuff that hurts her heart, too, because if she sees stuff, Being run wrong like it hurts her because it's like I came into health care because I want to help people and When in which you see some stupid stuff happening, then it hurts just hurts our heart, you know, so yeah Yeah I have a new spounce and sadness. 00:06:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. I'm also like on my period. So like everything is extra extra extra Okay, so I'm absolutely 2% wows like they could go through and change it. I'm 37% What you go away? They keep changing it close? I'm gonna share with you my little interesting thing 37% England and North Western Europe 19% Portugal, so that's changed because originally they had that at 12% my father is First generation American on his side because his mother well on his mother outside because his mother was from Portugal and long, you know, generations, but his dad was navy and so met her. 00:07:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. 00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And then 10% Ireland, 7% Germanic Europe, 7% Scotland, 5% Central and Southern Philippines. 00:07:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Wow. 00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) 4% France, 3% Eastern China. Wait, my African has gone now? That's interesting. 3% Northern and Central Philippines. I have South and Central Philippines is 5% and 3% North and Central Philippines is 3%. 3% Spain, 2% Welsh. used to have 2% Nigerian and 1% Cameron and Congo. So I wonder if that how that got absorbed because nothing here is Africa anymore. That's interesting. 00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, DNA is how much was Scotland? 00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Scotland is 7%. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, that's pretty high. So what's your highest one? 00:08:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, England and Northwestern Europe and then the second one is Portugal. 00:08:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) God, I got it. 00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, okay, let's talk about Joe. 00:08:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you think that? 00:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) yeah. Any other like you gave me an update and I was barely coming to consciousness. um, uh, on your, so you haven't heard back from the one client? 00:08:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, uh, he did. Actually, it was really sweet. And maybe just to give it justice, I'll just read it out. Let me go to Facebook. So you can see what response was. Yeah. Um, he's had a lot of happen to him in the last two weeks. So he just wants about a week to look over everything, but he feels it's the right thing to do. 00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh my God, that's so excited for you. 00:08:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, I'm excited about what we, yes, but I'm excited about what we went through yesterday because I know. If we make a right power pitch and stuff, and even if I make a video of that on my Facebook page, I know that we'll get a couple clients, and maybe we just, if we wanted to, yeah, get a client a month, you know, like, I just told my Samantha, I call her my Samantha. 00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So she is, she was Cory Michelle's project manager. She actually lived in a house with Cory Michelle. They called me to see Palace. What? They were so cold. The women that lived there, there were so many women that lived there. was just like, I would have call it like estrogen something, yeah, but Samantha is a little racier than I am. 00:09:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that whole family, but anyway, so she was her project manager and I was Cory Shane's project manager at the time. And so we ended up just like, we're like souls, like, just, we love each other. 00:09:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like, I love you. Like already. 00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And so we didn't talk for a few years, just kind of living life and going through stuff, and then we reconnected a few years ago. And then last year, I'm just like Samantha, my mission is like I've got to talk to women more. I need to feed my legal connections, I need to draw strength from my sisters, and I need to give strength to my sisters. And so we did that, and then I did that with my friend Stephanie and a few other people, and I'm just like, I love when I listen to God, because he loves us, he loves his daughters so much. And yeah, anyway, so I was telling her about the stuff that we're doing, and I'm like, I would be so happy, because honestly, Maria, I don't think business is my lifelong thing. I feel like when my girls are grown, that God is going to have me going to these third world countries. I don't know where I'll be, but I think it will be. And it's interesting, because I'm reading this book by Clayton M. Christensen, who was also So LES that he's passed away, and he was a Harvard business professor, my guy actually has learned from him and done business with him. I feel like weird and dizzy, but anyway, what's it called? Oh, the prosperity... Hold on, complex? The prosperity paradox. So basically the premise that I'm picked up so far, because I'm barely into the book, that most of the time when people have prosperity, they want to impart it to other people, like donate money, but that's not what you need to do. What you need to do is teach people how to be prosperous for themselves. It's the whole give them an edge teaching how to fish kind of thing. And I don't want anything in life. just want to be a service. I want health, want energy, but my joy... it does come from making other people happy and laboring. And I could see myself just going and teaching like you've seen how ideas just come out of my head and I can structure it and create an implement. And remember I told you about patriarchal blessings? Yes. My patriarchal blessing and I received it at 19 told me to study leadership that it was important and that the Lord had an important work for me to do and that it was that I would help people find and follow the path back to him. But it would be through leadership. And I don't care about leadership from an ego standpoint. I don't care about hierarchy or pecking order. I'm just as happy following as I am leading as long as good leadership. But I'm not afraid of it. A lot of people are, you know, they don't want to step on toes. don't want to whatever. I don't want to step on toes. But also I just know the value of structure and getting things done. I just kind of plow through and apologize later. Anyway, but to this point, like I don't have a business I'm trying to build. I don't have something I need to want to sell. just want to take care of what I need to take care of and enjoy what I'm doing while I'm doing it. Like for me, it is the journey. So if you were able to create this offer and I'm able to take care of the families that I'm financing and still be able to have enough money where I can grow for the future in case I can't work or something happens to my guy or something happens to our money, because nothing is guaranteed, especially with our government in their over a few months. I'm like, I would just be, I just think about that. like, that's all I want. I'm very simple. So if I got to spend my days and part of it is working with you and we're blessing other businesses. just think what I'm so simple that would make me happy. I was thinking about that this morning. 00:14:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) thought I would share that with you. Thank you. Yeah. No, I kind of the same too because I think was it you that I said, after I hung up a few, I don't know I said that to you, but I said, a man, a man, I've had known her four or five years ago. I'd be writing probably a $50 million business. 00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah. 00:14:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You're like, where are you not doing the agency yet? And Amanda looked at me and said, I hope you're not serious about wanting $50 million. And I'm like, no, no, but I just mean all the hard work, all the hours I've worked over the last like four or five years, every single week, giving, giving them a clients. they're the ones that are millionaires. then even how, you know, this has went down with Crena, like I'm just like, I know this wouldn't have happened to me if I had her by my side, know, four or five years ago, she goes, okay, I said, honestly, Amanda, like I'd be happy just with half a million or a million. I know it's not about, I've made a million a month at one time in my real estate investment business ages, but I know it's not about that anymore because that with that becomes such responsibility. Yes. 00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And such like other things. can and they're stressed like because then you've got fake friends like there's so much that has excessive amount of money and temptation because the devil is good at what he does, you know, and it's not necessary like big deal kind of things like but it doesn't matter. It's slippery slope with big things like we're more prone to ego maybe when you have more. 00:15:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm like, it was really important that God not make me too cute because I definitely have the type of personality that if I was so cute, I'd be all over Instagram shaking my body something like that. 00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He needed me to not like think that I'm just gorgeous or anything because I probably couldn't be trusted with such beauty. I love that. And for me, I, I, I feeling appreciated and seen and validated. Yeah. But also to know that I'm with somebody who is, um, like to, to be with a mama bear with a mom. Oh, yeah. So beautiful. Like to get to sort of care of other people with someone else. So I thought I had about Joe, though. Wait, I do want to know a little bit more about your guy. 00:16:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You know, I do that, let's just, yeah, close the loop of my guy, because we're just in the waiting game. So I think I, I'm comfortable with what I said to him. So it should or get off the pot. So he has a lot happened to him, right? Cause he, cause well, on the phone, like he had a good friend of him die tragically a week ago. Um, and he was also in a car accident. So recently, so he's suffering from headaches. So we said, we're on the same page, but I need to spend more time with the doc and note some questions. I'm not sure if I told you, but I'm suffering from headaches from a car accident. My friend died tragically week ago, and I'm in the midst of another super time conceiving stuff. Give me a week or two to merge so that I can give the best of myself to this, my number one priority project. I'll develop questions in the meantime so we can hit the ground running. Does that work? I said, let's move the combo to email. excited to be with you. I was telling my husband, it just feels right. I said, hey, it does feel right. I feel so long if you're off or in future vision. And I guess I should have emailed this to him. Actually, I will after this. And yes, you've been through a lot. So take a week or so to review for sure. One quick question. Can you put a small deposit down to hold your spot with me? I only ask that as there's two others I'm talking to, which is true as well. And my bandwidth is really to take one new client on for this year because I'm not like, I can't take three clients that they said all said yes today. So, you know, just being honest with us, would, would like a one K to positive be okay. 00:18:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Something to consider for future is that I wouldn't let somebody take now time even for that. But what I could say is I'll give it to you but what I can say is I can't promise it to you. So you take all the time that you need to and say and I don't mean this as a sales pitch but as you can see I'm making movements right now and it's attracting people and I'm not going to hold a spot open not for a thousand dollars not for anything. If you want to pay and work now we can and it isn't that I don't appreciate everything that you're going to through. It's just that I have put momentum out and it makes no sense for me to pull it back. If he knows it's for him then he will. will come to you quicker. And it but also what you should trust that that the right thing will come, but I don't let people hold me back anymore. Yeah, isn't out of disrespect for what they're going through. 00:19:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's trust that the timing will align when it needs to align. Yeah, yeah. 00:19:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So just something to think about. 00:19:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's true. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, it's my my sorry, my gut reaction is like I think what we presented was on fire and like I want hell yes people. Like I want him to say hey I've got crazy stuff put on for the next week's but I can put some money down to hold the spot with you. 00:19:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, yes. So what's it gonna say? Oh yeah, so the thing is that you're in a situation now of you've got an open loop in your brain. And that costs you, it costs you energy, it costs you confidence, because you are now already in a way beholden to him by by your choice and allowance. If other people came in, you would think, Oh, but I have to save space for him. And he hasn't done anything to earn it other than say I'm interested, which is not enough. And so you risk potentially either throttling somebody. But here's what I need you to understand, you will be throttling energetically. Because you've got this open energy attached to him already. He is taking space in your time, in your life, in your brain, even if it's just a little bit, he's getting something from you without putting anything in. And that's what what happens when we have these conversations, like Joe is already be taking from you. 00:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He's taking from you. 00:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anybody else is. Now, it's the nature of the business that you will give to some, but you can only give so much. Yeah. who aren't paying you. So you have to be aware that all of these exchanges are withdrawals from deposits to them without deposits back to you. Sooner or later, you become bankrupts doing that, but you could have discovery calls, don't you, though, to like close people? never have all of my stuff has been 100% word of mouth, but this is the clarity process. It can happen. Yes, you can have discovery calls, but you need to recognize that the way that you handle them is what constitutes and creates a situation. of how much of a withdrawal they can make from you without making the deposit. 00:22:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So if I had the pitch deck ready, they could then keep asking me questions and get consulting from me for free. would say, let me show you what happens when you start working with me when we actually engage in a sacred commerce transaction. 00:22:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This what I can do. You see now looking at when I talked about doing your pedigree, because the process of that is, here are the results I get. And then when you put all your different things that you have to offer. Now you're coming up, you showed me the Emily Hirsch, like the calculator image and then the pitch deck and all of that stuff. So when I say that these exercises lead to something, what it leads to is you having clarity about your value, which makes it much easier for you to get clarity to your people about your value. And then, so we've also gotten clear and clear on an offer on you where the guardrails are. We've talked about effective hourly rate. 00:23:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) this is taking us weeks and multiple conversations that we can see the pace and the power of it. 00:23:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah, you're on the back to people not being able to do that anymore. He's back to you. 00:23:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) He's back. Oh, let me just let me just get this food. 00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I put his food on the counter. Let me just go get it and bring it down. I'll be right back. No problem. Come on. 00:23:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Come on. He's really, um, I couldn't find the cannon food, but I haven't tried it but he's fully ready. Oh, that's fine. gonna tell that to now. I'm be able to find the word you can't do. That's what it's out on the show. Oh, that's a shot. So, that's business. Oh, he brings it on that side. He's okay. So, we're going do the walk. Yeah. I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the the walk. walk. I'm Okay, I can't remember which is right, which is left on the headphones. 00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I never think about that, but yeah, my my bows quite comfort on my. Yeah, they're not cute, but they're very comfortable. I have sensitive ears. 00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I can't just use anything. I, I do too. Like I have these other ones. And, but yeah, they feel a little and I have Sony or something. Anyways, I'd like you though too. 00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like it's like, I feel like the Princess and the P or whatever. Like, oh my gosh, you gotta try three different ones before I find one that's comfortable. 00:24:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Like, ah, anyways, but yeah, no, you're right. Because. I'm not used to selling to totally cold people. guess everyone who's ended up usually hiring me, you're right. It's through for all or through Going through one of my challenges or some of my courses and they're sold on me So it's like basically they're like how do I get started with you? 00:25:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was the question, you know Well, and if you weren't charging higher prices for your time That's different also because yep have to persuade people at a different level And they need more structure in the presentation like you have to put more into the pitch when you're Crisis, yeah, yeah, yeah Especially when it's not for Fulfillment or they're dictating your time or all kinds of different things like that. 00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) know what I mean this so There's a higher yeah proof Yeah, yeah, yeah um So so basically so there's that so I didn't like how he said he wants to go through the document He has questions for us. I'm like either in your out. That was one thing I was like, that's not a good sign that kind of means he's never going to pull the trigger is my first reaction when I read that actually. 00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you can always go back and change your message and just say, you know what, really like the conversations I'm having today. Here's what I need to tell you. And you can say something like I'm a big believer in timing and aligning and with all the respect and reverence for your situation. If this is the right thing for you, then we'll be able to connect when the time is right for you. But because I've generated so much momentum and having these conversations, I can't the conscience, not serve others who are ready to go or create space that's for you if you're not ready yet. 00:27:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah. 00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And, but when you're ready, let me know. I would love to help you work on this, whatever. And your, your main project business and help it grow. And I hope that your healing and comfort and all that stuff comes, but. You know, So, so you, and then you can say, so disregard the, the deposit. I'm really, I'm really not looking for hold to hold space for a deposit. I'm really just ready to do the work. 00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And I still to recall it doesn't look like he's read it. 00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know. There's new setting in messenger that you can set it to show that to not have read receipt. 00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So he could have seen it. Okay. All right. Got it. 00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Yeah. All right. You know, some people can see the preview and. So to me, that's just like, okay, well, I'd rather just be fully transparent. 00:28:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Got it. Got it. Okay. 00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So Joanne, yeah. 00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So it just, I have such unclearness in working with her. Like it's like, how do we want to close the loop? do you want me to do kind of what I suggested on the voxer? 00:28:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So can you show me? Uh, hold on a second. Yes, I'm going to hold on. Let me see if my babies need something. Yeah. Um, okay. Boxer where we at. Um, Oh, yeah, you were talking about a limb going over her stuff. So what I was thinking is, what if we, um, do that together? can like take a snippet of this portion. the video or something and go over it together. That way we're still unified and we can edit anything out that we wanted to if like we say something that was just between us or whatever. But that way you don't have to go do it by yourself and have an additional burden, we can just knock it out right now and then you're done. 00:29:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in order to do that, let me see what I wrote to you. would have to just take a quick look at her ads, give her things on that and then suggest the affiliate thing. I think we could open up a word doc and let's see where I put that. email us as just just suggesting something complementary operations team that's where you would talk to. And then do we want to give her the quote of? 00:30:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that's what I was looking at thinking about right now. So, first of all, one of the ways that I would frame it is basically what you're gifting to her right now is an audit. This is something that is something that I would sell an audit. I don't give audits for free. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, no, but Tina, did say like on the call, that three hour call, whatever that night. We should have said, okay, pay us $2,000 an hour to look at business. 00:30:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But instead we did say we should charge her for it. I'm just saying let her be aware that there's value in this. Yeah, got it, got it, got it. We're already, you know what I mean? So just saying that's all I'm just framing, just appreciate like hoping that she would appreciate that we're already giving her time. 00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, that's all. Yeah, I'm-framing it so she doesn't think we do this on the regular and take advantage of us. 00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Got it. Yes, framing the value. That's that's exactly what I'm talking about. Um, and then So going through it and giving it to her and I wouldn't give too much to it like what I would say like if you look at our ads You you might say something like I could see I would tweak Um, there are several things I would tweak about this that I think would give more leverage not this is what I would tweak I wouldn't do like you know what I mean? I wouldn't give away the recipe I would just say I see the recipe in my mind very easily Does that make sense? 00:31:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, so just like high level. 00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah, um, and then say um And maybe there's two offers so There are two versions of this where we can give you the strategy and the structure and your team can implement or um We can give you the strategy and structure and we can manage it for you And there are obviously different prices. So one, um, you're getting our high-level strategy, but not as much time so we can give that to you for $4,000, $6,000. $6,000 was the original price. 00:32:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That's basically still what we're doing. 00:32:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Or $10k a month because you're getting your time fully and my time or whatever you feel like. So it could be... 00:32:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) She wants us to help her raise the money. What she specifically said is up her raise $5 million. 00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She doesn't need us to do that. She just needs the strategy, that's already in my mind. get one of your people to go reach out to like I suggested high-profile black women because that nurturing motherhood in them and she... don't remember who she said. not just tell her to swing up, but she said, there was a, was it Rihanna, like somebody. Anyway, she had mentioned a name and I was like, yeah, there's this whole group of women that would probably help raise that money very quickly. Anyway, it's still mostly strategy, I think, is that what she needs and she can manage a team. That would be in her best interest is just to get our high level minds on it and the clarity and then manage it. If there is organized and structured as she says they are, then that's all they need. 00:33:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, so what if I share screen here for a second? So what if it's like just kind of, it would give come up better names you want, but ads review, more cash and existing assets, fine complimentary. 00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The way that I used to do business audits is, it's a good try on, try it on and see if it's the same. So if we don't like working for her, we didn't even open the door to a long time working, and if she doesn't like working with us, the same thing. So we can let her know that this is the entry offer period, that is the only one. If we do this and she likes it and wants to work with us, then we can have the next conversation. And if not, we are very competent that she will be happy with that work and that investment. And she can either take it or not. Because this is more cash-resistant assets, like if she finds the right company in Philly prior, that should bring in 10k a month, don't you think at least with the size of not only that, all it really has to do is bring in enough to pay what she invested in us. And then she's not lost anything, but the compounding effect means now she's getting that money back on repeat. And so she will have earned money from us. 00:36:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if I was going to offer that aligns. Well, with goals of strategy for the doc major film, say doc major document. Film. Film Your goals. So I would just say working with us. Us film projects. Please see. 00:36:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know what I would do strategically is after a documentary film project, comma, doubling the world breastfeeding rate and generating revenue because that's actually Yeah, work me asked with the documentary after film project, comma, leading to doubling the world breastfeeding rate. 00:37:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And, and increasing your annual sales. 00:37:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and. And, yeah. 00:37:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, she specifically said 10 million. Yeah. 00:37:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I would say, I like the way that you wrote it better because the conversation that I would have with her if we do this is like. I don't support arbitrary goals. doubling the world breastfeeding rate to me is not arbitrary. There is real. value in the impact to humanity through that, that could be quantified. There is no real value that you could quantify and really spell out with having $10 million profit. 00:38:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) First of all, it speaks to no profit margin. 00:38:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Second of all, what are you going to do with that revenue? That goes whatever, like there is no real value associated with that, but there is with the rest of it anyway. 00:38:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah. Got it. Okay. So, I want to at least look at her ads, like just on my own for about five minutes or so, like a boo, unless you want me to do it with me on it. And then that's pretty obvious, like her stuff, like EG, yoga for pregnant moms, what other affiliate products that is good for her? 00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Pro-lapse treatments, like what do you call it, pelvic floor exercises, things that happen, know, after you have a baby. Like our stuff on Clickbank, you think, or specifically, or other? Potentially. I'm sure that there's something there. Or, I mean, I have no idea what exists now, commission junction. 00:39:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:39:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) but also mental health. After you have a baby. Um, there's a lot that that women go through and postpartum I don't use this except for just. I don't even remember the last time I was in Clickbank. What's funny though, is that I have an alarm on my phone to remind me to go back and look at it. 00:39:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, woman. 00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Health. Coffee Shop Millionaire was like number one in business for a while on ClickBank. 00:40:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Wow. Parenting in families maybe? 00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Maybe. Well, you can just search. Oh, wait. That's what you did. Women's Health. 00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hi, Score. Yeah. 00:40:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) would put it like, so what, yeah, anyway, I don't even think you have to go that deep. 00:40:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There will be affiliate offers. Yeah. 00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. If you go create the affiliate partnership with somebody who didn't even have an affiliate program. Yeah. think outside the boss. She is. 00:40:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. Well, yeah. And I have, um, actually have a woman that does do a pelvic floor exercise, no ticket offer. So yeah, that actually probably those two could connect, but I'm not going to do it for free, connect them for free. 00:40:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's for sure. 00:40:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Right. That's, that's that brand dealer here. Okay. All right. Alright, so there we go. So digit with the public floor exercise. I don't know what else. Or more stuff? 00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, yeah, for sure. Any kind of self-care, honestly. And it's female community support, like if there are besides breastfeeding, but just like if you have these, I don't know. There's just, there's just so much. 00:41:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I have a minimum 10k month operations team. Do you want to go away for five minutes, 10 minutes to and then come back to me and you want to call her? 00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah, either way Like what's easiest like or do you just want to stay on the call right now and hit record I? Don't have any like there's nothing I would go get started for five or ten minutes So I mean and when I'm done with this call I'm done working and I'll go do other things for the day So I'm good to sit here and watch or come back whatever you want Know what I mean Do you know what you're gonna say to her about operations team? Sorry based on what she gave us I'd have to ask questions because she gave us the org chart and she makes it sound like everything works as You know like great. So I Would have more questions About that But operations is hardly all that I do Okay, so I guess we're getting go ahead So I just don't know okay, so do you want me to take this out like No, just as we I don't I don't know. Um, so sorry. 00:43:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) My brain is like, sorry stories. I was just thinking because you wanted to have her give us all this information. Yeah, so but she did. 00:43:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And what she didn't do is say how many hours a week everybody works. So she didn't answer that question. But she she constantly talks about how well everything is organized. 00:43:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Mm hmm. 00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so there's a disconnect there. And, um, I don't know. I don't have an immediate, like I would make this strategy a suggestion to her. But yeah, there's nothing super clear there. To me, the bigger play is marketing, but, um, staying on the top of the marketing, looking at the numbers and making sure that all of that makes financial. sense, but I don't even know. I don't know. I'm not, I really, um, almost actively repelled by it. Um, because there seems to be too many incongruencies. And, um, so it's basically let's just get this done so she stops bothering us and we're in congruity with at least talking to her. so she has bad mothers. 00:44:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) That got it. Okay. 00:44:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So let's. Oh, I know what it was. I was going to, I was going to say this and then we talked, we closed the loop with Garrett. What's his name? 00:44:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Something. Uh, Grant Miller. And there's a G and an R there. 00:44:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Mm hmm. The thought that I was having earlier is that, um, you know, there are, sometimes you really are aligned with the mission. Sometimes you really like the person, but sometimes the business model just doesn't connect. And that's this, this incongruency of like how she sees her business versus always getting the results, the fact that she's gone through six agencies in a year, got it. There are red flags and I don't want to wrestle, I'm in no mood to wrestle. And I'm also in, and so here's where the wrestle is. The wrestle is in, she wants to paint this beautiful picture, but she has a messy picture she wants to have corrected. She is, this is cognitive dissonance, right? She's aware it's messed up. She wants it fixed to align with the vision that she has, but she's pretending that that's how it already is. So when somebody is not able to be fully honest about their situation, that causes too much. much mental friction, I refuse to deal with it. That's their mess. I don't want to deal with it. I love the mission. I think she's wonderful. I don't want to touch the business. 00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I agree. There's something off about it too that I see too. So, yeah. okay, so do we want to it's recording right now automatically. So, do you want to stop recording, restart, and then get me the recording? do you want me to give you a link to my Zoom and record it on my Zoom and then we just get it done. 00:46:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But yeah, so my recording goes to my computer and I automatically stop it and then there's Fathom which does a separate recording and we could always take that and clip it so we could do anyway. We could stop and join your Zoom and then you have all the files and you have the control and you can do whatever you want to do. 00:46:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, that's just yeah, that's probably easiest than we don't have to edit or take anything out. It's just like we stop and start one section that we want for her. Okay, so I'll just give you on. Box or my zoom link. Do you want me to do that? 00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:47:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) All right. I'll hang on. 00:47:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm gonna go get some migraine glasses real quick and probably maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello. 00:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone Hello. 00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And how is Dan Ryan today? Mark's dog has pneumonia. 00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone You won't. 00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Ronin. 00:00:16 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah. I'll call him said dog. 00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. The neighbor dog had pneumonia and they didn't tell. 00:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone The neighbor. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone Ouch. 00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:00:30 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah. That's... pneumonia is communicable among dogs. 00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If it's viral, it is. Well, you also know. Because there's viral and bacterial pneumonia. back then, viral is always contagious. And he has to be on 10 days of medication. he said they have to cancel their trip to New York. So I'm guessing at his mom and somebody. I don't know who, but... And him and Jonah are on a vacation together right now. So... that's probably super stressful for him. 00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone Oh yeah. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh my gosh. My dog. She's got this weird like dark spot growing like her hair. She's getting this dark spot all of a sudden. She's a poodle and a bichon frise so they don't have spots and it's dark and it's wiry and I'm like what the crap is going on? I don't have a tumor or something and she bit as she tried to like bite a skunk in the butt before the sun even came up a couple days ago. That was a terrible way to wake up because my daughter's like mom she's foaming at the mouth and I didn't know if she was my daughter or the dog because she was just going to seminary. 00:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah. we discussing right now? 00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm just like I'm trying my best not to cuss everybody out right now but don't tell me nothing like a name. Stop. 00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone Follow me. 00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 00:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone Whoever it is. 00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah, it still smells. So it's been a good doggy week. All right, let's get on to this. It's funny because when I go into my notes, I have it's just weird, actually. I don't know if this was a new notebook because because this, hold on, these cannot be from 2022. The notes date says October 2022, but like thing I'm a jig and is in here. 00:02:37 - Dan’s iPhone That's 2022. 00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? 00:02:40 - Dan’s iPhone There's no way we're talking about that recently. 00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, no, I know, but I think it was way longer ago than that. 00:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone Oh, no, probably not. 00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to go look at my notebook and see if like there's more here or something because usually, anyway, the oldest note is at the top. I feel like there must have been... whatever. that was just funny. Okay, here's the call log for fan flow remarks had sent it to Dan, but I've saved it to the fan flow you know as well. What do I want to call log for fan flowy? Oh, fan flowy, not okay. Okay, that's what that is what I wanted. 00:03:32 - Dan’s iPhone I got it. 00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, taking a break from G4 because we're working on fan flow in mom and mapping out all the stuff, ads, ad copy, lead, mac and neck, superfan, band growth system and waiting for the book And Stacy was supposed to give you a task to complete your GA for container by the time we'll for goes live. So we're trying to do that happen. 00:04:12 - Dan’s iPhone I don't log into team works. 00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I couldn't tell you. Well, did you did you create the content where we are? 00:04:19 - Dan’s iPhone What's today that I have a created container now, but it's not. When he first he's working launching. I actually did work on it a little yesterday. It's worth of percentage value. 00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But even though you don't work log into teamwork, are you still meeting with Stacy and Eric Monday, Wednesday and Friday? 00:04:46 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah, I'm just saying that like I don't like if she I thought you were asking, did she create the task and teamwork? I literally have no idea. Um, I use teamwork only to respond to like tasks that exist. So I know. Yeah, sometimes I log in, like mostly I respond to email, but if I have to upload stuff, I tend to log in. So I just logged in to respond to Greg. 00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, are you still meeting with them every Monday, Wednesday, Friday? 00:05:19 - Dan’s iPhone Yep. 00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) good. Write it down. 00:05:23 - Dan’s iPhone Just going to get more. Their favorite meaning. 00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So does Stacy ask you about tasks then? 00:05:40 - Dan’s iPhone We do a thing called, so we also have like a, I know if you know this. But maybe if you've heard this one before. So once a month, we have an in person meeting. It's the last something of the month. Again, I forget what the schedule is. Pick it to Friday. I think it's the last Friday of every month, and in that meeting, we go through everything. Anything like it's old, it's new, it's anything that she has on this other sheet that she maintains. And then the Thursday after that meeting is called Old Test Thursday, where I'm only supposed to work for kind of old tasks, which is another sheet that she maintains that I reference when it's that Thursday. And sometimes I knock those things out, but that list is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. We might not need to keep doing that. A bunch of them are woofer based, they'll be done at this moment. But yeah. So yeah, we go over everything, topped about them on that one thing, and then on that she just pings me like, hey, have you seen this? Someone commented back on this, right? So, Like, that was what just happened, somebody, like, I didn't know it, but for like a month, my basis email wasn't working. So I wasn't getting emails from anybody at all. So if they emailed to that note, I was emailing out from D&D or whatever, but I figured it, and I fixed it. But she'll like pin me on tasks that are like static or, you know, sitting there, she's like, Hey, someone, they comment to back, you need to go look at this. But she'll bring that up on the calls to, Hey, sometimes she sends slacks and opens, let's go look at it right now. Yeah. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Well, I have a couple of questions for her and teamwork. So that will help me. so have you, this is what I thought was going to happen, but just wanted to check, did you not work on anything with GA before between last weekend now? 00:07:56 - Dan’s iPhone No, I do. Oh, you did start. Yeah, I just started. Mapping out like, some of the stuff from Mercer was like, he uses these, I think they're called templates. Am I ever wrong? But there's, I think they're templates. There's template libraries in GTM. We have never used them. So I was mapping out like, hey, we're not going to do, giving you an example, clarity. So Microsoft Clarity, we're doing it the old way, where you paste the HTML. The new way is to use the Clarity template. The same thing would apply to like Hotjar, but we don't use Hotjar anymore. But it may be Wistia. I was looking at like, okay, we got to start using templates where there are templates. So yeah. 00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like they have templates for Hotjar and Wistia or there. 00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone Okay. Yeah, it's like a look. There's like search area where you can search for templates. So there's those and then there's like one other one that I cannot remember the name of. So yeah, don't think that one exists anymore. That was one of the questions I asked them, but they were referencing another one that doesn't exist or so we'll be using that. I asked them how we're doing that now. They explained it to me. can't learn one. 00:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're getting super deep and growly voice where I can't understand you. 00:09:42 - Dan’s iPhone Listen, I can't help my voice. 00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You can help your voice. 00:09:47 - Dan’s iPhone God gave it to me. 00:09:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You sing. 00:09:50 - Dan’s iPhone So you definitely know how to help your voice. Sorry. Yeah, so that's it. Just like, oh, hey, we need you. templates where there are templates but these are the templates that we use and then like we're no longer like hot showers out where we that used to be part of our container will no longer be in our container. Oh the other bit is uh well I didn't do this but I just remember this kind of uh gotta send this to Norio but they said do not use visual website optimizer in GTM which I've experienced that issue but they're like yeah don't do it. I gotta figure out a way if we can put that I'm gonna have Norio add like a scripts area to the GTMizer that I can just load grips in which is probably good secret. 00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You need to have Norio add scripts area to what? 00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone GTMizer I mean it's literally for PWA on our communities. for theirs. It should just be like VWM and no one would use it. I mean, you could use it otherwise, but we'll maybe mark it as VWO. 00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Does Optimize that you've been existing anymore or Crazy Egg? 00:11:23 - Dan’s iPhone I don't know about Crazy Egg, but Optimize that he does, I believe. 00:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:11:29 - Dan’s iPhone But I've got like this grandfather account with VWO and never letting it go. Yeah. Yeah. 60 bucks a month. 00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. 00:11:39 - Dan’s iPhone You mean these? 00:11:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. Wait, what the? Oh, I must have it open into windows. That's not useful. So, let me look at this. What date is this October 4th? So you came up with the model, so the SaaS model plus coaching plus buying catalogs plus sign artists slash rev share plus distribution revenue streams and you might not say you need to model how the revenue will look percentages of each of that. for you and the guys. So what's the situation with buying was it lands down. 00:12:33 - Dan’s iPhone Superrolls, oh, lands down. I don't know. I'm really talked about. I met with. 00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:12:44 - Dan’s iPhone I was going to run up by Rhonda because so meet with her next week, I think I was going to run up by her, but then I met with this dude. This guy that. Joe interviewed on his podcast of the two. Oh, so the podcast the guy said. a couple of interesting things. So, many, many years ago, think it was Ezra Fierstown. I don't know where he said this, but he, I don't know if he was on a podcast or something, but he was talking about like, you know, he started making all this money and then he had like a tax person and then the whole, the whole thing, right, like around and he said, but then he was also starting to get around people had more money than him. And one of those guys said to him, hey, if you're a tax person and CFP makes less money than you do, then you need a new tax person than CFP. And he's like, because they can't, they, how can they possibly do that, right? They don't know what it's like to make that much money, like they don't know what it's like to, and I was like, that's an interesting point, like, like, why would I like, I wouldn't go hire someone to run ads that hadn't run as as well as I had, right? So I'm like, what would you, right? But you don't think about it in those terms of the thing. That sort of stuck with me, but I never really did anything about it. And then like, you know, Rhonda, not the bag I'm wrong, but right. Rhonda doesn't listen to me, right? Rhonda's executing Rhonda's plan, which I get, right? So her plan is like conservative. have a target. We're trying to, we're trying to end up where you're maintaining the same lifestyle until into your 90s so that you never run out of money. And that's a common sort of plan. It's certainly better than the plan I had. And so she's working that plan. And then the dude that Joe was interviewing said something like, you have a tax preparer, or do you have a tax planner, these like a tax. preparer looks backwards and then says this is how much money you owe. He's like a tax planner looks forward and they say they look at how much money you might owe and then they put strategies in place to mitigate that. And he's like if you have a tax preparer you need to have a tax planner and he's like that makes a lot of sense. And then he was doing some other stuff like you've probably seen the whole infinite banking or the family bank thing that comes up every five years. It's back. 00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think is always thinking about that and wanting to work on it. 00:15:39 - Dan’s iPhone Well, I'll send you this dude. I like this dude. I talk to this guy. So there and then my buddy actually wrote a book on it. That's how I actually got it. I actually heard about it somewhere else and then this dude that I know here actually wrote a book on it and he sells those policies. Well, what these guys do like I've seen other their people do is like, it's the basis of their sort of wealth pyramid, literally. yeah, when you start with that, and then they also go into like alternative investments and tax strategic investments. one of the things that he said on the call was like, yeah, you he's like, if you're, oh, the other thing he said in Joe's thing was, hey, if you're someone that's got like an eminent, um, crazy use, whatever. It was basically like, if you're someone that's going to be selling your business and you're going to have a huge influx of cash, he's like, you need, you need to have a plan before that happens, right? need to be, you need to have your tax strategy laid out so that you're not paying 40%. 00:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not paying this huge cap gains. What Dexter would tell you is instead of a tax planner or taxpayer or accountant at all, what you would want is a wealth manager. 00:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone that's what these guys are. 00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, they know the laws even better. 00:17:06 - Dan’s iPhone So what he's saying is like, hey, we have like a whole suite, right, that we have lawyers, have tax people, we have the accountants, we have the investors, and we're all sort of following the same program, and we all investment opportunities, and then they also will help you sort of go through one, so like my example is like, what if I want to buy multiplex? 00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I don't know about that. 00:17:40 - Dan’s iPhone So yeah, oh yeah, no, we can bring it to you can bring it to us, bring it to bring it to the group or whatever, bring it to this mastermind, whatever the hell you want to call it. And then we could walk you through how to do the deal, like they're not in on the deal, but they tell you what to look for and what to, you know, negotiate about. Okay, yeah, that's exactly. 00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what I want but he's like we don't help you find the deal but he's like we do find other deals that you can invest in or not but one of his things was like he's saying that you invest in energy you invest in oil and that these create these huge tax offsets but he's like what do you think you're paying tax right now I said I honestly don't know like it's got to be 40% he's like I could probably cut so sorry I was just thinking because Seth is big on trusts and he's like been studying this for years and like I am wanting to have conversations about it but so that I can understand it better because it's a scary kind of thing but basically and I just out of curiosity you might want to talk to him I don't I don't know how rebellious you want to be I already helped up 00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone That's my problem is that like the parts that make sense to me. I've executed right. So it made sense to me years ago have a solo 401k. I don't know why I set it up. And then when I got with Rob, she was like, how did you do this? It's like, how did you even know to do this and how did you do it? And then she's like, is this real? got as far as I know and it's real. And she took it over. And that was the right thing right now. It's this vehicle that I use. And then I got like, I have this one insurance policy with Denise and I, this was the dude that does the whole life. Like, I wasn't ready to commit the whole life at the time because I did. I mean, I understood it, but I was like, I don't think I could do that. I could definitely do it now. I don't think I was like financially really where I thought I could do it and not put myself in position where it might come back to bite me in the , but although I sort of think that isn't actually real thing. knew we were going to move, right? So I was like, I might need money for the house. I can't have money tied up in anything, so whatever. So I didn't do it then. But what I did do then was he had this other life-in-term thing. It's like a second to die policy. And it's basically like, essentially once all's been done, it's like the if I die or Denise dies, one of us dies, the other one gets like $3 million, something like that. And so he was like, this is how the policy works. And I told it to Ronda and Ronda was like, there's no way. There's no way it works like that. She's like, I need to meet with this guy. And we met with him. We went through the numbers and Ronda was like, holy , it does work the way. She's like, what the? And she's like, yeah, you could do that. I got the trust. So I set that up first. I think I got that. But then, What is this? His name is David Dark Angelou. He was like a friend of a friend. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I heard that name before. 00:21:09 - Dan’s iPhone He used to work with Tony Roberts bunch. 00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Way back in the Roberts or Robins. 00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone Robins, sorry. He's like he's never really been in the Internet marketing world. 00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I know I've seen that face too. long time ago. Oh, not that dude. Okay. Go away. 00:21:31 - Dan’s iPhone So he was like someone that I met years ago and like he actually recently hit me up. was actually going to hit him up about this whole life thing because I know that he knows that game. Right. He knows where to find the policies and yada yada. So when I talked to this other dude, I was like, well, hey, don't have to buy the policy through us. So they're like, we just help you. Oh, dude. Sorry. 00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's try to get it. Subscribe to him so I don't forget. 00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone They just show you like all the strategies and then they have like investment opportunities. Your paying for access is basically what it blows down to, access to people that are doing the same thing. he's like, look, you'll be in the room with people that have $100 million, just straight up just so you know, but I could show up with the whole life policy of, yeah, you don't have to buy it through us. Okay. I thought it was interesting and it's like, okay, so your base thing is not the thing that you're making money on, like the thing that you're telling everyone to do first. He could make money on it, but he's like, no, you can, you're ready to trust that up, would just make sure you can just go through the checklist and make sure it's set up the way it should be. Okay. 00:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, all this stuff fascinates me and I think that my guy is finally going to be done with crap in a few months, I don't know, I really hope so, because 10 years is a long time. Yeah, it is. It would break most people or they would move out of the country or just be thrown in prison because they tie your hand so bad you do something and that's the consequence, which is why I'm actually interested in having these conversations with Seth about trust and stuff, even though I'm sure he already knows a lot of that but doesn't want to talk about it because they just scared the life out of you. Anyway, um, lands down. 00:23:32 - Dan’s iPhone Okay, so, so, anyway, I'm to talk to Rhonda about that. And I did talk to, I did talk to this, this Dave person about it. So like, you can bring, I was like, so I could talk to you about like these things and I'm considering things like, yeah, and I think I gave them that as an example. And I go right. I could like, oh, the other thing I asked them because I actually weirdly or not, right. for this dude, shut up. I started looking into whole life again on my own. I was like, can you everything I looked at? Like, you couldn't pre-fund it. And so I asked him, I said, can you pre-fund one of these? He's like, you can. He's like, you just got to, it is possible. You can do it. It's like, you just got to make sure that that's the setup that you get yourself. then you can pre-fund it. Because what I was reading was like, you have to fund it for three years before you can actually then take a loan against it. So in my version of the world, I would fund it. And then if I do the Lansdown thing, I borrow the money from myself, which is the whole point of doing that . And then use that to buy Lansdown. Then I pay the interest on Lansdown with the money that I'm making from Lansdown. So I make a little less. Whatever. And then he's like, again, you just pay back at any time, right? not like a real loan. then, of course, that's where you use to like buy your kids. Give your kids a loan for their house. Oh, like if you have enough money there, it's like, okay, cool. 00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's still on the table. Let's see. I'm looking at last week or actually probably the last couple of weeks with mom course development or just stack or offer or anything. 00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone So Sean is evaluating circle as the community and it sounds like it sounds like it's so funny. He's like, I don't think this is going to work. It would be great if it did this. So he's doing this all via text and he's basically just texting himself. like he's texting questions to the group. And then in the course of like nine texts, he figured out he convinced himself the circle was the right solution. 00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Was I glad you worked that out with yourself. 00:26:17 - Dan’s iPhone But he's sold on it now. He's like, Oh, course, this is what I was saying the whole time. So we got to get that set up. It's set up. It's on the trial, whatever, but we got to get it set up. So that's now going to officially be the thing. Then that's where the course would live. So now we got to figure out I got Greg like finished the cover today. And then I just sent him a message. was like, Hey, I can either just drip. He did the cover in the first worksheet. I said, I can either drip the worksheets on you one in a row, one in time, or I can dump them all on you like in a priority order. Let me know. but you prefer. So based on his answer, I will do whatever he says, my plan is just to go, because he did literally did the first one on the book. So then we'll do the second one, the third one, fourth one, I think there's like nine to 12 or the other. So we'll get all those done, and then the book's done, and then I had sent Eric and Abhishek, those guys, the book funnel, all I was like, we can build this on new bases, right? they're like, yep. Then I sort of told Maria, hey, don't be surprised if I can tell you women a project here in the near future center. I don't think I sent her anything though. just emailed her back for me, but she told me. 00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I got her. She's getting big co-honies now. She put out a $15,000 offer and a done for you instead of the $2,000 stuff, and she's just feeling good. and she's got people who are would be a good fit for that. 00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone So then the course that we would have to make is the do it like just walking them through like how to do all the ads and stuff. So we got to sort of map that out because it's like I guess we'll just we'll do it like we'll make the email portion but then put it in your CRM and then the CRM we're going to show on the screen is ours. It's family but it's like you would just send her in your CRM whatever it is. I do mail chimping like in whatever is. And then I was going to hit up the super res guys I was thinking about that and I'm like I was just probably so I was going to hit them up and be like hey let's do like a hybrid hybrid non-commercial model. So it would be I pay you to customize it. I get to call it fan flowy. I am not going to sell it. Right, so that eliminates me competing with you not only am I not going to sell it I'm only going to allow people that have already become a lead for me to get access to it So it's not even good like you won't even be able to go download it from the site Right, so it's like it's sort of behind It's gated to whatever degree And then I'll pay you The customization fee and then I'll pay you a rip Like a quarterly rip on We're either a flat monthly licensing fee. I have no idea how many people are going to download this, right? So that's probably the best course of action like hey, you're making a Thousand bucks a month. I'll pay you 200 Let's pay you 200 a month to have to as a license fee and then we can sort of work out Another deal after that, but also I will I will helping market super-us. If you really think it's that great, I'll help you market it, but you have to cut me in on super-us. 00:30:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I vacillate instantaneously between their short-sidedness, but also the fact that, like, maybe reality is a little bit... 00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone I mean, I get it. It's big idea to see us, right? It's like they're so married to this thing. It's like... And then I'm not risking anything, right? It's like the only risk I'm taking is that they'll cut me out, but then I'll lock them into like a five-year deal. Like I want a five-year deal that you cannot back out of, and it will be very similar to what we did with like exam matrix when we got, we licensed their software and rebranded it, but we did sell it. And then... And we had a five-year deal that they were locked in. when they sold it, that contract went with them. when that guy sold it, that contract went with them until the final buyer was starting to be an addict and started re-interpreting the contract. And we were already on the path of building our own software in the background. And then lo and behold, when our contract ends, we had our own software. 00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oops. I feel like y'all didn't get left again at the same time. I slept terribly last night. 00:31:37 - Dan’s iPhone I'm not sure if I was sleeping anymore. 00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) thought I like, oh. I stopped wearing my Applewats and my Aurorang because I sleep better without them. But I also got a lot of data for a long time. So I know, you know, got my baselines really good. But I also ate garbage yesterday. 00:31:56 - Dan’s iPhone So there was that. 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I needed. that it was a girl thing. was like, I'm eating cake and Mexican. 00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone And cake. 00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. let me go through this. So one of the things that we're talking about was defining who should I have a community because they're not for everyone. Like, how big should your following be? What's the criteria? there's, I think I already said following size, that kind of thing. Have you guys talked about that at all? 00:32:39 - Dan’s iPhone Uh, no. I don't think that came up on the call like it was supposed to. 00:32:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So I'm going to do this and say, oh, What would you call that call that a mom call or? 00:33:07 - Dan’s iPhone Yes, Monday. 00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Monday what? 00:33:12 - Dan’s iPhone Mom. 00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:33:14 - Dan’s iPhone I think it says rent. mean, I think the meeting is like to rent the table. 00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Oh, actually said that earlier to her. Oh, fan flowy call log fan flowy call. Dan wants to discuss nine thirty nine sixteen seven twenty nine. I don't want to. I don't to a document making brand new change and I don't even have to edit access anyway so I'll put that in there um I'll just mark bring a list of stuff stuck on the call because he clearly has one where does it live I never got that you just get that yeah where does where does that how does that happen the google doc okay um what are you yesterday yes she said that that it that must be the fan flowy call-up google doc or something else huh yeah that's it so it's not I thought it was a transfer to my what what transfer why are you some of the transfer I guess that's what's called I'm no idea oh yeah what are minutes of you maybe more like it let's see That's interesting. Beta testers for the seating planner. 00:35:17 - Dan’s iPhone How that going? What am I Google answer? I went through my email and I found every Google ads rep that's ever reached out to me. He's like, I guess they just cycled her and give you a new one every quarter. I emailed all of them. Okay. And the oldest one, which is weird. So I just got a new one like after this started. So I think I got a new one on like Tuesday, randomly emailed her, emailed the one back to me yesterday. And we're like, are you still having this problem? And I just emailed them like, yes, still having this problem. They're like, oh, because they're like, if you're in the problem, I can escalate it. It's pretty run a mic. So hopefully it'll get escalated and solved. But I'm still stuck. Like, I cannot get ads to run on these accounts that have this payment or a file issue. Oh, and also, I don't want to run this on Mark's card, even though Mark's like, oh, you can put on my card. No, I can't, because it's mine. This is not yours, Mark. This is mine. 00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you can't get beta testers, because you need to run ads? OK. OK. 00:36:54 - Dan’s iPhone It can lead to your car. The leads will lead to beta. to test versus the thought yeah no I got that um yeah no it's just the thought now we're gonna breathe it oh you're red is great let's see what is the like status of that project I did one and I sent it to Sean and was like hey can you peruse this and see us right I don't know if he's like that yet I'm pretty sure I'm right um and I'm doing the other one but the other one the chat TPT was nowhere near successful with the second round I don't know why because it's the language is a little more nuanced than whatever so when it categorizes a bunch of stuff they're all wrong but a lot. I have to manually go through and like recategorize them and there's just taking forever. So I'm doing chunks. And then, of course, I screwed up and resorted the sheet and then lost my place and I couldn't resort it back to where it was. And I was like, oh, great. So I didn't start over, but I'm probably doing duplicative work because I don't recognize stuff that I had already done. But whatever, just don't sort it again. 00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You cut out for a minute. So I know. I think I got that just a minute. 00:38:38 - Dan’s iPhone I'm doing a second one. So the first one worked out. 00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I did a second one. You know, I have, I'm wondering sometimes now because chat GPT like about two and a half months ago, maybe three months ago now, probably two and a And I'm wondering if like. like if that's well obviously I think something actually happens because I used it too many times for that logic to make any sense for it to like be less logical and it is less logical so there are two kinds of things that I think about is it is it a I don't know like I wonder if it's setting it up so that we are wowed by the next version so much because it's so much better than this version because they backtracked it or if I don't know like throttling access and we're not really getting that for like I don't know what it is with something change and it is not as good right it's not precise but just stupid people started using it with us and therefore they make it dumber yeah but I will send you to your windows user what your windows user oh no you're windows can Good or so or no? No, I haven't. 00:40:02 - Dan’s iPhone I use I have I've had both a parallel Huh? Do you parallels? Can you run windows on Mac? 00:40:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know. I don't I mean I don't have it set up like that What is parallels? 00:40:16 - Dan’s iPhone It's not like it's so later. Yeah So Nvidia has their own gpt And it's like we started using the yesterday, so I won't send it to you unless it's good But it's it's called like Something like chart RX, so it's like specifically for dealing with data So I gave I had Eric install parallels and that yesterday and then he uploaded like all of Mark's blog posts and we gave it 40,000 records and Now I want to query that data set and say Tell me every city California city that is mentioned in these 40,000 posts, and then see how it does. And then I because I really just need the city names, and I'm like, how the hell am I going to get these across 40,000 posts? 00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:41:12 - Dan’s iPhone And then see how it does, and then be like, all right, now tell me the frequency of those cities, then be like, Hey, me what counties are mentioned. But I guess first, I don't know if have to teach it first, like, Hey, here are all the California cities and counties, that's easy to get. Well, we're going to see, but then it's also like, we're going to feed it the categories that SEO people created. And we're going to say, All right, anywhere. It's actually hard to do this. But what I wanted to do at the end is spit back out the CSV, and then add a column for categories, and then give it like, if there's a city make that a category, if there's a county make down a category, and then I'll prioritize the category. or the blog post category is for lack of a better term. And then I'd say if any of the blog post categories exist, you're allowed to add two. I don't want any more than four categories for any post. So you can add two by priority. if hit and run were the number one priority and hit and run was there, you'd use hit and run. And then whatever, right? And see if it can do that because we need, I need four categories applied to every blog post across 40,000 posts. All right. I'd like doing that manually. So let's see. But chat TPT borked, I thought I could even read the sheet. 00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I'm interested to see. I mean, so is NVIDIA stuff using OpenAI? 00:42:54 - Dan’s iPhone I actually don't know. I just stumbled on it. Just one of those weird random things, like an all of a sudden. two days later, I'm like, oh, we can do this. It's like, I wasn't looking for it. I don't know why it came into my purview, my view, well, whatever. There's another one too. There's one called, I don't think it's gonna be good for this, it's called base.ai. And it allows you to launch your own serverless agents, I think, is, I thinking that might be for something else. Then my buddy is like all into like just building your own rag environment, like on your computer and just running into LLM locally. 00:43:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Rag environment? 00:43:44 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah, I forget what it stands for, but that's the thing. you set up a rag, and we're going to there. 00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm like, I'm- It's generation. 00:43:53 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah, I'm not going down that road at all. 00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, I actually wanted to have like You can. Good night. server but I don't the thing is it's not like a there's two ways to look at it in one way it's not a great use of time because it's tedious and long there's a huge learning curve it'll take a while but on the other end of it the what we know about it and and what it and this goes back to kind of my whole generalist approach to business anyway is that my speed of implementation with whatever comes out will be so much faster and more leverage because I will have an internal understanding of how it works and also when it comes down to like cost and customization being able to have something on a server level and then also privacy to have your own server like and I think that that's going to be really important and I think that anyone I think that at that kind of privacy and having our own servers is going to be more commonplace than it's ever been before because of that's the biggest thing right now right is having everybody's data accessed all the time and how that's used. Did you see there was a there's these kids from Harvard that made and they connected their meta glasses to chat GBT and they built a program that would scan faces of people they are looking at and be able to pull up their name address phone number and all that kind of identification of course yeah I mean we knew that going to happen soon but that is already here like that's the thing and that's what we know about. 00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone Did you see Elon's robot that they just put out yesterday? Duke, people having a conversation with it. It's frightening. It's frightening. Like, oh my God, it sounds like a person. Like, it's way beyond what I thought it would be. oh, okay. And he's like, this is gonna be the best song product we ever make. Like, okay. I mean, we can it. I'm full on like, Rhonda by Tesla because they are not a car company. Period. 00:46:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Not a car company. No, van. 00:46:33 - Dan’s iPhone I just see Robo van. Have you seen that? Oh, yeah. think you're up. 00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's crazy. The truck's getting rocks. 00:46:41 - Dan’s iPhone The taxi. Yeah, it was a taxi to van and the robot or the piece of the rolled out yesterday. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is crazy how fast, like our sci-fi movies are coming. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the thing about pacing, though. is it's always been faster than well it's not always been faster like but but it is now faster than people think it is but but the the rate of increase is way faster than anybody thinks it's going to be yeah because of the compounding effect and all the brains working not necessarily together but they are all being able to pull from other people's learning curves and technology like there's so much access to a hive via the internet but also the worldwide networks of people who know people that's never existed before like it does now no no and my buddy is always like he thinks everyone should have their own like personal AI that's like really built around their data set that's sort of like what you were saying a minute ago and I ever 00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone Every day, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's, I could see where that would be helpful. And especially if you could have it sort of use your local data set and then also be tapping into the LLM, right? it's like, oh, and maybe you prioritize like I want, you know, consider this data source first and then if there's something missing, then go out. 00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and the, anybody that understands if this, then that logic will do really well because it's conditional logic that those things need to go with, right? If this does not, and if not this, then this, that type of thing. And there are a lot of brains that don't do that. There are a lot of that do, but percentage wise, most of them don't. so the opportunity for all these micro markets around AI exists and the, and I'm not had this thought before, but thinking about it now, that's where competition will still be is because it's the same way. Basically, it'll be like the same reason why one particular flavor, one person's particular flavor of voice would draw them to their business coaching over, let's say, Tony Robbins or some other big corporate mega name, right? would be the same reason somebody would buy that lower level AI because whatever, just that whole kind of nuance of personal connection and voice match and things like that. Anyway, interesting or fascinating, but to the point of the server, like I have these machines, but none of them are fast enough and I want to get it, but it's been so long since I've built a machine and know the components and I'd have to upgrade the motherboard and I'm like, oh, do I really want to do this? I wish I could just get one of my kids, like, train No, but there you've got their own interest and they're not here. So like here like in that interest. Anyway, oh, speaking of kids, how's Abel and doing? 00:50:11 - Dan’s iPhone You text here and there text to her today. 00:50:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She respond when I saw she read it. And yeah, somebody's going to teach her how to turn that off. 00:50:24 - Dan’s iPhone I thought she did. I think she did in our group chat, but she didn't turn it off and but yeah, well, it's positive. 00:50:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She doesn't turn it off. Probably a good thing. She's adjusting. Well, she doesn't, but it's hard. 00:50:41 - Dan’s iPhone How's Denise? 00:50:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's fine. 00:50:44 - Dan’s iPhone She's just, which Mary was the one like Mary was just getting. You know, your kids self diagnosed themselves with mental problems. Yes. What is up with that? Like, I don't understand this generation. 00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no. Oh, it's not just the generation, but it's the access that they have. So it's been a phenomenon in medical students since the beginning, where if they read about symptoms, then they can add, yeah, yeah, in fact, in my classes every year, they warn us like, don't think you have this just because you read it, because that's what everybody does and don't freak out. Oh, and yeah, so it's just that they've got so much access to this information that it happens. They see themselves in this thing. And what they don't realize is the nuance of it and the overlap and all these other conditions again, if this than that type of thing, but there's this also need to feel like we're seen and understood or to give meaning or logic to emotions that we have. And so when you find a label that seems like it fits, now you've feel like you have some understanding. And so that's the logic behind it, like, oh, okay, I understand this now. And also, I'm not accountable. not my fault. 00:52:12 - Dan’s iPhone So she's going through this series of self-diagnoses. And it's like she's literally trying to find one that we'll ascend to. And then because then the natural step after that is to go talk to your therapist. And we're like, okay, but first she had ADD. And I'm like, you do not have ADD. hate to break it to you, but like, you're born with that. And it would have shown up way before 16 and PS. 00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) nothing, girls. 00:52:48 - Dan’s iPhone Well, she doesn't have it. Like there's nothing ADD about you at all, at all. But it's like you can sit there and draw for hours on end. literally hours. I'm like, 80 people cannot do that. then she was like, and she's like, well, I don't have the HD part. I'm like, well, there you go. Now you're reading definitely too much. Then that turned into, then she started saying, I can't sit still. going crazy. can't sit still. Like, yeah, no. Okay. You literally can't sit still. You don't say you can't sit still. It's like you'd be bouncing around the river together. Then it was stress. Okay, well, what's stressing you out? And then she liked that one. And now she's sad all the time, mostly. 00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm like, yeah. 00:53:43 - Dan’s iPhone And I'm like, what are you doing? So then she keeps, she won't say it to me because, you know, I'll be like, try to solve it. And then with Denise, Denise is like, well, I could find like a Catholic counselor. And why does that have to be Catholic? Why does it have not have to be? it's like, do you want a counselor or not? So now it's going to be a specific one, which one? Which one should it be? 00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If you know so much. 00:54:09 - Dan’s iPhone So, yeah. 00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's hard. 00:54:13 - Dan’s iPhone It was homeschooling. At some point, she wanted to be homeschooled and that went away. It's like, okay. 00:54:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Yeah. I had one that she got her GED last year and, but she was, talk a class through everything, math, science, all that stuff. Then you get to high school and a lot of the teachers just are spazs. They're not even good at what they do. Sometimes they're dumber than my girls. They're poor leaders. It gets really frustrating. And then you're dealing with all these other students that have poor parenting, poor hygiene, not that intelligent. Like, it's just such a, you nothing out. in the world is like high school and it's it's rough while everybody's got volatile hormones and their brains are going through all these different changes their emotions they're not getting enough sleep and school starts super early even though their circadian rhythms are jacked up at this time it's fun it's lots of fun yeah yeah um okay let me so uh so you can't run any ads still at all is that what you're I cannot run ads in four accounts but the other ones that have the same payment profile well perfectly fine but how many are those oh i don't know like it's there you know there's a bunch of old accounts that i don't even use anymore but um so probably like three maybe and i don't want to 00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone I them because I'm like, I don't want to mess with those accounts and I don't want to mess with, you know, these are none of these are connected to another 71, luckily. And they're, you know, my opinion profile isn't connected to marks. So I was like, I don't want to, I don't know why this is happening. don't understand why it's happening. My account is approved and it has been for years. like, something's off somewhere. Maybe it was because I I don't know why. don't know why. I think it's associated with one and they're applying it to the other is what I think is going on. Yeah. 00:56:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you're like, sorry. 00:56:40 - Dan’s iPhone No, I just don't know what's going on. 00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're, um, so you were saying like last week or Monday, I think you said you got that new ad rep and you sent them a bunch of stuff, but then you're like, they keep changing. So is, do you have somebody working on it for you? 00:56:59 - Dan’s iPhone Supposedly right now. It's more deep the ad rip from six months ago. That's the only one that responded. No one else is responding. I'm sure it'll go into Google speed, which is not found. 00:57:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. This is the the the the the time of it's not what you know but who you know kind of thing. 00:57:27 - Dan’s iPhone Right. That's why I jumped into my emails. was like, well, like they contacted me. 00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) can't like them. 00:57:34 - Dan’s iPhone Right. I just think it's hilarious that the one that just got assigned to me and specifically is assigned to D&D as a respondent. 00:57:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we found out that so my guy had they got shut down and he went through all of his contacts to find an old connection that I get like you out like had or maybe like you I don't remember how nothing to do with that particular one but anyway Well, what somebody told him who shouldn't have said anything was that it it appeared to be competitor causing problems That got them shut down that's the thing so like Google Amazon and Facebook They own the majority of the media space and we're in election time where the space is like More valuable and I don't know what the overlap is like because there's only So much ad space on any particular thing and does that like does not related info Take up space like is that a reason I don't know but competitors for sure like Amazon like there That's this whole thing and That's even more reason why the who we know like you have lots of conversations with people Knowing who can help you on any of the the Media platforms cuz cuz all it would take would be for somebody Who competes with another 71? to get you guys shut down like playing a dirty game that's totally possible and And Like what do you do after that? They you're so much And that's to also why diversifying traffic sources is going to be so important diversifying and then Maintaining the most powerful relationships you can where it comes to The the main media sources, which is almost impossible, but it doesn't mean But and you know what happens synergistically Divinely universally whatever, you set that intention and things become more possible. that's, that's the dirty game that we are all at risk of is that if we, if the business is dependent upon ads from one of those big three where you can get shut down for anything, you don't know what it is, they won't tell you, you can't get a hold of a real person. There's no rhyme or reason or logic behind it. 01:00:28 - Dan’s iPhone Like if that's the bread and butter of your business, you're screwed. 01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 01:00:32 - Dan’s iPhone Anyway, lovely, colorful thoughts. 01:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) having this week. Holy , like you could just destroy a huge company. I will, I guess it's not really huge like when you think about it, but it's not but still there's like a few families that are dependent upon it. I guess it's not really huge. It is to the average person who's like millions of dollars. 01:00:58 - Dan’s iPhone Wow, you know, when they're 01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think that these platforms have been, yeah, like with all the crap that we've gone through with Wolfer for on brain tree, like brain tree doesn't give a about the account. 01:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah, give a . They're the that they've essentially like crippled. 01:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They would have been out of business. We didn't switch the stride. 01:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah. It's taken weeks and get it's still not done. It's unreal. And then brain trees shut down, reset you, just shut them down. And I was like, really? Locked up their money, shut them down, and said it was because they were selling supplements. Where? Where are there supplements for sale on this site? And then there's, and it's our decision is final. 01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Don't bother writing back. 01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone Wow. Your decision is based on nothing. It's final. Okay, sounds great. 01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so always having another option and back door, but like, how do you do that? How do you, like, how do you have a secondary option that's even comparable to GMB? 01:02:07 - Dan’s iPhone You don't, you don't. 01:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's crazy. Yeah. 01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone But, but I think, but I mean, I mean, problem there is that, but like, their entire business, like what, that's like with Mark three years ago, Mark last monkey three years ago, he was up . 01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's great. Yeah. 01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone Not so much. 01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It made me think about, though, the strategy between car accident claim center is like, what if you have two and you'd have to run them on completely different accounts, probably using a VPN, completely different IPs, completely different business names, like, is all the separation you could possibly have. And one is branded traffic and one is non branded traffic, just in case, and maybe to help mitigate, doesn't mean that they won't be you're out and shut you down, but um. 01:03:03 - Dan’s iPhone Oh, yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, you wouldn't want to mix, especially the other one works for both work. You want them separated. That's why I'm gonna, I want to copy the valiant thing through a different domain. So it's like, oh, I'm gonna use similar domain, but it's different. 01:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I think, yeah, that's the. Anyway, that's that's the thing that we have to be thinking about is what is what is the. It's not the variable, but but what diversity can we create even within the environment as a a backdoor, kind of not a backdoor option, but just a backup option that maybe isn't as powerful, but still. And honestly, maybe it is a data on a traffic plan. Like you have kind of like this parallel business that looks like the whole point of it is, you know, generating traffic for multiple businesses and you're selling leads, but really it's a if everything hits the fan I'm funneling all those leads to my own business. I don't know You don't want to fund your competitors, but Maybe sell the data to somebody who's not competing But still interested in relative data. I Don't know what that looks like, but either way, I feel like that's the chess move is to Know that traffic can get shut down. And so how do you have a backup traffic source on the same platform? That could be redirected to an existing business if it got shut down and maybe it's not the same amount of volume, but it keeps you from like going from Everything to zero and maybe you only lose like 50% of it or something While you work it out Yeah, I mean that's extremely difficult to do on google for sure Um, that's like Is it this this business was? 01:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone that dependent on that one source. 01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. Yeah. It was the thing that blew it up. 01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone Right. And it's also the thing that blew it up in both directions. 01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. But it's because of the nature of the business that it's the kind of thing that people go and get local reviews. So, and they were all tied to this one account. So it's definitely a learning lesson. Um, but it, but it, the growth was explosive and fast. And so was a shutdown, although, but it did get turned back on, but it was, it was crazy. Um, this whole thing again, back to pace of the evolution. It's, it's hard to, you have to be consciously thinking about the pace and the potential change and the potential destruction at all times to be able to be even remotely prepared for things happening because apathy. for even like a month or a few months could put you in a situation where something happened and like you took your eye off the ball and that the ball is your building up against this platform yes and you don't control any of it right totally yeah anyway all right well sir that's Friday huh oh how was how was mom time yesterday it was good i mean she's definitely like she was like who's your who's your sister who who's your person i go who's my person i know you have a secretary i go no who helps you i go stacy i'm going to reach out to stacy and tell her to put bomb lunch once a month in your calendar i said she'll do it i'm going to i'm going to reach out to her i don't know she really will she might we'll see um so she clearly wants that and then we went and visited my 01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone dad and he is oh man he is so much worse i was like he didn't remember anybody like any any of other than like the immediate family like he thought his brother was dead his only brother that's alive he thought he was dead and then he couldn't he didn't know my cousin sadly my cousin just passed away like last week and he didn't know who she was who's kid michelle who's michelle your brother's daughter what brother Paul Paul Paul has a daughter like Paul has two daughters he does i don't remember that but that was the interesting thing is he kept saying i don't remember that i don't remember that then he didn't remember he didn't remember his other brother's son who has the same name i was like are you talking about Jackie and you write so the That's Jack and the son's Jackie and what are you talking about Jackie? Who's Jackie? I'm like, Jack's son. I don't remember that. Is Jack have kids? Other kids were like, no. he goes, is he the oldest? And we're like, no. Like the fourth. And so I like, oh boy. And then he didn't like, didn't remember Lisa. He thought Lisa had a job somewhere. I don't know where he thought she worked, but he didn't remember that. He thought that my brother's garage, where he lived, was not remodeled. He's like, I want to go finish that. 01:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) want to go. 01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone I think we should build that out. We're like, it's filled out. He's like, no, no, I mean, like, put up insulation, put in wallboard. No, dad, that's all we're done. They put in wallboard? Who? We're like, okay. So, and then when we left, my mom's like, he is so much worse than the last time I was here. I was like, really? She goes, yeah, it's a. A lot of work seems to get open, which I thought. 01:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) was like, this seems worse. Does your mom have, like, good friends? 01:09:10 - Dan’s iPhone No, doesn't. Like, she did. The woman across the street, they were, like, besties. then she passed away. So there's one. And then her nephew moved in. He just moved out because he couldn't afford to live in California anymore. So that was dated. So David's gone. So all she's got is my brother. And then my brother's hilarious, right? she got that operation. So like, they're living together, which is going to be a lot. So she told me, I got a lot of my brother for this. So she'll come out and start talking to him, and he'll just look at her and go, Mom, it's quiet time right now. And then I go, what do you do? She goes, I go back into my room, sick. I'm like, that's a very nice way of putting it. She's like, no, I respect it like he's, you know, he's come. been working all day. You got to be on it. 01:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, she's a mom, so she probably gets that, but. 01:10:07 - Dan’s iPhone Yeah, I mean, she's very much still with it, right? she's still very sharp, and it's like, OK, yeah, she can't drive, right? So she just lost that. And then, you know, she does, the Ubers are so expensive. And then she's been trying to find an alternative to Uber. then they're all ludicrous. It's like, there's this other service. It's a minimum $150. It's three hours, minimum three hours, $150. And then they're a nurse. And she's like, I don't need a nurse. I just need like a sidekick. But how would you even like provide a service like that, right? have to do background check on these people, like, you know. So yeah, how much? 01:10:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is she like interested in retirement community at all? 01:10:57 - Dan’s iPhone No. Well, then another. money, right? All the money is going to my debt. Yesterday, she literally said this. She was like, we'd all be better off if I died. And I was like, that's where you're at. And she's like, well, it would just make things easier. And she's like, you know, then he'd get all the money, and then he'd get even more money because I passed away. And she's like, this is eventually going to like, I'm eventually going to run out of money. And I like, well, do you don't have to worry about it until that happens. No, I don't think that's the problem. Like, it's not where she's living. 01:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, how do you? 01:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone Well, love me. You're gonna be thinking about it right now. It's like, kind of be some sort of thing network thing that you can tap into where they come pick you up. Like, it's gonna be some sort of group affair. Yeah. 01:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like, if you look at longevity, the people that live the the longest longest are the people. 01:12:00 - Dan’s iPhone that live in multi-generational houses and have basically like open door policies and people visit each other a lot and she's like super at that because the joke was we should just get you in a joining room here she's like I'm not I'm not moving into a place like this and I think she just means in general like she doesn't want to live but she would literally arrive because she everybody loves her and she everyone times she was she's the one that like it's like she has an invisible couch that she takes around and they lay down on it and just spill their guns she would you'd go into the store to get like a loaf of bread you know pick a milk and she'd come out with like someone's life story I'm like oh my god you were only in there what is that making it be like take care of other people for a little bit each week or could you do this just for three months or six 01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) once or whatever and frame it like she's there to help other people which would be true because what she did she was a nurse that was right but but that's what I'm saying but like maybe she needs it to be positioned as this is a thing that you need to go do for other people could you go do this for other people for a little while and just because like they're lonely they need help and they don't have anybody who will do it because everybody's busy and up in their own world but and then maybe she just finds what she needs because we all especially women like men do too many projects that are things and women need projects that are people and yeah so the other thing she can't do right now is because of this recovery from the surgery right so right now it's literally just about like she just needs interaction outside of my brother i think she's but she can't get it because she's homebound really 01:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone Come on, better turn. Luckily, she's got the dog. The dog does help. They never had a dog. We never had a dog run up. She loves this dog. The dog's the best, Aw. 01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Man, I can't turn off mom mode, but I also can't turn off daughter mode and sister mode and all that other stuff. And it just breaks my heart, like, how much loneliness is in the world when there's like, but everybody's not everybody's lonely. But like, so many people are lonely. I'm like, you know, you guys could solve that if you would just, like, spend time with each other. Right. anyway, okay, I will be quiet. 01:14:38 - Dan’s iPhone I will let you go. 01:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) wait, I don't know if we're talking to Mark Monday. I will check on that, because he is on vacation. But I know how he is. He pretty much doesn't have our council air calls. I will check. And then I will let you know if there's any change. Otherwise, we will soon. I will talk to you Monday. Tina MarieBasis

I've been sending them updates because usually when I give them updates, things change pretty quickly, but it's not, it's not turning. That's a little frustrating. So I'm putting more into Walker because it's working. And quite frankly, we need the leads, but they're really quite expensive. 00:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, are you on a laptop or phone or what? 00:02:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Um, I got both. mean, I'm on the phone, but I got my laptop with sort of screen. 00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And then what's your situation right now? 00:02:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Okay. 00:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay.

I don't want it to because it was Christian from Gape's 50th birthday. I was the only work person to go. So all the other people were his friends and that was cool. So I didn't have to be like. 00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we got to have fun and everything else is good. Okay, so there's been some back and forth with what Josh is working on. And I mean, it would kind of be helpful to me, Dan, if I could be looped in with Stacy and Josh, so there's not quite such a middle person who's not on these conversations. Actually interacting with Josh, is that possible? 00:03:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Totally. 00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's the first thing I'm going to do is let me send an email to you real quick and Stacy. Yeah. a second. It'll work better if I just do this now. You guys can talk amongst yourselves about ads or anything if you want to. 00:04:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Well, let's talk about some of the other state specific pages. know we talked about that bit with Missouri and New Mexico and Colorado. Do we make any progress in that regard or not yet? 00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, they're all getting built. So there's all written pages for each. 00:04:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, they did. 00:04:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They linked the like there's two. There's like that's footer. There's the footer text links that go to actual URLs and then above that are like map links and the map links go to GMB. And that's what the SEO guys wanted. Like no, leave that alone. So we'll add the state city, whatever specifics. 00:04:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) they're filling in separate pages that are Yeah, sweetlers, Kansas City is the best because XYZ got it correct. 00:05:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So they'll do Kansas. I'm sorry Missouri, Kansas City and whatever the other one was and then so the same sort of thing For each state and then area so each state will have state page and then the featured cities We'll call it in each. 00:05:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) We'll also have their own featured city page And then what are we doing? So I know Isaac read into like a complete wall on St. 00:05:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So the last I heard he well he ran into a wall using Regis and then he was gonna go try to get a Different location that would put a name in the lobby That's the last I don't know how he was doing that, but he's seen like he had a plan Okay, so I'm not cuz we could and we could ask I can ask the these dudes like they you know Yeah, I have to ask that do you guys have a method for this? I'll ask Aronzo if they have a way to do it or if they know or is it they said they have kind of approved in that city. They're like we have people that are doing the same thing so I'll assess them. Where's their office? 00:06:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Or is there a better way to do it like we first need to do a Yelp account and maybe sign up with the X for that and then did the GMB? 00:06:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well they said it was it's this photo. This is all that's all they want. They want a photo that you're listed in the lobby right? Like on that headboard thing that's in every lobby. 00:06:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That's so cool. What it makes sense to them to go on like say task rob it and have someone literally just go and hold up a sign next to it. 00:06:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Uh I mean it needs to be in with everyone else's name. 00:06:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay I mean just like print out a sign and put it next to it. 00:06:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) don't know. I'm just trying to a plug about them to go by the letters at Staples and just go make their own listing just really just put it on the They're similar font and just stick it on there. 00:07:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I mean, for the worst idea, it's not a lot of. 00:07:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I'll ask them. I mean, that I swear they said it was specifically that city that they ran into it before. 00:07:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) got to have an issue or a self. Well, because we're going to keep stepping this out in Colorado, probably Idaho. Obviously, we got Washington going. The same though. Because we just signed a potentially monster case in St. Louis, and in one nation, we don't lose it by every church imaginable. Like hit by a commercial truck and bring me. So that's really, really good. 00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So what kind of situation do you have in St. Louis? Is it like one of the virtual offices or an actual? Yeah. 00:07:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) OK, yeah, it's a religious. It's location because I don't miss a plan on putting someone there. Oh, probably imagine Google being Google knows which offices are good our virtual offices. 00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I mean, if you really don't want to be screwed over by them, I would not play that game. 00:08:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) The problem is trying to find another location because we're not going be as good about this and right it could be. Janky ghetto has to be a place that forwards mail. Because whatever is listed, people are going to send mail to him if we don't get things that can be a really big problem, like from a ethical ability standpoint. So we can't just go like round the corner store for a month, like put a sign up and then leave. Plus, you know, like this case, if it looks good, I'm going to fly out to the client and we'll have them quote unquote meet us in the office in the conference room. or go to their house, or trailer where they live. But if we're already running the decision in Missouri, I know it's like some time I've heard, it was, it was Arizona or somewhere else. Because it shouldn't just be reached, like our Phoenix office, we have two physical offices we pay for every single month that two people are in and are working in and clients meet them and they're, you know, once every two or three weeks. 00:09:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You said it shouldn't be Regis? 00:09:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Oh, it shouldn't just be because it's a Regis. doesn't work like we have. 00:09:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) He's not. It's that Regis won't put you on that board. 00:09:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So it just needs to be different Regis. Yeah. That's the problem. 00:09:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They will not, they don't have that option or whatever. So with that photo, it's all down to this, the monument or whatever the thing is called. 00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Have you tried like easy offices or anything else? Or could you use task? I have somebody go physically inspect these offices and tell you which ones and like go ask questions in person That's you which one Joel. I mean, I guess you could call and have somebody there do but which one's like one Efficient or effective that some brando on tus grab it. I mean my brain is just going through things and I was like Oh, you could just call so anyway, yeah But like there's easy offices It's like usually Google wants photos, right? 00:10:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You don't suppose I'm inside the building in your office. 00:10:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They want some video Yeah, totally But we can pay someone to go do a video and like send some business cars with some business cars on a desk We can do those things. Yeah There's no we did that with Aaron's own at one point because they were being a pain in the There are several different But I need to know what the main hold of this It's that one photo They want a photo of you listed as in office sweet and 20 or whatever, you know what I mean? 00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Like, yeah, that's in the lobby of most buildings, right? 00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you got a Missouri anyway, so if you get one of those buildings and are actually there, and you have like, here's my travel receipts, I was there on this day, here's my picture, here's my office. 00:11:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Sadly, you're not going to get that kind of level of a touch from GMV. 00:11:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You're not. I mean, setting it with videos and photos when we try to set it up can help, but I, yeah, I don't really care about your travel receipts. Actually, they would try to hurt more than it would help. 00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Huh, yeah. Well, anyway, there's other office things, so can you have somebody call and say, which ones will get you sign it, is there something? 00:11:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, well, it sounds like, because it's, I've been pleased in like the front when you come off the elevator, where there's, you know, the 20 different businesses listed. 00:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I emailed the rounds, I'm Um, are there, like, uh, St. Louis adjacent towns that would make any sense? Like, do you does it? 00:12:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yes. 00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:12:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) There's like Chester field. Like we don't have to be in downtown. one Chester would. There's a couple of smaller cities that are where, like, nice people live. 00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What are Chester field? 00:12:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You said Chester field at first. Oh, yeah. 00:12:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Chester field. Sorry. So then can you get offices there instead? 00:12:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I have to see if we can transfer a readjust because we just paid for a year. 00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) But it's not working for you, so. 00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, so there. 00:12:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Fair enough. 00:13:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) But before we do, maybe we have the Google guys say, hey, this is thumbs up. Once we saw the address, yeah. And then I'll have them start looking for, well, no, we have a call, lot of one. So let's ask them how to do that one first as well. 00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Dan, do you need a reminder to do that? 00:13:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh, I just emailed her. 00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. All right. So that's instruction, hopefully. And then you might as well start looking, well, I guess you get the thumbs up, then you'll go look and find the place. Yeah. So Daniel, report back. Can you just see C on there so that I know that we're on the next phase and Mark needs to be looking for a place. 00:13:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Let me see you on what? 00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) When you get a reply and you tell Mark what the answer is.

I still believe in it. actually don't hate it, but it just annoyed me from running a business perspective. 00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Two people going where? 00:20:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) We're turning. 00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Puh.

California, California is like, yeah, think as much as you want. 00:21:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Go for it. 00:21:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) We're practically Europe. We're going to hold the Olympics, and we're just going ask everyone to work from home. 00:21:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Businesses won't mind. 00:21:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) It's going to be a car-free LA Olympic. 00:21:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No, it isn't. 00:21:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Well, because the businesses close, then the economy tanks and then people beg the government to rescue them. Right. We're just becoming communism. 00:21:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's fine. They're literally pitching car-free, like, what is it? Yes. everyone? Like, that's not going to the Olympics. Yes. yeah. 00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They're doing what? 00:21:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) For LA Olympics, which I think is 2020. 00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It is. 00:21:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. They're trying to make it a car-free Olympics, saying that LA will be a car-free zone, so you get to use the public transportation that they're bringing in or whatever. 00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, no. You'll get Elon stuff. This is what I was telling my guy. when they launch it. I'm like, watch there be, you know, probably roll out in China first because that's where they do all the will control you step first. It's like, you know, the pandemic shut everything down and how much can you. But with all the autonomous cars, watch them make it so that, and they'll say it's for our own good. They'll find a way to make it safer for kids because that's when people are like, oh yeah. But you can't drive on government roads unless it's autonomous. Or you have a very specific kind of license, but either way, mass control of the roads. 00:22:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, a company hates Elon right now. 00:22:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They're not going to say it won't be launched. 00:22:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, they won't even let us face like launch, which is just like, how much more business do you want to send out of California? 00:22:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) See, the thing is, Elon created the tech. So if somebody else just goes and makes a different version of it, that's California friendly and still same thing. 00:22:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yes, Elon. 00:22:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, no, their is so far ahead. No one's going to. catch them. But they're trying to use just copy it and marks going to have a bunch of lawsuits and they use someone's other anonymous thing. 00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yes, the way most at 4am hunting ones in the parking lot by the way, it goes back to diversification, business one on one, have more terms of income and some that have nothing to do with law. 00:23:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yes, if you don't buy Tesla people, if you're not buying it by it, they are going to be huge. 00:23:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, because they're not just cars or anything. 00:23:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) They are not a car company. 00:23:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You know, they're overvalued still. 00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) They're probably forced to split. 00:23:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Also, I don't think they're even properly valued. They're like 200 bucks 200 bucks a share or something. 00:23:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Like 80 X. 00:23:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) That and Nvidia, Nvidia. Yeah, I want to get it. They are the only thing that can run all the AI. They're it. They are 00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like Coca Cola, like there's still has 10x at least in the last four years. Also steel, yeah, like fast and all I bought fast and all four years ago. And it just keeps growing and I could find out that Dexter has been like researching how that company runs and they're cutting edge. But, but they're so, um, what do you call it? Not just natural resources, but specific kind anyway that are harder to get and keep up with the demand. that's what I went with there. It's doing very well. That's what do you call it? Fast and all and you can't remember what it is. Yeah. That one has done really well for me too. Anyway, okay. So Elon and cars and whatever. 00:25:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Oh, also randomly the, um, it castle and key to celery? Uh, was bought by a construction attorney, uh, the nationals, the sellers left in disrepair and he decided that he would bring it back to life. 00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, actually buying businesses, not law firms, but other businesses might be a good idea right now because a lot of baby boomers or businesses, they're just going down and they can't keep up with it. But if you went in and bought it, like, it would depend on the business and how bad it was run and how many leads it has, but so many of them just barely got by and they did, but they have good branding, they have, they have loyal customers, but they don't, they don't do great marketing, they don't have great systems, you know, there's a lot of optimization to be optimization to be done in some of these older dying businesses that could be gold mines. 00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay. 00:26:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, speaking, I'm diversifying this long time and other interests and the fact that you have been studying marketing and whatever. 00:26:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I like Fuggy daycares. 00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I, oh my gosh, that's what my, we spent like an hour going through chat TBT sessions because she wants to be a vet and, but she's also wanted to be, have a dog bakery and anyway, she's obsessed with dogs dogs or her life. 00:26:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Lower on the dog bakery, uh, don't think the margin there's good, but basically you have an empty warehouse, like three teenagers and the dogs just run around all day playing with each other. 00:26:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh my gosh. 00:26:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I know, uh, there's a two, there's a, this gay couple down here that went to high school with a buddy of mine and they, they have a place called camp run a mutt because of what it's like. 00:26:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Oh my gosh. That's adorable. 00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) And dude, they've not like, I mean, they've been only been around handful of years and I think they're up to like six locations in just like greater San Diego, like just sort of like I could believe it sitting outside. Yeah. And some cameras. Yeah, you get the dog pools, you put up the cameras and then they kick dogs out, right? your dog doesn't, your dog houses a bike, they do your . 00:27:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm that we were talking about that. was talking about margin. So I'm like, if you have the dog bakery, but it was optimized for like dog health plus a doggy daycare. And then my other daughter that does like special effects make up she also does. She gives the dogs haircuts and she dies their hair. Mike, you could just have this whole business. Anyway, speaking of dogs, they're going nuts right now. Okay, so Dan, what's the situation with your Google accounts? 00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) More deep, whatever their name 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:28:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's now, they're, they're, they're, they got back and see the number seven. Yeah. Uh, on Wednesday or Thursday, they're, are you still having this problem? 00:28:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I'm like, yes, I'm still having this problem. You idiots. 00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I'm trying to give you money. So they, she, he, not even sure, uh, It's been escalated. Uh, the escalation has gotten me approximately zero, uh, outreach. But supposedly, it's escalated. It's clearly just broken. It's, there's something wrong on their end. Just don't deliver it. It's, and I've tried many more times to get it to work. 00:28:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I was like, this is never going to work. Uh, well, good luck screwing up my other business too. I'm like, come on. Another 71. 00:28:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Now I'm trying to launch this lead website that I built for the wedding plan. 00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Or people. 00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I can't get suffering from the exact same problem and that's a brand new account I can't get in. 00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So if it doesn't, if you can't get those to work, what's your next plan? 00:29:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I would have to try to open a new account with a credit card I've never used before. From an IP, I've never used it. I could have to go all healthy stealth until they jump through their hoops and not get detected, even though I'm not really trying to get around anything, but that would be the only thing. I do think I do have a credit card that I've never used, so I have to confirm about those. 00:29:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You can't build any of my accounts, right? 00:29:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) No. No, I don't want to, I don't want to like risk like cross-pollinate because I don't know exactly what's wrong. So I'm like, it's like, I don't think I've been banned. don't do anything. 00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, okay. 00:30:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh, yeah, I have a credit card and I took out credit cards in my parents name through the business. So I had different credit cards. I have a credit card. My dad's name. I can literally put whatever these things. They don't care. they do. I tried to do it with my kids and somehow they figured out they were under 18. That was like, oh crap. 00:30:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Because we've done like MS, we've done wash. 00:30:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Really? 00:30:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Amex? Yeah, they don't care. 00:30:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh, they didn't care about my parents. They did care about the kids. Somehow they sniffed out that they were under 18. Mm hmm. Yeah, which I thought was weird and I was like, oh, I guess that makes sense. But now actually Abelens now under 18. 00:30:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) should get one in the table of name. There you go. build her credit and. 00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) All right, yeah, yeah, feel her identity it's for a good cause We're gonna use that word for to use your help builder credit. 00:31:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) There you go. 00:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah Um, okay, so I have Uh, I got to finish this I just didn't email to myself. I don't think I finished it. Um call control. Hold on Have some websites. I just have to review them And then let's set the reminder Wait for it to come through Don't You Do you know, Dan? 00:32:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I do not. 00:32:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Come on, come through. There it is. Okay, reminder. Okay. All right, let's see. So I sent an email asking and I CC you also mark if maybe all of us could and you maybe you don't want to, but at the very least I'm going to get on a call with Josh so I can understand what he's already working on what he knows and what can be done, but where I think that at some point, having the all of us on the same page would be, you know, what data is right and wrong when it shows up. And I just think that we'll get where we're going faster being all on the same page, but maybe the. First conversation would be I want to see what he's done and so I can get my head wrapped around what's there and compare it to what we know we want in the reports already. So maybe that's one and then step two if we could just if we can get on a call all together validating the data and then just tying it up, wrapping it up and being done with what we're asking of him would be ideal to me. Okay, okay. All right, I just sent that email so we'll get that rolling and let's see then we can stop talking about it every week hopefully and just have it to use. 00:33:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So, Dan, some of the people we met in Louisville who run marketing for MSculpt. Yeah, I like medspots stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're going on. Yeah, we're see your hand. I think it's my call go high level. They're like, yes, but we love it. It agrees with everything. 00:34:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Like, how do you know about this? Like been there, done that. 00:34:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So again, it's definitely the right thing to use, which is good. And knowing that it has a lot of great availability medical spaces. You feel a little better. 00:34:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So well, yeah, and then our, my, our internal developer guy, like we, I'm now at this point with him where I'm like, oh, you know, would be great. we should make it do XYZ. 00:34:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And then this morning he was like, Hey, I was thinking about what you're saying. We could totally do that. was like, okay, go ahead and do that. 00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. 00:34:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So we're like building our own app. Like it's the app's inside, but you're really just going out to your server and doing this other stuff. So it's okay. 00:34:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I'm excited to keep building this out for three reasons. One, because it's just kind of fun. Um, two, obviously, Chona. That'd be great. Our business, but three, the more I thought about this, and I want to pick your brain in this part, that's where I'm transitioning to. What if we, yeah, I'm trying to think of how to make the doctors work with more and more sticky to what I do and what we do. Yeah. In terms of I own you for lack of better term, we're already paying them well, we're already in communication, you know, we're saying them to like, you know, the suite or whatever we're sending them lunch. We're doing nice things for them. Most of the doctors I'm dealing with are not the most savvy people in the entire world, in terms of like business, in terms of technology. 00:35:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) mean, some of them are, right? That's like obviously a very, very general statement. 00:35:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, but if we're able to put more of these doctors on our high level, so we can, I want to say control the data, but. but keep them sticking to us, help them convert more of their patients, and then, you know, push us whenever possible. It could open up an entirely different segment of what we do. 00:36:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I don't know if that's getting too close to like crossing the line. What do you mean a different segment? I'm not totally following. 00:36:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay, so the keros and pain dogs that we work with, most of them are using like three or four different kind of EMRs, right, the electronic medical worker systems. Some of them have automated reminders, some of them don't, but none of them really have great lead nurturing, and almost none of them have good reporting. So a lot of them are just downloading the reports, doing everything manually, like getting it back, like how much they are to go about. For a lot of these guys, it's all about their AR, but they don't track how much they're getting by lawyer, how long it's been out, you know, different things that I know we can easily. input, assuming the information comes in. 00:37:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) to get him to do that, and it's all so chaotic, like not chaotic, okay. 00:37:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Correct. Yeah. And there's so much easier ways to do this, because I know high level has a lot of great integration, whether it's with QuickBooks or just even just basic information coming in. Yeah. the more people that we can get switched over to what we do, they're never going to leave. Right. how from there can we get them on our system, and then subtly the nudge, you know, sweet lures, sweet lures, I don't know. That's the part where I'm kind of like, okay, I see from A to C, but I don't know where point B is. And that's what it's about with. 00:37:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Well, do you think that what would happen is that you'd get that this would get a doctor that's already working with lawyers that are not new? And so then it would be like, oh, hey, it's got this feature that reports back on the firms that you're working with. And then we would see that we'd be like, Oh, well, they're working with this firm and this firm and this term. Um, mean, I've done second. 00:38:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I've no idea. going to call Michael. Hello. Okay, no problem. 00:38:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the very least, you're going to be able to see what doctors are working with firms and like the volume that they're getting in the app. then, I guess you just told call and be like, Oh, well, I already know I can beat what you're getting from the lawyers that you're already working with. Well, you know that. Right. 00:38:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Other averages and other things. 00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Slippery slip. Don't do it. I just think you like it feels really like a bad, bad, bad idea. could see. how you can do it. And I don't think you should. I think that you should just be glad for the business that that you have that expands and you get data and that data will teach you other things. But I think that it's just putting too much risk. So let's say you have a competitor who knows that you're doing that and they've got somebody who is high up who could just go twist it and make it look bad. just want to avoid the appearance of evil. Meaning it like that's the phrase, right? But avoid the appearance of doing something shady and trying to get business from those two. use it as a plan that it's an amazing business model because that market is underserved and you know how to serve it. And that that data will tell you how to continue to serve it better. And it may inspire you to know what you can do for building suite law. But Rather, look at it as a diverse way for your portfolio of businesses, but I would not try to figure out and almost even just say these people cannot do business with us because you are too open and too vulnerable to get them both shut down. 00:40:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So then we just do like the data. can get overall data, so we say, hey, here's what we're seeing across the entire market, but not having this individual. 00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I mean, it would be primed to be an expert speaker, to be a consultant, like you didn't be caught. You weren't an attorney anymore. You sold sweet lock after having done this for years, a few years, stayed as a consultant so that you still get the own, like the ability to access the data on both sides, you know, but, but trying to mix the two, you get, you had just have the wrong person looking. 00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) at you and you lose both of them how you would lose anything but yeah you could um because the more the bigger you are the worst enemies you have it doesn't matter if it's even legal or not you just but i mean i would what would they do to you oh you stole my dog they're like go back yourself no you know the issue is it's it's about it yeah oh they did differ because you you they can't for hit for lawyers you can't they can't pitch doctors anyway like there there's uh i mean you can but like there's what you can you can that's how that's how he gets doctors yeah i don't know anyway it just it just feels like a very very bad idea i mean i think you just let the data accumulate and then you make a decision like it could be nothing there. 00:42:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Got it. 00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're more in the world, Mark, powerful people who do really unethical things and just make it short people. So maybe you get what I'm saying more. It's not too. 00:42:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) It's not legal. 00:42:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not about what what makes sense. It's just that certain people got nothing better to do with their money than go do like that. 00:42:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Correct, but I'm also trying to think more and more of I don't want to say merging people. But the more you keep them within your ecosystem, there's two ways to look at it. more I have you by the balls, the more control I have over you. That's the worst way to look at it. That's not how I tend to operate. But still good to know. can just rip your balls off whenever I want. The better way to look at it is if I keep you within my ecosystem, then I've got a bigger and bigger ecosystem and growing, which more things coming into this ecosystem. but are okay. And everyone wins and everyone's happy. 00:43:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah, so you probably find what you're probably find is doctors that don't have this aspect to their business at all. 00:43:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And you could say, Hey, I'm going to get the most of the chiropractors that I work with, the pain docs are like, some messes have the time when it comes to business. 00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm going to give you a Tina version of this conversation that is a little bit different and about grounding, but also morality and being careful. there's a scripture that pops in my head from time to time. And that is that we have learned by said experience that is the nature and disposition of almost all men as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. The thing that you have to watch out is for temptation. So when you say, you know, I wouldn't do this, but just knowing I have the power, you put yourself in that position with the power, the temptation. and grows. So don't put yourself in that position and not even with that mindset because there's another one, the story of the two worlds, which one grows when you feed. Don't feed the power thing. Feed influence. Feed. So you having all of the data and being the sage, the wise sage that knows all of these things, that's more power. And it doesn't create enemies and it doesn't put a target on your back. Just be in there, know all the things, be the wise advisor, the one that people go to because with that flows money, flows more power and influence, but without setting yourself up in a situation to want to use it badly and just blacken your soul over time. That's all I'm saying. 00:44:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yay. 00:44:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Blackened. 00:44:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) To hear the buildings. 00:45:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Get those black molds when they're just sitting there in the celery because of what's coming out of these bourbon barrels not doing even bad. The building's so turn black. 00:45:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Real happen. 00:45:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. Anyway, my goal is not to try to screw over people. You guys know that about me. The goal is to try to figure out how we can build these things that everyone works better, more efficiently, less frustratingly and help me grow my business at the same time and multiple streams of income. Is always really good and has done a more than sure will attest as well. Tina. 00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Monthly recurring revenue is fast ever. 00:45:41 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, and I don't have that as much with what I do. 00:45:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So the more we start talking originally, you're like, I eventually just want to sell this business. think here's the thing. If you're going to like you, we have to go back to the value conversation. What is it that you want to do most of my. I was what brings you joy, but also what empowers it, right? What supplies it? You have to be able to fund all of the things that you want to do. But one of the aspects was being a consultant and the anyway, just keep thinking about not when you look at opportunity, you have to run us through some kind of filter and the filter has to be, how does this help or support my greatest values or how could it potentially hinder it? How could it distract me from what? 00:46:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) These are distractions, but the more that I build it up, not only do every cring, I do better understand from the doctor side as well. 00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you just hope to pitch. are talking about that just trying to get everybody to come back to sweet loss specifically. 00:46:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I'm not sure I'm that one, but the more people, remember, it's top of mind on all this stuff, right? 00:46:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's the reason I do all the webinars and everything else. It will probably I just naturally gravitate and create some magnetism so that but trying to engineer is what I think is not wise. 00:47:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Right, trying to force it. 00:47:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that's all I'm saying. And it's not a decision to make now. 00:47:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) We're not even there. 00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We don't get there but I'm just saying just check your intentions. Keep a check on yourself and go build the thing and do the thing that helps everybody grow their business and be better and be smarter and think about it that way and know that so gravity is affected by mass, right? Gravity, the whole. Anyway, the formula for gravity, I can't remember what it is but it has to do with mass. The bigger you grow, the bigger mass is, the bigger gravitational pull is. More will come to you naturally and consequently anyway. 00:47:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Make sense? 00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. So just build it and get better at it. more that you understand the data, the more stretch and almost even surgical, you will see in terms of a path to what's the next thing, what's the most leverage thing. And so, but since you brought that particular angle up, we had that conversation, but I think it'll be a moot point once we get there anyway. 00:48:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So back to executing it. So Dan, did you have a conversation with Jonah? 00:48:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Do you know what you need to start working on to build something for helping her? It's on vacation with somebody. 00:48:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I can grab her if you want. 00:48:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) You tell me what time it works. No, I'm just going to email her. 00:48:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) As long as I can email her at that Yahoo, I'll just be asking her questions. 00:48:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Yeah. I'll just ask her questions over email, but legit me. 00:48:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I'm like, just going to wait till they get back. No, that's that. 00:48:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) have enough going out. Oh, okay. 00:48:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Or you sitting in like a bunch of No. 00:48:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) She has expensive tastes and she needs to be able to pay for a portion. So no. No rest for the wicked. 00:48:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) What? Oh, such. 00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hope she's watching sometimes. I mean, generally speaking, her life is great. 00:49:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) She's fine. Generally speaking, she's fine. 00:49:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Generally speaking, I only drive her slightly crazy. 00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I gotta figure out, I could go like and search our messages and see if we, because I don't have something on my calendar for this week, but I've thought we talked about meeting. I mean, we're back Wednesday night, so we should be around. Yeah, okay, so hold on, let me go to where's the last time I had. I will meet this repeating. Okay, cool. thought I was on the calendar. Okay, so what's the next step then for getting down and showing it together? 00:49:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's about it. 00:49:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I have a email. Yeah, I know I I literally just stick my head in the other room and yell at her. just the way you do have an email address and I'm going to yell at her. I'll throw the empty pizza box at her. 00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's fine. Mark, be nice. 00:50:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) New York pizza is awesome. Yes, it is. residents. I don't want to go. 00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So any excuse. 00:50:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) You're such a punk. Yeah, what else is new? 00:50:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:50:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That's okay. We went to a super arrogant dude. Oh, my cousin last night. So you should buy a scratch. Andrew Philip Lee, was on like Top Chef, competing with her. But there was like two investors. was basically just pitching the entire time, ignoring everyone else. If it was like good, I would say seven out of 10, but yeah. So I don't know what I came up, but yes. This area and tables. 00:50:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) It's fine. 00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're okay. 00:50:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That saying that that's what made you think of it a little bit. All right, well, no whiskey for Tina. Sorry, bourbon, no bourbon, bourbon bourbon list, bourbon list. I haven't got chocolate, bourbon balls for and now, I had enough blockouts when I was 18 that I don't even if it wasn't for replays and I wouldn't be drinking things in halves. Fair enough. 00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, um, let's see. 00:51:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) How's Patrick? 00:51:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, so last week I was sick and we need to meet so I need to meet with them. 00:51:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Patrick's doing better so whatever you're doing with him is working. 00:51:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, well, can you quantify that for me? 00:51:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yes. Will you now? Um, yeah, he's slowly there and he's responsible for everything, which is good because he's kind of complaining one of his staff was out on vacation, they got sick and the emails weren't getting properly folded. So now he understands like he's going to take responsibility when stuff happens in his team. But the competition wise, he's trying to beat everyone else, which is good. We're getting fewer and fewer complaints, so he's getting his systems down a little bit better with his flow. So I don't have like it's 23% better or anything like that, but I can see the difference. So that's positive. 00:52:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. 00:52:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And he's going to take the Nevada bar in February. 00:52:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Nice. 00:52:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So yeah, then Hank will take the Georgia bar in February. So by summertime, God willing, we'll be able to open up those two states. One second. Doesn't about it just makes too much sense. My job will be a standpoint. 00:52:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think he's taking about the Nevada bar. 00:53:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Also on February? No, you seen the Georgia mark. 00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, Georgia. 00:53:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay. The Atlanta is a large city that really it apparently works pretty well for there's already some doctors there. 00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:53:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So, um, Sam's waiting into Illinois. So I've Missouri, Illinois, Georgia is kind of our Midwest East Coast ish stuff to start. And then everyone keeps talking about South Carolina, North Carolina is great for commercial trucking accidents. So I got to look into those. And then maybe we stop extending seats. 00:53:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. there's a lot of states. There's a lot of evaluating that has to be done too. And again, with the goal of you don't want to be in the office a lot. And you really don't have a great leader there to be running the business for you. really, if you want to keep this business going and you want it to be leveraged and massage well you need somebody. who isn't going to go off and have babies, who really likes running, likes leading, likes teaching, likes knowing the numbers and get them in there, so that you can work on the marketing, the strategy, the schmoozing, all the other things that are really important to making it work well, but you're missing that piece inside of your business right now and there's going to come a breaking point sooner rather than later in the growth cycle, if you don't have that in there, Mary is not that person, you don't have anybody that I don't agree with you. So now whether or not that's something that I know we've had this conversation before, but Salko, I don't know how much he would want, he's not the right person, he is definitely not the right person, but that's like abilities, not the point, especially so that's one part, part two is I don't 00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And he wants to do that. 00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK. 00:55:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I really don't think he has any desire to do that. He likes to work two to four hours a day on most days. And I can go to everyone with my kids. 00:55:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, that's good to know. Also, the thing to keep in mind is, so when we started this, Sweet Law was really the opposite of the building was your, I would say, emotional support business. And I don't think you need it like that, like you did before, because you're going out and socializing more and building a life. So the things that you might not have done, because you wanted everybody to be happy, might not be how you feel about it now. And I want you to just ponder on that and come back to me next week. Do not reply to me now about it. Think about it and think about what is true or not true about that. 00:56:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I would love to find a far far better than anything I've got in my office. I'll call it a supervising attorney for the lack of a better term, because I need someone on the legal side, but it's a supervisory slash COO type role. And I hear what you're saying with the finances, what's going on with all of this. 00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) the finances, but the leadership style and the absence of a firm and organizational presence. And how much you care about how your people like or don't like them, like that I really need you to contemplate that part of the conversation I just said, and what your emotional needs from your business were and are now. Because there's been a detachment that is good for business and good for you, but the way that you were operating was based on. a previous version that doesn't exist anymore and that should be considered. 00:57:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) So it's probably two roles. That would be a good supervising attorney. He kind of is doing it right now. He'd be good at that. He would not be good at running the business and you're right. He would not want to do it. Then you need like so, the odds of you getting someone that is good at the supervising attorney and the other is so slim. That's more than more couple. But you'd have like a C.O.L. supervising attorney. It's very much integrator visionary. integrator here doesn't need to know how to run it as a business. They don't need to run it as a lawyer. 00:57:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) No, so you do need the supervising attorney from the past. that will help us because I don't know. So I was the right one. 00:58:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) I don't know. 00:58:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) He's very knowledgeable. 00:58:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) He's sort of the role he's serving right now. 00:58:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) He is, but he's still pre-lit and what he does is still a bit different and he's still very, very conservative on the side, which it's fine. It just is what it is. Mary's best role is continuing to train people and recruit people. She does good job with that and is great at dealing with the case managers and the assistants and everything else that I think can continue to be her role. That's fine as her role. But someone who's actually running the company, yeah, that's not her. No. I know that. know that we all kind of are aware of that at this time and it's okay for now, but as we continue to grow and extend, it's not going to be okay. 00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. 00:58:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) So this is where the attorney going over all of the attorneys and also. So overlooking intake would take each gigantic load off of my shoulders. 00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So how do you feel about Samantha doing that? Now hold on a second, hold on, just for a minute. Don't think about the impact of her not being able to run all the cases. 00:59:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Nope, that's not where I'm even thinking about that side. She has zero apt to do it. She's shown a complete and total unwillingness to want to learn, to want to get better, any responsibility for anyone else. OK, she's just focused on her own racetrack and how she can squeeze every penny out of the law firm that she can, which is a right as an employee. But she has shown zero apt to do it. Because some that we talked about, these just I'm very, very disappointed to say it that way, because I thought she could really hit that. 00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No. 00:59:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) That's right. 00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I really thought she could. That tracks with just the tiny experience that I had with her. but also other things that you've said. So it is, it's too bad, because she has a lot of fun. Yeah. Okay, so- I don't think a siler, although Taylor has a very good knowledge base is very good with people. 01:00:16 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I don't think he has the desire to do it necessarily. He wants to be in the office five days week. No, he doesn't basically probably do it now. Now, Bren's not really the right one. And everyone else kind of too new to this to really be, you know, it's not Patrick, he's just too new. 01:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) mean, it's not his fault. just- Part doesn't love baby. 01:00:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) He's baby. Hank's still new to this. The law of course, obviously, too new in the Nick R. Lee Asian attorney doesn't make sense. 01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He doesn't do any pre-lit, so. So what if you're looking for a new attorney, because we're always looking, we've always got things Now, you set a new intention of you want it to be a managing attorney, a supervising attorney. That conversation changes like what can you afford it to be and do some forecasting we can do together as to like, if we could get somebody in there who could create a 5%, 10%, whatever improvement across the team, maybe not Samantha Rice, probably capped out, but I don't know. What would that do in returns for sweet law and then kind of put the salary or not the salary, but the salary plus an incentive program that only pays the money on the performance. And then, and then you've got a good offer for somebody who might be looking for a place to be respected, have the opportunity to work on their leadership that they haven't been able to, because they've just been working. in cases, that type of thing, like just get super clear on who you're looking for, who they are, like where are they at in their lives, where where they've been working, like it's an avatar kind of definition, right, of your ideal candidate. But the more specific you get on that, the more likely that you are to attract that particular person and have the offer and the package and the position ready for them to just be inserted to. The clarity increases the speed and likelihood of getting that. 01:02:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) But this is unicorn level stuff people, unicorn level. Oh, crap. 01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) not late for a meeting. That's not so cool. 01:02:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) It is really difficult because the hardest, I think the hardest thing is what we do is the volume. It's not just legal said, you can find plenty of people who've done personal injury out there. 01:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) The volume's the difficult part. 01:02:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) And the firms that tend to do our volume are higher or not firms that I think highly afraid. I've been to major issues. And realistically, we'd be pulling someone from one of those firms. Now, they may be ticked off with how that from works. And that's why they're looking to leap, right? Because they're tired of the doctor. It's not going to be a lawyer cash, not going to be a lawyer. How many people are you providing attorney role? 01:03:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Oh, for that. That's it. But I don't think you need which role do you really need next? I guess would be if you had to prioritize a role, which one? 01:03:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I think that'd be the biggest one because imagine if you could drive another 10% of just top line with what we're doing for a year. 01:03:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com) Where does that come from They send is drive to winter. 01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I can tell you that because if I was meeting with these guys on a daily basis and even just had half an hour to check on them on them every day, especially if I actually had oversight. can see them. The things that we're talking about, there, there is so much room for improvement in their systems. So, if somebody can actually be there and spend more time with them and watch what they're doing and knows that inside out as well on top of that, the list is 100% there for the taking. They will get to resolution faster, will do better on, I don't know how much better they can do on on distributions and getting getting those attorney fees. 01:04:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I don't know. pretty good at, but I think they could do a better job working up the cases, essentially catching other issues, other injuries, they're missing, other percent of them. 01:04:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I'm just scratching the surface of where we're doing, but and you're going to start getting a compounding effect of that. But if you have somebody in there who's doing that all the time and working with them closely and seeing how consistent. Don't mean they do that because sometimes, you know, we'll show up in the week and they've done it, but they've barely done it, you know, and I've got this one hour, whereas that's the kind of thing that gets managed every day. The speed is going to be so much faster. The results are going to be faster. You're definitely going to get more money out of the existing team you have. So, but on top of that, every new person coming in should be starting at a higher level, which makes them more valuable from the gate if you have somebody who's in this role and doing a good job at it. 01:05:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Now, so the second voice thing that we are having them do for each other, is experience. Yes, they should be able to get more and instruct. Hey, here's where this case went wrong. 01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Here's what we can do better next time. Yes, yes, yes, they, they need that. Well, go ahead. Okay. Anyway, so they're from another firm. One of the attributes, though, is that you should be looking for is somebody who learns quickly and likes to learn and also is good at teaching. So one of the things they might be unhappy at the other firm is, and they might not even know it. I can't even tell you, Mark, because of the way that I ask questions. One of the things that happens as a natural consequence is just people going, oh, I never thought about it that way, right? So they know that they're unhappy, but they don't know all the reasons they're unhappy. what we're putting out energetically is that this person is unhappy because they know that they're called to do more things. Like they want to lead, they want to teach, they want to learn, and they're just stuck operating, but they want to fulfill all these other things. And so there's probably other things that are off and dragging them nuts, but when this is put in front of their like, oh, like, that's the think I didn't know I needed that that kind of conversation. I think that that can happen. Are you there? 01:07:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I'm here. I agree with you. No, I don't disagree with anything. Well, I don't I do think it's an area of need. It's obviously a it's a key expensive iron, but the right person will, you know, help not just the bottom line, but help all the processes realistically. 01:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Right. So we go do some forecasting and look at what would happen if we got 5% improvement across the board, or maybe we make specific percentage of improvement targets for forecasting exercise with each of your different attorneys, attorneys, because they've all got different room and and plates for lifts, right? Samantha probably doesn't have a lot, but Patrick might have more Lorenz even more maybe based on the numbers and then go look at okay, what What would that generate and revenue if we were to get even half that or just super conservative numbers and then go higher and we know it's going to take a while to find this person and hire them. But yeah, the specificity of what we're looking for will help us find them faster. 01:08:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yes. And look, it's not going to be perfect person. You like the very first one is multi-stage practice and most of the state's rent is almost nil. 01:08:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not a lot of people to do it. So what I would love you to do is write out everything that you know that that person should be if we were going to make it perfect. And then on the on the left side, so do the non-negotiables, right? Absolutely, requirements and then the negotiable, but we would love to have. So you start with the overview, all the things, right? And then you put them into non-negotiable and negotiable. And then we go from there and we'll also do some the forecasting numbers. I got a goal, but I sent a calendar invite for you in China for Thursday at 6 p.m. that we can catch up and then and I think that's it. Unless you have any questions or anything else that you're going to my notes for later. 01:09:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Dan's in the high level going for her since we're talking about it. Yeah, moving a little bit. I'll really start thinking more about yeah, the summarizing and turning what that looks like. We've been such an up on a good managing and take person. We've had another interview, it wasn't. 01:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We'll keep pushing. 01:09:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Sorry. Yeah, look, having Patsy back in January will help, but yeah, overall, we're really a stronger person there. So it's just upgrading some new ski rules more than anything else as we keep growing and then definitely putting people in difference. any plans because I think I was a little overly generous while we were smaller. I need to pull back so we're getting bigger. So yeah. 01:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So write that out though, don't just think about it. It needs to be. 01:10:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I need to sit with I think both Michelle and Mary to look at what the numbers actually look like rather than me just trying to guess where things look like if we give them two or three percent set of five or seven percent what does that actually look like and go from there? 01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And before you implement it you should bring it back here so we can just go we will brains on it just to double check and support you that way. 01:10:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Yeah it may just be a higher base but much lower percentage although we'll see. I need to play around with those numbers and I'll bring a couple options and we'll look at it together and see what makes the most sense. 01:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes but written because that really helps us visualize and be on the same page. Okay cool. right then you've got to be nice to your wife. 01:10:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) She's like nothing right now. 01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She should be fine. 01:11:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Do you make her happy? She will make you look more. 01:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you want women are very sweet? That's a shame. 01:11:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Okay, you get what you get then. Well, I literally have a financial planner set for tomorrow. 01:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we go through all of our stuff, which is great. So she'll feel better in that regard. Don't be like I paid for everything. 01:11:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I'm taking her to car bone. We're going to see Lion King on Broadway. Are you going to say sweet things? Probably not. 01:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, do you want to be happy? 01:11:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) I don't know anymore. You did want to be happy. 01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, cry. Sweet words. 01:11:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) Just try. Or she was, or she was. Trust me. 01:11:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Trust me. I am very good. Just look, I have my guy is like Tony Soprano and he was very proud of that. And guess who broke him? I didn't break him. He's still very strong. 01:11:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com) But he has learned how to be sweet and guess who is learning. How to be happy even while the FTC is trying to murder him. Yes. 01:12:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. So listen to me mark Okay, mean it's gonna your dogs are going crazy. I know somebody's probably here, but I don't answer the door because imagine if they were in a doggy daycare Maybe so happy with a big hurry attached to it Like I haven't been here for six days and they're just like can you hug me for the next hour, please? No, good. I love them. I need a doggy daddy.

00:00:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. Hello. 00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, how are you? 00:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. Good, Good. 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Did you day? 00:00:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. No, my Friday was. 00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Would you have gone on Friday? 00:00:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. I went to, you know, my lunch times, you gypsy class. Yeah. And then I, uh, how do you get to see that? When I cut my eye open. 00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, hatch. Oh, my gosh. That's a lot. 00:00:39 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. So I went to the ER. Oh, I was that jujitsu. I somehow, someone scratched the top of my eyelid. And so the skin right above the eyebrow or the eyelash muscle tore off. And that's, that's what got me. So anyway, went to the ER, then they glued it back together. I have like that super blue Derma Bonda in my eyelid. 00:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, I don't know if it's your internet or my internet. It's fine. Okay. 00:01:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. 00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It froze right on your eye. was like. 00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. Perfect. 00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh my gosh. Yeah. Um, okay. Homework assignments. Oh, did you send me anything? 00:01:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, I don't think I was, uh, I have my hub spot. I'll share with you that I made a hub spot. Very excited. 00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right. 00:01:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I did the first, uh, the ones on that list. Um, yeah. So I signed up for a free version of HubSpot and then I finally just, I mean, I think I was having like decision paralysis. because my wife uses Salesforce CRM and then other people use air tables CRM and there's the SANA and HubSpot so finally I chose one I just chose HubSpot signed up and then yeah I just started building this contact list and I had a really good pretty good rate. Pretty much everyone I called or most of people I called would answer and then I would take their message I would like record their call secretly on my iPhone and then transcribe what was said, feed it into chat GPT and then they'd summarize it into a note format like this. 00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So then yeah now I know kind of like my next steps and what I have to do to message them. That's awesome let's see good and new, well that can be my priority. Let's see, call contact case managers, that's what you did right? 00:03:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. How many need to do. 00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So in the create new spreadsheet for a law from referral data, is that what HubSpot's taking care of or? 00:03:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I was going based on that. It was the, where was that? It was the one that my. It was the sheet that my manager set up. 00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see. 00:03:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's called Conteositas. 00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that one. 00:03:42 - Fujinaka, M.D. I got it. Yeah. Okay. There was a couple of these that I didn't call like when and I think it was rocky because they actually were referred by funding company. So I don't want to like backstab person that referred to me. So I stuck with the other ones. 00:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. How I don't understand that relationship, I think. So can you elaborate a little bit more? 00:04:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh yeah, it's like how like reaching out to them would be backstabbing. It's like this company like Global. So these guys, I sign a contract with them to get paid up front much lower than I usually get. So like these guys I signed up for like $250 a visit. And in return, they just refer cases straight to me. And then once I do the once I do the console, give them the note, they just give me $250. dollars at the front. I don't have to wait a year for 18 months. Downside is I make probably like, well, you know, I make like $200 less than I should, but I don't have to wait. 00:05:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:05:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. So, when they send me a case, I know the lawyer, right? Like, I know the case manager, because I could see who sent it to them. So, I just, to be playing nice in the sandbox, I don't, I don't try to jump over them and call their case manager and steal that relationship. 00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it's got to. 00:05:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. Because otherwise, they'll stop sending me cases. 00:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, got it. 00:05:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. So, but I do, like, I noticed that Global has sent me, like, one of cases in the past, like, from one law firm. If I noticed that, like, hey, they've only sent me one in, like, the last four or five months, I have gone back and messaged that law firm. was like, hey, like, six months ago, I did a case for you. 00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) guys how do you know but when when they're actively sending me cases I don't I try not to go after those guys how many cases have they sent you in the last year they send me I don't know in the last year but they send me about 10 or less that tone is called sprinkles I know I use a lot that's your alarm clock I said time to go on with Tina that that I think that's the same one we have yeah that's how I got it I choose I choose ones that aren't so distressing some of the alerts are very make you hear them I'm like leap out of my skin and I'm ready to go to battle fight or play I don't have fight flight or freeze I just have fight yeah that's it I only have one flavor it's funny radar radar does that to me radar makes me go like ah really Oh, like, oh, the radar sound. Yes. Or is it radio? It's called radio. 00:07:05 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know. 00:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. 00:07:06 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's aggressive. 00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, that is the one that I use when I need to not ignore an alarm. So I know if I've assigned something to that, I don't get to dismiss it or anything or snooze or whatever. OK. So I'm going to look at it on my screen. So what I would like is, whoa, there to go. Let's see. I'm going to insert column left, date, contacted, so that we know when you followed up with them. And this will be, we're assuming that this means when you've reached out for more cases. That way, you can track just easily, like, if it's been a little while, go ahead and reach out to the rest of them. And the other thing that What did we decide on a frequency of contact? 00:08:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. Um, for like ones that have only gave me one or two cases in general. 00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I think we should come up with that so that you just don't sit there and think, well, should I, should I, we just made a decision and is it within those parameters or is it not? it's not, then I reach out. 00:08:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Maybe I could put something like, like HubSpot or write in like HubSpot or something like that, because I think I could put a column in HubSpot where it says date last contacted. 00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Can we look at that together again? 00:08:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. I don't know to share a screen. 00:08:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You pick, I don't know how to do what I've just been doing. 00:08:54 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know how to, um, I've been asking chat GPT how to like set it up. 00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So that's probably not a chat. question. Awesome. 00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. I love do I create a field in a contact that is last state contact. Okay, customize. Gear icon. Okay. Data management. Up here. Properties. Oh, contact properties. And put create property in the top right. Oh, here it is, late, last object, awesome, so how do I add it, and then, okay, okay, how do I, what do I do now? 00:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, I thought I heard a dog, but I don't see her in her bed, just because she's over there. 00:10:43 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Is that it? Okay. 00:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:11:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, let's try to do this number. So now, there should be a, oh, okay, how do I find where I just did, 2D. 00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Maybe ask it how you can set it up so that in your, like, main view, it shows up that way. So, like, if you were to look up like this, right, how would you view it here? Or is there a view where you can just look at everybody and see that? Custom data thing that you just added. 00:11:55 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, yeah, yes, okay. So, may now you should click on contacts, open list of contacts. Let's try that. OK. Hot-contact. 00:12:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Advanced filter, maybe. Or all of you. 00:12:09 - Fujinaka, M.D. Oh, click. Do you see where action is?

Oh, maybe just automatically does it. Okay. Cool. All right. It'll just automatically. Okay. 00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) when I log in email or something, it'll save the day in the last contact. So you're contacting them through HubSpot? 00:14:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. No. 00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) haven't linked it yet. So then how is it updating it? 00:14:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. Because every time I call them, I take a transcript of what we talked about and then I put it right here. Inactivity? 00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. log it as an activity. 00:14:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. I put log, I put note, add in a note for a log call. Okay. And then I log my email that I have emailed them. Okay. So you're logging in? 00:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I was like, how is it knowing? 00:15:01 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, I got it. Yeah, it's very manual. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think I could do better like with automation, but for now, I was like, with Mark and with Dan, we're working on building an automation for something that would work for this. 00:15:20 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I was like, he's flashing up every time I click log email to like, you know, if you give us your Gmail account, we could log it for you. But I just, I haven't wanted to use that yet. Yeah. I want to learn how this goes in manually and then, I don't know, let's see. Yeah. This, this, this will help. Now I can figure out like, okay, I contacted them five days ago. 00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. So then, do you have all of your lists in here, including the ones that you haven't contacted? 00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. These are like the ones that 00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay so then the assignment for this week is to make sure you get everybody in there and then I think so frequency that that's the thing right what's what's the target is because there's there's two I don't know kind of deciding factors which is one when was the last time they sent you a case and two was the last time you followed up with that right right so how long after receiving a case do you want to begin your initial follow up and how long after your last follow up do you want to call and reach out again. 00:16:44 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know. So let's say it takes us. Let's say they send me a case. And then let's say it takes, you know, four days to see the patient days, two days to send the notes, that's seven days. So I would say, guaranteed, if we say like 10 days, guaranteed I've seen their patient and sent them the notes. So they should have everything after 10 days. So you know, around the two week mark is when I could be like, hey, you sending me some if they haven't already? Like, hey, how did that go last week or a couple weeks ago? 00:17:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Can you send me a little bit? Yeah. So in HubSpot, can you make that a canned message? And could you make some versions of it? Like maybe chat to you, give me five versions of this same email, which it can do and will do. So it's not verbatim. And that way you can go with HubSpot and go follow up since last case one, follow up since last case two, and then kind of cycle through them. So they're not getting the same exact email over and over again. And you can semi automate it. 00:18:02 - Fujinaka, M.D. So like, okay, so on HubSpot or somehow I need to know if one of these people sent me a case. 00:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, there is a Gmail plugin called Yesware. I don't know if this will fit in and maybe this is, we need to go like with go high level or something. But Yesware can, Yesware is a whole suite that plugs into Gmail and you can, it has can messages and follow up sequences, it can also check and it's been years since I've used it. So I imagine it's a lot smarter now where I don't know how you could trigger that. Have you received a case yet? Maybe that just has to be manual and maybe you can have your manners or do that and you know that that be a simple thing so that there's actually be human eyes on it, being sure that it's happening, and then everything else be automated, which I do like making sure that there's some kind of human audit happening at some point evaluating the activity. 00:19:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. Yeah. Okay. HubSpot, yeah, I can invite my manager, Paul, and he can share the same contact with me. So one, one kind of just very basic workaround we could do is I could just have him watch if anything comes from these companies, these clients. Yep. then what we could do. 00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There could be an automation though. So if anything, let's say you have their Gmail account or any G or, I mean, email account. Yeah, I have all their email, right. So you can create even, even just Google has this ability, some sort of automation that says, if you get this email, then do this. So, like, Zapier, if this, then that, there are different automations that can trigger and say, okay, go update this database to say, and Zapier might be the better one to do, but if this, then that might also put it in HubSpot and update it with the last case received on this date. 00:20:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. So, I think before I do that, an automation, I'll just have my manager do it by hand since there's not that many. Yeah. And essentially, so we're going to need to add some sort of like a log. 00:20:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, I would ask chat to PT because there are a few different automations. I would tell it, the overall goal that you want in the most simplified form, right? Because we don't want a convoluted process, and we wanted to stay as simple as possible, and say, this is the existing system and things that happen. know, we do this, we receive this. This is how we need the data to be processed. This is where we're currently holding and managing our data within our existing system and tech stack. What would be the simplest way to integrate? What would be the simplest solution that we could integrate that would add this feature of being able to receive x, update y, append data. You can draw it in a spreadsheet like Zapier could do multiple. That would be several different zaps, right? But it'd be this step, this step, this step in one recipe, zap typing, or make dot com. But ask it of if this does not, zapier, make dot com or potentially any other solution that we haven't considered, which one would be able to complete all of these steps under one roof. And is known to be successful in these particular applications. Okay, and then when they tell you one and you pick one, give me the recipe. Chat TPT is like the Scottie Pippin of our business here. It's given all the assists. You're probably too young for that version of the bowls though. If you probably, I don't even know. I'm a basketball nerd. 00:22:32 - Fujinaka, M.D. I'm shot in for bowls. 00:22:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, I just can't even talk. Don't worry, don't mind me. Did you guys move? 00:22:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. 21st. That's what they're doing outside is they're putting everything into boxes, pre-boxing everything for the movers. 00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'll put that on my calendar. 00:22:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. Fuji is moving today. Oh, let's see if I can find mine. And 00:24:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't even need that one anymore. Can you charge me? You 00:25:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. All right, let's see what Google Chat GVT comes up with. Okay, so it says, I asked it for three different processes, one at least one using HubSpot that I get integrated into my current system. So, first one it says, create a HubSpot account, which I did import your entire Google Master Sheet into HubSpot within and use the custom fields. as the contacts. For each referral, log it as a deal or create a custom property in the contacts to record and track the date of referral. So I have to map the file I do. I have a little of a column called date of referral. So I'd have to just like tell HubSpot, this is the column that signifies I got a deal and they want to call it a deal. And then it says set up a workflow and HubSpot trigger. If a contact has not sent to referral for more than a specified number of weeks, ask HubSpot to automatically send a personalized email to that case manager to stay top of mind, reminding them about your services. Cold call logging. Use HubSpot's activity tracking feature to log cold calls. Create a custom field or tag contacts who are cold called. That's not very specific. Use a HubSpot workflow to track whether any of these referrals resulted in receiving a referral. furl or a deal, and then track results with a report. Upsells reporting allows you to generate reports showing the case managers and law firms that have referred the most cases, as well as how many referrals came after a cold call. All this data you have in your spreadsheet. Then they gave me a sample for using Zape here. So, this one is saying, again, you should use Zape here to integrate Google Sheets with a Gmail process. For instance, Zap number one, every time a new referral is logged into Google Sheet, set a follow-up date automatically, for instance, 30 days following. If no referral is logged from that particular case manager's email or law firm within three weeks, then the email will get sent. No, can you tell me what a zap is? Is that like just like I pay like 10 cents a zap? 00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is that what it is? Something like that. So let me go log in. 00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Every time it does something. 00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Welcome back to you. Oh, I am so blurry. You're blurry. Sorry. Okay. So I almost never use this, but I have clients that use it lot, but I do have. Oh, go away. What just happened? Which one am I sharing? I'm not sharing that. Okay. What did I do with this? Oh, okay. So. Let's see. Untitled zap. this is, this actually wasn't one that I'm using, but I wanted to see if I could do it. So from. on ads. So I would select the event and then I got a move zoom on my way so I can see these things. Trigger event would be new lead which you would get from Facebook ads that would tell you you have a new lead and oops I don't want to do all that. And then so you would like sign into Facebook create the account you would connect the ads right here right so this would integrate the two things together and then lead connector is go high level. Are you familiar with go high level or with high level? Okay so um Mark can tell you more I can tell you a ton about it but if you also wanted to talk to him about it because we you can create custom apps and it does a lot of follow-up sequences a lot of automations with texting but data logging and creating automation workflows and it's a kind of an If then, if this then that logic as well, like there's literally an app called if this then that I have TT Like Zapier and it's been around a very long time and matter of fact, just let me just give you a little Tech like lesson today so Zapier if this then that this is business automation and what I would ask you to do Although I I'm sure Zapier for the most part has more recipes and then there's also make calm which is less expensive than both of them but newer and Sometimes this has integrations that Zapier doesn't and Price for action Make calm is currently cheaper But if you want to go just down a little bit of a rabbit hole and understand some of the Automations that are available to you Combine with chat tbt if you just are like I wonder if I could do this, ask chat GPT and then ask it to tell you how you would do it with make, how you would do it if this is not, and how you would do it with Zapier to get like a master-class kind of version of using automations but super super fast. would be the fastest way to do it. So Zapier, and I have, so I have a make recipe that I used because I was playing with Etsy stores and so I want to teach people that aren't good at business in my family how to have business and Etsy is a little like it's not going to make the kind of money I make but it can help them replace their income. So they're called scenarios here and this one so if I create a product in the Etsy store, the Etsy store has an RSS feed and so any time I create a product or a money. team creates it. They create a product. It goes into the RSS feed here and so then this make is watching for it and it runs every 30 minutes and then it grabs some data from it and it parses it. I had to look up this code to figure out how to do this. I didn't know how to do this. And then when it parses it, it so parsing separating, right? It gets a specific kind of data and I told it what I did, what data I wanted to get. So I could grab it here. The data I wanted it to get was the title and then it would feed that title to the Etsy part, right? Oh, so listing ID ID, that's what it was. And so from the listing ID, then it would go and say, okay, with this listing ID, I also need the images. And then it would go to chat GBT and it would, this is the instruction I gave it. You're my social media expert. I need you to write a description for this, this and then it would route it to Instagram and Facebook and it would go make a post for me. And so I haven't done anything for a long time. But if I go to Instagram, say, I'm on the app, I'm on a custom gift. You've got to find it. Well, I am not searching to optimize for that, huh? So, oh, let's see. I'll do that. Pretty sure. Maybe not. I do want to show you. Let me see Facebook. See if I can find it. Nope. Oh, well. Anyway, I can show you later, but it actually it's worth the effort. Let me, I have it here on my phone. I'll just switch real quick so I can show you a nice custom guess where I don't. 00:35:14 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I wonder if, you know, all these involved kind of these if than that. I think what I'll do then before I like try to automate is, I'm going to actually try to do it manually and see if I could do the same thing over and over. And then if I can do just the same workflow over and over, then I can automate that. 00:35:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I think first I'll try to figure out how to do it by hand. 00:35:38 - Fujinaka, M.D. And then once I can get it by hand, then next week or something, I can, I can try to use one of these automations. 00:35:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, okay, here it is. So all of this was created with, and that has, was enough brain mamas of the world. I would never write this stuff, but chat GPT did, but it's still something. Anyway, but everything in. including the link and the image was done through automations. As soon as the product was created in the store. 00:36:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. Wow. 00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I didn't. So I also used to have a go to Pinterest and Pinterest got me tons of traffic, which was crazy. Like, I didn't know anything about it. So, um, let's see. think I did a version. I'll show you one more zap. Oh, I use zap four. Um, this. So I'm working on creating a Tina GPT, right? So what it does is it takes my transcripts. Um, and from all of my calls and then I go, I have to add a new step in here because I was having this manually done. But, but what it does is it dumps all of my transcripts into one single Google Doc. And then I have chat GPT go and remove every speaker accepts me. So it's only my. information. And then additionally, I haven't removed any conversation I have that's personal that isn't business related, which I did test multiple times, but it's really good at that. I'd rather take out too much information than leave in personal stuff. But nobody has access to that GPT. The whole purpose of that GPT is for me to say, I remember I was talking about this one time, tell me what I said verbatim, or tell me how many times I've discussed this particular thing and what is the overall synapse, or write me a two paragraph blurb, right, about this particular thing I've talked about several times, it's really getting good. So anyway, but it just automatically pulls stuff from bathemin dumps it into a single dock, because when you do a custom GPT, you can only upload 10 documents to train it. So I didn't want to go have to combine, you know, hundreds of calls into it's already done automatically, it's been doing it since May. So that's the power of these automations and How much is it? How much is it? No, I knew you were going to ask me. have no idea. I just know that I don't see a bill that makes me freak out. 00:38:10 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I just pay it. Oh, is this a free plan? 00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Is it? 00:38:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't know. I'm left says free. 00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There you go. Yeah, two of 100 tasks. 00:38:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. you manage plan and see how much it is to upgrade? 00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, I can't even see that because it says edit. Change plan. Or upgrade plan. don't know. 00:38:33 - Fujinaka, M.D. So you get a hundred tasks a month. Zaps. Okay. then they want you to go up to. 750 tasks from one. Oh, yeah. Okay. So this is fine. 00:38:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Unlimited premium app. So that's all the different apps that you think you could possibly connect with also. 00:38:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. All right. So maybe what I okay. Maybe what I need to do then is I need to like just get. a system for like a process down, and then I can come back and be like, okay, let's use a period automate. 00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You might actually reverse engineer. I love reverse engineering. So you, it might actually help you come up with an idea when you go, okay, so what would you like to automate? And you can see the little AI thing here, right? Hi. 00:39:21 - Fujinaka, M.D. I have a list. I have, I have a Google sheet with a referral date, and I want an email reminder three weeks later or something. All right, that works too. Yeah, that's it, yeah. 00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see what it gives us for suggestion, because you are using Gmail, right? 00:40:16 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah. 00:40:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're using the magic of AI to create jobs up. 00:40:27 - Fujinaka, M.D. You know, actually, this reminds me that Esther and I had a talk because I was trying to, a couple of years ago, I was trying to do the same thing when I was visiting doctors to send to my physical clinic, and Esther was making the point that literally HubSpot and Salesforce, they were built to keep track of meetings like this. She's like, they literally recreated so that people doing sales could track their contact and tell you, like, when did you last contact, and when did you say to them, when did you email. so she's like you got it she was like get out of the mindset where one can do everything for you she's like you're at some point you're gonna have to use a CRM because that's the best thing for what you're doing yeah so there was an issue on our end okay so this literally sounds like one of those exact cases where we went over this like two three years ago with her and she's like you need to stop trying to make google sheets or everything like except that you're gonna have to use something else built on top of that so okay you guys are very smart and god gave her to you for a reason so you're proud to listen that's weird you're doing this i was like i was like man this sounds really familiar oh my god okay this is my experience i don't remember what it was but there was something i had been teaching my daughter since she could speak and she came home from it was kindergarten or or first grade i don't remember but i think it was kindergarten and she come home and she 00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He said, Mom, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she was blown away by this thing. And it had been something that I had been telling her forever. And I was like, I'm invisible. 00:42:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. I don't think it. 00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And that just happened on repeat with my kids constantly. OK, so let's see. We might need to simplify this. You were doing simple. I always like to test. I have a hair stuck on my face somewhere. Anyway, I always like to test the logic and what things are able to do. OK, let's see. When Google Sheet is updated, append new data. No, because when we receive an email, like that's how we want to do it. Oh, is that how you get your cases is email? Yeah, we see update Google Doc and HubSpot. If that doesn't work, then we'll just go ahead and try to click on, um, oh, uh, Z or what do you call it? 00:43:26 - Fujinaka, M.D. Um, Oh, here it is. So the first thing I asked is that if I import Google sheet, what will happen? it's like, well, you can import your sheet and then you can make contacts, non repeated contacts out of every, you know, email address and case manager found on it. However, HubSpot will not continuously sync. They said that that process needs to be used through Zapier or you. 00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so you would start by just go ahead and import in your spreadsheet. You could do that now where we're looking. Well, I'll look this up if you wanted to. I mean, this is a good use of time updating your system. Because that was something, as soon as you showed me your Google stuff, was like, we're going to have to get you, yes. OK, step one, new inbound email by Zapier, upload document, Google Docs, create updated, contact HubSpot. We're going to change this Google Google Sheet. Yes. OK. Oh, that was my bad, right there. Sheet. I'll take Google Sheet. Do we need the Google Sheet updated? 00:44:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. Or just? Yes. So I'm using Chat TPT, but they're saying that in Zapier, I need to choose a trigger which is 00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) they recommend is new spreadsheet row or that's because you did it wrong updated spreadsheet row updated spreadsheet row is possible but that's not really so this is why I say reverse engineer because the end goal is how you when you do it that's that's the easiest way to simplify it so the bottom line is you need a central location to track all of your attorneys and to have all the information that you need about it and the purpose about a spreadsheet would be to do some data and reporting where we can track how many cases we received but you probably could do that in HubSpot or also Zapier which is like a maybe I count if from Zapier like how many emails how many referrals did we get that you tracked in HubSpot you know that kind of thing so let's take that that kind of data calculations out of the picture for a minute and really what we want to know is what is the simplest system because the simpler it is, the less likely there is for error, and the more likely that if there's an error, one, we can track it, two, can fix it. Okay, so we want that as simple as possible, and that's why. So what we really want is a place that we house all of our attorneys that could be referring to us, and we want to know when the last time they sent us a referral is, and if it falls outside of this particular scope since the last one, we want to send them a follow-up message. So this recipe would be really, we don't even need the Google sheet at this point, really what you want is a zap that goes from email to HubSpot, that's it. And then potentially from HubSpot to Gmail, if you're going to send the email from your Gmail and not from HubSpot. 00:47:03 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I mean, I almost think like one little, one second between that would be also just, I want to contact, create a contact card for each case manager and tie, and tie that with if either the contact or the law firm has sent me a case in the last whatever, say one month or three weeks. So it's almost like what I want is I want the sheet. So when we put up, when we enter like a new row or we update a row, and we put in a, I have a column that says date referred. So if we see a date referred, that's the date, the law firm in with that attorney or case manager, if they haven't sent us a case before. 00:48:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, hold on a second. 00:48:29 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's where. 00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You 00:50:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. So I asked it pretty much the same way except only to create a contact. So they said that Zapier can check if a case manager's email already exists as a contact in HubSpot. If it already exists, it will add a note in that contacts contact card mentioned in the new referral date. 00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's see what this says. I don't want update my memory. Okay. Did it give you a recipe like this? Yup. 00:50:50 - Fujinaka, M.D. And then it says step by step. Use Google Sheets as the trigger, new, and select the trigger event. 00:50:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) didn't see what the trigger event was for yours. 00:51:00 - Fujinaka, M.D. be new content in that spot. 00:51:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I don't think either one of those right. Can we have the new trigger be an email in Gmail received? I guess maybe we have you could have two different recipes and it could jump against each other so that we're not duplicating things but because some of them will already exist in HubSpot but if a new one is there then it needs to be checking Gmail so really if we're going highest level it should be checking Gmail and but one of like I think that there would have to be a manual process of this is a referral and so like if it's a new existing one. Like like a sorting, that's all I managed to do is literally all day. Yeah. So like do you add a filter to it like you know the Gmail filters like added to a folder like how how do you mark it? Yeah, that's why we have Jamelius it's a whole marking system within on top of Gmail so my manager if it's a new referral says this is a new referral and he marks it as literally says new referral and then that goes to one of my two callers who are just calling people all day and then they call that person and try to get them a day how do you spell it g g melius how do you spell it g g e m e l i u s oh not do you work with i need sorry yes blah blah blah blah I meant to say does a peer work with g melius um Let's go check the Zapier real quick. I don't specifically work with Jim Elias. does or doesn't. 00:53:08 - Fujinaka, M.D. It said it didn't. 00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, okay. 00:53:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. Well, I don't know. Maybe it's better to have Zapier itself. 00:53:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, it seems like you're mentioning tool. Jim Elias needs share of a label. Send us a request to get it added to the app directory. Request to add. Okay. Okay. Anyway, and then let's see if make.com. Tools to see if it finds anything. But it's okay. So regardless if we don't take out the existing function, your person will still do what they do. So then the Zap would be. No, it doesn't have anything. The Zap would be once we, as soon as we mark something as new referral, then, okay, let's see. We currently use currently sort all new all incoming. And we'll continue to do this once the new referral comes in, it is marked as new referral. So, the Zap would need to start by watching what you can. 00:55:15 - Fujinaka, M.D. That's an interesting way I could do it, too, because yeah, so we we could, I could do it that way from Gmail as well. So I could do it either I pull the contact and the referral through an email, or I could pull the contact through the sheet. So yeah, that is another way we can do it. 00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So and what you could do is have it go straight from Gmail and also update the sheets and HubSpot. 00:55:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, there's So many likes, well. 00:56:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And you can just check this weekly, like, is it working? Did everything go, you know, and do an audit just since this would be a critical system? You know, you wanna make sure somebody's making sure it's working. 00:56:13 - Fujinaka, M.D. The tricky part of that is that the schedulers, I actually have one person that does this, is they take the email and put in the person's name, date of loss, law firm name, and they enter it into that spreadsheet by hand. So there's no eff ups. Like, it drives me bonkers when that sheet is messed up. So like, I probably wouldn't trust anything to pull data from an email. 00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, well, that makes sense to me. And I agree with not automating something so critical. You could have that automated, but have your person know, like, your job is to scrutinize and make sure that this is all correct. It should still save time. In the meantime, what you're doing is improving your knowledge awareness and use of automation without becoming dependent upon it. so when it evolves to the point where it's so good, you don't have to watch it, you'll know, and then you can take the next step. 00:57:17 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, I didn't even think about you could do it from Gmail. That's that's really interesting. I think I'll probably do the first one just from the spreadsheet, a new referral date triggers a zap to pull that to search that case manager's email in HubSpot, see if they have if there's an existing case manager contact by that name. Oh , you know, the other thing is, is that the people that the people that email me, the referrals, not the case manager, it's a case manager secretary, at these law firms, a case manager's directing traffic, and their secretary sends me a So I actually don't want to talk to the secretary, it's actually I want to to the case manager. So, would have to, I mean I guess some mistakes will happen, but essentially I need to, I need, and sometimes it's half and half who sends it to me. 00:58:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So there's a couple things that you can do. One thing is just have a person manually assign secretaries to case managers. So then you have logic, right? If it's from this person, it's again if this doesn't that right? If it comes from this person, this person, this person, it actually belongs to this case manager. Therefore respond to this case manager if we haven't received a case in 15 days, whatever. Oh, that's one reason. other one way. The other thing is similar would be like, could you create a higher article structure within HubSpot? 00:58:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. Because you can create. 00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh yeah. where there is you have an org chart basically for each company so if you know a secretary belongs to a case manager which belongs to a company put that in there and use that logic. It's basically the same thing only if there's way to do it. 00:59:19 - Fujinaka, M.D. It's called association so you can for instance add a secretary as an association to the higher level case manager as long as the case manager already as a contact card you can click associate the secretary with that case manager. 00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean at the end of the day there's going to be some things that are human touch and that's always a big thing to make sure because it serves an audit and so what you train your team is while you're going and making these adjustments you're looking with eagle eyes to make sure everything looks the way that it should while you're there if you notice anything odd report it. Or ask just ask me or ask Paul yeah yeah. Leadaway, have a conversation with somebody other than yourself to make sure that we're inspecting this. 01:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, and it is really, I'm not going to say it is, it's a little bit lazy, the data in MasterSheets is clean, but it's a little bit lazy, like that little step right there. I could make my team be like, who is the case manager and who is their secretary and put case manager and column one, secretary and column two, don't mess it up, you know. 01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, so 100% you should do that. And the other thing is, we're now prepping data for, if HubSpot probably is a sufficient CRM, but let's say you didn't want to go to high level or Salesforce or anything else, you now have attached data in recognizable format, so columns, right, or specific things that could then be migrated to another CRM because it's It's in a table format or could be exported as CSV or whatever, so that is really useful because if you ever get too scalable or for any reason you want to sell it, anything else like that, the integrity and how pristine your data is, how accurate. First of all, we already know how good that is for calculations and just deciding how to operate, but also moving, adjusting, potentially selling, transferring, whatever. All of this is really, really valuable. 01:01:31 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. 01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So you work on that, so your assignment for next week and the homework for next week is to have that process complete. There's no reason that I can think of unless you've got a really busy schedule. This shouldn't take you more than an hour or two. 01:01:49 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay. My homework then in summary, I'm going to create, I want to at least by next week have one auto automation that helps me. make contact, a contact card in my CRM for case managers that refer to me and track when they last referred. think that's as simple as I can state what I want that automation to be. 01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's create contact, yep, I want to add something to that I want you to today, give your assignment to your team to track whatever we know about secretaries and case managers and make those associations in the spreadsheet so that you have it for next week. So they get a whole week to work on it and you get it next week and we can deal with that. The other thing is, it's okay if this happens next and it's not due on Monday, but have chat give you a few variations of the follow-up sequence that you can use and implement. But I think, and I want you to measure this out for yourself in terms of the kind of pace and the progress and the growth that you want. Is that a sufficient amount of homework, because we do ask? 01:03:12 - Fujinaka, M.D. I want to do that, and then I want to keep, you know, pushing the referrals farther. So, regardless of how I do it, I still want to make another at least 10 call, remember we said hours, so two hours of calls, one hour, one day, one hour next, so I want to at least call the other phone for at least two more hours, trying to get new leads, and then I want to work on this automation as my other piece of homework to get the back end strong enough to support what I'm doing. 01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes. You also did still have some other things like contacts, it says CME, I'm not sure if that was right, or it's for CUMI, I don't know. 01:03:59 - Fujinaka, M.D. Yeah, so my first one guys. I was trying to find more business, yeah, someone told me no, but I have another like 10 to go, so we'll see. 01:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, um, and contact Renbaum Recooting. 01:04:11 - Fujinaka, M.D. That was it. He shot me down here. 01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I want to get that updated you part of your homework is reporting. 01:04:18 - Fujinaka, M.D. If you don't report, your homework is not complete. Okay. 01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 01:04:22 - Fujinaka, M.D. Okay, so respond to the homework email with an update to each one, our phone call or it's not complete. 01:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) right, that's that's good. So we've got the task. I will go ahead and email it to you for accountability and then, but read it today and make sure that it's accurate and that you agree to that, which creates that. That binding, but yeah, this is good. And it's still fun. 01:04:56 - Fujinaka, M.D. You're still liking it. Yeah, I mean, even just doing that. Puffs five and then putting it in with that manual GPT step. That was fun. 01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, and if you explore a little bit with Zapier and just what I think it'll get your brain percolating a little bit more on what's possible and then make sure you go back and tell Esther she was right. We'll do. All right, because you have a great day. Wait, okay, so next week when just. Oh, yeah, let's double check and make sure moving next week. And I did remove it. We moved you to Wednesday. Did we? Yeah, it's all the clock. 01:05:41 - Fujinaka, M.D. Did you accept it? Oh, yeah. Okay. 01:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, good luck next week and with all the moving and everything and with the babies. 01:05:53 - Fujinaka, M.D. I babysit for you if I could. 01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Thanks. Yeah. Bye. michaelfujinaka@gmail.comTina MarieFuji/Tina Coaching
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hey, hi, hi girl. What's going on? 00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Not talking about it. Let's think about work. Let's see. Trying to go get the notes from Babam and set it up so that you automatically get them. No, go away. Let's see. What's your joggy's name? 00:00:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Merlin. 00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I gotta remember that. I love that name so much. Do you remember when I was a kid? This was a navy blue phone and it was called Merlin and it was like they were Simon, you know, you pressed the button. 00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And Marlin was kind of like that, but I don't know I just love everything Celtic Merlin, you know, the whole things But he looks like a wizard because he's all black and white, you know, he's oh, just like it looks like a little wizard a Merlin There he is coming again Hey, there he is he is Hi Marlin Hey Marlin, that's a cute boy. I used to do a boy He's gonna sleep well tonight. 00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, the thing just I'm almost there Let's see, I'm just closing a bunch of Causing one step Project management methodology recap meeting includes including need to create agendas for the future Focus on securing a few high-level clients. Yeah, but what was the task? Action items review the camera Yeah, you suck at this. 00:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I suck at this? 00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, not you. Never say that. No, Father, I'm sorry. 00:02:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, well, I do suck at project management. Ironically, when I'm with the business office for engineering, it's helping for price of our house. is ironic. 00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You know what? 00:02:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) What is that? 00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) When you excel well enough in your own sphere, it compensates for not doing well in others. And that's why we don't have to be great at everything. Yeah, it didn't do a good job. And it didn't say what the agenda was. 00:02:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) just said that we needed to create an agenda. Oh, that's what I was like. 00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, yeah, that is not useful at all. Thank you for telling me that's an obvious, but I already knew. So, let me see how I got. Yeah, I. What I was thinking, so I was thinking about next steps, and I don't thank you for your uselessness by the time I will go open my own notes and do this. Let me get into the right. What'd you call it? And actually, I'm waiting to hear back for my client because I wanted to reschedule half an hour later, because I thought was not gonna want to go to school until lunch, but I think the massive mommy massages and a little ibuprofen and a home baked wiener wrap helped her be able to push through. 00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So what was I doing? 00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This is my brain. Yeah, I'm going to go back and forth between crying. And I'm so sad. I've lost 20 pounds since April, by the way. 00:03:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, because you're really in. 00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, that's why I tons of muscle on. I have done lots of healers. been hypoglycemic. had just taken. diabetes, I knew that this was going to be a battle, but yeah, so I'm upset, but I ordered a continuous glucose monitor and I fix it. But in the meantime, good, good. One more thing I have to think about constantly. Yeah, because it's not just like, Hey, it's high blood sugar. Hey, you could get neuropathy. Hey, I already have to use and I kind of need kidneys and I don't enjoy suffering and I already actually have chronic pain and suffer every single day. 00:04:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) like, I really don't want more of it. Hmm. Well, I know that my best friend, Derby kind of got diagnosed with that too. He's on the glucose monitor and it surprised me because he's like, yeah, he's not not that overweight at all. And but he's having success now. So anyways, I know you don't want to talk about it. But I'm just saying it seems to be prevalent. I'm on the verge. 00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like I'm on the you know the markers that say hey you're close to it so you got to watch what you do but that's where I was and in April I was like okay I've lost 20 pounds I expected the number go down it went up so but the good news is like I know what to do and I'm not doing all of it but that's the thing is that you have to be vigilant at all times you have to either decide like do I want to be super disciplined or do I want to allow the things to happen that will happen and it's a choice like I don't get to choose do I have diabetes and do I deal with it but so and with the propensity towards hypoglycemia I feel like crap if my sugar is low I feel like crap if it's high and going low so it doesn't even have to be low and I think a lot of people don't take that into account and understand that the impact on mood and productivity when your brain is your job as a mom, as a business, whatever, when mood has such a big impact on it, like they're like, we just eat better. Yeah, it's not at easy. 00:06:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's yeah. 00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I don't eat terrible. That's the thing. 00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I don't even even working out as well. So yeah, yeah. 00:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but it's just when my God has a plan for me, he needs me to know what I'm capable of. And he needs me to make decisions. And also the one thing I need to know for sure is he needs me to lead by example. And instead of telling people what they should do, I get to be a walking testimony of this is what happens when you do the hard things. So now it's hard to be in an example though. Okay, let me share my screen because that'll haunt me stay focused. Is that the right one? It's not the right one. This is the right one. Dan and my attorney client are just like blowing up email right now. Don't know how to, oh actually, want to, that would stop notifications. don't know how to put my iMac in advanced strum. If I put my phone in do not disturb, it should put my computer. Okay, how many, oh look at my conversion thing. So let's do Trello first of all. And just work on our board there and get that in my way. So I'm going to create a new board. Let's see how workspace settings board creates. And we will call this. So, Good to do. What's called a business launch and scale template board. Okay. this can be like the one board to rule them all sort of thing. And Do that and see what their templates are. I have a job board. I don't know what that is. Go to markets. You know what I don't want to start with the template. I will just create it. Whoa. Well, that's kind of cool. guess I can deal with that. Little dark. I'll deal with what it looks like later. So let's create a 30,000 foot view list and the card is map out master plan. So this is, what does the entire business look like when it's reached full maturation? Okay, I'll grown up. Yeah, that's part of my intake process. I've been using for a long time because sometimes the language, you know, people struggle. with it. So when it's, when it's become the fullest version of your vision, vision, what does it look like? Um, most people think in terms of revenue only making 20 a year, but we get there. Really need to back down. Do this template to be, of course, all of itself. Yeah, if we, if we do it right. So what are you selling? That's the offer stack. How. How. How. How. is it fulfilled, supported, so filled at map out the entire process and ideal stack, including vendors and suppliers and softwares. So if it's digital, right, where's it? Where's it housed? Where is it housed? Yeah. What is the customer experience during that process? Support in, who supports the products, services, and how many people. I'm sorry. does, employees, powers, works, ideal, wages, go level, what level of autonomy leadership they have. So again, we're talking about what is it look like when it's all grown up. Now this is way too much for most people, but this is, but if we're thinking about it in terms of reverse engineering, because even if they're not coming to the table telling you what their big dream and vision is, they have one. And we talk about a lot of times entering the conversation in people's heads. And the other thing is where frustration happens, where offense happens, where disappointment happens, is when expectations are Met and whether they communicated or not and even whether they are conscious of it or not The expectation is that whatever I'm doing right now is leading me to this actual drain and vision. I have in my head The burden then is to make that happen even if they haven't communicated it They're holding accountable whatever they're doing right now to this and most people they're not even conscious that they're doing it They don't know a lot of times people don't ask for help because they don't know how to ask for help They don't know what to ask for help with because they're going like yeah, but I need this I need this I need this Like I can't ask for all these things. can't afford all this help I don't even know how to get from here to there. So That is the thing that most people need is they don't know how to get from here to there. You could tell me any situation that you're trying to do. And I could probably figure out a practical plan to get you from here to there. We can vicariously guide them through getting from here to there by walking them through the mental process this. I almost guarantee you not nobody but most of the people have never gotten this specific in what their big vision is. And most of them even with the specific questions won't be able to tell you what that looks like. But if they can get a version, and this is what we'll say at the bottom if you if you can get a version how what now this doesn't mean that you're going to build what you plan out here. But if you can't even build a specific version in your mind of what you're going for you're having an Alice in Cheshire cat conversation. What path do I take? Where are you going? Don't know. Then the path doesn't matter. 00:15:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So we could throw in an image like that, too. Let's see if I get the image. So because we have limited time, this is, this helps kind of just give an example. Let me see if I can add an image or maybe I could just drag it in. Let me just complete that particular step in my head. It's not a desktop. There it is. All right. right. Yeah, so what I would like to do, however long it takes, is spend some time, a lot of it I can do myself, and then I could show you, and then on calls we can kind of work through it and go, I'll go like, well, here's what I've come up with. And then discuss it, and as we discussed it, I would imagine because this is what happens is I'll either get inspired to make modifications or you'll have some modifications that you'll suggest. But at the end of the conversation, however long that takes, we will have a template that a person can pick and choose and say, okay, I want this board I don't need this board. This is not applicable, right, but they'll have the master thing. So instead of going and adding boards, they can just remove, remove, remove, being able to visualize the whole thing can help. And so it in and of itself could be its own product and service. The other thing is, though, if we get a high level client, then we go through and say, okay, these are the boards that are applicable. now we just create. eight assignments, like, who's going to do this? When is this going to get done? Who's going to do this? When is it going to done? There will be dependencies that are built into the template. For example, if you're building a sales page, first of all, you have to have a domain. You have to have hosting. You have to have the, you have to have a merchant processing. You have to have, maybe you have to have a gateway if you have a merchant account, know, like all of these things. But then you have to have copy. You have to have images. The images need to be inspired by the copy. So the copy has to come first. So there's a dependency, right? The copywriter has to know what the name of the product is and has to have some information on them. So the copy is dependent upon market research and definition. So all of that stuff can be created in a, not necessarily linear, but somewhat chronological process and for people. I've never done this or never done it well. Most of the people that have done it did not do it well, did not do it quickly. It'll be the first time they've seen it mapped out like that. Even on a high level, because a lot of the high level, and I'm talking about seven and even eight bigger earners, I think it's very different once you get to nine and above. They didn't get there by not systematizing, optimizing, even if they're not good at higher somebody who is good at it. They understand the process because somebody else was helping them in doing it. They did it themselves. But seven and eight figure earners, a lot of the times just got there by grit, determination, charisma, that type of thing. Lots of times. It's not through good business structure, organization, and optimization. Anyway, I would like to do this. So what I was talking about is for us to create an agenda. And the agenda can be we progress on it even if we can't meet because stuff is going happen. Yeah, we can't meet but then we still know what we're working on. So to me and I'm going to go ahead and save this for now and pop over to this one, questions for next meeting, I'm going to say agenda, meeting agendas. I'm going add a card so big rocks call it big rocks so big rocks are not that open card. Really the big rocks so I'm kind of prioritizing them. So the big rock is one, two, four, five, on the through three not two three one two three anyway one three um high level df done for you um clients or done with you either i'll say df y slash the clients um that we work on together in either well in some marketing plus project management capacity in order to fund everything else and keep our saws so we'll put this here then the other thing would be so i see the next level down would be hybrid coaching group. Yeah, I'm not gonna call it group where we get to serve mid to get, I'll say mid level. Because this helps us ascend our audience. The higher level helps us refine our teaching serves as energy for us because we're in the community of people who are doing things and have experience, but don't need a ton for us. Yes, we end. they are doing things that we don't. have a high level of commitments to them. Also funds, whatever we are building. 00:22:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) To me, this gets the most time. 00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And this is the, remember I told you, there's 10% of people that will succeed no matter what you do, 10% that will fail no matter what you do, and there's 80% in the middle. To me, this is the 50 to 80% people. 50% people that are most are 90% actually, who's 60 to 90%. Most influenceable. Most kind of. Yeah, most influenceable. So, it gives us. this greater opportunity to impact the market on a larger scale, also should inspire content creation. So the high level of people in that top, they're in the top 10%. Their content, the only content they really need is going to be bite sized nuggets for the most part, something to inspire them because the rest of it is they're going to need a book, a masterclass or like a tactile thing that is too high level for most people, it needs to be really specific. 00:23:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah. 00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Whereas this group of people, they, there's a lot that they need to learn. So this is basically school, like they need to go to school every day, they need to learn the basics and the fundamentals. Um, maybe they have one fundamental mastered, but for the most part, they probably have zero fundamentals mastered and so they, they need the constant fountain, but they also need somebody that they can ask questions to from time to time. Um, but because of that, interacting with them should help us to know, hey, if we go go make a YouTube video on this or do a podcast on this or whatever create content around this, it should have a pretty large audience that can attract more people into this group and the goal would be to ascend, either continue to be there as a support, right, and we can ascend them maybe into a higher level group where there's even less, but they, um, members, but they get maybe a little bit more touch or maybe that it's box or access or whatever. I don't know. But anyway, that's where I'm thinking is that this, this takes up the most of our I'm in energy and I don't mean it in excess, I just mean that that's, that's the greatest need group. And then the other one would be do it yourself, coaching, they get software well, not software. They get courses, courses, emails, videos, curated content, but not Ascent, then higher level, low ticket, but low vibration also. That's, that's, that's, what it's going to be for the most part. There will be high vibration people in there that are going to move up. for the most part, we don't want to spend a lot of time and energy here. This is just we're offering it. It's a magnet to attract people. If you're looking for something and you can't afford more, this is here for you. But if you're the kind of person that is going to multiply what you have, that's when we want to work with you. But first, you have to prove it by consuming what we've given you and taking action on it. So this is our kind of, it's give back, it's taking advantage of giving use of our library, of wisdom, knowledge, products we've created. So they are just creating these are the big rocks. So, big rocks are everything that we do throughout the week. If it isn't serving a big rock, either we need to redefine our rocks or it shouldn't be getting done. Unless, you know, we're getting into, I'm acknowledging the fact that I'm just doing this because it's shiny and it's fun and I want to, but I'm not doing it at the detriment of these other things. So, one of the things we have to do is do we want to agree that these are the priorities of what we want to work on together. 00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think so. I have to think about this more to see if there's something to And writing it down helps us to do that. 00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) you can look at that. So then the next thing would be so in order to support the big rock. So the first big rock is this. And so, in order to do that, we need to create Trello board template. And we'll do this. Right out. Already. Slash pedigree. Post page. That's what I was looking for. Products. Already created. And define which ones need to be updated. Okay. All The sub task is create tasks and due dates, assignments, can we repurpose it, can somebody else do this, can we delegate it or not, for updating those products. And then, um, that creates a webinar or VSL or VSL or video, either way, however we do it, um, Our history, um, how we grow businesses and how. The power. of, you know, your marketing specifically, and my project management and ops is a powerhouse catalyst for sustainable growth. Something to that effect. So we've been talking about, that's what people need to see, right? They need to see who we are, what we do, how we can do it, we put it in some content where, because first we have to increase their level of awareness, just that we're even there. We need to have a application form, qualification form in order to talk to us, paid time that is given rebate, basically, on towards working with us. So to me, that's it for this big rock, because we have clients at some point, right? So potentially create maybe YouTube ads for getting eyeballs on this content, slash offer, whatever. I mean, but that's, it wants to this. But to me, that is the overarching kind of view of like, what we've discussed should happen. And that if we do this, and if we do these things well, it should attract the people that we're looking for. 00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) we don't. I agree. Yeah, yeah. it eliminates all the time on the sales calls, pre-selling, right? Because a lot of them are, you know, haven't been, yeah, exposed to our content, so you don't have to answer it one-on-one, you know? Yeah, I like that. 00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'll do this. Everything that we do for my level clients helps us here. That content can be repurposed to be to this offer. The solo board becomes, we template, we sell rather than use for that, right? So we're creating it, and we'll use it for our content. at high level, but for the hybrid and the low level people even, you get it, you manage it, you do it, but we created it. 00:33:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) If my power goes out, that's why I lost you. We just thunderstorms coming in. 00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, both the dog and cat's heads went up and look it around. It's funny, but not, you know. 00:33:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it right when you're not a huge city. these storms cause power. 00:33:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and we used to live out in the country where the power went out part of it, and it's only 15 minutes away from here, but the city grid and county grids are different and the upkeep on them and the quality of them. My girls are now because because we used to live out there and we'd have outages for like 12 hours. so we're like, I wish the power would just go out. only way it happens here is not usually from a storm unless we need a train call or if a car ran into a transformer. So that does happen, but because We are dead in the middle of the city and the impact is so huge they get the crews out immediately Okay But it also does never take down the cell towers, and I've got Wi-Fi like they'll service for days, so Okay, um anyway, so What I think that we could do and this is something like I could work on and then just go okay I finished it. Do you want to add anything to it? don't actually have to do this on the calls? I'll sometimes like and This is what I was talking about when you're like maybe it could be a support call Sometimes my brain is just like I can't draw the energy like I need the conversation Then just being here talking about it together my brain goes. Oh, yeah, let's see this this isn't this But I cannot get myself to sit down and even open this and look at it It feels Overwhelming and I feel sad and I feel impressed And it's just the way my brain works and it stresses me out and frustrates me, but if I talk to somebody about it And I'm like, Oh, I love this again. Let's do this. And it's a social thing. So, um, I don't. So, so to me, like, for, for here, through next week. And so you close the one client, right? have income coming for, yeah. to me, that's bought some time you've got enough. Yeah. So, so what I would love to do is just kind of set, first of all, the, so the first thing has to be, let's agree on what our rocks are. And, um, generally speaking, I'd like to set rocks for the quarter, but sometimes they'll extend past. Sometimes they don't take up the whole quarter. But to me, these things, building these out through the rest of the end of the year, like, if we go fast, amazing. But if we don't, and it takes us until like, you know, it would be really great if we have an offer ready. for the new year energy. Yes, people are setting goals and targets. I'm not a huge, like, I'm on a constant path of evolution. I don't need something to tell me I need to redefine myself and change myself. And but that's big energy for for a new year. People like have a sudden awareness of where they're at. 00:36:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Whereas I'm constantly taking stock of it. 00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I've never really been big into that. But the more that I realize like there really is a surge. And I do have seasonal energy shifts and awareness. So something happens. Like when everything gets cold and dies, like my perspective shifts when fall happens and the kids go back to school after I'm done just because in the summer, all I want to do is set up the sun. 00:36:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I don't really care about anything else at all. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I want to be in the water. I want to be outside. I just want to be cleaning and organizing, so I have natural seasons that are very different operationally and mentally, but I have noticed that there is generally this whole surge of people evaluating themselves and feeling a pressure and a depression and a sadness and an overwhelm during the holidays probably increased also by the fact that they might not have the family that they want to have. Christmas Day is the biggest day of suicide. At least in America, I don't know how it is worldwide, but given that Christianity isn't as prevalent throughout the whole world. But that's it. So anyway, if we could have working backwards, since you um, I don't know. So And next week I would love us to figure out some targets of what could we have and do we do we go do we target more the the high ticket and let the high ticket work trickle down and to feed this this lower level. I'd love to come up with names for each of these. And so it's like this one could be pocket COO, CMO, right? It would be great if we and this could be just what do we have it right now? Marketing Accelerator, I have a new school group. 00:38:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, this is yeah, perfect. 00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's perfect because that's my hair is driving me now. 00:38:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. 00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so if we could figure out what is marvellous. I'm like, oh, yeah, the purple. 00:39:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's see the purple. Oh, yeah. 00:39:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) that's pretty. 00:39:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) love it. Go ahead. Sorry. 00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, you've got the colorful picture behind you and then you've got the red shirt and the purple and I'm just like, it just goes. 00:39:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's awesome. I know. Well, the funniest thing is I did no videos today. So we're just wearing a t-shirt here and no makeup and hair was in like up and ahead, Ben. 00:39:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Look at you. 00:39:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at you. Yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, well, right now the business accelerator, honestly, is 99% the gears. So I don't think there's that many mid-level people in it. I don't think we should think about what's there. I think we should think about what we want to be there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we could, yeah, so it could become something else. mean, I'm a little bit of a fan right now, just someone I'm seeing and then how we could potentially attract a lot of good traffic from YouTube, especially when we start, you know, really, you know, everything else we got going on here with the pedigree and, and, and, hold it on the messaging. I think, yeah, to like a webinar VSL funnel to sell like a 197 or 297, I think could be the coolest thing as the middle one. 00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That hybrid coaching group, maybe and 197. 00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) My eyes just really well was opened when Cara showed me that productivity funnel that is charging $297 for course, make $100k a month. Like, wow, that's nice. 00:40:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think though, so here's the thing about pricing. When you can show a person the value and how they're 297 at the very least, they make it back. If not, they make more. So that requires is then to already be making money. We don't want to have people going broke in here. If you are not able to get your money back, if you're not making money and we can't help you get your money back, we don't want the energy of your stress and your overwhelm. Anyway, go to our go get our other stuff. 00:41:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, and that's sort of where I'm thinking a $197 to $97 is because the $5 of the free and then now I change the $5 a month school group, I don't think the energy's right in there. 00:41:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Like don't have a joy doing my Wednesday calls, but speaking of that, either fall in a minute, I got a call in a minute as well. 00:41:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. So actually right now it's just in three. Oh, you want to play your time? So but I like where this is going, um, marvelous. 00:41:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yes, marvelous. So we can keep working on this. We'll carry the conversation through officer. You go ahead. I feel like this was productive. 00:41:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I think you're amazing. I adore you. Thank you. 00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Cheers. Bye. Bye. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Hi! 00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I'm Jim Good. thought I'd take it from my phone in the other room as I'm putting a keypad on my back and then I'll go to my computer when we're ready. it was bad about two weeks ago but the lady who did the massage in my back yesterday said yeah I should continue heating it. Everyone's well so yeah. What did you do? I think was about two weeks ago. I just tweaked it. I just moved the wrong way. You know when your muscles are tight and it's ready to pull if you don't take care of it and so I just tweaked it and I think it's actually when I was getting into the shower because we have a bathtub shower and bathtub is pretty high because we got the bathroom renovated a year ago because we wanted a deeper tub but I guess I just tweaked it because the bathtub's higher and I was gonna get in and you know it is what happens. 00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I can do that just standing up. That's funny. He's a Dana Carvey skit and he talks about getting older and this was like almost 20 years ago. Oh yeah. And he was like going to answer the phone. He's like oh my elbow, my elbow, he's like he sprained his ankle, elbow just answering the phone. And I laughed until I did it. 00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And then I was like oh you actually did that. 00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Something like that. 00:01:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh my God. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) funny. It was, it was ridiculous. I don't remember. Oh, I woke up and it felt like I'd sprained my wrist just sleeping, but it was like that for two days. 00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh my God. I was like, how do you spray your wrist sleeping? 00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And my sister's like, it's because you sleep with T-rex arms because you're autistic and I'm like, it might be. 00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh my God. That's funny. 00:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, let me open the right tabs. Let's see. Tell me about your host monitor YouTube stuff, huh? 00:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, it's going really good So does it hurt? 00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh No, not at all the first couple days it really annoyed me because I'm very sensitive and I noticed everything and Yeah, but no, I don't feel it at all now and it updates every 15 minutes. 00:02:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's pretty awesome. Oh Oh, it's cool and my numbers have been great. 00:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) haven't gone above one thirty five But that doesn't mean it's because I'm not diabetic it means because I'm massively controlled in my diet and it's annoying But that's what it is. 00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So give me example when you said a hundred grams. I think a carbs a day net carbs net carbs So what's your what do we typically we got yesterday? 00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) did you eat all the ways protein first and then veggies? So that because I I read that it helps to keep your glucose from spiking 00:03:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) in the first place the order of how you eat things. Like boiled eggs or something in the morning or? 00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Boiled eggs, just regular eggs, steak. always have stuff prepped. 00:03:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I got to something like that or fish or whatever I had. I had steak yesterday for breakfast and lunch. 00:03:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's easy and also steak because it's loaded with B vitamins so it's good energy first thing in the morning. And then I have these there's a brand called Simple Mills and they make clean snacks and they have these it's made with almond flour and their chocolate chip bars but the neck carbs is like I don't know what it is it's not very high but it doesn't spike sugar especially if I have the protein first. So I've got good energy and it's easy because I don't spend lot of time cooking. 00:03:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I've got things I want to do. 00:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's a time that I used to cook a lot and now That's like, I've got so many things I want to accomplish on a lot, plus it also makes dishes and it takes even more time. 00:04:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. like, I'll make an instant pop full of stew and just tomato juice and steak and zucchini and black beans. 00:04:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. 00:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) but I've been figuring out diet and macros for my body for a long time already. So like, this wasn't new. I knew this was probably coming. Oh, my back just popped. So, you know, it's, and also I had gestational diabetes with each of my girls. 00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah. So you're saying right there. 00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I haven't had a soda and what year is it? Two years. 00:04:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Really? It's bubbly. know, the carbonation, like, it drops toxins in your fat cells. That's one thing. I was, I told him, 00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Father because one day I was drinking a coke and I was looking at the black sludge going into my body and going I would never have a soda ever again in my life if you wouldn't let me get diabetes and I have diabetes and I'm okay and me and that just reminded me I have to have a conversation with him yeah but anyway uh and Wednesdays I have uh missionary training and so usually it's done a few minutes before 11 but sometimes it goes right up to 11 so today it went right up there okay lores lores anyway so you want to talk about your youtube stuff yes 00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's do it. 00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, that's what you've been all about for like the last couple of weeks, so... 00:06:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) It's so insane, um, like, I'm just still shocked at the growth the channel's doing, and I'm just like, yeah, um, let's teach it. Hey, Merlin, okay, buddy, come on, come on, he's wondering if he's okay for him to come out. 00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's scared of flies. 00:06:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So cute. think he saw a fly. So he went downstairs and hid in the basement. It's okay, buddy. It's just scared again. Doodles. They're scared of everything. But anyway, um, the concept is, because you know I rock at low ticket funnels, that teaching people how to do YouTube is such a high, huge, total addressable market, right? And I really think it can be the vehicle to get to 50k months, 50% profit margin, just that alone with that digital offer. the first step is just like this masterclass I'm doing on social Saturday mainly just to kind of start getting some content out and everything. always like to be paid to create. So, you know, just get some sales at $97 and I purposely chose on 7 and I could have done 27, got more people in it, but I wanted to keep it a small cohort so that basically forces me because this is the type of way I work. it gives me that deadline. like, , I got to get this done now, you know, people pay me for it. It's not just, I'm going to do it. And then with their feedback, of course, I'm sure I'll get testimonials from them, then we'll use that for the sales page and their feedback and this could then become like $1,000 course or $2.47 course that sold as OTO1 upsell1 from a $7 ticket, you know, and that works really well, like I know some people running funnels like that that are doing really well, or just sell it from YouTube to sign up to the on-demand Evergreen, you know, VSL webinar, you know, enter your email. And then the next page is a little blurb about the YouTube course, then you sell it for $197 or And that as well is super scalable, right? and you know, I don't know if there's a high ticket into that after, because I'm not crazy about a high ticket, even though everyone says sell five 10k high tickets. So I like our idea, just having like a few clients that are paying like 5,000 a month or something, and then try to get everything almost passive. And that was motivated by it, to be honest, when my friend Cara showed me that productivity products, where they're making $100,000 a month from their 247 core. So I think they have two options, 247 or 397 or something. she said, man, just an on-demand webinar, you know? didn't ask her what their ad spend is. So I'll ask Cara the next time, because she's good friends with them, but she said they just dialed in that particular webinar training, similar to how publishing.com. I'm probably giving you over context, over information, but She said similar to, you know, the guys at publishing.com, they're making tons of money conversions on their webinar, on demand webinar, they have their webinar really dialed in. So Carol said they just, they sort of just modeled off of the format and training how publishing.com is webinar kind of flows and to their then offer, you know, totally different offer, but just kind of modeled off of that. And yeah, optimize it, tweaked it. 00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, Do you have a name for it? 00:09:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Well, I was calling it YouTube Fast Track System, but I just want to call it YouTube Launchpad. Something like that, you know, I'm open to other names, but it could be the successful, like. 00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, to me, the name should be really as clear as it can be about what the result is. And so, we have to go broad to go narrow first, but you're using it, first of all, strategically in your content creation to get targeted low-cost leads, free leads, targeted leads, and sales. I would like to see the name have something related to sales related to the strategy. Even though it may be longer, you've been around long enough to know about low-hanging food and SEO if you really want to. And I would imagine you're using this strategy with YouTube is that you're probably using low-hanging fruit. He works a little bit plus the algorithm because it can watch the video and see how good your content is, so that's a little bit different. But for people's brains, if they're choosing what videos to look at when they're looking up how to make money from YouTube, you don't want people that want to create a channel for monetization. specifically because that content might be different, maybe you do, but I would think that you want to attract the people who want to use it to get traffic to a sales offer. 00:11:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, mostly for coaches, digital, course creators, and even high ticket people, or even agencies that need to book calls. But yeah, I think the low hanging fruit could be just like, it's for people who are pissed off at Facebook ads, like that's kind of why I went to YouTube, right? I got pissed off at Facebook ads because of the election right now. Facebook ads are more expensive. You cannot have a low ticket funnel that's going to be profitable. You have to have a back-end system to make it profitable, which is still good. Don't get me wrong. But you can self-liquidate your ads, but I was used to actually making more money than your ads on your low ticket funnels. But with the election right now. yeah, my community and school, people are buying into it. Like I'm getting two average two sales a day, joining my community, is five bucks a month or 25 bucks for the year. have some digital products that are coming in. So yeah, I think the low hanging fruit is the combination YouTube and digital offers. And maybe you get the coaches in the high ticket thing. yeah, and I agree with you. I know one of my friends, he had something called the consulting marketing toolkit and it's like, no, it should be the highly paid consulting, mulch marketing toolkit, because it adds something to it. 00:12:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm like, how do you add this to it? What if it's like YouTube, YouTube profits for offer owners? That's really specific. And it's really only technical word is the filler word of four. Yeah. YouTube profits for offer owners. 00:12:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So offer owner is a very specific thing. Yeah, I love that, actually. And it brings into my communities of being announced tennis group because his main thing is teaching people. It would have their own offer, right? 00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it brings in my micro for magic. Well, and it is, so coaches and consultants, I can't go into Facebook without getting a firm request for somebody who's like, coaches and consultants, get new leads, sales, blah, blah, blah, So like everybody's targeting a diet, but our owners, you know something about marketing when you see that phrase and it means something to you. 00:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I love it. I think that makes so much sense because the other thing, angle I was going like on the sales page. What you mind? 00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm really dizzy watching you. 00:13:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. I will go to my laptop any minute now. Sorry, I Yeah, cause I was thinking also like, you know, you could pass track to your first thousand dollars online, but I like. 00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's a big U.S. because it could be. 00:13:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I like YouTube profits for offer owners and I'm going to. it up and go to my desktop. So you don't get dizzy. I'm going to put my video off and I'm going to walk and mosey on over to my laptop. Hey, I might even know where I got my massage, the lady changed offices, buildings, and they have like little cute little offices for rent for 400 bucks a month. I might. Yeah, I might get one, at least one. Because what I think is cool about that is focus time. It's like I can drop Merlin off a doggy daycare, then I go, okay, I'm going to get like four hours consistent time. My mornings are the best, right? So I'm going to get four hours because it's been done. Then when I come home, whatever I want to work from home, I have more, you know, flexible schedule. But anyways, I'm just a total side note while I was going home. I'm going to invite you to this board, going to make a board just for YouTube profits for our owners and I'm going to be showing up on the other one maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
