00:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was a long five minutes.
00:00:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I was like, I need to make coffee.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're spilling it, huh?
00:00:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Step over this sleeping puppy.
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, does she have a name yet?
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Lula Bell?
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, you told me that Lula Bell. Yeah.
00:00:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've been quickly truncated to Bell and Bella. There you go.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like it.
00:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She is feisty.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a bell. It is a bell. Oh, man. She goes by Bell. Let me see. Go in here. I was so worried that Mark would just start going to his phone in the morning. But I was really impressed that he started doing some meditation.
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you probably needs it. I should send him. I've fallen off. I started doing that. Wow. The peak flow breathing training thing that my buddies and his girlfriend over there in Thailand did like that. And I remember doing it when I did it originally. I remember around like week three, I was like, holy . Like I am dialed right now. was like working in the middle of the workout. I was like, man, I'm firing an all cylinders. I just had this realization. So I started doing it five weeks ago. And I did it for three weeks. And then I fell off a week for week five. So I'm like, I gotta, or this is fine. This is week. No, this is going to be week six. So I got to jump back in it. But I'm telling you right now from the first day, first day with it between the first day and the next week, I was like, I I felt a total difference. I was like, I don't understand this , it's so crazy. So I was going to hit him up today and be like, do I just keep doing these six over and over and over? Or is there like a maintenance one? What is the next step here? do you keep changing it? But the whole point of this training was to get you into a flow state. And I remember I definitely hit a flow state around week three or week four and I was approaching it this time and then I fell off because I was at work or something and then I was trying to do it every Wednesday and then I messed up so I'm going to be able to do it today.
00:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And it's so nuts that you're doing it for an hour. That's the craziest part. And then some of the sessions you get like transported, it's very weird.
00:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Now this is stuff you've...
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
been doing right? I only did it that six weeks. And then I did another one off one on one session with her that was crazy town. That was the one where like at the end, I was like bathed in white light and I was like, holy , what is going on?
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was a long time ago though.
00:03:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I decided a couple of weeks ago, I'm like, how can I get back into that? Just like, I was going to send Mark, I might send him this yoga knee drill one because it sounds like he's close to doing that. And that's pretty trippy.
00:03:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, uh, I would be amazed to see like what he said. So what you didn't hear was when he got on the line, I was like, how are you doing? He's like, I'm good. Like he sounded great. Like, yes. Okay. So then, um, he's, I'm like, Well, what happened? He's like, well, you know, that counselor that I was asking about is like, yeah, he's well, he fired Chona today. And I said, wait, what?
00:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wow.
00:04:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he said he can't help her.
00:04:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I that sounds right. So here comes the divorce. But now Mark can be like, it's not just me. Because my lady told him, you guys should get divorced. And that basically this guy's telling him, you guys should get divorced. Yeah, um, when he's on his wedding day, I'm sure people know. So I didn't know this. I don't remember telling him about. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you were you were talking about that. You talked to they met with her. They had one meeting and the one meeting, she said, you guys should get divorced. Which is, I was like, she said that. If she's, I know her and I'm like, if she said that with all her experience, she definitely picked up on something. Okay. then that's what the reason they hired this person is because Jonah wanted to pick them. And of course, what a surprise she picked the one that cost a hundred grand.
00:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. And he said, no, I can't help you.
00:05:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is talking. Which I guess, I guess there's some integrity there. That guy's like, yeah, no. Yeah. gonna work for you.
00:05:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild.
00:05:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or she's bad craving.
00:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, this is not worth it.
00:05:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's one of the other girls.
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're similar. That's so sad. But it was nice to hear him sound chipper like in a good mood. And it just kind of puts the whole your stuff into perspective for me. Like, I don't know, you know, how much of it was that, but it feels like he had to have come to a decision that he's on a track, because I did, I had to go through this in mind divorce. Like, I never should have been together, but he was pretty much scary, manipulative, psycho, and I wasn't mentally strong enough when I was, I met him at 21. But when I got to the point where like, for sure, this is not good for my girls because then there's religion, I've got children, all these things trying to make a decision, and are they better off with that or with no dad, because no dad is not a great situation either. And, but there was, there was this pivotal moment where I start going down the line of boxes I need to tell like, try counseling, try this, try that, try whatever, make sure I've done all the things. So I have zero regrets. And know that if anybody says, Hey, I quit, I didn't try hard enough, I didn't give enough chances, blah, blah, blah. I'd be like, look, I did all these things, you can't say that, like, I'm walking away with zero, any kind of pain, any kind of fear, any kind of whatever. And like, it's almost like he's mentally just going down that, that list himself of, you know, like, first of all, I know what it is, I'm done, I'm out, but I'm gonna technically go through this process and make sure, you know, nobody can say anything. I did all the things, I was a good, good spouse, did my part, gave them a chance. But that is very liberating mentally. When you know, that's where you're at with it. Like, when you stop giving that person power over you, and you stop feeling like you're going to let them like just keep destroying you. Like I feel like he had to have come to that conclusion because there was a shift and it was around the time when he was asking about whatever. I think he asked about finding that person after the fact that it was like there was a shift where he's just like I'm just gonna do my stuff.
00:08:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You what mean? Yeah and he's yep and then I mean he had her sign of prenup. I mean come on. I know it felt like but still it's like yeah there's a reason for that. There was a reason why you had a prenup sign and you know. So whatever it may guess and it might even wise now it turns out good move.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah yeah well anyway the whole meditation okay so if you send in the breathing...
00:08:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wonder if he stays with that I guess he probably will what the dude whatever the kids but maybe not because I think the guy worked with couples so maybe not yeah either way I mean I don't know something has changed and helped him so Salco also said he's making friends outside of work yeah I love that yeah I'm like you're kidding he's like no he's doing it and I think Salco sort of helped but it's like people with similar interests and like a similar yeah they're going to similar income bracket and the thing is like people love Mark yes they do right so he's not a bad dude no nothing I thought he was right I've never met him he was supposed to be there and then he didn't show up.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the guy, the doctor that he referred to me, you would love this guy is just great. Um, he, he, and he loves Mark, like, yeah, it was just a whole new level of insight, um, into the way that like he talks about Mark and everything, which it didn't surprise me. But I, I don't, I yeah.
00:10:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, and Sal goes to the one that told Mark to build the doctor network. He was like, this is what you need to do. This is, this is, you need to go belly to belly. And he did.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they're, which I need to have to mark about actually, but they're, they're doing some kind of business thing together that, um, I don't know how it works out. So I have, I have questions to ask, but yeah, I mean,
00:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not the scrubs thing.
00:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's it. I don't know.
00:11:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think that was, I think that was for China.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
July medical, I think. But anyway, yeah.
00:11:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what are you helping the doctor with?
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark was, Mark calls me a business coach and he just, that's it. He's just like everything. So we're talking about like his slate. We'll talk about his business just, you know, CEO health and wellness. Make sure that he's top of his line and then that he's taking care of his business well. But in order to take care of his business well, he's got to take care of himself well. So starting with the normal things like daily habits that, that make him, you know, be at his best so the business can be at its best.
00:11:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is he a good source of. retainers from Mark?
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:12:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually, let's go look and live away on the chance. Because it would be like, it could probably, I mean, this is what I would want to know. From both sides, from the mark side. Hey, is he a good source of leads from Mark or retainers from Mark relieves, I guess? And then from his side, our relationship is Mark, a good source of revenue for him, right? Because those lean oriented patients, right? You're that's like a guarantee pay, right? Now, sometimes they negotiate down based on how the case turns out. And that's baked in like they kind of know that's the thing. But it would be like, how many lawyers is he working with? And who's the best one? Is it Mark? Is Mark the only one? Stuff like that. And then if he is a good source from mark and like can we use this guy can we help this guy get mark more conversions right go go to the idea where. Where i was telling mark hand out more than a business card i mean i would the other thing what is the dude my understanding is that that guy just says oh you should call these lawyers if they're doing more than one lawyer they hand out like. I would say a stack but it's already not a stack but whatever and with mark i was like no dude you should be handing them something more substantial. Right something that's like that that just that dispels the myths around you know finally a lawsuit got together.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just looked in love by under his name and I only see 20 files related, but they are from March of 2021 so. No, and I don't, it would be interesting actually to see Dr. by doctors and let it by too, next as a kind of another thing to ask.
00:14:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, that did it in there, yeah.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but, um, they're a source, are they considered a source I don't even know. Yeah. Referrals.
00:14:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. But do they show up or they just show up as doctors, not doctors, so. Right.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just doctor. Not. But, but what we America was most of the tracking it based off of what doctors. Yeah, they are tracking doctor referrals by doctor now. They weren't.
00:14:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They weren't.
00:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Probably have at least a year's worth of data if not. closer to two. So that would be interesting. So you think that there's a play basically of giving doctors a particular speech strategy, handout, like what are you trying to do?
00:15:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Just like sort of like with the whole ad survey thing, like, can you take a doctor, preferably the best one or a larger volume one and make, I guess you need to understand like, what is the level of competition that's going on in that office, right? Am I competing with other firms? Like, so if we were to look at like the doctor in Arizona that I think sends it the most, it's like, is that because I'm the only game in town? Like Mark is the only game in town? Okay. so that don't use him. So it's like, find someone that you where you know there's competition and and go, okay, I assume the other firms are maybe getting some of those. And then you'd alter the offer, basically, right? These are these are offers being made in the office. You split test the offer.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't, like, I think we've had this conversation with Mark and that there is ethics involved.
00:16:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, he said he could do it. We just haven't. Yeah, we just haven't. And I think he said at one point, he said, I think he said they did, they tried a brochure, but they didn't track it. And I was like, well, then you didn't really try it. Right. don't really, it might have worked. And we know one makes a difference. Two makes a bigger difference. But if you get one and then you can roll that out to 20 offices, are you going get 20? Mm hmm. That kind of thing.
00:16:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like it. I like it.
00:17:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, my thing, and I said, know, you number these things so that if you could know that it was, this is, they handed out a hundred and we got five. So like, or, you know, once a hundred are handed out, something like that, right? You have to figure out a way to sort of track it. So, you know, hey, Dr. Tina has got a hundred handouts and when the handouts are done, they'll let us know and then we can do it because they'll be like, hey, we're almost down or we're out or whatever.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Two inches. Okay. I like that. Okay. So remember how many you get to each doctor's office and aren't just, okay, got it. I like that. How were your explorations into GA for this week?
00:17:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am almost ready. through should be done today, the initial what is he calls it his framework, right? Hey, this is how it all works. Yeah, he's got a he's done a good job of like raking it up, right? So there's like three stages, but then within the stages, there's like three levels. So he's like, Hey, you need to go through all three stages, but you're like in the cave, you're like, you're using stone tools, like we got, we got to get you using the stone tools. You have to do these basic things, get all this stuff in place, and you're in, you're ready to leave the cave. when you leave the cave, you're in the valley, and then you go back and revisit that stuff and you start adding to it and enhancing it. So in the cave, as an example, no GTM, get the on your site, start tracking the stuff that's built in, blah, blah, blah, blah. Then when you go to the Valley, it's like, okay, now you're going to start tracking this stuff, but if you want to track some of this other stuff like enhanced e-commerce, well, you think you've got to implement GTM at that point. So he shows you the framework, like you're going to do your cave build, then you're going to do your valley build, then you're going to do what he calls the summit build. And he's like, you're always going back and forth between the valley and the summit forever. Right, there is, except you're maybe you're going to different summits, you go back that you go back down the mountain and then you climb the next summit, you go back down the mountain, you climb the next summit. So I'm almost done with that, which totally makes sense. It's very, very logical, like this is really, really well done. And so then you go from there into like, okay, so now you're going to go set up your GA4. And then, so he, there's a lot of courses, but it's like, go Go through your framework, learn the whole, learn what you're going to do, and then go then step one is go build, do your cave build, which I think is just the GA for basics course. I'll go through that, although I have all that I'm pretty much probably I'll have all that set up, although I do think you did say a couple of things, I'm not sure I am actually doing that, like I'm not sure cross domain tracking is set up. I think it is. So I think what will happen is you go to GA for, then you go to GTM, and then you whatever, and then he also, at the summit level, you're using Looker Studio, Google Data Studio or whatever. I don't know why they changed the name of that, but he talked about some stuff you can do with that, and we have Melissa for that. But stuff that I was like, oh yeah, we should do that, like he thumbs up, thumbs down on Twitter. Track off track stuff sort of like what we do in our Monday meeting where we say hey new customers on track off track Well, we I don't think we can get new customers did well Actually, I do because he was saying it like at the stop summit level like when you're really going ham You're sending all kinds of custom events to GA for that. They don't know what it is You know what it is But they don't he's like that's where the real power is where you start doing these business model metrics and events really not metrics events You're doing business model events that mean something to you Custom that you're sending in so I could send in I'm sure as I'm sitting here looking at the ceiling That there's a way I could send in new customer because I know when they're new I just need a signal And then I'd convert that to a customer event So then Bobby wouldn't even have to do that report anymore, and that would God that would save him time And then you probably present it in Looker Studio, but you're saying in Looker Studio, you start to create these thumbs up, thumbs down things, right? like the whole entree, you know, beyond track and in the, in the rocks scenario over the US.
00:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:22:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So more courses. But it's the course you got to take because it's the course going into it. It's, I'm super into it and it's like, now I just wonder, and like how much more I can do than other people because everything he's presenting, like I've been watching his stuff and then I consumed a bunch of podcasts about some Google ads stuff and some other stuff. And everybody, which makes sense, but everyone is talking from this. agency perspective and that is a huge limitation. I don't have that limitation, right? I can custom code whatever the hell I want. I drop a first-party cookie and you guys are doing that and you're never going to be able to do it, right? So I'm like, there's things available to me that aren't available to other people but then of course this all just goes right into basis. So it's like once I do it, it's then available to other people where I can make it available to them. So I'm going to go through all this stuff, get all my stuffs in a row and then you have direct access to all the instructors over there including Mercer, right? I know Mercer's. I'll be like, hey man, now what can I do? Because I also can do this, this, this, this. And he'll prime nerd out on that. Okay, What happened? I don't know if you're muted, but you might be.
