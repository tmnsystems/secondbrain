Hi, Lauren.
00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
How are you?
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My daughter started seminary and it starts at 6 a.m. and I get up at 5.30 a.m. am not adjusted and I'm tired.
00:00:25 - Lorenz Schuerch
Are you LDS?
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am.
00:00:28 - Lorenz Schuerch
Oh, so am I.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you really? Yeah. I did not know that. That does not surprise me though.
00:00:37 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sun's starting seminary next year.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm so tired. But it's awful. She comes back and she's so happy and I really think that that extra fortification. I'm a convert and so I didn't have any that I didn't do any church until I was 19 and none of my other girls finish at one. Two of them dabbled and then just dropped out very quickly, but I think this one is going to stick it out. So yeah, I'm hoping Maybe hopefully I'm the only member in my family besides my girls Yeah, I did well. I did early early morning seminary and I dropped off for a few years and I came back so yeah Yeah, I gotta take that journey, but I don't I don't know. Oh, that's my CPA. I need to turn that around I don't know. Yeah, I think I probably would have done it. I did jazz choir at seven So it would only have been an hour early and I always wanted to escape home. So I probably would have won it And I had stamina back then stamina. Oh man, I don't know. That is anymore Um, oh, I was opening litify refresh. I wonder patrick remembers You can chat and really quick Yeah, I'll just text them real quick Yeah, do I have it? Is that your number? Hold on. I thought I saved you guys when we sent exchanged numbers. But I don't, I didn't say it has full number apparently. Yes, would you please? I'm going to go find out the emails that email with your numbers.
00:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch
He's in the waiting room apparently.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't tell me. It doesn't show him. He is probably in the wrong one, the old meeting.
00:02:59 - Lorenz Schuerch
Hold him. I just told him to click on the link on the new, and on the new way back, seems.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There we go, okay, so let's see that as the lens. No, Patrick, you're 385, right? Okay. Add to context. Pretty new. Okay. I was sure Patrick replied. Just search for him only. I am sorry. There he is. Add to context. context. Okay, nothing's wrong. Yep. Are we there? Hi, Patrick.
00:04:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, Tina.
00:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good.
00:04:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you doing? Good.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you say your last name? Okay. Okay. I didn't, I wasn't paying attention to way the highest. Well, then I'm making sure I have you both in my phone in case we have any other issues in your calendar invitation. Do you have the right link? Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to make sure because when I updated it for Mark, I. Thought I updated the link and then I did not put the right one in there. So I didn't save it. I did actually do it. I just forgot. completed properly. All right, how are my guys doing today?
00:05:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good finally got a settlement after six days.
00:05:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
That's nerve wracking, huh?
00:05:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I was like, dude, what the is going on?
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we did an F bomb, but I am said. We'll let it slide this time. Let's let this on.
00:05:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Let me go get these numbers equals last quarter.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want where we at right now. We're still beginning of September. Just kind of see how everybody's doing. So tell me about the holy heck. I just looked at the video seconds. just think it's big. What am I? looking at.
00:05:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's what people can.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was funny. I'm usually looking at my screen and not video, so that's Oh, this is funny. Okay, so I'm in Lettify looking at September. Mark, you know what? have a meeting with him next week. I'll yell at him about stats for you guys. see, he always tells me I'm doing something busy. Got this going on that comic, but I got a job to do. He's a boss or something. It's rude. I am the Portuguese woman. am the boss. You see? Oh, okay. I'm paying attention. I am. I'm just like all over the board. You didn't hear about my daughter is going to seminary before school and it starts at six o'clock in the morning, which means I have to get up at five thirty in the morning. That is my best sleep time. I've had two naps every day and it is not enough. It's from a little extra aggressive. I don't apologize.
00:07:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
what is seminary like church?
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so it's a program for my church that we have for the high schoolers and they go not every place has early morning but most of them I think have early morning and they go for an hour and they follow this it's kind of like Sunday school but it's specifically for the teenagers we have this program called come follow me and it's a program that goes through because I'm LDS so we have the Book of Mormon but we also go through the Bible and they study it for a year but there's a lot of kids and so they get I don't know there's this extra fortification of spirituality before going into the cesspool of high school and she comes out like feeling good enough lifted and with some of the filthy stuff that people have to do within school I'm really glad because I did not have that I was the filthy stuff in school so I feel a little bit better for my kids.
00:08:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I gave in here drop of the F-flops.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, people, when I was like in six or seven grade, people would be like, your dad or cast is like a sailor. I'm like, no, I make them less. yes, we're a little bit different. I've been on a path. Let me tell you. Okay. I hate looking at numbers when I'm tired. My brain looks at it and glazes over. Um, so we're only into September. Let me just kind of. So I'm looking at cases closed resolutions. I'm sharing screens because Mark takes whatever and works his blood, giving me what I want. He doesn't like it. He can yell at me, but he's never done that. So we'll see. He should have, but he hasn't. Uh, this is just September. So obviously these little snapshots are almost nothing. I don't even think that it's probably wise to look at. it by a month. Can we do the last 60 days? Oh yeah, that's what, you know, not last 30, last 60. All right. I heard you got a bunch of cases shifted over to Yuri, Patrick. Was it to Hank?
00:09:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I thought it was Oh, well, but that's why though, because of Yuri, because of the new law clerk.
00:09:48 - Lorenz Schuerch
So is Hank, is he getting a full caseload now?
00:09:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why don't think so? He's too new for that, I think. I think, I think, I need to ask Mark about what left-hand knows about the right hand in this company, because... Yeah, I think one of these days I need to get Mark on here with all of us, so I can do same page and be like, what's up? That would be helpful. Yeah, so just helping because Arizona volume is increasing. For September so far, Arizona is leading the pack in terms of volume, so that's a shift. It wasn't like that before, and... So that has to come into account, especially because not everybody can practice in Arizona. Let look at this close to 25 team, and that's probably an outlier case that's not bad, which you have to drill into and look at. Average days to close cases, that number is shrinking. That's good. And Patrick, you're still not really getting the, what I would call a normal load to really look at this. So I'm gonna stop sharing on that right now. What I would like to talk about if I can find the right tab is just some tasks. Okay, so we talked about Oh, hold on a second. I'm gonna go to all this plants and provide feedback and culture and based on it. So the problem with me, I know to me to write my own notes, but then I'm busy talking so it's really hard to get them good. Let's do this and start with this really because I meant to ask you this, but then I got distracted. What? Tell me what you've just been working on, what you've noticed. You're working on in terms of leadership and management over the last week.
00:12:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
Always go first.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I Patrick Gole this time. It's so short of you, Lauren. Well, you, Lauren.
00:13:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
We call that punting. Working on leadership.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Management, you know, just what are you doing to drive momentum and improvement?
00:13:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll see what's gone Thursday Friday. So, you know, Cynthia and I kind of just filled in her place picking calls and just kind of keeping everything going. Or as I probably could have just deferred and let Elsie pick up, you know, all the stuff where she got back, but, you know, it's not about just because she's the case manager. She's got to handle that stuff. It's kind of why I was trained the way I was then. You know, if she's not a year, I could still couldn't do all the tasks that Cynthia's supposed to do, that else he's supposed to do. and it's for the benefit of the team for me to keep the ball rolling. So, um, hopefully Cynthia saw that, you know, just because I'm the attorney doesn't mean, I mean, I could have just dumped calls on her. Um, but, you know, we both kind of filled in for, I'll see what she was gone. So. But she notices that the attorney is also willing to do the work that they're doing and nobody's, you know, just getting like their tasks laid on when they come back.
00:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:14:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And is she back?
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And did she notice?
00:14:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I haven't talked to her about it, but I'm sure I gave her like a list of things that, you know, the calls I made and, you know, when he's doing to be done, so.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When did she but she didn't say anything?
00:15:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so that's good as now. What the heck is going on with my stuff? OK. It's about like disappearing tabs and makes me mad. But I am tired, so probably everything makes me mad right now. Anyway. Tell about your prioritization throughout the week. Or do you feel like you did a good job at prioritizing throughout the week?
00:15:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This month, making sure that settle. are going to be coming in at the end of the month or mid-month, and the last week or last month was strictly money-in work, so prioritizing, making sure that records that need to be received are being worked on to come in, being proactive on calling insurance companies, not just waiting for the deadline to arrive. That's what happened to focus on this, mostly.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like that makes any difference?
00:16:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, 100%.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how can you observe that? How would you quantify that?
00:16:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, like sometimes I'll call insurance like two weeks before the deadline. that line and be like, hey, I've got chance to review. they're like, yeah, I'm actually finishing it up now. So who knows? Maybe they would have just sat on it and did that line and been like, hey, here's our offer. But if I can get that number two weeks early and negotiate it that week and get it done, then I just saved a week on that case. Because the insurance company isn't jumping up and down to send us anything. I noticed because it takes 30 days for them to send a response that didn't require 30 days. now I'm sure Lorenz knows, too, like when you want to grind on money in like the last week, things start to come in and you get it done. So it's one of those things where if you really put the effort into it, it does make a difference. It's just you kind of have to manage what when you're doing that. Like the end of the last month, I wouldn't be smart for me to do that because The goal is to get money in at that point.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're saying that there is a time when it's not smart to grant out those calls?
00:18:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like last month at the end of the month, the first settlement goes mad that the money in goes non-med. doesn't really make sense for me to dump all this time for settlements when winning money in for that month. So now that we achieved that, now I can go back to pushing for settlements. And then as the month goes on, you kind of balance what you need.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you considered splitting it up in the weeks rather than the months, for example? So we have talked about segmenting time for efficiency, for momentum, for flow, right? Because, there's every case is going to be in a different space and they all come in kind of steadily, right? So if let's say there's a couple like the first half of the week you're dealing with settlements, the second half you're dealing with money in and collecting or whatever the language would be or you know what going back and forth but I feel like if you're waiting if there's a two-week gap there's too much potential for cooling off for the cases that wherever they're sitting. let's say they're sitting with the client, let's say they're sitting with the doctor, let's say they're sitting with insurance, whatever. The longer they're there and you're not following up on it, the more their figurative or literal piles stack up on top of your stuff, you're not top of mind anymore. as if you're cycling through everything in a timely manner, then there's less cooling off period and potentially, now this is a theory, this is not 100%, this is how it's going to work and it can't be that because there's too many expectors going into it. But I think that that's probably too big of a gap to be focusing on one particular goal over the other, and we'd love to see what happens if you shift it to really kind of being mindful of both at all times, even if you do choose maybe it could be parts of a day, certain times throughout the week, but what could that look like? And Lorenz, I'm happy to hear any feedback from you about what you might be doing, but that since those are two major goals and within them they have different types of activities. What do you think could be an ideal that increases the frequency of really working each goal? Not necessarily grinding because to me that language is kind of like first of all it's it actually feels more reactive rather than proactive. We need to get here because we haven't got here yet. And yeah, well just the whole reactive versus proactive. So what do you think that we do to kind of improve that schedule?
00:21:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, you know, I understand where Patrick's coming from. That's that's like an issue that I think all of us have because, you know, we'll hit settlement goal. And you know, everyone, Mark and Mary and everyone wants to make sure we hit both goals. And so we're super we hyper focus on on the money in goal. And that that's an issue that, you know, I've always had. Because not just that you hear a sweep, all the prior law firms is just because it's just that nature of the beast, you settle a lot of cases at the beginning of the month. And then for whatever reason, you need to rush and get your money in before the end of the month. And so it's kind of put up into that way. I think I'm starting to find a group with my team where we're able to, instead of only doing money in, we can still focus on managing the cases. those regular meetings with my team, we review the cases and try to move them forward, regardless of what time of the month it is. And so that allows us to send to me biggest determinative factor for settlements is usually the more demands you have out, the more settlements. They're going to get it. And so I try to move those cases ready for demand as quickly as I can. And so thus, the regular reviews with the team are going to help me do that a lot quicker than if I were to just review them by myself and then wait for them to answer my questions. I'll review a case and then I'll ask Jessica, where are we at on the records for this? Mike, help me talk to client about doing injections, things like that and then I have to wait for their response. So if I'm reviewing the bases at night, I have to wait 12 hours until they respond. Whereas if we review together, then we have all those answers together. We're all on the same page at the same time and we can move those cases a lot quicker.
00:23:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that. What if you've looked at it more as a linear approach rather than two buckets, right? Settlement versus closed and... got the money in because really there is no case closing a money in until you've reached a settlement, right? So there is just a straight line trajectory for each case. And the real goal is complete the case with the maximum amount of money possible, having handled almost even like it's an obstacle course. Like, you've seen American Ninja Warrior. I'm a nerd, but also I'm like, want to be gladiator, that kind of girl. If I could program and be a gladiator, I'd be perfect. Okay. Anyway, so every obstacle is completely different, right? is a different skill set, different muscles. But you can't get to the end, you get to collect nothing, you don't get to ring the buzzer if everything in between isn't done really well. Everything has to be done really well. So what you want to do is make sure that you have a process for making sure that all of that is getting done on a cycle. And if a day isn't a good enough cycle, then maybe it's a day and a half, maybe it's a two day cycle, whatever, but you really want to be working everything top to bottom where it's at in a cycle. And the reason for the cycle is because task switching is not efficient. Let's say if you were just going to keep going, okay, well, where's this case and go down a case list, that doesn't make any sense because you're constantly task-wishing there. All those cases are in different statuses. Whereas if you're operating on a status basis, you're remaining in a particular mindset and a particular operational mode, right? So calling insurance companies. Anybody that's in a status of, I've got call insurance companies. Anybody that's in the status of, we need to get some files. And then, within that, you want to have that segmented on your team as much as possible. So, one person on the team that's doing certain types of calls that they're best at, types of procedures within the statuses, does that make sense? If you, let's just hypothetically do that. If you were going to take the team, no, actually let's do that. This, could you create an outline and a framework and probably not here on the call, but I would really actually love to see this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make an assignment for both of you and we'll compare notes later, don't do this together, don't talk about it at all. This is going to be really revealing in a good way. So, if you, You have any kind of trust in me at all. Trust me with this and also be patient with me because it's going to be tedious and you hate it, especially you Patrick, you're really going to hate it. I just know you were going to hate it. Don't hate me, just hate the activity. I really want you to write down all the types of things that has to happen in a case from the point that intake gives it to you until the time that you've gotten distributions and money is in. Okay? There can be major sections and then subtasks, but I really want a thorough outline of what the entire process is. Then what I want you to do, I'm going to go highlight this, then what I want you to do is write the name of whoever does any of those types of activities and who, so I'll know if you don't have that person. in there on your team. know that person never touches those things. So then what I'm going to have you do is tell me who does the most of them, who does it the best. And then after you guys have done that, we're going to come back and kind of look at the schedule and go, okay, could we try an experiment? We don't have to do this permanent. But try an experiment that we will come up with. We don't have it defined yet of working through that with kind of almost special teams, right? So people specializing in particular types of tasks and just working through those. Now obviously there's times when like somebody's out of the office and so somebody else is going to have to pitch in things like that. But and it may just cause a serious morale issue. It might just be really hated and we don't want to do that either. But here's If you guys want to do this job the best that you can, if you want to make the most amount of money that you can for the firm, but I'll end for yourself, if you want to have job security, and even if that means, let's say something happens, terrible sweet line it went under, which is not going to happen because they're too smart, but let's say it did, your skill set is going to be so solid that you'll be valued no matter where you go. What you won't get is somebody that's going to come in and support you and train you and give you all of these things that's just going to make you just so optimized. But if you want to do the best that you can, you're going to have to do something other than just show up and we work the case. What we can do, if you'll trust me, if you'll go through these processes, is find a way where everyone around you you is performing at their best and getting, hitting policy limits, getting the highest level and distribution that you can, all of those things are just going to be happening as a norm. We can't control, you know, the, like, hit it on the ball park, little cases, the million dollar cases, the death cases, things like that. We can't control how much that we get. What we can control is how quickly we get through things. We can influence policy limits. We can influence distributions. We can't control that, but we can definitely significantly influence it, right? And then we can also significantly influence, but not fully control, how long it takes to close a case. We know that because there's a significant disparity among the teams that is actually really starting to line up more. So all of those things being optimized the best. Bottom line keeps improving. I've been watching that for three and a half years so I can tell you, it makes a big difference. The other thing I can tell you is that these types of things make, so let's say somebody's got an illness and you can't work for a while. difficult happens at home or you lose a family member or a parent or something, Having systems like this means that when those hard times come, not if but when because they happen to every human being, something difficult happens that throws you out of your game and makes work difficult. It means that you've built up such a good system that you can do it even when you're struggling and still do pretty well and because you will have built up a solid team around you, those times will not be as difficult as well. So that's the benefit of figuring out how to optimize these things as much as possible. So that being said, Will you make that outline that I've requested of you for what needs to be done with the case, start the finish for the view?
00:32:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so in the next three months, I've got to do some shifting around because Vary has gone all month, this month for her surgery. And the next month, Jessica is taking two weeks off for her wedding. And the month after that, John is taking two weeks off for his, the birth of his son. And then that same month, Mike is taking a week off to go to a wedding.
00:32:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's actually perfect timing to do this type of exercise because you really need to take inventory of your team of the work who can do what and so that you have a game plan because within all of those planned absences are going to be unplanned absences as well. just happens. Yeah. So you want to be prepared for that as much as possible, have contingencies back up.
00:33:06 - Lorenz Schuerch
People take on extra work, they get sick more often than they get.
00:33:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we're going into winter. So it's just going to happen. So what happens though, the other thing I want you guys to, I know I've said it, but I really want you to kind of internalize this is when you look at things. Okay, so either of you guys like watch football, I don't know, played football. know you did, you swam, Swam and did. Huh?
00:33:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How much football?
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guys football. Well, so I mean, you guys have seen game plans, right?
00:33:54 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes, as a nose.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Kind of. I mean, I'm also like, basketball coach and soccer post.
00:34:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have a game plan so sports analogies will come up from time to time. I have a soccer guy so if you don't get too deep into football I can follow a bit.
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey well it's called football in England so I'm pretty much everywhere else but anyway so the thing is is that when you're trying to just get a concept and trying to figure out who's playing what and you're you're talking about it ambiguously or talking about it just verbally it's one kind of thing but when you can see it when you can see what the pieces are when you can visualize it when you can wrap your head around it then your concept is that much clearer and it can happen even with the day-to-day tasks like you might look at that and go holy crap that's a lot of things that we do and you might notice how easy it is for things to fall through the crop you might look at that and go you know what we don't have anybody that's really good at this particular thing or everybody's really good this particular thing or something. What happens with the visual exercise every single time is just a you know what I didn't think about this or you ask yourself a question that you've never asked yourself before or you show it to somebody on the team and I'm like actually it's always a revelatory experience every single time and just you guys know I have to talk everybody into it even if they pay me a lot of money to work with me they still are like I don't want to do it but when we do it nobody has regrets there is always a massive epiphany so this particular exercise probably is not a massive epiphany but there probably is going to be some revelation about what we can do a little bit better but it's the starting point so but what it does release you from doing because we talked about doing some time tracking and both of you are especially part of your blood now thank you Yes.
00:36:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
I did one day, but it took so much out of my day.
00:36:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I got petered out after one day. Yeah, you'll don't love that exercise, but this is kind of a work around. It still kind of helps us take socks. So what you're going to do is we're going to we're going to come up with this outline of the things that get done and then I want you to just kind of start noticing like how how is your current plan for it. We talked about this, Patrick. And to that point, that's when we discovered you've probably checked email, maybe little bit too frequently. How's that been going for you?
00:36:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's pretty good. Like the other day I was writing demands.
00:36:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't check it for like two hours. Yeah. how productive was that demand writing?
00:36:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It was good. got stuff done, didn't miss out on anything in the emails.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and have you got any responses to those?
00:37:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
demands? No, this was like the other day.
00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested to know if like the quality of the demands were any better.
00:37:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Probably not is probably goes by faster. Just I mean, they're kind of all the same at this point. Like, it's just a matter of getting all the records and stuff in there, but probably speed because what I would usually do is like get through part of it. Okay, let me check my email and then, you know, see something there and next thing, you know, you're on the phone and yeah.
00:37:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm very aware. That's why we have a conversation about checking emails so frequently. So, so you feel like it probably you probably got more done quicker because, okay, so that's the point now. And then what I was talking about is there's a compounding effect to that. So, if you see that day after day, week after week, month after month, guess what starts happening? You'll or cases get results quicker. It's cause and effect. If you're more fluid with your time, if you're not task switching as often, you'll get in the zone a little bit more often, you will complete tasks faster. Along with that, you probably will in complete tasks better. There's just something about the repetition, the fluidity and just the, you know, there's just a lot to be said for repetition and repetition without breaking things up like that. So that's awesome. I'm glad that you're doing that. And do you feel like your, we'll say like just energy and maybe mental clarity was less volatile throughout the day that way?
00:38:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I mean, especially on the demands, like I used to like right half of one and then go back to it and obviously you got to like get yourself back into that case, you know, yes, I just kind of get it done. Yeah, I like it for sure. I think quality and stuff would come out more on like phone calls, things like that, because the demands are kind of repetitive, but yeah, I would do it in more.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I'm really glad that you noticed that I want you to remind yourself of that, because it's very easy to slip into old habits, it can happen, especially, let's say we're having a rough day or having a hard time focusing, could be physical pain, emotional pain, exhaustion, all kinds of things, can get us off task. And you might be shocked, because I'm still shocked at how easily I can forget that I do a particular thing for a particular reason. And it's because it gets me really good results. And then something broke my pattern, and I didn't notice it. I went back to it like, oh yeah, I used to do it this way. And everything was just so much better. So notice that, first of all, not checking email frequently, but especially staying in a task until it's complete. And really noticing the fact that there is such a thing as this mental lag time, which you just described, which is, wait, where was I? And that happens. So in the vein of working cases, one thing that really helps is making really, really clear notes. So have you ever, and maybe you haven't, and maybe this doesn't happen with your team, but I used to work at a call center like 26 years ago. I'm only 26, you guys believe that, right? It's kidding. I'm 40 and I don't care. Anyway, old lady, I'm okay. You can probably be my son.
00:41:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
But you can't remember my baby brother, no not you, you can be a brother.
00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You do kind of remind me of my baby brother, but he's a little bit older now. Anyway, so we, we did tech support for Apple, did tech support for Intel. I was very nerdy. I learned how to build networks from the ground up in Unix and all kinds of different computer languages. So NASA called me for tech support, they're going to call me for tech support. I'm a nerd certifiable. Had to tell you that. Anyway, but we would get cases from other people. And so if they didn't take very good notes, I had to start all over, start from scratch. And if somebody, let's say I was the one taking notes and I needed them to go do a step and I wasn't allowed to stay on the phone with them. They had to go do the step and they had to call Bob. If I didn't have good notes, I wasn't sure where we're starting. even if it was just spending. a minute or two going through the troubleshooting steps, I know I have to go through logically. That was still time. And so the thing about the call centers is that the contractual, there are contractual metrics. have to be handled within a certain amount of time. If that exceed, if that time is exceeded, then they get penalized and the call center doesn't get paid as much. Up to sometimes actually losing money, which is really bad for business. And if they stay within it, then they get bonus money, especially if the calls are resolved within that time period and it's within, you know, call, two calls, whatever. Point is, is that really good notes create mental clarity very quickly. It's not just what's involved, it's how it's sometimes. Bullet pointing particular types of things or highlighting. or keeping them always in the same structure, like here's where the doctors notes are, here's where the pictures that we needed, here's any of this type of stuff, right, just everything being very clear, and complete, so that as the case moves between people or between stages, there's no, okay, what's happening here, because everything is done really clearly. Now, I have not been in your guys' business, I don't know what happens, I haven't seen the cases work through it, I see stuff in little by it, but not a whole lot of it, and I don't know how much of it stays in there or how much of it stays, know, how much of it is happening in Slack or email or physical papers or anything like that. Do you think of, can you think of, throughout your process, anywhere, there might be a place where, I um the notes that get left about the case could make a difference in how long it takes with the next person to do the next job. Does that make any sense?
00:44:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
It was a it was a problem initially with John. lot of people had issues uh taking cases from him because his his notes were basically all or nothing. You either had way too much and you'd you'd be scrolling for days on each job as they got the likes to talk a lot yeah okay or or you'd get nothing or everything wasn't the wrong spot and you had to do like you know summon your inner Colombo to Patrick doesn't even know who Colombo is do you? Probably not.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it different Columbus?
00:44:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
No no no no he doesn't know no way okay you're not missing it but anyway you had to be and so it for about a year there is pretty rough and we finally down to a point where everyone is on the same on the same page so that that helps a lot in the speeding up to yeah what you were saying like the efficiency at which a case is moved through the pipeline so do you think that is there any room for improvement in in notes on your team at all but we're kind of at a point where everyone understands each other I don't want to mess with it too much you didn't ask my question so if the if you think everything is going really well and cannot be improved then that's the answer if you think it can be and you're scared to do the improvement we have a whole another conversation to add Lorenz want to say that it's perfect.
00:46:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's no such thing. That's not what I'm not smart enough, like right now, I'm not smart enough to know where where it can be improved. Okay, so let me let me come on a different angle. Do you feel like you ever look at anything and go? You just really have to take a little while to figure out what's happening in the case.
00:46:22 - Lorenz Schuerch
There's a couple of things. Yeah, there's a couple of things that I think about it that I wish were a little bit clearer right as I put the case in front of me.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So does everybody on the team care about the quality of the work they do? Does everybody on the team want to get the best results out of the time that they work?
00:46:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Does everybody want to make as much money as they can?
00:47:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can without having to work over time or extra hours.
00:47:06 - Lorenz Schuerch
I assume so, yeah.
00:47:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not everybody's motivated that way, and we don't want to make those assumptions because we need to know what their motivators are.
00:47:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think right now, yes.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So to your hesitation of not wanting to mess things up or whatever. We don't want to try to attack anything and we don't want to go after and fix all things all at once. There's nothing perfection is unattainable. Progress and constant progress should be the goal. Constant progress is not more difficult than maintenance because maintenance is not real. You're either improving or you're regressing. So, you want to be actively improving, otherwise you will be regressing. You want to be actively improving because otherwise you are going to be overtaken by apathy at some point. Progress and the pursuit of it is inoculation against apathy. Apathy will get you fired, apathy will cost you money, apathy is pervasive and will creep into the rest of your life. So it should be 18 and a company-wide cultural traits that we improve, not to the point that it's stressful and overwhelming, and I mean because all goals are arbitrary, we set them because we set them. So, if you can say, hey, this week, I noticed this, that's little bit better than we did before. Awesome. Even if nothing else improves, that's awesome. That's progress. Now, to the point of if you see something and you look at it and go, you know, this is taking me a little while to figure out if they had just said this, if this had just been done, then take it as a coaching moment, but, and if you don't want to disrupt people, if you don't want to, you know, hurt morale, which of course we don't want to, then you can also say and look for what was great about it. This was great. The reason we want to work on this is because it caused friction. I couldn't figure out this. I didn't know this. This was not recorded. This was not clear. Okay. So you just want to be really specific about the thing. thing is not the way they handled the whole case. It is this tiny little thing, right? But you want to explain the compounding effect. Compounding works negatively and positively. If we continue to have these friction points, then what that's doing is keeping our, you know, long it takes to resolve a case longer than it ought to be, how long it takes to get paid longer than it ought to be. How long it takes to do the task each day preventing me from being able to get to the distributions or the demands or whatever else I needed to get to today to make sure all the other goals get hit. If a friction point can be identified, then it needs to be addressed. Does that make sense? Now, we clear on what a friction point is?
00:50:49 - Lorenz Schuerch
Anything else close us down?
00:50:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Clear to you, Patrick? just a reminder, what is the one assignment
00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have for you guys this week right down all the tasks associated with the case from start to finish and Assign those tasks to do it who completes them.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't want you to assign anything I want you to tell me who does them right? That's what I meant. Yes. Yes, it's a little bit different because I just want to make Sure you're not going out and talking to the team and say go do this or whatever I just want to know what the current operations is the current function and who does it and who can't do it and who can't Right match it with who does it right? I would also like you to rank who does it best to least Because that would be really helpful as well Especially giving all the the absences you're going to be having Lorenz That would be really good Okay Okay, quiet little Patrick over there. Okay, probably Geez. Ah, cute kid. Anyway, I know you're a grown man, but when you get to a certain age, everybody's a kid below you, right, Laurence?
00:52:08 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is. I'm like, but I'm a kid to all the older people and I'm 48. And when they treat me like a baby, I'm like, Oh, Like, it's funny. No, no. Anyway, okay. So let me go back to your notes. I cannot even try that right now, because my tabs are all over the place, not that I have a billion tabs open all the time. Oh, yeah, Patrick, you were having a conversation. We were talking about how Samantha prepares. I'm on the head and prioritizes. And I just want know, have you had any more thoughts about that conversation? I asked you, I think, to ask her about her priorities. If she, if she has, you know, how she chooses her priorities in terms of like distribution, sometimes case lists, that that's what yours were, I think. Uh, says then go back through email and look for docs that will help push cases forward. Oh, you do that. Yeah. Anyway, just has there been any evolution in that conversation in your own minds?
00:53:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um, kind of the same stuff. Just, you just have to be very proactive because like sometimes you'll see something that's already there that could help move the case, you just didn't really think about it. so you have to like constantly be doing file reviews. Because just because something comes in, it may not be the time for it to help move the case forward, but if you're doing file review, then you're always know, like, okay, for this case, I need this. Like a health insurance link can come in at the beginning of the case, but you know, you still got the rest of the case, but if the case is done, you're just waiting for it. Now it's like the one thing that pushes it forward. So doing a lot of file review, making sure you're up to date on where the cases are at, is very helpful to be able to recognize what's going to what you need to get you to the next step.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how do you approach file reviews then? You said doing a lot of them?
00:54:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I try to do daily, just sections of my case load to go through and basically check out what's going on, check out the notes, look at the treatment, you know, what are we missing. And at that point, I'll task, you know, the team, if I need them to do something, but there's a section of my day that I do that.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you review all the files by the end of the week?
00:55:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Not all, but pretty much most of them, because I mean, I can get through most of them in a week.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and I don't know what the timeline could be or should be, or how, so let me ask you this, actually, and this probably depends on where the case is and what the status is. But do you think, could either one of you give me a ballpark of how long it takes you to review the files? I know that there's got to be a huge range, but I love it for me.
00:55:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
I know exactly what my number is, because I have been timing it for the last two months, so we went from about ago. going to have minutes for file and now we're down to about between two and three minutes for file.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think that you're still that is still a quality review? And is that all in your team file reviews now?
00:56:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, Patrick, do you do file reviews on your own?
00:56:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you consider, do you see any value and potentially, so this is a new process that Lorentz has is is having the team do file reviews together. And then he actually separated that by groups, but you know, your team all works, I think, together. But would you be interested in trying it for a month doing file reviews together and see if that improves anything for you? Maybe speed or understanding clarity of it. lot quicker.
00:57:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
yeah I mean I'll probably do like because I feel like they're I feel like they will get straight with other tasks much more quickly than me because it's not necessarily their responsibility to make sure the case is getting closed like it is for the attorneys like but I think we can do like game ones do you do like every single case learns or is it like big cases or not do every single case I used to do no we used to not do it headcases but now we even do headcases so because we got so efficient and we can review we do twice a week so on Mondays we do distributions cases that we think we're gonna just try we're trying to distribute this month on Tuesdays we do An hour or a foul review, and then on Thursday, we do another hour of foul review, so two hours a week, a foul review. If you count the distribution, that's two and a half, I guess. And then in those two and a half, every three weeks, we go through every single case. So I used to take me probably an hour to an hour and a half a day, every single day, to review them by myself on my own. And then I'd have to assign tasks and follow up on those tasks. Now we can do more work and less time by doing as a team. And so I feel like it's improved my quality of life. I don't. I'm not working like I used to be working like 13 hour days before. just to get those files reviewed, those files reviewed, and my wife asked me to sign a different solution.
00:59:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's all the innovation. So two things, let's stick with you for minute, Patrick. Would you, will you try that?
00:59:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think it could be like a team meeting, but very specific to cases.
00:59:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what I would like you to do is let me know if structure is going to be and try that. And I don't want you to be like, hey, what do you guys think about it? Hey, this is what we're doing here. You drive it. But what I want you to consider is that you are actually going to be improving your team significantly through this process. Everybody will have a better understanding when you discuss it together, which means that if somebody is not around, you've now got people. people who, because they understand it, they're more viable, they'll be able to do more things eventually over time. So that's important to you, because like, you just heard of Lorenz is like, Oh, it's team is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone. You know, and as you, whether you stay the same size or you grow in your team size, there are going to be things that create hiccups. The better your team is at all things, the less stress it is for everyone, because you've got stronger shoulders across the board to help carry the weight no matter what happens. So you'll really be serving them well by improving them and having that experience Lorenz. I would love to see what happens if you change your file review time to 75 to 90 minutes instead. Again, just, it's a short term, because if it's taking you three weeks to get through everyone. everything and given the length of time that it takes for case resolutions, though it is improving and maybe it's already on that trajectory, maybe just 75 minutes instead of 60, maybe 90s too much. But will you try increasing that time just a little bit or adding one more file review, meaning, but I think you're probably better off increasing the time a little bit and see what happens.
01:01:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think I can try. So 75 minutes, that's only 15 more minutes, right?
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just 15 more minutes, but it's an extra 30 minutes a week. And if you're able to do that, then you probably get down to all your cases in about two and a half weeks, potentially two weeks depending on how well it goes, because you're in flow already. I'm central. Breaking it up between two calls, there's this whole half an hour that's added, or, you know, 15 on one and 15 on the other. That might actually increase that pace a little bit, but what would happen, you know, if you're able to get through that whole caseload and every two, two weeks and a couple days versus three weeks. Because, and I would also love you to go through and check the correlation between your file review and how your pace changed for average rate to close across that time period, we could do it on your one on one call through letify if you want and make that correlation, but I have a feeling that there's some kind of correlation. It's really hard to find out. Because of how long the cases take to close, but, but if there's any kind of relationship, that probably has something to do with it. Yeah. All right, two assignments. Patrick, Lorenz told me what it was last time, what's the assignment?
01:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Break down every step of our job, basically. For cases assigned for Mark, who does what? Who does it more efficiently versus the least? And then do a team file review?
01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yep. Okay. You got it. Do you guys have any questions, comments, concerns, complaints?
01:03:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Nope.
01:03:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
Nope.
01:03:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All right. don't live in Southern Oregon.
01:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's, there's a lot of fires here. We've had smoke for. Yeah. All right. right. and I'm not a happy girl about it. I freeze all winter and then they smoke me out all summer and I'm just an angry girl. Okay, okay.
01:04:08 - Lorenz Schuerch
Your tears on it.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to. I'm actually going there in a couple weeks. Either that or Vegas. We haven't decided what we're going yet. It's much to be hard to say. But anyway, Vegas, they're not Vegas. Arizona that I could retire there. But I'm portable so I'll just go everywhere and see all the people. Stay away from rednecks.
01:04:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay. Well, maybe don't come to Arizona then.
01:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh no, there is no comparison. I promise you.
01:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch
They do call us a Florida of the West.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I guess it depends on where you're at.
01:04:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But I'm telling you, you can't compete with these people.
01:04:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a town called Clement Falls. We like ranked in the top five in the nation for domestic violence. Matthew, use um yeah and all the things that correlate so low income um high unemployment and just ignorance and stupidity and it's willful and it's disgusting or whatever i mean it's not everybody because huh pictures look nice oh yeah i mean the nature's pretty except for when it's on fire i'm not angry everything's fine i'm not angry at all all right you guys you're awesome keep up the good work and wait who am i talking to next week okay patrick patrick i'm gonna pick on you next week and then oh oh so that was the last question i want to ask do you guys find the value still in um being able to collaborate every other week or would you like it just to be one on one twice a month elaborate I like the library as well, because I think it's really useful because you both have very different insights you just different people and I think that that's great, but I wanted to check and make sure because this is really this is your time so. Thanks for showing up and letting me work with you. You guys are great.
01:06:20 - Lorenz Schuerch
Bye.
01:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
