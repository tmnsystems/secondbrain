Hello. Happy 25, 2025, 2025, everyone. Hey, gang.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bro, at the end of this year, we'll be at quarter of the way to the center.
00:00:13 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, glorious. So celebratory.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know what happened to Mark on New Year's Eve?
00:00:23 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I know what happened to Mark.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:27 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
No, they got robbed.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At their house.
00:00:32 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
At their house.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:00:34 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Did they get followed home?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:00:37 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
That's the LA move.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's never happened in their neighborhood. Like they don't. The whole neighborhood doesn't have security, basically, because stuff never happens.
00:00:50 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Well, the LA move, the LA move is they.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, they went straight in Prachona's air maze that left laptops. passports and all kinds of other things. So they feel like it's an inside job.
00:01:05 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, they weren't home.
00:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They weren't like there. No.
00:01:09 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Got it. No, they do these, they follow, they follow people home from restaurants and then they rob them and then they get, once they pull them the driveway, then they follow them in.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. That sounds even scarier.
00:01:24 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
It's nuts. It's like the first time I heard it, I was like, oh, that's so smart. Like I was no one ever done this before, but okay. Yeah. And Mark lives in like a very rich area. If you hadn't gotten that.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:39 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, like the entire county.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh.
00:01:43 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Like he knows, like he doesn't live in LA. We say LA, but he does not live in LA.
00:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I would have imagined that anyway.
00:01:54 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. mean, he lives like 45 minutes away from LA. Well, there, at least Chona is very shook enough about it, but she doesn't have any security at his house or he does.
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no, not even cameras.
00:02:12 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, time to get the, time to get the, uh, Ecobee camera set up.
00:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time to get all the things.
00:02:21 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, because if they show up and there's like a resistance, guess what's coming back?
00:02:27 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So they, why do they think it's an inside job meet? Like who would be inside an ex assistant or some or relative of an assistant. And they stole the bags and stuff.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:02:43 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
That's easy to get rid of.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so that happened between two and four on New Year's Eve.
00:02:55 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Thanks.
00:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Happy New Year.
00:02:59 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that.
00:04:00 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
And I think I'm glad about that.
00:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying like, it's crazy, man. People are hitting my stuff. So you should be good, like, just just be good. don't need anybody else having any more problems around me. I to pick up both of my girls on New Jersey from their parties, separate parties, because they were crying and upset and emotional. So I'm like, all right, and then my sister called me the next day crying, and my mission leader had a horrible day and like, I'm just, I'm just staying home. That's good.
00:04:29 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
For real.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And building AI bots and finding out that I can do all the things that I want to do and APIs should work. And I got my first two basic versions of the bots working. Now I just have to like expand the code and the function to do what I want it to do.
00:04:50 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's been fun being nerdy again.
00:04:55 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I went down that and then I was like, all right, I'll revisit this. again later.
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's definitely a cap to like how much my brain can spend on it also just waiting for the response because I don't know how to do it by myself. So I'm going through it with chat GPT and Claude and really realizing I've got even with chat GPT chat GPT doesn't tell you to keep the conversation short Claude does. But the longer that conversation goes chat GPT gets dumber and dumber.
00:05:25 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
It really does.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:27 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
You have to keep checking back in with it like do you know what I'm talking about?
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember that? No, even if I do that it's still bad. So what I have to do is like get through a step and then wrap it up with okay print out the original overview goal and then the steps that we took without you know all the extraneous conversation so that I can take this to a new chat and then I do that and it works fine. But I've just wasted hours going what the hell is wrong with you and then realize oh You have limitations.
00:06:01 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
You're just not telling me. Yeah I'm sorry. No, you're not. You're not sorry.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, dude one time Okay, so it and I just remember this told me to do a command in terminal that Deleted all the files from a directory that directory was my downloads folder. lovely Yeah, and it was a permanent force deletion. It doesn't go to my deleted files. It doesn't go anywhere It's just on and it didn't tell me what was happening and it didn't warn me didn't tell me anything And then I was like oh it and he goes. I'm sorry. We're in this together.
00:06:38 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
The we are You didn't just let us files Yeah, family files that can't be replaced. No, so then I got a new software that helps me recover it But AI is gonna replace everyone for five years.
00:06:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it isn't Yeah Yeah, not if we want things to actually work properly.
00:06:58 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I hate to break it to you not happy
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I'm not worried about being replaced ever.
00:07:04 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's not all that everyone says it is. It just isn't.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. And even when it is, it won't be because morality at the very least isn't going to be programmed correctly and consistently. But consistency is probably the biggest thing that it will lack on top of all the other types of nuance. So yeah. But they can, they can believe in it and be scared and every other thing they want to.
00:07:34 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I mean, it's just like the ultimate potential. Oh, the potential.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, yeah, the potential's great. That's it would be cool if dreams and all that stuff. Speaking of it would be cool if you finish the book.
00:07:50 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Have that go. Not great.
00:07:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Damn.
00:07:56 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were supposed to finish that.
00:07:58 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
What happened? to it. I was like, done. I'm buying it just for that reason. Until I did.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can add a second track to voice memos.
00:09:10 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
It sounds good. They're using something about the hardware of the phone. This is what's crazy. You're playing first track and singing over it. No headphones, no nothing. And it's canceling out the first track somehow. The software and the hardware somehow cancel out that thing and then record the new thing on a separate track. then when you play it back, they're both playing simultaneously, like a multi-track.
00:09:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's wild. I don't know what else the differences are between them. I get phone every two years, just because usually the upgrades aren't that big of a deal between each. Every two, it's pretty significant so far in the last, like, since iPhone 10 with the cameras and because I like to take pictures so much, you know, the next ones are real up.
00:10:12 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
This, this phone isn't except for this function. And I was like, oh, buying that. Denise is like, are you going phone? Like, nope. You're all getting one next year.
00:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we are like, oh, Hmm. Okay. So what did you add?
00:10:35 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
There was like, don't buy stuff.
00:10:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, Justin, isn't that the opposite of what she normally tells you?
00:10:42 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know if she was busy or what, because, well, she's, you know, she's super conservative. So she's like, you can't do it like every year, which I don't. Right. like, this is, this is a not year. And then I told her, I'm like, yeah, I'm going into like, this year is probably going to be maybe the biggest year ever and she was taking that into account like oh okay so put put that powder keep that powder dry yeah and then i'm like and i'm going to probably lower expenses i'm like outside contractors to a degree so there's that yeah it would be like a double whammy yeah so we got to spend ronda i'm okay waiting um so anyway so then i was like okay but i could spend money on like charity whatever so i did that and then and then stuff like training so i bought like three or four music marketing courses and then what i do is i get cadence whatever her last name is, I'm into these courses, download the videos, name them one, two, four, five, you know, whatever it is, then upload them one at a time to descript into a unified just take it into chat TPT. Hey, analyze and summarize this for me. Okay, great. Then I give it the book and I say, compare to the book, what's missing, what blah, blah, blah, and it will give me stuff.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:43 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So I did that and I need that to the book. So I'm like, all right, well, I shouldn't edit the book until it's all written, because I'm adding quite a bit, actually. So I got to do that with. I did it with them on. I'm going to give Katie another one. And then I'm done. I'm like, okay, I'm done after that. There's legitimately, I'm like, I don't think I can find another resource that's even worth looking at. And then then I'll edit the entire book.
00:13:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, Like, do you have an outline of it table of contents or anything that you could share work. Yeah.
00:13:31 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I can send you the whole draft that's done.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to see that.
00:13:35 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And that part might change slightly like subsections are getting added or renamed.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you send that now? Because one of the things that we talked about doing was mapping out what the, like, in a kind of mind map. What the offer for mom is. Is basically your fan flowy, I guess? Like the product offer is probably fan flowy with the businesses make our music?
00:14:10 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
No, it's like the over-arching brand is mom, or like the umbrella. And then within that, there be fan flowy, distro flowy, sort of mom records, which is where we might, like Sean and then want to basically sign this girl that they found through one of our leads, which is hilarious because I'm pretty sure someone predicted that that would happen. Oh, that's right, it was me. And it happened within the first 300 leads. This girl came in as a lead through the radio station promo. They checked her out. They've talked to her parents because she's like 17 or 18. And then on Monday, I was like, what? So then I didn't know who it was. They just kept saying her, her, her, and I was like, yeah, whatever, like I don't really care. And then I didn't care at the moment. And then over the weekend, last weekend or something, was like, who, who is this? Like, I don't even know who it is. And then her name is, I forget, I'll tell you later. But I went to her tech talk, listened to her stuff. was like, damn, it's actually, it's actually good. And I would not say that. It's pretty good. some of the, I think some of the song arrangements are not great, but like she can sing and she's not doing usually the, the, the chicks, those guys like to me are just these derivative, they do this weird old timing, like this, what, that doesn't seem real. Like this doesn't seem it seems like they're trying to be somebody that never existed. And they all do it. Like if you can, I can find four chicks doing the exact same sound. This girl sort and she's not doing that, but she also hasn't quite figured out her genre, which I don't think is a problem. But she looks good, like she's got a good look. So I was like, all right, well, what's the deal? Like, how does this work? And Mark, they didn't really have an answer. And I said, okay, well, this is on Monday now. I go, okay, well, look at it like this. If you could go back in time and change what you did with the two that got away, what that looked like. And Mark was like, oh, that's a really good way of looking at it. He's like, I'll figure it out. He's like, because we couldn't do a bunch of stuff back then. We can do it all now. So we can totally sign like a different deal with her. And then I was like, all right. And then the other bit is like, I'm I don't think the songs are all that great. the producer dudes, same dudes doing all the songs, I go, they sound good. I don't, I actually don't think the mix is super great. It's good. could be better. And I said, do you, do we do like a single with her and say, okay, hey, we're going to do the single with you. It's 50-50. And then we have to tell her this is how you're going to promote it. You're going to use fan flow like they're just going to do this. And Mark was like, hey, yeah, we could do that. We could do that. And I go and then you have some sort of first writer refusal or some . And then see what happens. So we'll see. But I knew it. I knew what happened. And the ones that I find will be better though.
00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's, you know, one of my favorite words is compounding. When you keep doing something consistently, and it'd be Basically gains mass right because you keep building it. It keeps increasing mass mass increases gravity gravity And I know it's not a physical thing, but it's kind of the same concept The bigger you get the more you attract and if you consider it being energy instead of mass It's probably about the same thing Concept anyway right The very least we know that when you keep showing and up and doing something consistently and you grow and you improve Your knowledge increases your awareness increases and that just sends out signals to the universe that just says bring it to me Well, and I think I cracked That too like so I was Like every week it's like we have this tick-tock task Bobby's like did you work on that?
00:18:50 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Did you work on that? every week it's like no because I just had the sort of concept right So there are these dudes, the one dude is now making $100,000 a month off of Spotify, which is ridiculous when you think the payout is .004 per street. So he's getting 360 million streams a year, he's unsigned, he's totally independent. So all the money goes to him unless someone else wrote the song, but ostensibly he's not on a label. So 100% of the revenue is going to him and or co-writers and or collaborators, right? But he doesn't have collaborators on every song. So he's making around 100 grand a month-ish from Spotify on autopilot. So his whole thing is TikTok. So he grew it all from TikTok.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we knew that.
00:19:52 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
And I think I first encountered him like two years ago and I started, you know, I was like, okay, wow. he doing this, right? And then I bought his book and, you know, read the book, whatever, then I've watched interviews with him. And, and all he says, like, Oh, you got to make content for the song. I'm like, dude, literally useless, like, useless information, right? Got it. Content. How? So he was doing it. And then he got with this producer guy, who basically, I think mixes and masters, he might add some stuff. Occasionally he writes. So that guy must have been like watching the dude that he's working with go in Jesus. This guy's making bank, you know, just doing a TikTok. So then that guy started writing his own songs and releasing them. He blew up. He's got to be making 30 or 40 grand a month off of Spotify. And I was like, all right, so he got those two. And then I, but I still didn't know what to do with it. So I looked at their channels and I'm like, right, they're doing like, they're doing like, what are they doing, right? It's like, okay, yeah, you're releasing content around a song. And the questions in my head were, well, how many pieces of content? Is it the same? Is it through a period of time? Do they return to a long, like, what are they doing exactly? They don't tell you, and I realized that's because they don't, there is no real strategy.
00:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is.
00:21:38 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
The strategy is, to your point a moment ago, consistency, they consistently put out songs and they consistently turn content with those songs. I'm falling.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm changing audio. brought in my iPad so I could do, what do you call it, the whiteboard, but I joined audio when I shouldn't have.
00:22:12 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I've done that with Sean.
00:22:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hang on, I'm going to try that. Let's see. It won't let me hit the mute button though. That's really weird. Stay participant.
00:22:28 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
What I do with Sean is I mute the original source.
00:22:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably what I need to do because I mean, I know where to go to do these things, but it's not working right on the iPad. So, anyway, I'll just hear, you can hear me fine anyway, right?
00:22:55 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So, for a very long time, I've been like, I don't know what they're good. So then I listen, I for whatever reason, oh, I bought this course. One of these courses of this dude, and, and he, I think I was just on his YouTube and he interviewed this dude, this guy Nick, and I'm like, for whatever reason, I was like, I'll just put that interview on in the background. And I was doing my stuff listening to the interview, and he's saying the same . And I'm like, okay, this isn't helpful. And then all of a sudden I was like, I think he said something about, he's like, Oh, released this song. And he was mentioning how he had released songs before, which I didn't really realize because I never really dug in like his Spotify catalog. So then I thought, Oh, okay, wait a minute. So he's saying he had some songs out, then he put out this one song.
00:23:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, that must be when he, he must not have tick-tocked these older songs.
00:23:56 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I'm like, all right. So he hadn't done that. Okay, that's interesting. what can I do with that? And I started thinking, okay, I scraped his entire TikTok. I can scrape all their TikToks. And I can see the date of the video, obviously what the video is. Most of the time you get the song that's in the video, sometimes it doesn't have the correct name, it just says like original audio, unfortunately. But I'm like, okay, I could, I could pay someone to go through and like make sure they get the actual song name. Okay, yeah. And then I go, all right, so how do I scrape their Spotify? So I think I figured out, I'm actually going to send this to my buddy over in India today, I just decided on the car right over. So my thought is, okay, I scraped their Spotify, I get the release date, the song name, the total amount of streams, and another sheet I have their tiktok I get them to fix any missing song data and then I've got two data sets that maybe I can merge and then I give that to Julio and I say hey I want to run queries against this data set and I want to say I want to have a dropdown where I pick the song title and it tells me hey they did this many videos it's these and shows me the dates so that I can look at them and say okay the first song you ever did is called fine apple so I give fine apple I do pull that from the dropdown it goes here's the promotion for fine apple there were 11 videos these are the 11 videos the first list them in chronological order the first video was in this state last videos on this date and then I can see if he ever went back to that video so they'd be like okay here's this assuming this is what it goes like here's the original promotion here's Here's the return promotion. What do they look like? OK, great. Then do the next video, then do the next video, and then be able to query it and say, on average, how many pieces of content are there per song? And then I'll know. On average, what period of time were those videos released in? Are they all in three days? Are they in three weeks? Like, I don't know. He doesn't know.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do that already? No. OK, so you talked about doing that, but.
00:26:29 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
No, now I haven't scraped the Spotify. I figured out how to do it, I think. But I tried to do it, and I failed. And I was like, you know what? I'm not going to waste my time on this. I'm going to give it to those guys and say, hey, here's how you can do it. You guys go figure out how to do it, and then I'll pay you to start scraping channels. I'll pay you to figure it out. I'll pay you to set it up, and then I'll pay you to scrape the channels. And I already scraped all the TikToks. That I already know how to do.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, I keep, man, so, so then from that, then you actually have the strategy.
00:27:13 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
It's like, this is the strategy. This is how you do it. So then you can tell people, one thing the guy said that I thought was interesting that a couple of people said, and it's true, and you know this, and I know this, you, I could give someone this formula and say, here's the success to TikTok formula. They're not going to do it because it's work.
00:27:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:27:34 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, and Mark was like, dude, are you really doing that? I'm like, yes. And he's like, I'll do it. I'll execute it. He's like, I'll do it with my band. And I'm like, I'm going to do it with mine, whatever it is, because this works and you've got to do it now because there is no one selling this formula. And I don't know that you should.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's, it's funny because you. you bring up the point and it's the concern that everybody has is like if you share something, people will take it and steal it and do it and whatever. Because, but for the most part, they won't because it's doing work. But what I started building on and I'm excited about it just because it's like playing stuff, you know, like I got excited when I learned how to connect subwoofers and tweeters. I'm easily excited. But so building the two bots that I started with are foundational project management box. So one of them, it's purpose is to bring storm, what the tasks are to, let's say we're going to create a simple business. model, what are the projects, what are the departments, and any business is going to have to have something it sells, right? So the creation of the product starts to finish. What would all the tasks be that need to happen, you know, what are the dependencies, what is, you know, assuming X skill level and X hours worked each week, what is a reasonable timeline to create this, know how much it can be, given the AI, that thing, right? So basically map out this product or project, start to finish, and it can create all the tasks in Slack and in Trello and create assignments with a schedule to follow up with them, make sure everything was on task, make sure, you know, basically like the Monday meetings, right? Is there anything stopping us, how are we doing, what into the way, are we there? And he can do all of that. So that's one bot. And the other one is that I just started last night is a hiring bot. So it's job is to, so let's say we've looked at the project and we've decided that we're going to separate, that we're going to create these departments. And we actually want a human being to do some of these things. So what is the minimum and maximum skill level we want? So what are the skill level parameters? What's the budget? How many hours do we want that type of thing? And then through Upwork API, because I just confirmed this last night that that API allows this access, it can lock into Upwork, it can post the job posting that it will have mostly written by itself, all approved it, right? And then go out and look for people that. match those qualifications, then invite them to the job, and then look for anybody that followed the application instructions, reply to the applicants, conduct an interview, and then let me know when somebody has passed all the qualifications and give me a short list that I would then go approve and hire myself, and then give all the information back to the project management bots, and get them set up in Slack, give them their assignments, and carry on from there. So, all of that takes hours, and, but I have a systematic approach for it, because I already have all these job postings, I already have all this logic in my head about how I hire people, and that's one of the things that stops a lot of people, so one of the things that I wanted to do when I was teaching my course, and, like, everything about it is, how do I help people get out of the, it takes five to ten years before anybody actually gets really good at running a small business, right? Because they go broke buying all the stuff from the boomers, they can't hire people, they can't afford it, like there's this big huge delay in acquiring both skills and financial assets enough to actually get people help you. But if I could teach them the operations and the functions and the foundations and then offer in a package, the box and maybe there's a done for you where somebody like builds them on your computer or something like that, I don't even know, or maybe their server access because the box can be built locally or remotely on a server, right, with all these different things like rasa and hugging things and things like that. So, so that as a service, but it. Not so much is like, hey, there's another way to make money. It is that. But here's a way to actually make people be successful using the concepts and the foundations that I'm teaching, because now I've removed a lot of the limitations that would have kept them from executing it in the first place.
00:33:17 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And to me, that's exciting. Like, I still think it's going to be a small percentage of people that will do it. But what I think is that that small percentage will get further faster, and that's what's exciting to me.
00:33:32 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Well, what I was thinking is that they have to do it, right? So you want to be wary of ending up like me. You don't want people to become dependent on you. You want to give them the tools to do it themselves. Yeah. And you're like, this is the best way for me, because then they're better up.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that is my whole point is like, it's exactly that. I want autonomy for people. I want through them for people. And I want what's the best way to protect them from the vipers of their, right, is to make sure that they understand and have enough that they don't get stuck feeling desperate. And I want to talk in the morning when they have nothing but a credit card and just know, they go buy somebody selling them, you know, this pipe dream that's not even real, and then you can't get their money back. Like, to me, this is how I protect the people that I would love to death and call family, but I've never met them, you know, just the good people out there who actually create good in their communities. They have these really niche skills. They just don't know how to get it to people or create their thing. And anyway, so yeah, so it's been fun. But also my, what I know is that if I'm going to, and this has always been my MO for everything, if I'm going to to continue to be valuable, but also get the best out of what's happening in AI, I have to use it. I have to build with it myself. I have to understand it conceptually from the inside out, because that's what I've done with everything else. I've done copywriting, I've done graphics, I've done, you know, like basic PHP editing and C++ editing and things like that. So that I knew when I hired people, like you can't pull the wool over my eyes, that shouldn't take you that long. That doesn't cost that much money.
00:35:35 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
That type of thing, right?
00:35:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll have this skill as well, but the other thing is nothing has grown this fast. There has never been, what's the word, innovation at the speed and all of these different companies popping up with all these other resources. The only way I'm going to even have an understanding of what they could actually do is to try them and use them. And also I just like playing and being nerdy, but I'm playing and being nerdy with a goal in mind. And the other thing is, I'm normally bottlenecked by other people's availability focus more.
00:36:19 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I'll never, I'll never happens.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rives me nuts, because I'm like, if I had more time, I would do it all myself, but I'm still single mom. So guess what's not in issue right now, Dan?
00:36:33 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I buy other people.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so, but it also makes me want to go, okay, well, what are the real world applications I can help the people I'm working with now? So like for one thing, and I have that as the task is, how do we build the form that Mark needs to get to you the information he needs for when are we lose? which is just a really basic kind of questionnaire type thing, but also is there anything that you don't have somebody to do like if you have something you want created and let me see at least add some research time to it and see what I can find is most of the things that you have an application for I would have an application for just in a different way. So if you come up with an idea and you're like I'm not working on this but if you want to work on it let me know. I like building so like you and lead flowy and there's so many different applications it applies to so many different businesses it can assist you it can be niche level it can be its own thing period like that type of thing right yeah oh okay so what I did want to do was I have to go back to my notes because we had talked about what is the offer if you can't get the Spotify app and you're like, they're already selling it. So I wanted to have a visual representation of what is being sold. I have, hold on, let me see what I wrote down. I know that you've got the back catalog that lets people hit the API of all the release songs. The latest release app, which is that UI that runs in the background, triggers the automation to go, hold on, that's not a wrap. I got to wrap these things so I can actually see them. Look for the latest release and update the artist profile with the latest release. The URL redirect builder, that's a series of URLs to put in their products. socials, then those rewrites and append tracking codes. I remember the discussion about it. didn't write good notes, but I remember what it did. And then the custom onboarding app to create onboarding steps and define if they are required, can't go anywhere else until they do it. I really got to write better notes. Then we give them the URL to take them to so there's a fixed onboarding and they have public reports. Never mind. I write bad notes. Keep them from accessing band flowy until they fully onboarded. That's basically the point of the gist. know what I mean? guess if you want to say it, how do people... it into your ecosystem?
00:40:04 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So this is what I covered it with these guys, one of these weeks. So that was my good day. I said, where are these people coming from right now? And that I didn't know. I assumed the majority were through their personal network, because I know that they know some of these bands or in listening to them say, how someone's going to use it. We were on tour with them in 1999. It's like, okay. So I assume most of them are from that. They're not. Most of them are from the radio station dude. So he has an offer that he does that is, I'm just going to call it label services. And I actually don't know what he's doing for these bands. Exactly. but he has a team that is doing cold outreach to bands from the radio station saying, hey, blah, blah, blah. Like, whatever. We don't know what the pitch is, but I'm like, get it. I want you to get the pitch. want you to get the script. I want you to get everything from him. I want to know what he's doing. So he's signing bands to his service, and then he in turn is referring them to fan flow because he's like, you need to use this. So that's where the majority of bands that are using it right now have come from. Most of the people have been on for months. We've only lost a handful of people, and that was because they came on so early, and like things were being developed and really, you know, it was not breaking, but changing, like constantly changing. And then they were using the original Instagram thing that only worked for a short period of time. That was, it would bang all and to followers, but it was more of like a vanity metric. We weren't really sure how well they converted to Phantom, whatever. And then that broke. We were using the third part for that. That's what put me on the whole super rise thing. Anyway, so only a few people have left, but Sean went through the list and said where they came from. Most of them were from this dude, John and Rock Rage. And then a handful were from another referral source, and I was like, right, so affiliate, basically. all these people are coming from affiliate, and then the main affiliate is doing cold outreach. And then the other chunk is coming from the promotion we're doing with John, where we're running an ad and getting your song on the radio. And then we've converted three of those leads to fan flowy. But still, they're coming from Rock Rage. And I was like, all right. You need to go do more of that and find more people like him and the other guy, and I forget who the other guy is and what the other guy does, but the thing, the only thing that's holding that up is like, okay, we just need to make a facing offer or not, do we just keep making it like, do we keep making it like invite only, which it is right now essentially, and we haven't quite decided that, or do we make an actual front facing offer? part of me is like, why would you make a front facing offer when there was a one before? I'm like, we like, I think why would we change it? Mark was talking about like, we should go get a booth itself by Southwest. I'm like, no, like, That's stupid. There's no evidence that that will work. And it'll cost $10,000. And it's like, I'd rather spend $10,000 on leads that we know one out of 300 convert because 10,000 leads at $10,000 at 50 cents a lead to , little leads. Way more you're going to get spit out some website content. And it's like, you know, I don't know if you call it like the beta or it's invite only, come up with some, some offer, so that there's like a velvet rope aspect to it, to which there is, and then use and then finish up these tools so that it is ready, not necessarily waiting for Spotify. But, and the other bit is that I didn't know this, but the. The company that we might white label their distribution software It's got a weird it's like Evie era so Sean and I we're talking to them and then At one point I got sidetracked Talking to a dude about acquiring his distribution software So I sort of stopped talking to the Evie era dude and then I figured out the guy I was talking to was just Didn't know what the hell he was doing. So I'm like, I'm not buying that So then I looped back around to those guys asked couple of clarifying questions He didn't have the answer. I literally just re-clarified that yesterday or the day before to Figure out like how we can integrate it in with fan flow away and then I have some more technical sort of programming questions, but I'm gonna wait till he responds to the part that was unclear and then Then I think probably going to do it. And then I need to negotiate a deal with them. Like, okay, it's, you know, this much setup fee, and then this much a month. And then, you know, offer is like, 10 grand setup, $900 a month. I'm like, that's not happening. But, you know, what is it going to be? And then I was talking to Sean and Mark yesterday, like, what is the model here, right? if you look at the other distribution companies, their model is subscription. They're just sasses, essentially. And these guys want to make the model more dependent on, not dependent, but more, more built upon the royalties that you can get as a distributor. So these other distributors, some take royalties, but like two of the bigger ones don't. So they're just straight sass. And here, it would be hybrid model of that. And then if we can, what these other distribution companies can't do is like, they don't have a fan flowy thing. So they're like, got their dude. And it's funny, I was talking to Chad TPT and Chad TPT even said, it's like, your real different areas that you can offer promotion, which none of these guys do. They're all trying to move in that direction. But like, we've done the part that they don't have, and then we're going to go white label the part that they do have. So it's like, okay, then that becomes a technical question for the EV era guys like, hey, and I don't know the answer to this, how can I sell a bundle? Like, who's processing these cars? This processing happening? So I got to figure that out. But odds are we'll do a deal with them because the other bit being, you know, more than 50% of the leads that we get right now don't have distribution. I'm like, dude, even if we're just selling these people into like a $20 distribution deal, like one song, $20. A certain chunk of them are going to do it right so and then there are there in our that's the only system They've ever used as ours and then we promote you want to grow your band and the bubble bubble so Well, and then you get to a tipping point where word of mouth takes over Because you need it or wants everyone in his dog You will that actually have something? Yeah, and I want to You know, we that's the thing it's like you don't you keep it sort of gated Yeah, I I kind of like that like no, know, it's just isn't for everyone And then yeah word of mouth that's also happening we do have word of mouth happening so that will happen more So it's like okay if you build this community and you show people how to do this stuff and they know fan flow is there and Then we're saying you're just you're not ready for this like this is just a distraction that you need to follow the follow the map. Are you ready to promote? If you're not ready to promote then don't do that then you shouldn't be using this but when you're ready you know where to go. You're here and you know let us let us know when you think you're ready. As opposed to like doing a 14 day free trial and have like all these people coming through the system like it's like dude no that slow growth. Yes and then doing the thing where like we go out and target artists the other bit that I was like we should be targeting people that like so targeting artists that are with a management company targeting artists that are with whatever so that we get the whole roster because you get one band and they're like this works. And then the label or the management companies like oh, we want this for all our guys like, okay And get it rather than a bunch of rent rather than 10 randos you have like 10 Relatives or whatever Oops undo dude.
00:50:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at this I Zoom has all of these whiteboard templates. This one is MVP ideation That's funny That's Yeah, do you see it?
00:50:34 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I didn't I hit the button on the way But now it's back.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It has so many different templates like this for meetings And I bet most people have no idea that they're there. Oh, no, they definitely don't I've never seen it I've never heard anyone talk about it Holy crap, it has Well, let me show you another one. I won't bother you with the tunnel, but it's interesting. Look at this one. 30, 60, 90 days.
00:51:11 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
What's my favorite?
00:51:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It has a SWAT analysis. They've got all kinds of things. This is wild. It's crazy how just having a visual inside of your like that everybody is looking at at the same time can anchor a conversation and a phone call and but also extract out of the call what needs to happen. We're not there. You've got really organized calls, but anyway, just the evolution of tools and but to your point earlier, still do much work and people won't do it. Yeah, which is why AI is not going to take ever what what's going to happen is the people that do the work are still going to be the people that do the work. They're just the only thing that's going to happen is the people that are willing to do the work, but just didn't have the resources, will not be able to enter the playing field. And that will shift things a little bit, but not very much. It will shift it more for them than it will for the world at large. And yeah, anyway, why don't we? So, okay, so you haven't even decided, collectively, if you want a front-facing offer, you already have organic traffic coming from a source. And that type of traffic was ideal, is ideal, is probably more of what you want and would work better than your own front-facing offer. sounds like what you think. Is that right?
00:53:00 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, it's like, there's a front-facing offer, but it's gated, right? So it's not, maybe you do sell them into DIY, ultimately. But for the time being, you're really trying to get more of what really needs to happen is that like if these guys are going to keep coaching people or doing the done with you, they need to have some, you can coach them too. They're paying you $600 a month, $97, and then the remainder is the coaching money, right? more all-in-one. We need to have subscriptions running, like we need to start putting subscription data, MRR , like up on the board, which is fine. They don't have problem with that. Like, we just didn't have the ability to do it. And then we have the pricing, so it's like, yeah, and then go get, then we have to figure out Like what your capacity for doing this sort of done with you, how does that look? I assume there's a capacity, right? Everything. Or you raise the price, right?
00:54:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you do both. So, let's say somebody came in, right? What are these guys doing offering? know we just told you the stack that you tell me that you have in fan flow A, but what is That's all they're offering.
00:54:35 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So, they're offering that plus we run the ads for you. So, it's not an agency throwing the software in. So, there is a subscription, but there should be two subscriptions. Oh, hey, here's the subscription for fan flow A, and then here's your or retain our subscription, whatever you wanna call the other thing to run the ads and answer your questions. Like then they run concurrently, so they could drop and say, you know what I wanna learn to do the ads? And we show them, here's how you run the ads. Okay, gonna take it from here, great. maybe that's the offer. You go, hey, we onboard you, we give you done with you for a month. You get, ask all the questions you want, maybe it's 60 days, figure it out, and then say at the end of the 60 days, you can drop that part and just stay on just the software and in the community, or then maybe you charge for the community too, and say, oh yeah, and then if you want to, you know, ongoing support, you can just pay $20 a month to be in the community. Okay. Actually, I like that, I never thought of that.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, well, let me highlight that. Can you bundle that all in in the beginning?
00:55:56 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
You say, okay, you pay the first 60 days. I think you got to start the fan flow subscription from the jump and then they pay whatever the fee is for 30 to 60 days of done with you. Hey, we're going to hold your hand through it. And then at the end of that, they're on their own unless they want to stay on that. But maybe not. I mean, this is where the capacity thing comes in. So let's assume at the end of that, they just go into the gen pop and you go, hey, pop up or you can go into the paid community, which still gets your access to us. Bob, Bob, Bob.
00:56:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to move this out of the way. This is just more of a bottleneck. It'll be easier to make things later. Okay. So what is move out of my way going back into my spreadsheet? Okay. Pay community. $1,000 a month?
00:56:58 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll ask you about what that access is in a second, but what is gen pop a prison term?
00:57:09 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
What? General population.
00:57:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Okay.
00:57:15 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
You can go to gen pop or you can be in, you know, you can be the better part of the prison with us.
00:57:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So general population is $20 a month and no gen pop is free. Oh.
00:57:26 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So then it would be the pay community, whatever, we'll come up with a name for that. Okay.
00:57:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. what I'm going to go do right now is try to make like a simple visual version of this for you to just probably hopefully have a better conversation of outcome so that you guys can get a little closer to making this decision. Because when you have that book done, you've already got all of these stuff with our live.
00:58:06 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
So custom onboarding app, said, oh, it's not tested, but we don't need it yet for what we just talked about. But we it's live. just I was messing with it earlier today. There's two ones that are live that one I learned a little bit about today. It's a couple questions about it today that I wait for an answer on. And then we'll we'll pretty it up. But we could start using it ourselves. So when a new person comes on, we would go through the onboarding with them, which is what they're doing now, except there's just no visual to it, right? So we would use it. then that would help us finalizing.
00:58:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what is the cost of that suite of the low end prices, 97 bucks.
00:58:59 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
And then I think the dumb with you, they were talking 1.97, but it's not that. So, this is the error that I sort of overlooked, but now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, like, no, you would never have done with you be a single subscription because I don't know that we can downgrade them to 97, I'd need to look into that. So, you would just have this base price of 97, and then if they get these other things, it's a separate subscription. They run concurrently, but they're not connected to each other necessarily.
00:59:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
do you have a, at least a rough definition of what, do it yourself and done with you look like? So, low-end, I'm assuming, is do it yourself, right?
00:59:51 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, but we're not going to sell that. So, that people will get, we're only going to sell them with you, and then downgrade them. And then release them in to do it yourself if they want, but you can't come in at do it.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay What I'm thinking right now downgraded into here after Done with you. I like that. That's gated And and then done with you is obviously gonna be gated. So that's good. means that everybody has gone in there and gone through What they need for success?
01:00:28 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so it would be like We know that they are on track. They're on the track So done with you.
01:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that price and what do they get they get all of those things?
01:00:40 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
All right. so everyone's done with you right now, and I don't think they I think they're just like what can you afford? Right Which would go away Okay, well, what do you think it should be I? Would want to know what they're actually charging right now like what is I would literally take the average
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what it is, $97 and then whatever they're averaging right now and then look at that number and say, okay, what? Email you right now, Dan.
01:01:08 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I'm texting them right now.
01:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Hi. Hello. It's just in case for whatever reason they take a while to get back to you, that reminder will be in your email. Okay. You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to see if I can explain this to Claud and get Claud to do it. I had Claud help you with some visual representations of things before and it uses CSS to create it.
01:01:57 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. know what I did with the Chantu Petitio, dammit. was like, this is dope. I gave it, um, what did I give it? I gave it somebody's PDF that was like, around social media or whatever. And I was like, can you? Could you create a calendar file from this that I could import into a calendar? like, yup. , really? So I had to do it and then I didn't do it, but it mapped out. Like, Oh, this according to this, you these days. Oh, it was a singing course. And I was like, could you turn this into a calendar file with reminders for Google? they're like, yep. And we can create an ICS file. was like, God damn. Never thought about that.
01:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
01:02:45 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
I know. It's like, this is cool.
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I okay, so you can use chat to create a calendar ICS file from well, whatever, that'll be enough.
01:03:00 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and I had it created from a PDF that was like, hey, you want to practice this many times per week and for this long, I was like, God damn, okay. And then I assumed you could say, I wanted, I want my time to be 12 and two every day. Like, okay, here you go.
01:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things I want to work on is figuring out how to build the stuff where there's like, it told Mariasse, this is the year of no new clients unless they're just like, amazing balls, right?
01:03:32 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
What an interesting concept.
01:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All my clients are amazing balls, but you don't just find them, like, man, and we were connected for years and they just happened to be the right time and the right thing, all that stuff. That just doesn't happen. You don't build a funnel for that. You can, but you have to deal with a whole lot of other parts to do it and I don't want to. But what I would like to do is kind of create that same thing, but I've been able to do that. and it's been awesome, you know, most people can't. But if I could create all these little simple kind of business models that are replicatable that people could then go and build their specific niches around and just if I can manage to convince people that you don't have to do anything new, it's just your own perky person is enough to be different and attract people. it's you know, two point of like 10,000 true fans or 1,000 true fans, whatever it is, you don't need everybody. You just need a few to have a good life and a good living. You don't need the market.
01:04:42 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
You're teaching people and this is I mean, this is my big takeaway from 2024 that I'm carrying it at 2025 is that what you first do, right, this is where we don't have to do this here. I know what their objective is. Their objective. is to get more listeners, to get more fans, to grow their streams, like, they want to get their music out there. So that's the objective. So we don't need to be like, what's your objective in releasing music? I know what it is. But what they lack is strategy. What you do is you go in and say, what's your objective? Right? That's where you're getting into. Do you want more time with your family?
01:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want to make more What do your values?

Then you give them, then you go, great, I've got the strategy to get you there. And then that's where all the tools come in. But no one's having that objective conversation with them and they're not having it with themselves.
01:05:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And you can't, that's not a one and done conversation. Conversation that has to be on repeat because every week you get somewhere else and you go, oh , watch my mouth. Not this, not that, you know, that kind of thing. But the other thing is, okay, you said this was your objective. Do you realize that the steps you're taking right now are taking you off your objective?
01:05:56 - Dan (danddcompany.com)
Right, Mark.
01:05:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. yeah exactly yeah so but I can build that into the process and one of the things I got from Seth and spending time with him is knowing that you build that you can build that into the automations so it goes out and and basically does a where you at you know and are you in alignment here's how figure out if you're in alignment but I can also build a Tina bot into the automations so like it can respond and I don't we're not there yet but I bet you by the end of the year we will be where the email can go out and the email trigger is let me see how you're doing get your response and the response goes back to um Tina does this logic and goes this is what they told me they were working on chat you can in or cloud or whatever's logic says that's not in alignment and this is what Tina would say you know, if you're not in alignment to help you get back, right? Because I do have a whole set of things that I would have said. And can we get them back on track through automations? I think we could do way more good than not, right? I don't think it'll be perfect, but 80, 20, I don't have to.

Right. Right.

So, like, if we can get for people to actually, so here's my favorite part of what I do about business, it's not business. It's people understanding who they are and why they do what they do so that they're paying more attention to what they're doing and why they're doing it so that they make better choices. And as a result, they end up being better people, We end up being better family members, husbands, wife, spouses, parents, whatever, because we're paying attention to what we're doing and what we're saying. And we're paying attention to what matters most to us. And you, you can't, you can't keep it to just business. It ends up like, Joe was like, I think Heather said it, but I think Joe said it too. It's it's changed the way she does everything after we talked. And now we're looking at it backwards and going, but she just got really hard to just, that's because I think it's been more time there. But anyway, but it just, when you start measuring what you're doing differently, it applies and spill lots to the rest of your life. So if I was able to do this and basically get people to observe their own logic and then improve their logic and just continue to be mindful of it, what would happen? I don't even know, because I can't get to that many people. And the rest of us are scrolling on Facebook. So like I've paid attention, somebody taught me, multiple people taught me, but. Anyway, yep, it's all like a fascinating social experiment, too For reals For realsies. Oh, yeah, I've got I better get ready for all right then.

I'm like, I want to get one of those and My thing that I've fallen into over the last 30 years is like I Only buy natural wood guitars like I none of my guitars are painted because that's just what happened from when I was like 17 and So like three weeks to go. So I've gone to this website and I've custom built the guitar that I would want. And three weeks ago, this guitar went on sale on reverb.com. It's literally the guitar I would build, and then it sold, and then it came back. And then it sold again, and then it came back. And then it sold again, and then it popped up today.
