00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Tina Marie: Not at all. That's crazy, isn't it?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Dan Ryan: So crazy.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
mark sweet: Um, we just are literally starting it today.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Dan Ryan: Well, and then I'm actually, weirdly. I've been talking to the. So the SEO guys were like blah blah blah local blah blah blah.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Dan Ryan: And they were like, you don't have Gmbs for every single location I'm like, no, we don't like. We don't. I don't think we want one for Los Angeles.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Dan Ryan: Right? Is that office even real.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
mark sweet: Uh, we can't even get a postcard if they send it there.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. So I was like, La, we can't do. But I was like. And then Texas.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Dan Ryan: Vegas. It was gone. And then Texas, do we want to do Texas.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Dan Ryan: So Missouri is missing, which.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
mark sweet: No, I don't.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Dan Ryan: Might be, might be resolved. Don't want to do. Texas couldn't do. La, I'm like, no, I think we got all the ones we want. But what about.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Dan Ryan: Now Colorado.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
mark sweet: I would like it. Yeah.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, well, I'm guessing you're Gonna have to do the same thing you did in Missouri.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
mark sweet: Great.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Dan Ryan: Layout.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
mark sweet: Well, let's see if we get a postcard first.st Colorado was a little different.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Dan Ryan: And the chat button. All right.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Um.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Tina Marie: Second voice tracking updates. Have you? Did you spend any time on that last week?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
mark sweet: Going back in time, or adding to what we already have.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Tina Marie: Any either or.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:49.000
mark sweet: Um. I've got what we have. So we added a total of so far 218,000 gross.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
mark sweet: So that's good.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Tina Marie: Um, okay. How much of it in fees?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
mark sweet: Uh, I don't. It should be about 76,000. Roughly.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Tina Marie: So that was roughly 13,000 more in fees. Since last week.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tina Marie: That's good. Adds up.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Tina Marie: Um. One way to look at that is like.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Tina Marie: What wages did that second voice just cover? You know what I mean.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
mark sweet: Totally. Okay.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Tina Marie: Um. I really.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so I'm kind of in the middle of 2 things. Isabelle needs a ride again today. Normally, it's not an issue, but it is so. I have to go back and forth in the talking, but I.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Tina Marie: Made my talking points. Um well.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Tina Marie: 2 things that I want to make sure that we do, whether it's on a. Monday call, or just an additional one, is you and I.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Tina Marie: Sit down and work on. Second voice tracking just some kind of simple attribution.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Tina Marie: Um system. So that you're not having to do it all yourself.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Tina Marie: And then um. How is the the data going that you were working on with Isaac?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tina Marie: The reporting so that we can figure out things like. Whale percentage rates and all the other things that we'll be able to get from.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Tina Marie: What you guys were working on. David Hudson.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Tina Marie: Do you know what I'm talking about, Mark?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
mark sweet: I know we had talked about trying to figure out well, percentage rates.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
mark sweet: I don't remember what Isaac. We're waiting on Isaac for.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Tina Marie: So 2 weeks ago, or 3 weeks ago, you and I were sitting down looking at the reports. And we were.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Tina Marie: Um looking at the total. Revenue by cases.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Tina Marie: And. Some things were missing. You were looking at that and going. This isn't right. I could go.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Tina Marie: Pull back up the notes, and then make sure that we've got. Basically an outline of what we want to do. I didn't, because it sounded like you.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Tina Marie: Had a clear idea. But as more time passes, and you have all these other things on your plate. It's easy for that information to degrade.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Tina Marie: So.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
mark sweet: Cause. I know we got you over. We were talking about like. Close. An average attorney, fee.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Tina Marie: Yes, that also. So there were kind of 2 things that.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
mark sweet: Cause that one I remember and like. We're done.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Tina Marie: And you're you're done. Would you say.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
mark sweet: Yeah. It took a while. I had to literally hand go through. All of it.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Tina Marie: Well, what can you share with me on that.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
mark sweet: I shared it to you.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Tina Marie: Wait a minute. Sorry. Like in a just shared like a Google, something.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tina Marie: Hey, cousin? Stop!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Tina Marie: Mark, let me look at this.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
mark sweet: Yeah, um, I can reshare it if you need me to.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Tina Marie: I probably.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
mark sweet: What's called time until paid.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Tina Marie: Oh, yeah, okay. I saw something. Um.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tina Marie: But it wasn't in my email. There you go!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Tina Marie: Time until paid. I thought that was a Chona thing.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
mark sweet: No.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Tina Marie: Raw data. So when you say time until paid, that's close, right.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Tina Marie: Let me look at this with my mom. Tyler, Sam.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Tina Marie: 3, 88. 3, 52.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So Samantha went up.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Tina Marie: 36 days, roughly. And the rent only went up about 16 days.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Tina Marie: Well, the difference so. Things got for Samantha, 9.2 1% longer for Lorenz, only 4.9% longer.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Tina Marie: So Samantha. Almost doubled in how much longer it took. But I don't want to look at it that way on a percentage level.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Tina Marie: Um, but well, but still in days. So part of the reason. Okay, let's look at the outliers.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Tina Marie: 9.8 per 6% change. Outlier. What is this number of outliers.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Tina Marie: I don't think.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
mark sweet: So that's if I take out the outliers, because there's some that. Are just way. Hasty.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Tina Marie: If you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
mark sweet: Way, you know.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Tina Marie: What did you qualify as an outlier.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:28.000
mark sweet: Um like we had a. One. That was a minor. So when we sell their case and they're like almost 17. So we just they want to wait until they're 18 to get their money rather than going through the entire fund court.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
mark sweet: Stuff that wouldn't even help them would literally just take money from them.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so that's 1 case. How many outliers were there for people.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
mark sweet: Not a lot. I would say less than 3.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Tina Marie: It.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
mark sweet: To like each person like there weren't. It wasn't a huge number of cases.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
mark sweet: But it did make a difference in terms of. Time.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Tina Marie: Where it says outliers was that if they were included.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
mark sweet: That's if they were taken out.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Tina Marie: Oh, okay.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
mark sweet: It's only 2 shots and no outliers.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Tina Marie: 1, 6, 2, 3 times around.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
mark sweet: I'm not sure, Dan, on this we have some clue. What the hell we're talking about.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tina Marie: Alright! Let's go. Hold on a second transitioning to the car.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tina Marie: And the doggies will be barking. Dan, can you see what we're talking about? We usually have some good questions about this.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Dan Ryan: See what. I don't know what you're looking there, where there's nothing on screen.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Tina Marie: I think he just shared it to you.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, an email. Not shared. I don't have it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Tina Marie: It's called time to paid, or something like that.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Dan Ryan: Did you ever send it to me, Mark? I don't have it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
mark sweet: I like literally did like just right now.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Dan Ryan: Oh, I don't have this.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Tina Marie: Oh, wow! Those average fees are.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, does not? It's not showing up. So hold on.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Tina Marie: Crazy. Oops need to see this here.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Tina Marie: What do you think about those average fees? Mark.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
mark sweet: Picking out the outliers.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Tina Marie: Well, let's see.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Dan Ryan: Up in a lay.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I didn't look at that without the outliers.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
mark sweet: Because, like this year, still relatively new, we take out the, you know, 1 million dollars for Lorenz. It kind of makes a large difference.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Tina Marie: That's definitely. Yeah.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, it does. But. When you look at the change. So Samantha went from.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Tina Marie: 16.6 4 9. Average, 2024 to 13.7 5 5.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Tina Marie: Lorenz went up, she went down.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Tina Marie: So does that. Make you ask yourself any questions.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000
mark sweet: Not necessarily. And and part of the reason is because I went through all the raw data so much, and. She's still getting policy limit very, very, very often.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
mark sweet: So she wasn't getting the policy limit very, very, very often.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Tina Marie: She's still doing what? What is very, very, very, very, very often.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Tina Marie: In a percentage.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
mark sweet: I honestly didn't count the percentage, but I would say it was. I'm guessing, but probably about 80% of the time.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay. So that's something we don't want to guess that we do actually want to dig into. Because. That's the variation between California and Arizona potentially.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Tina Marie: Right. So apples and oranges, trying to compare Samantha to Lorenz. Um, not that you would be trying to do that, but I am, because the whole point of this is trying to figure out.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Tina Marie: What can we do as always, to get more out of what we have. It's going to be process related. It's going to be system related. So.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Tina Marie: Do you remember reading the book? Um. Switch. I'm pretty sure it was in switch. Okay, do you remember the bright spots.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
mark sweet: Yep. Yes.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Tina Marie: Analysis. Okay. So somewhere in here are existing bright spots, and some of them will be emerging bright spots. As a result of other people's processes, potentially.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tina Marie: What I'm doing with Lorenz. And also as much as I would like you to keep hiring me to work with Lorenz. If I'm not actually making a difference. We want to know that.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tina Marie: But if I am, and it is making a difference. Is there anything that you can capture and bring across the board.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Tina Marie: Then we loop back to the other issue of you. Don't want to rock the boat because you're afraid somebody will leave sweet Law. And then you can't even handle the cases. You can't make the money.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Tina Marie: We can't get new attorneys. And so it's a constant chicken and egg situation.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Tina Marie: Uh, but the more that we understand. About the bright spots.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Tina Marie: The more that we can find. And I hate to use this because this is not wisdom. This is scarcity, mindset.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Tina Marie: But the path of least resistance. To where we can make improvement across the board.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Tina Marie: Where you're not worried about losing somebody because you asked them to do their job a little bit better. Heaven forbid!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Tina Marie: Not that I have any opinions about this or anything.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Dan Ryan: So I can see it now. My, so this. The reason I sent the email today. And the reason I'm gonna ask this question is because I got our report from Bobby this morning.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Dan Ryan: And I looked at it, and I was like. Uh, and I think I said, I've mentioned this, you guys before, but.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Dan Ryan: We've been tracking this one metric forever. And then, when I did the redid, the math.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Dan Ryan: In light of the supplement, and and you know my goals for the year, or whatever. I realized that.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Dan Ryan: The well. I don't know if I told you this, but this is what I realized was that the number that we were tracking before was a number that I came up with when we launched. The business as a subscription.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Dan Ryan: So at the time it was a key performance indicator. It was like, I need to hit this number.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Tina Marie: Um.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Dan Ryan: And then I know that this worked. I know that I'm on track. To get the business to where we were before we launched a subscription.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Dan Ryan: So then we've been tracking that ever since. Then when I and and we used it um.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Dan Ryan: And but it it led us astray. Sort of it led us astray, like 2 years ago, with like that number started dropping.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Dan Ryan: And I was the only one that was like, Hey, there's something going on here. And then it was like. You know, borderline not catastrophic, but.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Dan Ryan: The compounding effect of that number going down was like. Terrible over the long term.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Dan Ryan: And then we rebounded, or whatever, and then I redid the math this year, and I realized oh, no, no, no! That while that that's like a guiding metric, right? And and it was really a guiding metric from the beginning. I just didn't view it like that in the beginning it was.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Dan Ryan: Guiding me to. Hey? If you do this, you're going to get that. But it wasn't a performance metric per se.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Dan Ryan: The performance. Metric is the number of subscriptions we add per day. So Bobby sent the report this morning, and the report is the guiding metric, and I was like.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Dan Ryan: A he. He sends that and another number. And I was like, Dude. What is this other number? Because now I'm looking at it, and I don't really know. Is is it this or is it that? And it's.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Dan Ryan: Actually neither. So I was like, all right, we just need to get rid of that one, because that one doesn't matter at all. It's neither guiding. Nor is it performance.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Dan Ryan: And we need to look at this other number. So here. While this is a number timed to getting paid.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Dan Ryan: When Mark said, gets more policy limits. I'm like, Okay. Is time to getting paid. Really a guiding metric.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Dan Ryan: Or is performance metric.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tina Marie: It is.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Dan Ryan: And is the performance metric. The number, the percentage of policy achieved.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Dan Ryan: That's what it sounds like to me that this is.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tina Marie: Well, there, there's there's more, and I'll and I'll tell you why. They make a difference. Um so.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Tina Marie: In in breaking down what has to happen in the case. So so we've got lots of different things. And you could tell me whether it's performance or guiding. I don't really care about that, although I get it, and it should. But but I'll I'll.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Tina Marie: We can help define it. But I'll tell you why it matters so much. Because going into both Patrick and Lorenz's cases.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Tina Marie: Forensically, looking at. All the notes and what was happening across the team and the people is there were gaps.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tina Marie: Huge gaps in conversations, and the case not getting followed up with. So we got primary, secondary, tertiary impact of that right and consequences.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Tina Marie: So primary is obvious. The case takes longer.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Tina Marie: Secondary is, if the case takes longer than we get. It takes longer to get paid and get that money back that we're investing in.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Tina Marie: But we still get paid. But the other thing and hang on because it's gonna switch to.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Tina Marie: My phone. So I'm just gonna do this manually real quick. Where the heck is zoom.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Tina Marie: Zoom uh. Okay, so.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Tina Marie: The other thing that would happen, though. Um and this is important is that. We would get people complaining about not getting contact.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Tina Marie: Did. And this is still happening. Obviously. Um, and just.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Tina Marie: Where's my attorney? They're mia. Nobody is responding to me, and that kind of stuff comes out in Google reviews which obviously affects brand reputation and acquisition. So it goes.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Tina Marie: It's all. Hold on one sec. So it goes full circle.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Tina Marie: Um. And then what we found out, though. Is.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Tina Marie: Lorenz and Patrick, both. We're not good at case review, and when I say not good, I mean inconsistent.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Tina Marie: It wasn't top of mind. It was, it really was not top of mind for either one of them. It was shocking.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Tina Marie: Um. They did it, but they didn't have a schedule for it. They didn't have a system for it, a requirement, hey? Or or even huge priority.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Tina Marie: It was basically a reactive kind of thing that was happening. Um. So that was a big issue.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Tina Marie: And then, when they actually did review it, what they would find is weak spots. So the opposite of the bright spots, right. Where certain people on the team.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Tina Marie: Had certain things that they just. Didn't do well, whether it was following up with particular types of clients.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Tina Marie: Or particular types of situations. But there were patterns that had emerged in that.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Tina Marie: So what?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Dan Ryan: Um. Well, tell me what case review is, because I have no idea.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Tina Marie: It's looking at the case to see where it's at and what's been going on with it. What's happened? Yes.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Dan Ryan: During. Okay. And that's something they do.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Dan Ryan: In on some sort of schedule, or should be.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Tina Marie: Should should. But it wasn't happening any kind of consistently.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Dan Ryan: Okay, yeah, yeah. Got it.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Tina Marie: Um if you would if I asked their perspective of it, you know. Yes, it's a thing that we do. Roughly about this. Not every week, not every Monday, not at least once a month, or at least it was.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Tina Marie: Very kind of nonspecific, which was seriously problematic.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Dan Ryan: Got it.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tina Marie: When that was identified. And identified as a problem.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Tina Marie: So part of the issue was. They? They didn't have a good system for reviewing the cases. It was just this broad, sweeping view of what was happening.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Tina Marie: Without looking for a particular thing that stood out right. So there was a lot of overwhelm, because there's 200 cases roughly.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Tina Marie: And a lot of data to process rather than going into the case and specifically looking for. What happened last? What happened next?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Tina Marie: But what we also did was write out all of the steps of the case. So part of the issue was, there are a lot of things for them to keep track of mentally.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Tina Marie: And there's no checklist. Which means that you're.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Tina Marie: Counting on human memory. Which is, you know, prone to failure.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Tina Marie: Especially when it's overwhelmed with all these things all the time. Ah! To remember this is the next step.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Tina Marie: So what you have is somebody sitting there staring at the screen, going? Okay, what should I do next? Or taking again the path of least resistance, picking whatever's just right in front of them.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Tina Marie: Rather than the thing that should be prioritized because of kpis. Or something like that. So.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tina Marie: The job was getting done, but there was no really systematic approach to it. It wasn't based on priority. It wasn't based on.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Tina Marie: Impact to finances. It was just.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Tina Marie: Robotic kind of show up. And these are the things I do, because these are the things I do. Not because this is the thing that's going to have the biggest impact. You know what I'm saying.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Tina Marie: So Lorenz's numbers, as you can see.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, so, yeah.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Tina Marie: Have improved. And hold on a second.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Tina Marie: So hold on a second. We gotta take out the outliers. I gotta go back to this.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Tina Marie: It's not really that it's improved right because it. The number has gotten longer. But Samantha so, and then I. And then there's other things to take into account. All of their caseloads increased because we've been growing the business.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Tina Marie: So they're doing more. So one of the things we don't know is, what is the. I don't know how to say this, but.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Tina Marie: Threshold right so of pressure. How without a system. If, let's say, Samantha's system is just.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Tina Marie: Sit down, hustle, get it done right. But it's not strategic. It's just. Working really, really hard, and that works well to a certain extent. But when you start to add capacity.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Tina Marie: An increased capacity. That requires a system to be able to maintain quality.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Tina Marie: My premise is that. There's not a great system. There was just drive.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Tina Marie: And youth, and vigor and consistency. Without a systematic.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Tina Marie: Application to the process. And so when we increased the case volume.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Tina Marie: We increased. How long it took to. Get the cases handled just because, again, no checklist, no process, no system.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Tina Marie: Just these are the things that have to get done. These are the calls that are coming in. These are the calls that are on my desk. This is what's going to get done. Meaning.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Tina Marie: How many of these cases were just neglected, or how much of this time is because. A few cases got neglected.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Tina Marie: And the rest got handled. Well. But we don't know but that's my point. None of this is really having great oversight.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Tina Marie: And if it did, I think that. I also think we could. We could have them be less stressed. Mark.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tina Marie: I think if they were just. Open to it. I know Samantha is not open in general.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Tina Marie: Um. But maybe she is. If you approach her and say, I think this will cause less stress. If we try it this way, would you? You know.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Tina Marie: Be willing to do an experiment for 90 days if it meant that. We didn't have to reduce Caseload, and you felt less stressed, and you got paid more.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Tina Marie: Does that make any sense.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
mark sweet: Yes, it does if they were willing, which we've seen so far. The answer that is, they're not.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Tina Marie: But a lot of that is approach and presentation. Even that has to be strategic.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
mark sweet: Right.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Tina Marie: And I don't know. How it's been handled, and you know, if it was presented in the best way.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Tina Marie: But I don't even think we had the best plan in the future. In the past. I think that we do.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Tina Marie: Have a better one. Now. Because of the work that's been done. It was helpful to Patrick. It was helpful to Lorenz.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Tina Marie: You know. Maybe there's something that could be helpful to Samantha if we. Wrap it in a way specifically to.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Tina Marie: Whatever her objections would be.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
mark sweet: Wonder if Tyler would be the. More logical, next choice, instead.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, I mean, if you get everybody but Samantha.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
mark sweet: Because if Tyler and the Rans.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
mark sweet: And Patrick girl saying something. Maybe then she'll listen.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tina Marie: Right. Especially when you show the numbers.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Tina Marie: Like. Look, you were our top performer. But your cases, your time to close time to paid whatever increased by 33 days. Lorenz was always, like our.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Tina Marie: Tortoise basically right. His, only increased by 14 days, and not even in a full 14.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Tina Marie: So obviously something's changed, and his Christ load also increased. Um and.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Tina Marie: So the other number that we need to know that is really pertinent to this whole formula is. Percentage of attorney fees collected.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Tina Marie: So percentage of cases that get. Full attorney fees.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Tina Marie: Because when you stack those 2 together. If he outperformed that.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Tina Marie: And this. Clearly, something's working.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Tina Marie: So. But we need to be able to have that data and trust it. Before, and it can't be guesses, so we cannot trust trust guesses.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Tina Marie: Whether you have to go get that manually, or you know. Delegate it to somebody to get it manually, or we can get a reliable report. That is information we absolutely have to have. That's why we built the dashboard, but it's not been reliable.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Dan Ryan: Well, so this also. So I mean again, I don't really understand case view. But I'm assuming case review is more.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Dan Ryan: There. It's more important in. Like, Po, I'm gonna say.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Dan Ryan: Post, or at least from the lawyer's perspective. Case reviews, more important post.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Dan Ryan: Treatment being completed. Right? Cause. Okay, perfect. That's great.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Tina Marie: No, no.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
mark sweet: No, no.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Dan Ryan: So then we go back to the thing that we talked to Josh about where you define the steps which I'm guessing you can do now. Right. There's the steps of a case.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Dan Ryan: And then, as they move through that, Josh was saying that you can do start date, end date, and then that lets you know. You could do an analysis and say.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Dan Ryan: I have no idea what the steps are, but. You know. 3, 4. If your cycle's 9 months, 1 9 month cycle.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Dan Ryan: Right. That's gonna be. You know ship.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Dan Ryan: 300 cases. Right? It's a fairly good data point. But then that number goes up every month.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Dan Ryan: And month 1112, 13. So you would look at it and say, Okay, the average case, whatever it is. You know, unless and until but as it's it, the number will become more real over time, like it does with the subscription.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Dan Ryan: Spends this amount of time in step one. This amount of time in step 2. This amount of time in step 3. And then how.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Dan Ryan: A case is um. Case, whatever it's called. Again, case review is done.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Dan Ryan: You can see like. This is how many touch points should happen in this section, or you could define that right? So when they do, case review.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Dan Ryan: You can have like a red, yellow, green. Like, hey, these cases are red.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Dan Ryan: Because they're in step 3 and. X or y, or z did not occur.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Dan Ryan: Um. It's just a matter of sort of defining that. Just like in a spreadsheet, or in a document, or whatever.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Dan Ryan: And then creating those stages in lidify. And then using the in and out dates like Josh talked about.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Dan Ryan: And then case review becomes very systematic. Not only that Mark would then have this overall sweet love view of like.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Dan Ryan: How many of my cases are in stage 2, stage 3. Because this metric here of time to case or time to.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Dan Ryan: Turn, to, paid. Then becomes uh.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Dan Ryan: You know, it's a guiding metric. But then it's also predictive. Right? So then you can start to say, well, my average case is whatever. I've got this many cases in Stage 5. There, that means they're all going to settle in 60 days, because that's how long stage 6 and 7 takes, so I already know that my revenue in.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Dan Ryan: 2 months from now is going to be my average time. However, many number of cases are in that stage. Regardless of outliers. Right outliers just change the whole thing.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Dan Ryan: But then it becomes very systematic, and it becomes. I would say ease so, and it's not a matter of.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Dan Ryan: Them changing what they do. It's a matter of the system. Sort of being built on top of what's if they're already all doing it. You're not asking them to change anything.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Tina Marie: Thank you.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Dan Ryan: You're just saying, Hey, I'm giving you a better view. This many of your cases are in Stage 3, which is treatment, or whatever the hell it is.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:44.000
mark sweet: The the question. The issue, though, is, is that going to invite more. Phone calls, more issues for people to reach out like, what does that mean? What's going on with it and creating more headaches, more problems where.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Dan Ryan: They don't know.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
mark sweet: Poking the bear may not be the best thing.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Dan Ryan: No, but they don't know. This is all internal stuff. Right, so.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
mark sweet: Oh, if it's internally yes, that makes some sense I was talking about externally.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, it has nothing to do. No, it's all internal, but then it could be.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Dan Ryan: The question is, if you do it, do those issues become lessened. Because people are, they learn the system, and they go. Oh.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Dan Ryan: Like, and I don't know if it could go to this degree, but. If you could have.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Dan Ryan: Last touch point right. If the teams. The intake team. We know uses lead flowy. But the case management team is 100% lidify based.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Dan Ryan: So there's a trigger in there that says up contacted. That's going to affect the colorization of that thing. So if they're stage 2 yellow.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Dan Ryan: It means, hey? They haven't been contacted in. Let's say 2 weeks is bad. They haven't been contacted in 2 weeks.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Dan Ryan: So then the lawyer, the the lawyer, doing case management, or case review on ah, on. A Monday. Right? They do case reviews on Monday they go. Oh, I got 4 yellows. You guys got to make sure that these suckers are green. By the end of the week.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Dan Ryan: Right, so you would never do. Case review on a Friday. You do it on a Monday. And then, you know, you start to recommend those things. But really they'll start to see the red, yellow, green, and then.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah, it'll be kind of maybe bad for the people that are. Their cases are all over the place right away. But. It would be quickly corrected, especially if they're just delegating it to the team.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Dan Ryan: Like, Oh, hey! And they know exactly what to tell them. You need to contact these 5 people. And then boom! The thing gets resolved.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Dan Ryan: Or that the color gets resolved. But then you're then you're starting to accrue these metrics again. It would take 9 months to get your fur. Well, 10 months.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Dan Ryan: To get your 1st round. But then that data becomes more and more valuable over time. It's like.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Dan Ryan: That's why I'm able to do the shit that I do, because I've got 6 years worth of data. And I go. Okay. This looks good. This looks bad.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Dan Ryan: This is, these are the. These are the numbers we're shooting for. And then, you know, other shit will come from that, because.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Dan Ryan: You're you'll have this data, and then you can start tying it to other things like. The app, the um.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Dan Ryan: You know, if you could ever tie it to. An insurance company, or you could tie it to an adjuster, or you could tie it to whatever like. I don't know.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Dan Ryan: You don't need that stuff. It's just like, oh, those things. Become visible because you've.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Dan Ryan: Like, what's this is becoming visible? Because what we're looking at on the screen right now. Right. It's like, Oh.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Dan Ryan: Yeah. Okay, well, how do you? How do you make this more valuable? How do you make this? How do you systematize it? Right? It's anything that you do repeatedly. Can be systematized. But 1st you have to look at it and go well. What um! What are we even doing.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
mark sweet: Let me talk to Isaac to figure out. How we can do this.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:58.000
mark sweet: So just be based on the last activity date, which I know is a field. So we should be able to prove that. So let me talk to him and see what we can.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
mark sweet: Do. Because ideally, it'd be based on.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
mark sweet: Phone call or. Text, but we can always resort back to.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
mark sweet: It's every day.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Tina Marie: So. Hold on total number of cases.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Tina Marie: 2, 1, 9, 95. Yeah, I really want to have. Oh, that's um number of cases. That's that's.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Tina Marie: Regardless of outliers. Right? That's all cases. Period.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
mark sweet: Great. Okay. Um. I apologize. I was talking to Isaac before I forgot.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
mark sweet: The number of cases.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Tina Marie: That's all cases they're like. Outliers are irrelevant there, right? That's so. That's.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
mark sweet: Correct. Yeah.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Tina Marie: So Samantha had. So her trajectory right.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Tina Marie: She's got 95 cases right now, I assume that's open.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
mark sweet: No, these are settled. This is the number of settled cases.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tina Marie: This this year, okay.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
mark sweet: So if you did like 95 times the 14,000 blah blah, you'd find out how much she brought in so far this year.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Tina Marie: So something else we need to see is how many cases they have open. Because what we're trying to figure out is.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Tina Marie: What is the issue? I guarantee you. Systems and processes is part of the issue.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Tina Marie: But another part of the issue is is definitely going to be capacity. But.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Tina Marie: Um. That capacity is.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Tina Marie: It's gonna be individual. It'll be. It'll also be team based.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Tina Marie: And. The.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Tina Marie: So how much of Samantha's. I'll say degradation in stats.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Tina Marie: Is a result of. Workload, and how much of that is workload, because there are no systems.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Tina Marie: Or workload just because she's overwhelmed. And can't mentally process it regardless.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Tina Marie: Unless she has highly systematized. Her ability to process the volume, whatever it is.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Tina Marie: Will improve. With better systems. That is the point of them. It is to reduce the mental load.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Tina Marie: Required to perform the tasks. Because there is finite mental ability.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Tina Marie: It's a fixed amount. Varying day by day, but.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Tina Marie: But once it's tapped it's tapped. So it doesn't matter if we keep getting more cases if she's tapped. If her team is tapped.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Tina Marie: Right which is going to change by health. What's happening at home.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Tina Marie: How many people are out, what kind of cases we have so many different things. All of it is improved by system, so we already know Samantha is resistant to it.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Tina Marie: Right, but. These stats are kind of hard to deny, and.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Tina Marie: If she wants a referral from you, going somewhere else like. Getting less.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Tina Marie: You know, if we were just to look at just the numbers right? You and I both know we all know. That one way or another this is impacted because volume has increased.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Tina Marie: She did also go through a divorce, and things started dipping at that point. We didn't really track it. From that point, but.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Tina Marie: That also aligned with increased volume. The reason I'm even having this conversation, Mark, is because.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Tina Marie: We need to figure out the way to get Samantha on board to stop thinking she could just do whatever or go get a job somewhere else, and also. You need to understand that.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Tina Marie: And and and find a way to um. Make sure that she's aware that. You don't just jump ship and everything be okay somewhere else you're starting over. She could be not top dog in a new place.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Tina Marie: Like she's kind of top dog here. Does she want to go? Be bottom of the barrel? Does she want to go. Have to compete super hard. Does she want to go work for somebody who's not as.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Tina Marie: Kind and lenient and understanding, and supportive like. You know.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Tina Marie: I don't think that. I think she understands she'd have to be stupid to just think that she could just go.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Tina Marie: Get another job. And you know, you just. Grass is green, or whatever she she can't be. That dumb.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Tina Marie: Especially after going through a divorce. The the roots of.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Tina Marie: The community at Sweet Law has to have some impact on her. So I think that you're.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Tina Marie: Adding fear or increasing fear. Um, that isn't really there.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Tina Marie: And basically, we just have to formulate the idea in a way that number one, you stop being the resistance. So that you stop projecting it, and then we come up with a way to.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Tina Marie: Um suggest something that doesn't just make Samantha perform better, so that Sweetlaw can get paid more. But make her life easier.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Tina Marie: Because we create systems that help her not drain her brain so much. And her teams and make her not have to micromanage.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Tina Marie: Like that is the point of what we're doing. It's not creating more work. It is different, and in the beginning.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Tina Marie: The change is more work. But not long after that it becomes less work.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Tina Marie: It becomes easier. Yeah, that's huge. Look at that.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Tina Marie: She's got a lot of cases. There's no way that doesn't.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000
mark sweet: Yeah, similar to Tyler. I mean 3, 14 versus 3, 10. I'm not gonna. You pick.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Tina Marie: Yeah.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
mark sweet: Lorenz and Pat have significantly less.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Tina Marie: Yes, right. And so, Tyler, what was like? Could you go year to date to see. How many cases Samantha had open at this time last year.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
mark sweet: No.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Tina Marie: And Tyler see, we should be able to know that what cases were opened by attorney at this time last year.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:54.000
mark sweet: No. I don't know how our system could pull that.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Tina Marie: I'm not saying it can. I'm just saying like that should be something that we knew so that we could look at things like this. Year over year.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Tina Marie: Um, but. Tyler's difference. He went from.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:18.000
mark sweet: I mean, I can look at how many cases they got each month, or all of last year, or from January 1st to May 12. I I can pull that. But yeah.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Tina Marie: Yeah, so, Tyler, though. Went from days to close, from 326 to 428.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Tina Marie: He more than a year longer, and if you take out the outliers. It's still.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Tina Marie: Almost 80 days longer, like 75 days longer.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Tina Marie: What the hell's going on there like? Were you aware of that? If we didn't do this you would not be aware of that.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
mark sweet: Yeah.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Tina Marie: Just about bet you. Right.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:56.000
mark sweet: We know that Tyler is one of the slowest, as part of his negotiating sometimes is to wait until a new adjuster gets. But on a case that definitely slows down cases.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so is this something you're gonna look at and go like, well, that's cool. I don't want to lose an attorney. So I'm gonna let them take 80 days longer to close cases.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:16.000
mark sweet: No, I think it's a good starting point to talk to them about. Look, here's where you were last year. Here's where you are this year. What's going on? What can I do to get you back to where you were? Or, better.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Tina Marie: Right. And that's really the. The thing is like, what do you think is happening? And how can we support you?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000
mark sweet: Although theoretically, I would take an 80 day trade off for a 25% increase of average fee.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Tina Marie: Yes, that's huge. Also, that's huge. And and I would point that out. But.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Tina Marie: So like. Hey! I was looking at your stats and noticing this like. This went crazy like way longer. But also look at your average fees. That's amazing.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tina Marie: What do you think is happening like, are you? Did you? Did you try something new, like what's going on. And just leave it open, ended, and be quiet, and if they're like I don't know.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Tina Marie: 1st of all, that's an issue that that wasn't on purpose. But there may be something that they did kind of subconsciously, or somebody on the team, or they happen to observe something. Say, okay, well.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Tina Marie: These are significantly different stats. Good and bad, right on the average sea level. Definitely good.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Tina Marie: On taking longer definitely. Not good. But if again, like you, said the trade-off. So let's dig into this. What? What could we identify? It.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Tina Marie: There's got to be something that didn't just happen. So can we also.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Tina Marie: Because. 2024 to 2025, and we're halfway through. Is not that big.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Tina Marie: Can we do this? And the answer should be, Yes, not. It's a pain in the ass. Get the numbers for 2023, also.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Tina Marie: The longer we have historical data. The more we actually can see what's happening on a pattern.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Tina Marie: And we'll have a better idea of the correlation between Caseload. And whatever else is happening.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:20.000
mark sweet: So yes, I can definitely do 2023. I can definitely do the raw data. Like very easily um to take out. The outliers have to literally go through case by case, and then.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Tina Marie: Mhm. If you will output the raw data and share that with me, I will help.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:29.000
mark sweet: Takes. So the run deal, okay, yeah, we'll figure it out.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Tina Marie: Okay. This you. You see the value in this right.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
mark sweet: Oh, yeah, no. Definitely.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Alright. Um! Let me go back to my list of stuff real quick. Things. I wanted to talk to you about.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Tina Marie: Second voice. No, we did that. It was. There was something else, the call control. Um.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
mark sweet: So Patsy's back. Finally.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
mark sweet: So one of the things I had her do on top of all this was, listen to phone calls and grade them.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Right.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:13.000
mark sweet: So Jose and mia got pays. Elva got a B.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
mark sweet: As volume where you got C's.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Tina Marie: Oh!

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000
mark sweet: Angeles say, got like a C minus. And Marco got. Maybe.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
mark sweet: B minus c, plus.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so. How did we score that? Where's that information? Where's that report?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
mark sweet: There is no report.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Tina Marie: So she just picked a letter.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
mark sweet: There's no report in lidify. Um, so.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tina Marie: No, I've never did. So did Patsy take notes on the calls.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
mark sweet: Yes.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Tina Marie: Where are those notes?

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
mark sweet: Oh, Oscar, to resend it, cause we just literally sat there and talked about each one.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Tina Marie: Did you record that conversation.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
mark sweet: That I had with Patsy. Now.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Tina Marie: Okay. If in the future record those conversations, if you're analyzing something with someone. Because then we can go pull out that, bring it to our conversations and go okay.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Tina Marie: How is that relevant to what we're talking about? How do we track something? How do we create a simple system. Right. That doesn't create much resistance. We already know there's going to be some.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Tina Marie: But if we can reduce the resistance and make it an acceptable level. Of change and implement it.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Tina Marie: Which again, should not be the way that we're approaching it. But. It is um. Then what can we do with that? So.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Tina Marie: Whatever you can recall from that conversation, plus whatever those notes. And if it's easier for you to just.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Tina Marie: Tell me on a call, and I zoom record it, or you put it into, you know a voice memo, and I get the transcript either way. There will be something.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Tina Marie: Identifiable as what we can measure or what we can look at. Intake has been this.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Tina Marie: Blob amorphous thing, really, that has no. Definition, no way to change it.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Tina Marie: And for all this time for 4 years now we've been working together. So.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Tina Marie: We've we've learned that there are things that we can do. But we have to.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Tina Marie: Understand them and then measure them and apply them. So that's a good starting point. That review whatever she used to.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Tina Marie: Come up with a score whatever notes that she has. If you'll share that with me, then I will.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Tina Marie: I will formulate questions for you from there, so that you're not trying to figure out how to solve all these things by yourself. Because you do have so much to do.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Tina Marie: Do you need a reminder to send that to me?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
mark sweet: No.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Thank you. And then.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Tina Marie: One second. Got that we got that we got that we got that.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Tina Marie: And that. So, Walker, let's see, concerns get to Washington, due to lead quality issues, and Missouri is not performing.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Tina Marie: How are Walker leads doing it? Doesn't, I mean. The stats for this week weren't great.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Tina Marie: Or last week, I guess. Month to date. Basically.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Tina Marie: Anything you observed with Walker. And the changes that we're making.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
mark sweet: It started really slow, which is super frustrating.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Tina Marie: Yeah. Um. So is that gonna be just a wait and see, or are you gonna pick up the phone and be like.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Tina Marie: What's up?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
mark sweet: No, I've gotten them pretty much immediately that the number of leads wasn't where it needed to be.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Alright!

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.000
mark sweet: Let me trying to pull how many weeks it was. So. Bear with me for a second.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Tina Marie: Mhm.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
mark sweet: So since the 1st we've had 25 leads.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Tina Marie: And how many. So because we get a retainer report and not a lead report that doesn't really mean anything to me.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Tina Marie: I don't. I have nothing to measure and compare that to.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
mark sweet: Yep.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Tina Marie: What? But you look at that. Don't you.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:24.000
mark sweet: Yeah. So let's see. Out of this 25, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
mark sweet: 7 of them have converted.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Tina Marie: Okay, so again. And I say again, because, like, we've had these conversations before, but not looked at it. It's really conversion rate.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Tina Marie: So how many leads are we getting? What is the current version rate across vendors. Across states.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
mark sweet: So generally, Walker has been closer to 20%. So we're at 28%, which is good.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Tina Marie: Okay.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:59.000
mark sweet: We technically are even higher than that, because one's investigator set one's waiting for document investigator sent. Should sign. There's not a reason.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.000
mark sweet: Shouldn't. So if I change that to 8 out 25, then. Or at 32%. So we're actually doing well.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Tina Marie: Do we have a reliable report where we can look at this? We did build it. I don't know that it's reliable.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
mark sweet: I I don't know if it's reliable or not anymore. Like half the stuff we build sometimes works, and sometimes it doesn't.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.000
mark sweet: So it I don't have a good answer for you, and it's a frustrating thing to say, because we keep trying to build these things, and they just. Sometimes work, and sometimes don't.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Tina Marie: So. Yeah.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.000
mark sweet: I know this is one of the things Josh was working on, and then it kind of like disappeared.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Tina Marie: Disappeared. Yeah, but honestly. But, Isaac, said he, you know I don't know what his workload is, but he seems to feel like.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Tina Marie: He's confident that he understands things, that the the thing that he went through was the same thing. Josh went through. And and that he'd want to spend some time on it.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Tina Marie: I'd be happy to have a conversation with you and Isaac, or just me and Isaac, so I can understand what he understands. Meaning like, ask him questions, and if he goes I don't know but he goes. Oh, we could probably. Do you know what I mean? Gauge his understanding.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Tina Marie: Um, and then work with them directly, because you have them internally. What's that.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Dan Ryan: 400. Or hired Josh's sidekick that he offered.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Tina Marie: I'd rather have it internally. We've got more access.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Dan Ryan: I'd rather have it.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, regardless. I'd like an answer to my question.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
mark sweet: He's been busy right now with the new space, but that's gonna be winding down pretty. Surely.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tina Marie: Um. Could you be a little more specific about what you think shortly? Is. Maybe days, weeks, months. I don't know.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000
mark sweet: Don't know how much more there is left for him to do, so. It shouldn't take him more than another. Week.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Tina Marie: Okay. Well, because Josh are are. Josh Isaac already knows us, and what we're tracking and what we're doing.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Tina Marie: I'd rather start with Isaac, I said. Josh. I met Isaac. Um.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Tina Marie: Because I think that's a faster start period. If he's available to have a conversation in another week or 2.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Tina Marie: Would be probably much faster to get where we're going than to. Bring somebody new in.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
mark sweet: That makes sense to me.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Tina Marie: Okay, we're at the hour. Um. Does anybody have any questions or something they want to bring up or bring up for next week?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Dan Ryan: Hope you all bought your Bitcoin Bull Run, starting.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
mark sweet: Nice.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tina Marie: Other than that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Dan Ryan: Nope, that's it. I'm watching it right now.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Tina Marie: We expect the full report there, Dan.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Dan Ryan: Going, all in.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Tina Marie: Alright. Um okay, then we'll end. I'm gonna get some notes together, and then.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Tina Marie: Waiting for some things back from you, Mark. I probably will just send an email about what I'm waiting for. Just to make sure that we're both on the same page about that.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
mark sweet: Okay, all the notes from Patsy pretty shortly. She's just at lunch right now, but. Look at it as soon as she's back.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tina Marie: Awesome. Alright guys. Oh, we'll talk to you later. Bye.
