https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHJaulwEmVc

Transcript:
(00:02) Today I'm going to show you how to basically automate anything with this brand new browser use agent. So for example here we've got claw desktop open and if we say right okay search my browser uh for the prices of the S&P 500. Right. And essentially what we've got here is a MCP agent that can open our browser and then start using it.
(00:33) So as an example, Here's an example. So we said open my browser and check the price of the MC S&P 500. Right? And you see here it used browser navigate to have a look and search for that using our S&P. So let me show you an example. There we go. It's using browser navigate MCP. And then if we check in the background over here, you can see that it's actually navigated to browser use agent.
(01:24) So it can use the browser in the background to navigate and search stuff. So if we go back inside here and we say right, okay, open my browser and check the latest headlines for AI news, right? And so we've got Claude desktop over here. And Claude Desktop is going to browse the web inside Claude Desktop and then give us the results, right? And I'll show you exactly how to set this up for free in a second. So it's now browsing the web.
(01:54) It's looking for AI news. You can see an example right here. It's pulling in those headlines and boom, we're good to go. Now it's browsing the web, navigating through Reuters.com. And again, this AI agent is not just easy to use, it's also super fast and it's completely free to use. So, it's absolutely crazy how powerful it is and how easy it is to set up.
(02:18) I'll show you how to set up in a second, but you can see essentially here. Here's how it's working, what it's doing, etc. It's navigating our browser, looking at our browser in the background, and searching for whatever we want. So, I'm just going to stop that for now. But you see how easy this is to set up.
(02:33) And now, I'm going to run through exactly how to install it. So, if you want to install this bad boy, basically what you're going to do is you're going to go over to let me show you. Here we've got the notes inside the AI success lab. So, you're going to go to docs.browser. browsermcp.io io and this is basically a free MCP server that you can set up to browse your web and it's using claw desktop to do it right so really easy and simple and then you can click on install in the top right and basically what you're going to get here is the MCP
(03:24) server configuration now when you're setting this up essentially you would just grab this code so you can just copy this I'll put it inside the AI success lab link in the comments description if you want to get this stuff just for free and you just want to steal it for me and and copy and paste this stuff. There you go.
(03:52) So, you can just copy and paste this if you want to. And essentially, you're going to go into Claude. Make sure you've got developer settings set on. So, allow developer settings. Then you're going to click on developer, open MCP log file, and you can see the details of the MCPS you're using.
(04:10) Right now, inside Claude desktop, what you want to do is go over to Claude in the navigation menu. Then you're going to click on settings and then inside your settings. You're going to go to developer and you can see the MCPS I've got installed. Now, if you want to install MCPS on claw desktop, pretty simple.
(04:31) So you edit the config file like this. You can just open it with text edit and then you can install whatever you want. So inside my settings I have browser MCP set up. I also have Apple script set up as well. And I'll come on to exactly how these can work side by side because it's pretty crazy. And then we have like the basic settings for MCP servers.
(04:52) Now if you want to just steal that configuration from me and again these are all free MCPS. You don't have to pay for them. then I will include that inside the AI success lab as well. So you can just steal my full MCP setup if you want to. All right. And what this can essentially allow you to do is not just navigate the web but also navigate your actual computer as well.
(05:12) So let me show you exactly what we're doing here. So before we get on to that, what I also want to show you is inside your settings. Once you've set up the MCP config file like so, you're just going to hit save like that. You've got your MCP settings inside here. You're going to close that and then you would restart Claude and that's when it's going to trigger the MCP settings.
(05:39) So pretty easy and simple to set up. And then once you've done this, we've now got two different MCP settings set up, right? So we've got Apple script and this can actually go straight inside your browser and start searching stuff. And then we also have sorry Apple script can connect to your laptop. So it can work internally with your laptop and everything that's on there.
(05:58) And then we also have browser's agent which can then surf the web for us, right? So we can do internal and external if that makes sense. And now you've allowed Claude to be like 10 times more powerful because it can interact with your laptop. It can interact with your browser etc. Okay. So for example here if we say okay what's my battery percentage it's going to use the Apple script MCP as you can see here.
(06:31) And you see here it says your battery is currently 96% and we can see that is indeed 96% in the top right right there. Right? So it's really easy to set this stuff up. Pretty crazy what you can do with it and it really doesn't take a long time. Right? All you have to do is allow the MCPS.
(06:49) Now if you want a full setup on MCPS and how to build them, etc. I've also got another training inside the AI success lab. Link in the comments description if you just want to steal this stuff from me. But essentially between the Apple script MCP and the browser use MCP you are absolutely flying my friends and it's incredibly easy to do. So let's keep going.
(07:07) Now what we're going to do from here is we're going to go back into Claude and we'll pull up example of what we can do here. So, I'm now going to say, okay, open my browser and post a cheeky tweet on Twitter. All right. And I'm just going to post this on a test Twitter account, not my main account. All right.
(07:33) About and we'll put about AI. Something like that. So, let's see if you can do that. So using browser navigate to navigate to the twitter.com page and you can see it is doing that over here. And then we just have to allow this MCP to use an external integration. So it says browser MCP review each action carefully before approving claw can guarantee blah blah blah.
(08:27) I'm going to click allow always. Obviously you use this at your own risk, right? And now it's opening up Twitter and it's navigating as you can see right here. So, this is the browse the the mouse that it's using to navigate around. It's going to compose a tweet. And what it's doing is actually if we click on the browser navigate tool here, it's actually like taking screenshots and just figuring out what's going on. It's like, right, great.
(09:29) Now I can see the tweet composed dialog is open. Let me type a cheeky tweet about AI. It's also got a browser wait function. So that allows it to wait before it starts posting. Let's try something else. So, we're
(10:46) going to say, okay, go to bolt new and give me a prompt to build an SEO tool. So, as you can see, it's now navigating to Well, don't you and then we've got the prompt that we
(12:02) can just check out. Right. So, so it navigated to bolt new, gave us the prompt, plugged it, and then we plug it in here to build out whatever tool we want. Right? So you can use this AI agent to instruct other AI agents and navigate to them and side by side you can do some pretty powerful stuff. Now also with the Apple script example, what we could even do for example is let's wait for that to load. So it's now coding out the tool.
(12:51) You can see the code over here. It's doing the data visualization. And again, I haven't paid to use this tool at all. When you're setting up the extension as well, so you do need the Chrome extension as you can see right here. And once you're setting that up, you just need to connect, right? So, for example, if we go to my extensions, click on browser KPI, we can say connect from this tab or focus on one connected tab, etc.
(13:21) Right? So that tool is now building out and it's pretty simple and easy. What we could also do is we could go back to bolt. We can take an example app that we've already built out. So we've got this example app. Um, what we can do is we could say to Apple script take a
(14:29) screenshot of my browser. and then give me some ideas on how I can improve this app built in Spanish C browser. So allow that to go. It's got a tool called browser screenshot. So, it's taken the screenshot and then it gives us some ideas on how to improve it. Switch to Spanish mode though for some reason, which is not ideal.
(15:26) I'm just going to be transparent with you there. I was going to say right in English, but it's basically taken a screenshot from the app that we've built as you can see inside bolt. And then it's given us some ideas on how we can improve that on the left hand side over here. Right? So it can read your screen, it can navigate, it can browse.
(16:05) It's not that great at interacting with social media platforms to be honest with you, but you get an idea and a feel of like how powerful this can be. And also it can interact like directly inside your laptop as well, right? So if we go inside here, we're using the Apple script MCP. We can say, right, okay, give me the last three files in my downloads from the last 24 hours, right? Something like that.
(16:40) And it's like, right, I'm going to check your downloads folder for most recent files from the last 24 hours using Apple script. It's setting up all the filters right here inside Finder. As you can see, and also there's a bunch of different prompts you can actually use with Apple Script. So if we go back inside a browser here and we'll go over to the clawed MCP section inside the ASS lab.
(17:26) Then from here we're just going to for example create one of these. So for example, show me all my files in my downloads folder for the past week. And you can see that's retrieved the information, right? So it's like right based on the information I've retrieved here are the most recent files downloaded in the last 24 hours and then it's found the examples of flow whisper that actually downloaded recently.
(17:53) Then we've also got two thumbnails for the live stream that I'm doing right now. Right? And so like it can interact with your browser with your local folders and you're basically making like a AI super agent that can interact with pretty much anything to get really good results. Right. Um, we got a question from Dennis Hugh, the legend, who says, "Can it make a list of all the podcasts I've been on, including yours?" Let's have a look.
(18:16) I'm pretty sure it could do something like that quite easily. So, let's try this out. We're going to say, "Right, open up my browser, find podcasts that Dennisu has been on recently, something like that. Let's see if it can work its magic on this. So, it's going to open up the browser.
(18:44) It's using browser navigate and it's searching on Google to do that. So, if we go over here, you can see it's searching. And if we pull this to the right hand side, you can see it's navigating and checking the recent podcast appearances. All right. And then it's also searching Dennis U podcast guest 2025 etc.
(19:15) You can see on the right hand side this is Dennis U and his podcast. And on the left hand side here's a list of his recent podcast. So let's pull this up and see if it's relevant. So it said recent Dennis U podcast appearances 2025. Shout out to Dennis. The Ask My Advisor Show. the local marketing secrets, speak with people, Neil Schaffer's podcast, etc.
(19:37) Even gives us the length as well. So, let's just check that now. I'm just going to copy that and then plug it into Chrome. See if we can find that. Um, there you have the podcast that it found. Right. So, this is the Dennis Hugh podcast that we were talking about with Neil Schaffer 10 months ago, so fairly recent.
(20:01) And that is definitely with Dennis Hugh as you can see. So any basic stuff like that, anything that you know an executive assistant for example would do, this can now do. And uh and it's automated. It's really really fast to do. So super powerful. I think like if you wanted a really comprehensive list, yeah, you could use deep research or something like that.
(20:27) I think there's a research option here. So you can just go inside Claude and and research like that. But yeah, essentially that's how you can use the MCP to do research, to post tweets for you, to check bolt new to check your apps and rebuild them, etc. Pretty much anything that you can think of you can now do with these MCPs and the interact both locally and also directly on the internet as well. It's crazy.
(20:50) They're liberated and autonomous. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to all the video notes from today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab link in the comments in description completely free. You can get all the notes from here. You can get the code that I've used to set all of this up. It is free to use inside Claude.
(21:08) And then additionally, if you want to upgrade and get, for example, an amazing community focused on making more money and saving time with AI, feel free to get that link in the comments description to the AI profit boardroom. Basically, if you want coaching, if you want support, if you want help implementing all this stuff, then feel free to check this out.
(21:26) This is an amazing, supportive community of great people who are focused on growing their business and scaling with AI. So, link in the comments description to the AI profit boardroom as well. And if you want to just get the free video notes plus links to everything, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab. So, I'm going to show you how to basically get Claude to create and copy almost any template you can find from NA10.
(22:28) Right? So, basically what Claude can now do using this process I'll show you is very specific and I'm going to show you step by step exactly how to set it up. It can now create agents like you can see right here that basically copy and paste and then you can paste those directly into NA10. Right? So as an example, this is one I actually built earlier.
(22:45) And if you want to build this out yourself, let me show you how. So we'll just delete that. And this Claude agent is custom trained on NA10's documentation to be able to build and copy paste NA10 templates. Right? So for example, I actually took a screenshot of this NA10 workflow that I wanted to replicate.
(23:05) Then I said recreate this workflow. And if we copy this information right here and then paste it directly into NA10, you can see that it basically creates a really simple workflow based on our screenshot. Right? So this was the original screenshot and this is the whole workflow. And you can see it's even added the same sticky notes inside the workflow.
(23:26) So we can easily just copy paste and replicate any NA10 workflow using this custom trained clawed project. Right? Here's another example. So if we grab this one, let's copy this. And then you can see this was one that you can easily build out. And yeah, it's a simple but powerful workflow. All right, I want to show you another one as well.
(25:08) So if we say for example create a AI voice agent for NA10 inside the NA10 JSON builder, it's now going to start coding out, right? So you can see it's thinking about it and it can basically produce like copy paste JSON code. Right? So the way this works is we've actually got this custom trained prompt over here.
(25:39) I'll put it inside the AI success lab. So you can get the prompt for free if you want to just steal this stuff from me. But basically we said you are an NA10 expert NA10 workflow generator. Your job is to create fully functional NA10 workflow JSON that can be directly pasted into NA10 to create working automations.
(26:06) JSON should be complete valid ready to use blah blah blah. Then we've included instructions on how to do that what to set up etc. the output format and the goal. Um that is directly inside the project details of this agent. Right. Now, what you can also see here is that we've attached information on the JSON uh cheat sheet for NA10 and also a bunch of other NA10 templates that it can learn from.
(26:43) Right? So, the way that this works is Let's take for example this information right here. Basically has documentation on exactly how to build out AI agents. Now I've attached that all inside the AI success lab. So you can just upload this knowledge if you want to. And essentially to set this up if you want to create a new project inside Claude that can build stuff like this.
(27:09) You just click on projects in the left hand side. Then you're going to click on new project. From here create project and then from here you're going to name your project right so for example claude n10 assistant right we'll create that project like so then from here inside the project knowledge we're going to upload from a device and I'm going to take that information that's inside the AI success lab and just upload that like so.
(27:40) What I also like to do is just upload a few NA10 template projects. So, I've actually got some of those inside the AI success lab. But if you want to see an example of how I do it, so we can type in Jason here. Scroll down, get the web scraper agent that I've previously done, grab the appointment set agent, upload those, and we're good to go. All right.
(28:06) Now if we go back inside here and let's say we want to replicate this particular agent, we can just take a screenshot of any N810 workflow that we want to replicate. Copy that image. Then we're going to go back into Claude and using the project and the project knowledge we've set up, we'll paste in that screenshot and we'll say replicate this into a JSON format for NAN. Crypto White Hat just tipped $5.
(28:50) Thank you very much, sir. Appreciate that. And Nicholas says, "This is scary. Reminds me of malware." I think you're referring to the MCPS I showed earlier. If that's the case, yeah, just use that stuff at your own risk. Um, you know, you do need to be careful what you install.
(29:07) I kind of show this stuff as a guinea pig, but obviously you do need to be careful in terms of what you build, how you build it, what you install, etc. And that's that's down to you and what you want to do, but I take the risk for you. So, now we're going to wait for this to load. And you can see it's basically building out the JSON format, right? Which is pretty cool because then you can copy and paste this stuff directly into NA10.
(29:32) So we're waiting for that to load right now. Like so. And then what you would do what you do is just copy and paste that in. Right. So for example, this is the original template, right? So this is the original template we took a screenshot of. As you can see inside Claude, here's the screenshot. And then if we go to overview, we'll leave without saving that. We'll create a new workflow.
(30:04) And then all we're going to do is take this information like so, copy it, go into claude, sorry, into N810, paste in that information, and boom, shakalaka, we've got the AI agent fully replicated. Right? So, we've got the outbound dial, the structured output passer, the open AI chat. That's you saw the original a second ago, which is this screenshot right here.
(30:31) And this is the workflow automation that's created. Right? Nice and simple. We could say as well like if we just want to add an extra option to that, we could say, okay, add a Google Sheets node to this too. So I can output the agent workflows, sheets, whatever. Right? And let's say you want to add an extra module to your NA10 template, but you don't want to add it manually.
(30:59) You want to get Claude to do it for you. Well, you can get Claude to put out the JSON like so. Now, one thing I want to say right here is like this has worked beautifully this time around, right? So, you can see that automation is actually is actually awesome. Like it looks really, really good.
(31:15) Um, I don't want to BS you though cuz sometimes it doesn't go that well. And if that's the case, you just need to tidy up. But what I will say is that typically it will give you the 8020, right? Right? So, it will give you like the 80/20 of the format and then you just need to make a few changes before you finally go live and test out.
(31:31) Right? But in terms of like adding the modules, setting all up, etc., it is quite easy to set up with this Claude AI assistant. And if you're wondering how do you set up, you create a new project, you insert the custom instructions from the AI success lab, you upload the knowledge inside the resources section, as you can see down here.
(31:51) And then from there, you are good to go with your NA10 agent. And what I'd recommend is that you don't necessarily describe what you want. Instead, what I'd recommend is that you actually take a screenshot of what you want and then replicate it that way. That seems to work a lot better, right? Because then it's got a visual understanding of what you want.
(32:09) Right? So, if we have a look, this is the new workflow from NA10, the Claude assistant. And then you can see here it's taken exactly the same workflow but this time it's added the Google sheet module as we requested. Right? So we've just literally copied and pasted that in. It's taken the Google sheet section like you can see that's all plugged in ready to go.
(32:32) And then we just need to map this out right and connect it to a Google sheet. But essentially that's how you can set up the whole process. Really easy to just copy paste and replicate almost anything that you want. I mean, if we go back to NA10 over here. All right. And then inside NA10, we're just going to go to templates and find like a a template that we could actually set up as an example.
(33:17) Then we're going to take this template like so. We'll copy that image as you can see. Then we're going to go back to Claude start new chat inside the project section. So let's find the N10 assistant. We'll paste that in and then we'll say recreate this. And literally, I would say in about 60 seconds, you're going to have your full JSON ready to go.
(34:01) Now, you might need to say in your instructions as well, just recreate this in JSON for NAN, etc. That's essentially it, right? Just going to go back to the original JSON builder. So, here we go. Paste that in. And then it's going straight into JSON as you can see. Right. So, it saves a lot of time, automates, replicates, copies and pastes for you.
(34:38) And you know, to be honest, like what you could even do, so you could link this to something like the MCP browser agent. So, I've got browser MCP there. I could go inside Claude like so. And I could say, right, create that JSON file inside the project section and then go to NA10 and paste it in as a new workflow.
(34:56) Right? You could probably fully automate that if you wanted to. I'm not going to do that in this video, but I just want to give you some ideas of what you could build, etc. So, if we just copy this JSON format from the JSON builder, then we're going to go over to NA10. We'll paste that in. And there we go. All right. The crazy thing as well is like if you actually compare them side by side.
(35:20) So, this is the original and this is the version that we created. This version actually looks a lot neater and nicer, right? Super neat. It's super tidy. It's got nice sticky notes there as well. The automation is fully linked together as well. And it was so easy to build that just using this custom NA10 project builder.
(35:40) That actually took me a few hours to figure this stuff out. But essentially, if you want to just steal it from me, take the custom instructions, take the custom knowledge inside the AI success lab. It is completely free. Link in the comments description. And then you can just grab this stuff from me. The other idea that I had as well was that what you can actually do is you could go to NA10 JSON builder like you can see uh sorry you can go to NA10 sorry you can go to claude projects then go to new project you know type in all the details
(36:12) you want right as an example and then we can actually take the official NA10 docs from GitHub and load that as knowledge inside claude right So, if we click on the plus sign under project knowledge over here, then we're going to type in GitHub, we'll click on link, hit the copy and pasteable GitHub URL, paste that in there, and then you can select which documents, which official documents from NA10's GitHub you want to custom train that Claude project on, right? and then you're probably going to get even better outputs because you're
(36:51) using the official documentation from NA10 to build out your copy and paste machine, right? But either way, you can now get your AI agents to build other AI agents and replicate any NA10 workflow that you want in a copy and pasteable format and it's completely free. It's crazy.
(37:12) So, feel free to get all my notes inside the AI success lab if you want to steal this stuff from me. Again, you really do need the knowledge, so you need to download that. Make sure you've got that plugged in as well. And that is free inside the AI success lab. If you want support and help and you want an amazing community of people all interested in in scaling and growing their business with AI, including using NA10 automations, then feel free to get the AI profit boardroom.
(37:36) This is an awesome community where you get DM support, you get weekly Q&A calls, you get a community you can post in and ask questions to, and there's 584 serious entrepreneurs trying to scale their business with AI. Feel free to get that link in the comments and the description. So today, what we're going to be looking at is the new feature of Quen that has just come out.
(38:25) And so Quen have just announced that Quen WebDev, which is kind of like a free alternative to Bolt, now allows you to deploy apps or whatever you create in one single click. Pretty crazy stuff. So let me show you an example of exactly how to do this for free. It's kind of like a free lovable free bolt example.
(38:45) So what we can do over here, we're just going to use Quen Max as an example, but you can use the latest models from Quen, which is Quen 3. And then inside here, we can then select webdev. All right, so we need to select webdev. And this is going to create like a canvas when we're creating our apps and our prompts, right? So if I go inside Quen 2.5 Max, select webdev.
(39:08) And then from here I'm going to say, okay, create a basic SEO cost calculator app. It's going to start building out for me. Now, not only is it going to code out the app, not only is it going to do it for free, but also we can actually deploy it, right? So, you can see there's now a new button called deploy where you can deploy whatever you create on a subdomain and then share it with people.
(39:37) So, let's have an example and run an example of what this can look like and how easy it is to use. So, we're waiting for the code to build out right now. And what we can actually do, this is going to be very interesting, is we can compare this side by side versus bolt in the meantime.
(40:16) Right? So whilst this is loading and building what if we want, we're going to go into bolt new and use exactly the same prompt and hit enter. So bolt new is a pay tool, lovable pay tool, etc. And now inside Quen, we're going to use this method. So let's just check this actually works. So it does. It's updating the total cost over here.
(40:33) Let's try again. We'll put 10 keywords. Total cost is updated. Beautiful. We can click those. Those work perfectly. And then what we're going to do from here is we're going to hit on deploy. All right. So, if we hit deploy over here, you can see the it gives you this deploy option and it says anyone with the link can access your chat messages will not be shared.
(40:54) Right? So, the privacy of your chat and how you built the tool will not be shared. But the actual deployment of the tool will be shared, right? And you can make this public or you can just say only you have access, right? But either way, we're deploying this towen. And it's completely free. So if we click on public now, we'll hit deploy like so.
(41:20) And then if we click on this link, we've now got the cost calculator fully embedded on a subdomain, right? And it took like two or three minutes to build out. How crazy is that? So, let's just check this works on the deployment. Yes, it does. Beautiful. We can select high, medium, low, etc. And now you can not just build your own SAS tools, not just do it for free, but also deploy it to the internet and share it.
(41:42) Right. So, if we actually open up a new incognito tab just to check this works. You can see this works beautifully. We've got the URL. Nobody needs to log in to use your tool. And you can just share it on the web openly, right? So easy. and bolt. New is still building this out whilst we've created a tool that actually works already.
(42:08) So if you're not using Quen, it is really really cool. I mean it can generate videos, images, all that sort of stuff as well. But the fact that you can actually use Quen to do this sort of stuff is is wild. Right now let's try something else. Quite interested to see this. So we're waiting for Bolt in the meantime. I'm going to test this against Gemini.
(42:29) So Gemini is another one of my favorite apps. The difference between Gemini and 2.5 Pro and using Quen is that Quen is free. All right. So for example, if we say, okay, create a basic SEO cost calculator app and we'll use Gemini as well. Right? In fact, we're going to we're going to switch this up. So I'm going to select canvas inside Gemini.
(42:49) And we're going to go with something a bit more advanced. So we say right okay create a app where I can paint and draw right so we're going to use that inside Gemini advanced and then we'll also do the same thing inside Quen and we'll see which one number one codesis and number two which one gives us the best outputs right so we're comparing Gemini versus Quen in the meantime as well we've also got bolt new coding out a tool as well.
(43:23) Now, here's what's crazy, right? So, bolt new exactly the same prompt. It's a paid tool. It hasn't actually published what we wanted it to, right? So, we've got a blank screen right there. We have to fix the errors. It's giving us errors straight away. Whereas inside Quen, we actually deployed and built this SEO cost calculator using exactly the same prompt, but it was way faster, right? And this doesn't cost us a penny.
(43:48) So, it's crazy to see. And also, we're using the old version of Quen. We're not even using Quen 3. We're just using Quen 2.5 Max to build this out. Um, so it's pretty wild. Now, let's just come back here. We're going to go back into Gemini and compare the output side by side. So, this is still coding. Now, we're going to click on preview for Quen.
(44:16) And you can see we've now got the app inside Quen. We can paint as we requested. We can change the brush size. There we go. We can clear the canvas and we can deploy that. All right. So, if we click on deploy over here, we've now got a subdomain where we can share this stuff too. Right. So, for example, if I go on to Twitter and I'm like, you know, check this bad boy out.
(44:44) I can now share my creation with the world and people can check it out. All right, actually works. There we go. Boom. Let's go inside Gemini and see what we got from Gemini. So, we can also deploy on a subdomain on Gemini as well. But the difference here is like you I'm using Gemini Advance, which is a pay tool, right? So, let's see what we get back inside Gemini. Here's a tool.
(45:12) I still think I mean if you compare them side by side right this is the tool from Quen this is the tool from Gemini Gemini is still way nicer right so Gemini 2.5 Pro is still much nicer when it comes to coding but if you want a free version then you would use Quen and it could do similar outputs right it's not quite I would put like this app from Quen is probably like a a seven out of 10 and this app from Gemini like a 9 out of 10, right? Cuz it's just a nice UI.
(45:44) It looks better. You can actually save what you create as well and download the image instantly, which is crazy. And all we did was say like just go off and do this, right? So, for example, if we put a little smiley face here, hit save, open that bad boy up, we've got the PNG file over here, right? So, Quen is not quite as advanced as Gemini, but still, for a free deployment, I'm pretty impressed. It looks pretty cool.
(46:11) Let's test it out. And there we go. Right. Clear fat canvas works perfectly. Now, going back to bolt, bolt didn't work at all. So, we can't deploy because we'd have to go back and forth with the errors, mess around there. I do like bolt as a tool, honestly. Like, it was it was the first mover in the industry, and I respect that.
(46:32) Um, but honestly, Quen and its deployment feature is a game changer. It's completely free and uh I would definitely recommend checking out. Here's an example what you can build.
