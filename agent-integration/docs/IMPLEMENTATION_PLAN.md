# Agent Integration Implementation Plan (BP-07)

## Overview

The Agent Integration component (BP-07) provides a robust framework for coordinating multiple AI agents within the SecondBrain architecture. This component enables structured communication between specialized agents, ensures context preservation between agent interactions, and implements the Reviewer Agent protocol for quality assurance.

## Components

1. **Agent Manager**
   - Central coordination system for all agents
   - Agent initialization and configuration
   - Message routing and priority management
   - State tracking and synchronization

2. **Multi-Agent Communication System**
   - Structured message passing between agents
   - Standardized message format with metadata
   - Support for synchronous and asynchronous communication
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Agent Role Definitions**
   - Planner Agent (strategy and planning)
   - Executor Agent (implementation and execution)
   - Reviewer Agent (quality assurance and verification)
   - Notion Agent (documentation and persistence)
   - Orchestrator Agent (workflow coordination)
   - Refactor Agent (code improvements)
   - Build Agent (system construction)

4. **Context Persistence**
   - Session context preservation between agent handoffs
   - Context summarization for token optimization
   - Context restoration from persistent storage
   - Integration with Notion SSoT for long-term storage

5. **LangGraph Integration**
   - Agent workflow definitions using LangGraph
   - State management and transitions
   - Tool calling framework
   - Error recovery and retry logic

6. **Reviewer Agent Protocol**
   - Implementation of mandatory review processes
   - Pre-implementation review workflow
   - Post-implementation verification
   - Integration with Notion for documentation

7. **Security and Authentication**
   - Inter-agent authentication
   - Access control and permissions
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure credential management

8. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Agent activity logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - Integration with central logging system

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create directory structure
   - Define configuration format
   - Setup environment variables
   - Install required dependencies

2. **Core Components**
   - Implement Agent Manager

   - Implement communication protocol
   - Setup context persistence system

3. **Agent Implementations**
   - Develop agent-specific classes
   - Implement role-based behaviors
   - Create agent routing logic
   - Setup agent state management

4. **Integration**
   - Integrate with Notion SSoT
   - Implement LangGraph workflows
   - Setup logging and monitoring
   - Configure security and authentication

5. **Reviewer Protocol**
   - Implement pre-implementation review
   - Develop post-implementation verification
   - Create documentation workflow
   - Setup approval tracking

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for agent communication
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Performance and load testing

7. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration guide
   - Troubleshooting information

## Timeline

1. Setup Phase: 1 day
2. Core Components: 2-3 days
3. Agent Implementations: 3-4 days
4. Integration: 2-3 days
5. Reviewer Protocol: 2 days
6. Testing and Validation: 2-3 days
7. Documentation: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 13-18 days

## Dependencies

- LangGraph for agent workflows
- Pydantic for schema validation
- Notion API client for persistence
- Claude and OpenAI APIs for agent capabilities
- Redis for short-term memory
- PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Pinecone for vector search (optional)

## Success Criteria

1. All agents can communicate effectively with proper context preservation
2. Reviewer Agent protocol is fully implemented and enforced
3. Context persists across agent transitions and CLI sessions
4. Notion SSoT integration provides complete audit trail
5. System handles errors gracefully with proper recovery
6. All agent interactions are properly logged and monitored
7. Security measures prevent unauthorized access or misuse

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Context loss during agent transitions
   **Mitigation**: Implement robust context persistence with redundancy

2. **Risk**: Agent coordination failures
   **Mitigation**: Design clear error handling and recovery mechanisms

3. **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks in multi-agent workflows
   **Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous processing and batch operations

4. **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in inter-agent communication
   **Mitigation**: Apply thorough authentication and input validation

5. **Risk**: Excessive token usage in large contexts
   **Mitigation**: Develop efficient context summarization techniques
