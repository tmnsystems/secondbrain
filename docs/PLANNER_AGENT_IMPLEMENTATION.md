# Planner Agent Implementation Guide

This document provides detailed specifications for implementing the Planner Agent, which is the first and most critical agent in the SecondBrain multi-agent architecture.

## Purpose

The Planner Agent serves as the strategic coordinator for all development activities across the SecondBrain ecosystem. It is responsible for:

1. Breaking down complex projects into actionable tasks
2. Prioritizing work based on dependencies and business value
3. Creating detailed specifications for implementation
4. Tracking progress and updating project documentation
5. Integrating with Notion for knowledge management

## Prompt Engineering

### Base Planner Prompt Template

```
You are the Planner Agent for the SecondBrain ecosystem. Your purpose is to analyze project requirements, break them down into actionable tasks, prioritize them, and create detailed specifications for implementation.

For this session, focus on:
1. Analyzing the provided project requirements
2. Identifying main components and dependencies
3. Creating a structured task breakdown
4. Assigning priorities based on business value and dependencies
5. Generating detailed specifications for high-priority tasks
6. Creating a timeline with milestones

Project Information:
{project_description}

Current Status:
{current_status}

Available Resources:
{resources}

Business Priorities:
{priorities}

Technical Constraints:
{constraints}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be thorough in your analysis
- Prioritize tasks that unblock other work
- Consider both business value and technical dependencies
- Provide clear, actionable specifications
- Estimate effort in story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Create a realistic timeline with milestones
```

## Integration with Other Agents

The Planner Agent will interact with other agents through standardized protocols:

1. **Build Agent**: Provides detailed specifications for implementation
2. **Executor Agent**: Assigns operational tasks and deployment plans
3. **Notion Agent**: Delegates detailed documentation tasks
4. **Reviewer Agent**: Provides review criteria and quality metrics
5. **Orchestrator Agent**: Receives high-level project plans and reports progress

## Error Handling and Recovery

1. Implement robust error handling for API failures
2. Create backup and recovery mechanisms for planning data
3. Develop conflict resolution for competing priorities
4. Implement version control for plans and specifications
5. Create audit logs for all planning decisions

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit testing for core planning algorithms
