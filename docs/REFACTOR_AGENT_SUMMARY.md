## Current Capabilities

The Refactor Agent currently provides a complete framework with placeholder implementations that:

- Defines all necessary interfaces and types
- Establishes the proper architecture for all components
- Provides integration points with other agents
- Includes test structure for validation
- Is ready for real implementation of refactoring tools

## Next Steps

The following steps are required to make the Refactor Agent fully functional:

1. **Implement Real Code Analysis**
   - Integrate AST parsers for code structure analysis
   - Add dependency graph generation tools
   - Implement dead code detection algorithms
   - Add code duplication identification algorithms
   - Implement technical debt assessment metrics

2. **Implement Real Transformation Engine**
   - Add pattern-based refactoring implementations
   - Implement function extraction logic
   - Add symbol renaming with proper scoping
   - Implement class restructuring algorithms
   - Add code style normalization tools

3. **Add Performance Optimization Tools**
   - Implement algorithm optimization techniques
   - Add memory usage improvement tools
   - Implement async pattern optimization
   - Add loop enhancement algorithms
   - Implement caching strategies

4. **Complete Modernization Tools**
   - Add legacy code transformation implementations
   - Implement framework migration assistance
   - Add language feature upgrade tools
   - Implement deprecated API detection and replacement
   - Add build system improvement tools

5. **Enhance Integration with Reviewer Agent**
   - Implement real-time quality validation during refactoring
   - Add code quality metrics for refactoring impact
   - Implement test impact prediction algorithms
   - Add breaking change detection with detailed analysis

## Integration with MCP Architecture

The Refactor Agent is now the sixth completed agent in our Multi-Claude-Persona (MCP) architecture, following:

1. Planner Agent
2. Executor Agent
3. Notion Agent
4. Build Agent
5. Reviewer Agent

This maintains our dependency order and provides a solid foundation for the final agent:

7. Orchestrator Agent (next to be implemented)

## Conclusion

The Refactor Agent implementation provides a comprehensive framework for code optimization, maintenance, and technical debt reduction. While the real implementations of refactoring tools are still pending, the architecture is in place and ready for incremental enhancement with actual tool integrations.

The initial phase focuses on structure and integration, with the subsequent phases adding concrete functionality, ensuring that the agent will be able to fulfill its code improvement role in the MCP architecture.
