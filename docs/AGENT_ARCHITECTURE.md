# SecondBrain Agent Architecture

This document outlines the multi-agent architecture used in the SecondBrain ecosystem, with special focus on the Claude Code CLI integration.

## Agent Types and Responsibilities

### 1. Planner Agent
**Primary Function:** Organizes and plans all development work
**Key Capabilities:**
- Reads from and writes to Notion pages for task tracking
- Breaks down complex projects into actionable tasks
- Prioritizes work based on dependencies and business value
- Creates detailed technical specifications for implementation
- Estimates time and resource requirements

**Implementation Priority:** 1 (First)

### 2. Executor Agent
**Primary Function:** DevOps and system operations
**Key Capabilities:**
- Executes bash commands for environment setup
- Manages git operations (commits, branches, merges)
- Deploys code to production environments
- Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines
- Monitors system health and performance

**Implementation Priority:** 2

### 3. Notion Agent
**Primary Function:** Documentation and knowledge management
**Key Capabilities:**
- Creates and updates Notion pages and databases
- Organizes project documentation
- Maintains knowledge base of common patterns
- Tracks project progress and milestones
- Generates reports and status updates

**Implementation Priority:** 3

### 4. Build Agent
**Primary Function:** Code generation and scaffolding
**Key Capabilities:**
- Creates new projects and components
- Implements features based on specifications
- Generates boilerplate code
- Scaffolds file structures
- Integrates new code with existing systems

**Implementation Priority:** 4

### 5. Reviewer Agent
**Primary Function:** Code quality assurance
**Key Capabilities:**
- Reviews code for bugs and security issues
- Ensures adherence to project standards
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Suggests improvements to existing code
- Validates implementation against specifications

**Implementation Priority:** 5

### 6. Refactor Agent
**Primary Function:** Code optimization and maintenance
**Key Capabilities:**
- Refactors code for better readability
- Improves performance of existing systems
- Modernizes legacy components
- Standardizes code across projects
- Reduces technical debt

**Implementation Priority:** 6

### 7. Orchestrator Agent
**Primary Function:** Coordinates other agents
**Key Capabilities:**
- Manages complex workflows across multiple agents
- Handles context sharing between agents
- Ensures proper sequencing of operations
- Provides high-level oversight of projects
- Resolves conflicts and bottlenecks

**Implementation Priority:** 7 (Last)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Develop Planner Agent with basic Notion integration
- Implement Executor Agent for environment management
- Create standard protocols for agent communication

### Phase 2: Building Blocks (Weeks 3-4)
- Develop full-featured Notion Agent
- Implement Build Agent with project scaffolding capabilities
- Begin development of Reviewer Agent

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Complete Reviewer Agent implementation
- Develop Refactor Agent
- Create initial version of Orchestrator Agent

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- Full integration of all agents
- Comprehensive testing of multi-agent workflows
- Performance optimization and refinement

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Claude CLI:** Primary interface for all agent operations
- **Prompt Engineering:** Specialized prompts for each agent type
- **Context Management:** Efficient sharing of context between agents
- **Tool Access:** File system, git, code editing, and web APIs

### Agent Communication
- Standardized JSON schema for inter-agent messages
- Shared context store for project state
- Event-driven architecture for agent coordination
- Versioned prompt templates and configurations

## Security and Governance

- All agents operate with least-privilege access
- Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- Comprehensive logging of all agent actions
- Regular review of agent performance and outputs

## Integration with SecondBrain Products

Each SecondBrain product will leverage specific agents based on needs:

- **CoachTinaMarieAI:** Planner, Build, Reviewer agents for coaching content
- **TubeToTask:** Executor, Notion agents for data processing
- **NymirAI:** Refactor, Build agents for model integration
- **ClientManager:** Notion, Planner agents for CRM functionality
- **Incredagents:** Orchestrator agent for coordinating micro-agents

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Planner Agent with detailed specifications
2. Establish testing framework for agent validation
3. Create shared libraries for common agent functions
4. Develop initial prompt templates for each agent type
