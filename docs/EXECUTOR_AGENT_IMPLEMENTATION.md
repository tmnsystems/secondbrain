## Technical Details

### Command Execution Module

The core command execution module will:

1. Validate commands against an allowlist
2. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. Execute commands in a controlled environment
4. Capture standard output, error output, and exit codes
5. Format results for consumption by other agents
6. Provide error handling and recovery options

```typescript
interface CommandResult {
  success: boolean;
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  exitCode: number;
  duration: number;
  command: string;
  timestamp: string;
}

async function executeCommand(
  command: string, 
  options: ExecutionOptions = {}
): Promise<CommandResult> {
  // Validate command against allowlist
  validateCommand(command);
  
  // Sanitize command to prevent injection
  const sanitizedCommand = sanitizeCommand(command);
  
  // Execute the command
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const result = await executeShellCommand(sanitizedCommand, options);
  const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
  
  // Format and return results
  return {
    success: result.exitCode === 0,
    stdout: result.stdout,
    stderr: result.stderr,
    exitCode: result.exitCode,
    duration,
    command: sanitizedCommand,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
}
```

### Git Operations Module

The Git operations module will:

1. Abstract common git operations into simple functions
2. Handle authentication and credentials securely
3. Provide intelligent commit message generation
4. Support branch management
5. Facilitate pull request creation

```typescript
interface GitResult {
  success: boolean;
  output: string;
  error?: string;
  commitId?: string;
  branchName?: string;
  prUrl?: string;
}

async function gitCommit(
  message: string,
  files: string[] = ['.'], 
  options: GitOptions = {}
): Promise<GitResult> {
  // Add files to staging
  await executeCommand(`git add ${files.join(' ')}`);
  
  // Create commit
  const result = await executeCommand(`git commit -m "${message}"`);
  
  // Extract commit ID if successful
  let commitId;
  if (result.success) {
    const match = result.stdout.match(/\[main ([a-f0-9]+)\]/);
    commitId = match ? match[1] : undefined;
  }
  
  return {
    success: result.success,
    output: result.stdout,
    error: result.success ? undefined : result.stderr,
    commitId
  };
}
```

### Deployment Module

The deployment module will:

1. Support multiple hosting platforms (Vercel, Railway, Replit)
2. Automate environment setup
3. Manage build processes
4. Handle deployment and rollbacks
5. Verify deployment success

```typescript
interface DeploymentResult {
  success: boolean;
  deploymentUrl?: string;
  logs: string;
  error?: string;
  duration: number;
  environment: string;
  timestamp: string;
}

async function deployToVercel(
  projectPath: string,
  options: VercelOptions = {}
): Promise<DeploymentResult> {
  // Build the project
  const buildResult = await executeCommand(`cd ${projectPath} && npm run build`);
  if (!buildResult.success) {
    return {
      success: false,
      logs: buildResult.stdout + buildResult.stderr,
      error: 'Build failed',
      duration: buildResult.duration,
      environment: 'vercel',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
  
  // Deploy to Vercel
  const deployResult = await executeCommand(`cd ${projectPath} && vercel deploy --prod`);
  
  // Extract deployment URL
  let deploymentUrl;
  if (deployResult.success) {
    const match = deployResult.stdout.match(/https:\/\/[\w-]+\.vercel\.app/);
    deploymentUrl = match ? match[0] : undefined;
  }
  
  return {
    success: deployResult.success,
    deploymentUrl,
    logs: deployResult.stdout,
    error: deployResult.success ? undefined : deployResult.stderr,
    duration: deployResult.duration,
    environment: 'vercel',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
}
```

### Testing Module

The testing module will:

1. Execute tests in different frameworks
2. Analyze test results
3. Report coverage metrics
4. Diagnose test failures
5. Provide recommendations for fixes

```typescript
interface TestResult {
  success: boolean;
  totalTests: number;
  passedTests: number;
  failedTests: number;
  skippedTests: number;
  coverage?: number;
  duration: number;
  failureDetails?: FailureDetail[];
  logs: string;
}

async function runTests(
  projectPath: string,
  testCommand: string = 'npm test',
  options: TestOptions = {}
): Promise<TestResult> {
  // Execute tests
  const result = await executeCommand(`cd ${projectPath} && ${testCommand}`);
  
  // Parse test results
  // This will depend on the testing framework used
  const parsedResults = parseTestOutput(result.stdout, result.stderr);
  
  return {
    success: parsedResults.failedTests === 0,
    totalTests: parsedResults.totalTests,
    passedTests: parsedResults.passedTests,
    failedTests: parsedResults.failedTests,
    skippedTests: parsedResults.skippedTests,
    coverage: parsedResults.coverage,
    duration: result.duration,
    failureDetails: parsedResults.failureDetails,
    logs: result.stdout + result.stderr
  };
}
```

## Safety and Security

1. **Command Validation**
   - Maintain an allowlist of permitted commands
   - Block potentially dangerous operations
   - Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection

2. **Environment Isolation**
   - Execute commands in controlled environments
   - Limit access to sensitive resources
   - Use proper permission boundaries

3. **Credential Management**
   - Store sensitive credentials securely
   - Use temporary tokens where possible
   - Rotate keys regularly

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all executed commands
   - Track resource usage
   - Enable tracing for debugging

## Integration with Other Agents

The Executor Agent will interact with other agents as follows:

1. **Planner Agent**: Receives execution tasks from the Planner Agent
2. **Build Agent**: Executes build commands for code created by the Build Agent
3. **Reviewer Agent**: Runs tests and validations requested by the Reviewer Agent
4. **Notion Agent**: Provides execution results for documentation
5. **Orchestrator Agent**: Reports execution status and receives high-level directives

## Error Handling and Recovery

The Executor Agent will include robust error handling:

1. Automatic retry for transient failures
2. Graceful degradation for partial failures
3. Diagnostic information for debugging
4. Safe rollback capabilities for failed operations
5. Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit testing for command execution logic
2. Integration testing for git operations
3. End-to-end testing for deployment pipelines
4. Security testing for command validation
5. Performance testing for resource-intensive operations

## Success Metrics

The Executor Agent implementation will be measured by:

1. Command execution success rate
2. Deployment reliability
3. Test execution accuracy
4. Recovery effectiveness
5. Performance overhead
6. Security effectiveness

## Next Steps

1. Implement the command execution module
2. Build git operation capabilities
3. Create deployment pipeline components
4. Develop testing and monitoring frameworks
5. Integrate with the Planner Agent
