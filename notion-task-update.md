# Task Update for Notion

## Task SB-BUILD-001: Create directory structure for monorepo setup

### Status: Completed

### Implementation Details

I've implemented a comprehensive directory structure for the SecondBrain project following TypeScript monorepo best practices. The structure supports the agent architecture outlined in the Master Plan and follows the Seven-Stage Build Flow process.

### Key Components

1. **Package Organization**:
   - Created a `packages` directory with clear separation of concerns
   - Implemented core functionality in `packages/core`
   - Added shared types and utilities in `packages/shared`
   - Structured agent packages under `packages/agents/*`

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - Set up base TypeScript configuration with `packages/tsconfig.base.json`
   - Created package-specific TypeScript configurations
   - Updated root `tsconfig.json` with proper paths and references
   - Added `turbo.json` for monorepo build management

3. **Build Agent Implementation**:
   - Implemented the basic structure for the Build Agent
   - Created type definitions and interfaces
   - Set up the agent workflow based on the Seven-Stage Build Flow

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `monorepo-documentation.md`
   - Detailed design decisions and architecture choices
   - Explained how the structure supports the agent architecture

### Design Decisions

1. **Workspace Organization**:
   - Used a nested workspace structure to allow for focused development
   - Optimized for package independence and clear dependencies

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Implemented path aliases for improved imports
   - Used project references for better TypeScript integration
   - Set up strict type checking for enhanced code quality

3. **Agent Architecture**:
   - Designed for agent isolation with well-defined interfaces
   - Created a structure that supports the workflow management
   - Ensured type safety across package boundaries

### Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining agent packages
2. Set up continuous integration
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Integrate with Notion for task management

### Time Spent

- Planning: 1 hour
- Implementation: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Testing: 0.5 hours

### Completion Date

May 8, 2025

### Notes

The implemented structure provides a solid foundation for the SecondBrain project, enabling scalable development and clear separation of concerns between different agent types and functionality. The monorepo approach will facilitate faster development cycles and better code organization as the project grows.
