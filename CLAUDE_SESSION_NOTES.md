## Technical Details

The Planner Agent works by:
1. Analyzing a project to identify components and dependencies
2. Generating tasks with priorities and dependencies
3. Creating a timeline with milestones
4. Generating detailed specifications for high-priority tasks
5. Saving everything to Notion for tracking and collaboration

The multi-agent architecture is designed to modularize functions with different agent types:
- Planner Agent: Project planning and task breakdown (uses o3)
- Executor Agent: Handles system operations and deployment (uses GPT-4.1 Mini)
- Notion Agent: Documentation and knowledge management
- Build Agent: Code generation and scaffolding
- Reviewer Agent: Code quality assurance (uses Claude)
- Refactor Agent: Code optimization and maintenance
- Orchestrator Agent: Coordinates other agents

### Slack+Notion Integration Architecture (May 12, 2025)

The Slack+Notion integration uses a Vercel+Linode architecture:
1. Vercel hosts the Next.js frontend and API endpoints
2. Linode hosts the agent VMs and persistence layer
3. Context persistence system using Pinecone prevents lost context
4. Agents run in dedicated VMs with proper authorization
5. All agent actions are transparently logged in both Slack and Notion

This architecture ensures:
- Complete transparency in agent operations
- Proper model routing (o3, GPT-4.1 Mini, Claude)
- Context persistence between sessions
- Secure handling of API keys
- Strict adherence to the design specifications

See `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/revised_planner_agent_response.md` for the complete implementation plan.

# üö® CRITICAL: CLI SESSION CONTEXT PRESERVATION SYSTEM (May 14, 2025)

## Overview

We have implemented a REAL-TIME context logging system that prevents catastrophic context loss during CLI sessions. This system ensures all interactions are logged to Notion AS THEY HAPPEN, not after completion, to maintain context even during automatic compaction events or session disconnections.

## Core Components Created

1. **Real-Time Notion Logger** (`cli_session_logger.js`)
   - Logs every user message, system action, and assistant response in real-time
   - Creates session bridges for context continuity
   - Handles compaction events to preserve context during truncation
   - Provides redundancy with file system backups

2. **Enhanced Session Initialization** (`initialize-session.js`)
   - Integrates real-time logging into session startup
   - Loads previous context from earlier sessions
   - Requires explicit confirmation of real-time logging requirement
   - Sets up compaction event handlers

3. **Critical Warning in CLAUDE.md**
   - Added prominent warning at the top of CLAUDE.md
   - Emphasizes mandatory real-time logging to prevent context loss
   - Details the consequences of failing to maintain proper context persistence

4. **Context Persistence Test** (`test_cli_context_persistence.js`)
   - Verifies the context persistence system works as expected
   - Simulates user interactions, system actions, and compaction events
   - Tests context retrieval after simulated issues

## CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

ALWAYS use the global sessionLogger object for EVERY interaction:

```javascript
// Log user message AS IT HAPPENS
await sessionLogger.logUserMessage(message);

// Log system action AS IT HAPPENS
await sessionLogger.logSystemAction(action, details);

// Log assistant response AS IT HAPPENS
await sessionLogger.logAssistantResponse(response);

// Log tool call AS IT HAPPENS
await sessionLogger.logToolCall(toolName, input, output);
```

## 5 Critical Principles

1. **Log EVERYTHING in real-time** - Log AS IT HAPPENS, not after the fact
2. **Never delay logging until after execution** - Immediate logging ensures nothing is lost
3. **Always check for previous context** - Load context from previous sessions at initialization
4. **Store complete logs, not summaries** - Full content preservation for proper restoration
5. **Create bridges between sessions** - Explicit linking between related sessions

## Key Files Created/Modified

- `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/cli_session_logger.js` (NEW)
- `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/initialize-session.js` (MODIFIED)
- `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/CLAUDE.md` (UPDATED with warning)
- `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/test_cli_context_persistence.js` (NEW)
- `/Volumes/Envoy/SecondBrain/CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (UPDATED)

## Notion Database Structure

The SecondBrain Tasks database in Notion is used with:
- **Name**: Session ID and timestamp
- **Status**: In Progress, Completed, Failed
- **Task ID**: Unique session identifier
- **Content Blocks**: User messages, system actions, assistant responses, tool calls

## Testing Instructions

Run: `node test_cli_context_persistence.js`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - WITHOUT REAL-TIME LOGGING, CONTEXT LOSS IS INEVITABLE ‚ö†Ô∏è

The real-time context logging system is MANDATORY to prevent catastrophic context loss during CLI sessions. Waiting to log actions after they happen risks losing everything during automatic compaction or disconnections.
