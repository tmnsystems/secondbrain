## 1. Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Design data models for project representation, tasks, timelines, and specifications
- Define interfaces for all major components of the planning engine
- Create interaction diagrams showing component relationships
- Specify API contract for internal and external communication
- Ensure extensibility for future agent integration

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complete UML diagrams for all data models
- Documented API contracts with examples
- Component interaction diagrams
- Extension points clearly identified
- Design validated against sample scenarios

## 2. Technical Approach

The core planning engine will follow a modular architecture with the following principles:
- Clear separation of concerns between analysis, task generation, timeline creation, etc.
- Immutable data structures for predictable state management
- Event-driven communication between components
- Pluggable implementation for key components to allow future extensions

The architecture will use TypeScript interfaces to define contracts between components,
with concrete implementations that can be swapped based on requirements.

## 3. Interface Definitions

### Project Interface
\`\`\`typescript
interface Project {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  objectives: string[];
  constraints?: string[];
  // Additional fields as defined in types.ts
}
\`\`\`

### Core Planning Engine API
\`\`\`typescript
interface PlanningEngine {
  analyzeProject(project: Project): Promise<Analysis>;
  generateTasks(analysis: Analysis, options?: TaskOptions): Promise<Task[]>;
  createTimeline(tasks: Task[], project: Project): Promise<Timeline>;
  validatePlan(plan: Plan): ValidationResult;
}
\`\`\`

## 4. Testing Considerations

- Unit tests for each isolated component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests with sample projects
- Performance testing with large/complex projects
- Validation testing to ensure output quality

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

- All planning operations will be performed server-side
- Claude API availability is required for cognitive operations
- Project complexity may be limited in initial implementation
- Timeline accuracy depends on quality of task effort estimates`;
