But I was like, you know what you know. When I grew up it was, what could we pick on about a person? What was wrong with this person. What was wrong with that person? And I love that we are a family that just looks for great things in people, and compliments it constantly, and.

But I was like, you know what you know. When I grew up it was, what could we pick on about a person? What was wrong with this person. What was wrong with that person? And I love that we are a family that just looks for great things in people, and compliments it constantly, and.
```

## Value 3

```
You see what you look for, so look for the good. Um see people. As for me, it was. I need to see everybody as a child of God.
```

## Value 4

```
For those things, and like. Okay, there's a little chink in your armor right there, like you.
```

## Value 5

I don't need to put any of you on a pedestal. I don't need to put myself on a pedestal. I'm not better than anybody else. I'm not worse than anybody else. We all.
```

```

## Value 7

```
Deserve respect and to be happy. Now some people. Also.
```

## Value 8

```
But, barring that exception. To me. Everybody deserves to be happy, deserves respect.
```

## Value 9

```
Deserves kindness, deserves. Um acknowledgement. You know those kinds of things, and so.
```

## Value 10

```
Incessantly negative. They are their own worst enemies. You don't need to worry about punishing them or getting them back, or.
```

## Value 11

```
Yeah. And it's, you know, it's really interesting, because you just demonstrated that right? Your mom is not thankful for the gift that she is for you, for the peace of mind, and for the help that she is to the family.
```

## Value 12

```
But Fuji's mom is, thank you for this right? And. And you can see the difference in happiness. But I bet if you looked at.
```

## Value 13

```
Gratitude across the parallels, right in in the parents. Um that you would see that. That's that's probably.
```

## Value 14

```
Confirmation, you know, for test proofs, scientific method, right of of a concept and a principle. Um for what I would call.
```

## Value 15

```
Maybe even eternal truths or universal truths.
```

## Value 16

```
Right that there aren't exceptions for. And that to me is one of them. It is that people that are thankful.
```

## Value 17

```
Right. But but there's a correlation between gratitude and happiness. That is undeniable and.
```

## Value 18

```
I have to ask you about this, because. I felt that you had said, you don't make friends easily, so this feels like a little bit of a shift.
```

## Value 19

```
Because of how you felt, or your mom staying with you, or anything right. But that was a gift that you gave to your children.
```

## Value 20

```
So frequency is energy. So like if we get heavy metal poisoning right. But that will change the frequency. All all the things inside of our bodies. There's everything's energy, everything's.
```

## Value 21

```
So if you play one frequency, one tone in the left ear and one on the right ear, bi narrow right, 2 ears.
```

## Value 22

```
Toxic to us. So we can think about it on a musical level, right? What it feels like. We know that that's dark. That's foreboding music.
```

## Value 23

```
On a frequency level that cannot be perceived. Right? We know that there's a whole spectrum of light and sound.
```

## Value 24

```
Oh, right!
```

## Value 25

```
And then shame! Right, which was used on purpose by anybody who wanted to control victims.
```

## Value 26

```
They weren't even able to know what was truth.
```

## Value 27

```
Culture suggests that. Tradition is the highest value.
```

## Value 28

```
Shame. And tradition is the highest value.
```

## Value 29

```
Motherhood, and that you weren't really sure that you wanted to be a mother. Um at at 1 point, and then I was thinking about also the value of.
```

## Value 30

```
Don't ever apologize for your children. If you feel like you have to apologize for somebody, you're doing business with the wrong people. You need to stop that.
```

## Value 31

```
Don't ever apologize for your children. If you feel like you have to apologize for somebody, you're doing business with the wrong people. You need to stop that.
```

## Value 32

```
And he was dead serious, like he was upset with me, that I would feel that I need to apologize for my children, that they're everything.
```

## Value 33

```
I'm telling you um, and but he's got his flaws right, and they're really difficult. We all big people, big energy people.
```

## Value 34

```
Something that I'm doing wrong. 2 things are going to happen. Number one, you're going to feel like I want to kill you.
```

## Value 35

```
I am going to go inspect everything you said, and I'm going to expect the quality of the person who said it to me, and I don't let low quality people around me. So I'm going to give a lot of value to what was said to me.
```

## Value 36

```
I am going to like. I believe in what I did and how I did it. However.
```

## Value 37

```
For you because I honor you.
```

## Value 38

```
Because I love you and value you and want you. And so learning that.
```

## Value 39

```
And try to right, and they will. Be who they are with you.
```

## Value 40

```
And I say at all times, because there's fair weather friends right? There are people. Who are safe up and until.
```

## Value 41

```
She's like not right now.
```

## Value 42

```
I like. I want to be my own self, and be comfortable, being um my own self, and use my own voice and my own thoughts. And I need to only be around people who respect that.
```

## Value 43

```
And to allow children to think that he was dying. So that kind of manipulation hasn't changed. It's only gotten worse. So my poor babies don't even know what the truth is.
```

## Value 44

```
Somehow they'll be able to orient. I know that they will. They'll be able to orient and know what the truth is. But that example is that powerful? Because.
```

## Value 45

Those men are not abusive. They respect women.
```

## Value 46

Um. This is a good segue, because we need to wrap up and make a plan for next week, but. You're you're you're so far ahead of most people who have lived the kind of life that you did, Esther.
```

## Value 47

```
When I, when I was praying for the kind of partner that I would have in my life, when I was ready to be single until my girls were grown. My my key thing was, I wanted somebody who would make me the best version of myself.
```

## Value 48

```
We don't grow without opposition. So to become the best version of ourselves. We have to have somebody who is.
```

## Value 49

```
Yeah, yeah, but but respectfully and good. You've done that, you you have. You created the environment for yourself to grow.
```

## Value 50

```
I could keep talking to you, but I have to get ready for my daughter, but what I would love to do. Is, I just want you to contemplate.
```

## Value 51

```
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This this. Okay? So I will tell you, because one of the things I do sometimes is I take my transcripts and go to the AI like, okay, do you have any feedback for my coaching? Right.
```

## Value 52

```
Esther's heart and mind. Which are the filters that all the thoughts will go through that have to do with anything.
```

## Value 53

```
Think about you and to journal and to write. That's all the structure there is. You can brain dump. There doesn't need to be more than that.
```

## Value 54

```
Right, so.
```

## Value 55

```
And I want you to think about. It's 1 of my favorite phrases. I think I might have told you. Um. But this is a good thing to end with is that.
```

## Value 56
