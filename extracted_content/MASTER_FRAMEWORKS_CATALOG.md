So that's why I'm getting ready to tell you it's multiple stages. So sometimes it's patients not going to treatment, right? So they've noted patients going to start treatment, and so nobody talks to them because they're in treatment except for the patient wasn't going, or the client wasn't going to treatment right. And let's say it's a stack of treatments that have to happen in order to hit policy limits, which happens a lot.

And let's say that there's a mismatch of the person on the team that has to behave a particular way, and then the client that they're dealing with.

You know what I mean that this whole process of evolution, and last night my daughter was talking to me about. You know how she wants to raise her children and stuff like that.

```

```
Because my brain, when I'm focused, I'm laser focused. I go. I have fast tools, my like. I always have top of the line computers and everything, because my brain can process super fast, and so my hands can process super fast like I have great reflexes. If something falls out of the cabinet, I will catch it before it even gets to waist level like I've got like I work really fast. I think we talked about.
```

### General Framework 10

**Source**: Esther's Journey's transcript (4).txt

But it is internalizing, basically a system of deciding. Does it even belong. Here on my awareness doesn't get any of my mental space.

```

### General Framework 12

**Source**: Esther's Journey's transcript (4).txt

```
Where would we be if we didn't have somebody who could help us with the cooking and the cleaning, or whatever? But where would they be if we couldn't use our brains to create better systems, to create the jobs to whatever like, we all need each other in those roles, and none of us can do it all, but somehow we've gotten to this point where we're all supposed to do it all. That's not right. It was never like that.
```

### General Framework 13

**Source**: Esther's Journey's transcript (4).txt

```
What what the language is. Always look at these systems and go okay, like, if it works for you verbatim great. Nothing works for me verbatim. I have to change everything.

I don't know what to do, because your brain is trying to process all of these things. Well, if you add email, which email is simple. So it seems like it's not that much.
```

### General Framework 15

**Source**: Fast Pain Doc 's transcript.txt

```
That she will be able to do so. Remember, the whole thing about the driving analogy is that after we do it for a while things become reflexive. And you don't have to process the thought so much. So. It's not as mentally exhausting, and you're less likely to make mistakes because of the repetition, but also because so like when we're learning how to drive, we're not allowed to have any distractions right.
```

### General Framework 16

**Source**: Fast Pain Doc 's transcript.txt

```
And then, as we evolve, we'll um, we'll add some things on. As you feel able, and then you give her a little bit, and you let her get used to that until that becomes a reflexive thing rather than a you know everything is a mental process.
```

### General Framework 17

**Source**: Fast Pain Doc 's transcript.txt

```
Yes, so start with your plan. Start small. At least you'll know you're doing something. One day a week, if you want to do that like if go back and look at all the days he didn't show up. Is there a trend? Are there certain days? Was there a trend in the certain types of procedures that he had the day before, or that day, or whatever like. What can you go and look at and predict.

```

### General Framework 27

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

It should not. But you can ask that question. Also don't use projects. Get out of projects. So you can choose the model you're working with.
```

### General Framework 28

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

```

```

### General Framework 31

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

```
Okay. So Paul, Paul can solve lots of things if you can let him do it. If he can't immediately, just step in. Don't let them keep going there. So at least you know that they're. It might not be in his wheelhouse to even process those types of things.
```

### General Framework 32

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

```
Um. So you just discovered that there's a system to this particular one lead system. I want you to write it down. Figure out the system for each of the vendors, the lead vendors, the brokers right.
```

### General Framework 33

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

```
And work, the system. You are trending down.
```

### General Framework 34

**Source**: Fuji coaching Call's transcript (10).txt

This is what you really have to focus on the systems, and everything else is coming together, really? Well, but you gotta go. Drive, that.
```

```
Internal alert system added for oh, wait.
```

### General Framework 36

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Um system. So that you're not having to do it all yourself.
```

### General Framework 37

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
What can we do as always, to get more out of what we have. It's going to be process related. It's going to be system related. So.
```

### General Framework 38

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Analysis. Okay. So somewhere in here are existing bright spots, and some of them will be emerging bright spots. As a result of other people's processes, potentially.
```

### General Framework 39

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Um. They did it, but they didn't have a schedule for it. They didn't have a system for it, a requirement, hey? Or or even huge priority.
```

### General Framework 40

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Had certain things that they just. Didn't do well, whether it was following up with particular types of clients.
```

### General Framework 41

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Or particular types of situations. But there were patterns that had emerged in that.
```

### General Framework 42

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
So part of the issue was. They? They didn't have a good system for reviewing the cases. It was just this broad, sweeping view of what was happening.
```

### General Framework 43

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
And a lot of data to process rather than going into the case and specifically looking for. What happened last? What happened next?
```

### General Framework 44

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
But what we also did was write out all of the steps of the case. So part of the issue was, there are a lot of things for them to keep track of mentally.
```

### General Framework 45

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
The job was getting done, but there was no really systematic approach to it. It wasn't based on priority. It wasn't based on.
```

### General Framework 46

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Threshold right so of pressure. How without a system. If, let's say, Samantha's system is just.
```

### General Framework 47

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
An increased capacity. That requires a system to be able to maintain quality.
```

### General Framework 48

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
My premise is that. There's not a great system. There was just drive.
```

### General Framework 49

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
And youth, and vigor and consistency. Without a systematic.
```

### General Framework 50

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Application to the process. And so when we increased the case volume.
```

### General Framework 51

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
We increased. How long it took to. Get the cases handled just because, again, no checklist, no process, no system.
```

### General Framework 52

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Um. But maybe she is. If you approach her and say, I think this will cause less stress. If we try it this way, would you? You know.
```

### General Framework 53

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
But a lot of that is approach and presentation. Even that has to be strategic.
```

### General Framework 54

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
What is the issue? I guarantee you. Systems and processes is part of the issue.
```

### General Framework 55

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Is a result of. Workload, and how much of that is workload, because there are no systems.
```

### General Framework 56

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Or workload just because she's overwhelmed. And can't mentally process it regardless.
```

### General Framework 57

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Unless she has highly systematized. Her ability to process the volume, whatever it is.
```

### General Framework 58

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Will improve. With better systems. That is the point of them. It is to reduce the mental load.
```

### General Framework 59

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
How many people are out, what kind of cases we have so many different things. All of it is improved by system, so we already know Samantha is resistant to it.
```

### General Framework 60

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Because we create systems that help her not drain her brain so much. And her teams and make her not have to micromanage.
```

### General Framework 61

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
How is that relevant to what we're talking about? How do we track something? How do we create a simple system. Right. That doesn't create much resistance. We already know there's going to be some.
```

### General Framework 62

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (15).txt

```
Which again, should not be the way that we're approaching it. But. It is um. Then what can we do with that? So.
```

### General Framework 63

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
What system.
```

### General Framework 64

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
Well, what needs to get done is these. There are, um, certain types of conversations.
```

### General Framework 65

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
It. It's not really like that. It's it's more um talking about certain specific types of dynamics, right? So if the call goes off, grid off off the rails. Here's how you get it back.
```

### General Framework 66

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
We don't. We're not thinking about it the same way, because I'm trying to distill this from. Years of experience in a call center, managing hundreds of people and getting those types of results. And and so.
```

### General Framework 67

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
Like the way that you're looking at it and approaching about it doesn't even make sense to me. It kind of does. But like. You're asked.
```

### General Framework 68

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
Okay. But it's still not an issue. All they need to learn how to do is get a call back on track, and there's a few types of things they can learn there's a skip. Okay, alright, let's.
```

### General Framework 69

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
How fast do we process it and get paid? How much do we get paid? All of those things.
```

### General Framework 70

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (13).txt

```
Have nuance and components inside of them. So to get the most out of the least. We have to find those leverage points.
```

### General Framework 71

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
What? Model? Is it using.
```

### General Framework 72

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
Use one of the smarter models and go through and say, Look, this is the situation. This is what we have. What are the best types of questions to ask as a test. Also just what are the types of questions we might expect a user to ask on this website. So that.
```

### General Framework 73

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
But. Ensuring number one, that the system's working, and 2 that it's working across.
```

### General Framework 74

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
For me, Dan. It would be super helpful when we're having these types of conversations. And you're looking into stuff. If you share screen because I like, I have so little context for this.
```

### General Framework 75

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
About 1 3.rd Approaching.
```

### General Framework 76

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (12).txt

```
The point that I'm trying to make is that and I could be wrong. I could have 0 impact on how profitable Lorenz is to you. But the systematic approach that we've had to him managing his stuff.
```

### General Framework 77

**Source**: Mark Sweet + Basis + Tina's transcript (11).txt

```
Huh! Well, without all this put together, it always will look different anyway. So it's just natural that it's an iterative process.
```

### General Framework 78

And then this system goes and looks internally. Right, non accessible to the public.
