- Implemented proper type hints and validation rules
- Created models for tasks, messages, and workflow states

### 7. Logging & Utilities
- Implemented comprehensive logging system with file and console output
- Created utility functions for common operations
- Set up error handling and formatting

## Next Steps

The following steps are required to complete the implementation:

1. **Connect to Slack Workspace**
   - Finish configuring the Slack app in the Slack API Dashboard
   - Add the Slack app to your workspace
   - Update bot token and app-level token as needed

2. **Test Full Integration Flow**
   - Test the entire workflow from Slack message to Notion logging
   - Verify proper task creation and progression
   - Test reactions and thread-based interactions

3. **Deploy the Integration**
   - Set up a server or serverless function to host the integration
   - Configure environment variables in the deployment environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging

4. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Document API endpoints and data models
   - Create setup and troubleshooting guides

## Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Notion Integration

1. Create a Notion integration at https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Copy the integration token and add it to `secondbrain_api_keys.env`
3. Create a page in your Notion workspace called "SecondBrain Project"
4. Share the page with your integration by clicking "..." > "Add connections"
5. Run the setup command to create the necessary databases:
   ```
   python3 -m slack_notion_integration.src.main --setup-notion
   ```

### Setting Up Slack Integration

1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Add the following scopes to your app:
   - `app_mentions:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `files:read`
   - `files:write`
   - `reactions:read`
   - `reactions:write`
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`
3. Enable Socket Mode and generate an app-level token with `connections:write` scope
4. Install the app to your workspace
5. Copy the bot token and app-level token to `secondbrain_api_keys.env`

### Running the Integration

To start all agents:
```
python3 -m slack_notion_integration.src.main --start-agents
```

To start a specific agent:
```
python3 -m slack_notion_integration.src.main --start-agents --agent planner
```

Available agents:
- `planner` - Planning and task breakdown
- `executor` - Task execution
- `reviewer` - Code and implementation review
- `notion` - Documentation and knowledge management

## Troubleshooting

### Notion API Issues
- Ensure your Notion API key is correct
- Make sure your integration has been shared with at least one page
- Verify your integration has the right permissions

### Slack API Issues
- Check that your Slack tokens are correct
- Ensure the app is installed to your workspace
- Verify the app has the necessary scopes

### General Issues
- Check the logs in the `logs` directory
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure all dependencies are installed:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
