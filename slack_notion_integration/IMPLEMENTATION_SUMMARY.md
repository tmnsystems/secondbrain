# SecondBrain Context Persistence Implementation Summary

## Overview

The context persistence system has been implemented for the SecondBrain CLI to ensure that context is never lost during auto-compaction events, session disconnections, or system failures. This implementation follows the "NEVER TRUNCATE" principle and logs all interactions to Notion in real-time. The system has been expanded to include Slack integration with multi-agent support and three-layer context persistence.

## Key Components

1. **CLI Session Logger** (`src/cli/cli_session_logger.py`)
   - Core class for real-time Notion logging
   - Logs all user messages, system actions, assistant responses, and tool calls
   - Creates and maintains session bridges
   - Handles compaction events
   - Loads previous context at initialization

2. **Session Manager** (`src/cli/session_manager.py`)
   - Provides high-level API for session management
   - Initializes sessions with context restoration
   - Sets up compaction handlers
   - Manages sessions across various contexts

3. **CLI Bridge** (`cli_bridge.py`)
   - Command-line interface for interacting with the context persistence system
   - Provides commands for initialization, logging, compaction handling, and session closing
   - Maintains session state between invocations

4. **Enhanced Slack App** (`src/slack/enhanced_app.py`)
   - Extends the base Slack app with real-time context logging to Notion
   - Integrates with CLI Session Logger for consistent persistence
   - Logs all Slack interactions as they happen
   - Handles message processing with context awareness

5. **Multi-Agent System** (`src/slack/multi_agent.py`)
   - Implements a multi-agent architecture with distinct agent roles
   - Manages agent transitions and message routing
   - Maintains context continuity across agent handoffs
   - Provides agent-specific context formatting

6. **Enhanced LangGraph Flows** (`src/langgraph/enhanced_flows.py`)
   - Augments LangGraph with real-time logging capabilities
   - Wraps workflow nodes with persistent logging
   - Ensures all workflow transitions are tracked
   - Preserves context during complex multi-step operations

7. **Three-Layer Context Persistence** (`context_manager.py`)
   - Implements Redis (short-term), PostgreSQL (medium-term), and Pinecone (long-term) storage
   - Provides unified API for context operations
   - Ensures redundancy and fault tolerance
   - Supports semantic search and relationship tracking

8. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_cli_context_persistence.py`: Tests CLI context persistence
   - `test_enhanced_slack_integration.py`: Tests Slack integration with real-time logging
   - `test_multi_agent_system.py`: Tests multi-agent architecture with context preservation

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new CLI session
python cli_bridge.py init

# Log a user message
python cli_bridge.py log-user "User message here"

# Log a system action
python cli_bridge.py log-system "ACTION_TYPE" "key1=value1" "key2=value2"

# Log an assistant response
python cli_bridge.py log-assistant "Assistant response here"

# Log a tool call
python cli_bridge.py log-tool "ToolName" --input "param1=value1" --output "result=success"

# Handle compaction
python cli_bridge.py handle-compaction --reason "CONTEXT_LIMIT_REACHED"

# Close the current session
python cli_bridge.py close
```

### Slack Integration

```bash
# Start the enhanced Slack app with real-time logging
python start_enhanced_slack_app.py

# Start the multi-agent system
python start_multi_agent_system.py

# Test Slack integration
python test_enhanced_slack_integration.py
```

### Three-Layer Persistence

```bash
# Initialize the context manager
python -c "import asyncio; from context_manager import ContextManager; asyncio.run(ContextManager().initialize())"

# Store context across all layers
python -c "import asyncio; from context_manager import ContextManager; asyncio.run(ContextManager().store_context(context_obj))"

# Retrieve context with semantic search
python -c "import asyncio; from context_manager import ContextManager; asyncio.run(ContextManager().retrieve_context(query='business systems'))"
```

## Integration with Claude CLI

To integrate with the Claude CLI, add the following to your initialization script:

```bash
# Initialize CLI session when starting Claude
SESSION_ID=$(python cli_bridge.py init | grep "Initialized new CLI session" | awk '{print $5}')
echo "Using CLI session: $SESSION_ID"

# Set up compaction handler
claude_on_compaction() {
  echo "Handling compaction event..."
  python cli_bridge.py handle-compaction --reason "$1"
  echo "Compaction handled."
}

# Export handler for Claude to use
export -f claude_on_compaction
```

## Notion Structure

The system creates and maintains the following in Notion:

1. **CLI Sessions Database**
   - Each session has its own page
   - Sessions are linked together with bidirectional bridges
   - Status is tracked (Active, Compacted, or Completed)
   - All interactions are logged chronologically

2. **Slack Conversations Database**
   - Tracks all Slack conversations
   - Links to related CLI sessions
   - Maintains agent identity and thread context
   - Preserves multi-agent interactions

3. **Task Tracking Database**
   - Manages agent tasks and workflows
   - Tracks completion status and timestamps
   - Links to relevant sessions and conversations
   - Provides audit trail for reviewer verification

4. **Session Page Content**
   - User messages (üë§ USER)
   - System actions (‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEM)
   - Assistant responses (ü§ñ ASSISTANT)
   - Tool calls (üîß TOOL)
   - Compaction events (üîÑ COMPACTION)
   - Session bridges (‚õìÔ∏è CONTINUED FROM/IN)
   - Slack messages (üí¨ SLACK)
   - Agent transitions (üîÑ AGENT)

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The system implements a robust multi-agent architecture with the following components:
