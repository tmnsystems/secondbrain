## 1. Holistic Wellbeing

### Core Value
Business success must be integrated with personal wellbeing for sustainable growth.

### Examples

- "*Your business runs on you and you run on sleep and everything else so do pay attention to it.*"
- "*I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times a day if that's what it takes.*"

### Related Principles
- Self-care is a business strategy, not a luxury

- Prevention of burnout is more efficient than recovery

## 2. Time Freedom & Leverage

### Core Value
True success includes the freedom to control your time while maintaining financial prosperity.

### Examples
- "*I don't work long hours, but I do show up consistently.*"
- "*It's so much easier to maintain than to catch up.*"
- "*We're always looking for leverage, and leverage is how we get more out of what we already have.*"
- "*Everything else needs to be leveraged.*"

### Related Principles

## 3. Balance of Profit & Purpose

### Core Value
Business decisions should balance financial success with deeper purpose and integrity.

### Examples
- "*It's at a good place right now... This is like a one point, maybe $1.5 million a year business for me. At this level, it takes very little work.*"
- "*We don't care how much we make, it's not worth being in business [with someone who doesn't align with our values].*"
- "*Is that that much money for that amount of work? Because now your operation is just ridiculous.*"

### Related Principles
- Not all revenue is equal - consider the cost in time and energy
- Define your own "enough" rather than endless growth
- Make decisions based on long-term sustainability, not just short-term profit
- Know when to walk away from money that costs too much in other ways

## 4. Data-Driven Decision Making

### Core Value
Informed decisions based on data lead to better outcomes than emotional reactions.

### Examples
- "*When you watch those patterns it gives more certainty so sometimes it can alleviate stress.*"
- "*Complacency and apathy about it and just like do the thing and then you realize that there's a pattern of a little less a little less a little less and it's much harder to try to correct what's happening.*"
- "*I would get really clear on those numbers. Okay, because they're intermingling and you are, it's obviously taking that brain space... either way, knowing is going to be really empowering.*"

### Related Principles
- Track what matters to identify patterns
- Create dashboards for quick visibility into business health
- Use data to inform intuition, not replace it
- Measure both lagging indicators (results) and leading indicators (actions)

## 5. Ethical Client Relationships

### Core Value
Business relationships should create mutual benefit and maintain integrity.

### Examples
- "*I've cut out a couple law firms that I know lie about their patients.*"
- "*As long as you know that you're being ethical about it, meaning there's nobody coming in, you're 100% sure they don't need to be reached out again, in which case you should tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up with this person so that you know you're operating in integrity.*"
- "*But ethically we're also helping the person who's busy who really doesn't want to deal with any of this.*"

### Related Principles

- Make decisions that you would be comfortable having publicized
- Consider the long-term impact of your business practices on clients
- Be willing to walk away from business that compromises your integrity

## 6. Sustainable Systems

### Core Value
Build systems that work long-term without constant intervention or exhaustion.

### Examples
- "*I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful.*"
- "*I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together.*"
- "*It reduces how much time, energy it takes and max profit margins.*"

### Related Principles
- Invest time upfront in building and optimizing systems
- Train people thoroughly rather than expecting them to figure it out
- Optimize existing processes before scaling
- Design systems that don't rely on any single person (including yourself)

## 7. Intentional Focus

### Core Value
Focus energy where it matters most rather than scattering attention across too many projects.

### Examples
- "*What you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much.*"
- "*Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission... but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep.*"
- "*that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it.*"

### Related Principles
- Make conscious decisions about what to pursue and what to ignore
- Understand the "why" behind your choices and actions
- Set boundaries around your time and energy
- Give yourself permission to explore while maintaining core commitments

## 8. Pragmatic Approach

### Core Value
Focus on what works practically rather than getting caught in perfectionism or theory.

### Examples
- "*I look at it and go huh maybe I'll try this put it in an experiment and then I'm not thinking about it anymore I don't worry about it.*"
- "*It's amazing for being email. I mean, I'm proud for that.*"
- "*But there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat.*"

### Related Principles
- Test and iterate rather than seeking perfect solutions
- Use what works even if it's not the most elegant solution
- Focus on results rather than appearance
- Break complex projects into manageable experiments

## 9. Collaborative Growth

### Core Value
Strategic partnerships can accelerate growth beyond what's possible alone.

### Examples
- "*The roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster if we're doing something together.*"
- "*To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too.*"
- "*Where you have friction is clarity... So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore?*"

### Related Principles
- Look for complementary skills in partnerships
- Leverage each other's strengths while supporting weaknesses
- Create structures where both parties can win independently and together
- Maintain sovereignty while collaborating

## 10. Continuous Adaptation

### Core Value
Staying flexible and willing to adapt is essential for long-term success.

### Examples
- "*If you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around.*"
- "*Let's say you make a reference from your existing group... those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission.*"
- "*Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do.*"

### Related Principles
- Create systems flexible enough to evolve as needs change
- Balance experimentation with commitment to core projects
- Make decisions that expand future options rather than limiting them
- Stay attuned to what's working and what isn't
