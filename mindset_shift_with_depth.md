# The Mindset Shift: You Actually Are Expert Enough

Let's be real for a minute. You're sitting there right now thinking, "Yeah, that all sounds nice, Tina, but I can't charge THAT much for what I do."

I see you. I've been in those shoes, staring at my price list, finger hovering over the keyboard, thinking about adding that extra zero but feeling like an absolute fraud.

But here's what you're not seeing: every time you undercharge, you're creating three massive problems that compound over time.

First, you're establishing an unsustainable effective hourly rate. When you charge $500 for something that takes 10 hours, that's $50/hour – before expenses, before taxes, before the admin time and client communication that aren't billable. After all that? You're looking at maybe $25/hour. Try building wealth on that. Try hiring help on that. Try taking a vacation on that. You can't. The math simply doesn't work.

Second, you're attracting exactly the wrong kind of clients. The ones who will haggle over $50. The ones who will demand endless revisions. The ones who will message you at 11 PM on a Saturday and expect an immediate response. When you price at the bottom, you get clients who see you as a commodity – and commodities are replaceable and disposable.

Third – and this is the one most people miss – you're delivering worse results. Yes, worse. Because when clients invest more, they show up differently. They do the work. They implement. They respect the process. The $300 client will skip calls, ignore homework, then blame you when they don't get results. The $3,000 client will move mountains to make the most of their investment.

I worked with Sean, a Facebook ads specialist who was charging $750/month to manage campaigns. He was working 60-hour weeks, had 22 clients (most of whom were unappreciative), and was making about $50,000 a year – while providing millions in revenue for his clients.

We tripled his rates to $2,250/month. You know what happened? He lost 17 clients. Terrifying, right?

But the 5 who stayed were his best clients. And within 60 days, he had added 3 new clients at the higher rate. His client load went from 22 to 8. His revenue went from $16,500/month to $18,000/month. And his work hours were cut in half.

The math changed everything. His effective hourly rate quadrupled. He went from running on a hamster wheel to building actual wealth.

And here's the kicker – his new clients got better results because they were actually implementing his recommendations. They weren't nickel-and-diming every suggestion. They trusted the process because they had skin in the game.

So when I tell you to raise your prices, it's not just about your bank account. It's about creating sustainable client relationships that energize rather than drain you. It's about working with people who value expertise over price. It's about building a business that can support your life instead of consuming it.

See, most unpaid experts don't yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. It's that gnawing voice in your head saying, "Who am I to charge for this? What if they find out I don't know EVERYTHING?"

But expertise isn't about knowing everything. It's about knowing more than your client and being able to get them results they couldn't achieve as quickly on their own.

Think about it this way: If your neighbor wants help with his computer because he's a "technoob" and you're awesome, he might offer to send over some killer BBQ when he grills this weekend instead of paying you.

Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you're okay with that. Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it.

But when it comes to charging actual money from strangers? Suddenly you're hemming and hawing and thinking maybe you should just do it for the "exposure" or the "testimonials" or whatever other BS excuse you've been telling yourself.

Here's the truth no one tells you: There are different clients out there with different values and different budgets. The mistake most entrepreneurs make is assuming everyone is price-sensitive.

They're not. Different avatars care about different things.

The budget buyer only cares about price. They'll find the cheapest option that meets minimum requirements and go with that. They'll haggle, they'll comparison shop, they'll jump ship the moment someone cheaper comes along.

The value buyer cares about getting good value for their money. They're not looking for the cheapest, but they want to feel they're getting more than they paid for. They'll do research, they'll read reviews, they'll consider multiple options.

The results buyer only cares about the outcome. If they believe you can get them the result they want, they'll pay. Period. They're not price-sensitive – they're results-sensitive. They just want to know, "Can you solve my problem faster or better than I can solve it myself?"

The experience buyer wants the premium treatment. They want to feel special. They want white-glove service. They want a brand they can brag about. They'll pay top dollar not just for the result but for how it feels to work with you.

Your job is not to be the right fit for everyone. Your job is to decide which avatar you want to serve, then price and position accordingly.

When I first started as a consultant, I charged $25 an hour. TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS. I had six years of corporate experience building systems that saved entire departments. I was good. I was fast. And I was charging less than a mediocre plumber.

Why? Because I didn't believe I was expert enough. Because I thought being the cheapest was the only way to compete. Because I didn't understand the different client avatars and how pricing signals value.

So I was attracting budget buyers who drained my energy, questioned every suggestion, and jumped ship the moment someone offered them a deal that was $50 cheaper. My effective hourly rate, after all the unbillable hours and stress, was probably $12.

It wasn't until I niched down, raised my rates, and positioned myself for results buyers that everything changed. Suddenly I was working with clients who trusted my expertise. Who implemented my suggestions. Who referred other great clients. My effective hourly rate shot up to over $300, and ironically, my clients got better results.

Why better results? Because when people pay more:
1. They take the work more seriously
2. They follow through on recommendations
3. They're typically more sophisticated and have more resources to implement
4. They don't waste your time with trivial concerns
5. They already believe in your expertise (or they wouldn't have paid)

This isn't just theory. I've seen it play out with hundreds of clients across dozens of industries. Pricing isn't just about money – it's about positioning, client selection, and the type of business you want to build.

The reality is, there is a ceiling on how many hours you can work. There is a ceiling on how efficient you can become. There is a ceiling on how many clients you can juggle. But there is no ceiling on how much you can charge if you're delivering tremendous value to the right clients.

So here's what you're going to do right now. Open your pricing sheet. Add that 10%. Feel the fear. Do it anyway. The only one saying no to your worth right now is you.

If you're thinking, "But my market can't afford higher prices!" – I'm calling BS. Your "market" isn't every broke person with a pulse. Your market is the people who value solutions enough to pay for them. It's the people who will get ROI from what you offer.

If someone pays you $1,000 and gets $10,000 in value, that's a bargain. If they pay you $100 and get no value because they don't implement, that's expensive.

Value isn't about the number on the invoice. It's about the transformation you create. And the right clients will pay for transformation all day long.

Stop leaving money on the table. Stop attracting clients who drain you. Stop creating unsustainable effective hourly rates that will burn you out.

You are expert enough. Your knowledge is valuable. And there are clients out there right now who would happily pay your worth if only you'd let them.

They're literally waiting for you while you're over here doubting yourself.

Don't make them wait any longer.
