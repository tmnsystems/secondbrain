One moment, my video, my sound isn't fun.\n00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNo, that was my fault.\n00:00:13 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, there you go.\n00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWe always need it.\n00:00:15 - Michael Fujinaka\nHow are you?\n00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nare you? Good.\n00:00:19 - Michael Fujinaka\nYou sleepy?\n00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHow's Esther doing?\n00:00:27 - Michael Fujinaka\nMore sleepy.\n00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nA lot. When the baby is a lot.\n00:00:35 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. She lost a lot of blood after the delivery. And it was really tough for them to control it. So she lost almost half half for over half of her blood. you. So she had to take a transfusion because she was like, every day her blood was going down like this. And she getting weaker and weaker and her heart was like changing so really well so yeah.\n00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nGood job for modern medicine if it wasn't for that then I would be dead many times over especially when it came to childbirth but even along before that so you know it's um as you know statistically we do really really well but childbirth is still traumatic.\n00:01:29 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah it took them over an hour to find where she was bleeding they had to get like a special tool and they couldn't find because she just kept trickling and trickling and trickling and trickling and they're like is this the uterus and then they found it was actually just terror just way up inside and uh god I was just like how do people at home birthing centers do this like it's crazy to me but they don't make it work I guess.\n00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWell they have backup doctors and hospitals for emergencies that's how. That's probably true. They know it for sure.\n00:02:01 - Michael Fujinaka\nThat's true.\n00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's I mean, almost every place. That's what you have to do is you have to have a backup plan and and every midwife has a doctor that they work with those that if there's an emergency, they've got established networks, just like you guys do with attorneys and things like that for what you have to do so that they're not having their patients go to somebody they don't know anything about I see back backup plans for everything we don't we don't do babies haphazardly yeah I'm gonna say okay so you sent a lot I've got this hair that just keeps poking me in the eye and it's itchy me and driving me nuts and anyway so I'm just gonna scratch my face.\n00:02:45 - Michael Fujinaka\ntime we're having a face to face it's I'll tell you it's much more and not intense but I'm like oh I really gotta be honest we can do we can do just audio and I like it. I like the face-to-face. I think it all it I feel I feel it more, you know, that accountability though You were wanting so if you could see that teena expression That's what I'm getting us in on.\n00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThank you My face doesn't lie It may tell you I'm holding something back, but it'll tell you a lot unfortunately it gets me in trouble So All right, so I've got my notes Um, let me just scan them again because I prepped them last night and see where I want to start with.\n00:03:39 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, okay. Thank for postponing our monday's call. Sorry.\n00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nnotified he's so late, but thank you This we are real people And as parents, this is one of the reasons I love working with parents or At least people that prioritize family is that um, you know flexibility matters. I'm very much a punctuality and respect time kind of person, but respect the person first and the time second, right?\n00:04:12 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo thank you.\n00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nReally, just good communication, if it's last second, it's not going to matter. But I would expect the same from you if I'm like last second on my daughter's having an issue, I need to go do this. So, but that is part of the things that I learned to do in business too, is make sure that the people that I work with on a regular basis, so like customers or patients wouldn't necessarily be the same thing, partners and anybody that you have like a consistent kind of energy exchange, you want to have at least compatible values. They don't have to be the same, but they have to be compatible so that the things that are important to you, you never feel like you have to apologize for. And likewise, that's a gift that you get to give to somebody else that reciprocity, right? that they know that they're safe with you and comfortable with you and I was one of the most liberating things that I ever did was change that in my practice and let's see how long has it been? I would say probably nine years and I've been doing this for 22 years, um really more aggressively. I mean honestly I fired, I fired my main client that I'd had for nine years last year so it's uh everything is iterative line-up online kind of kind of type of thing where you you we grow in degrees I guess it would be an even better way like you think about the way that the sun comes up and the illumination of the earth it is um by degrees literally degrees right? It comes up and you know that it's coming up and you can tell that it's coming up and you can at more light and you can feel that warmth like all of those things that the sun gives increases just slowly and so we grow the same way and it's important to keep that in mind because you can't rush the sun we can't really rush our growth either you can't skip a step it can't go from here to here it has to do the whole gamut so anyway uh these things okay so long version of glad we could be scheduled welcome to adac right anyway so i did review your sleep journal and um and your journal journal which my writing is pretty bad so i'm not judging but it was a little difficult i was like let's just say and i think i deciphered most of it but um let me move this over here so i can see i've written the journal like the same way i mean i started writing a journal when i was about six six or seven years old when i\n00:07:00 - Michael Fujinaka\nAll the way through college, I in college, continued it a little bit in med school, then stopped, continued it a little bit after I graduated when I was like 32, then I stopped. But yeah, I've written like my journal entries back when I was six years old, look almost exactly the same, like the content looks the same and it looks the same, it's really funny.\n00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's awesome.\n00:07:26 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, it's always been just a very narrative of like what I did, because if I remember what I did, I remember how I was feeling generally. I never really needed to put feelings in because that's how I remembered it, but yeah, so anyway, the content of it is almost the same as what I first started.\n00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWell, that tells you though how consistent you are. And I wouldn't say that you're not changing, but because that's a kind of core internal practice. that that shows your steadfastness, which I think is a very good quality, personally. So, let me go to my notes.\n00:08:14 - Michael Fujinaka\nI did cut out, I used to be obsessive about time stamping everything. I used to put like the time my mom would take me to school, what time my mom picked me up, what time we'd arrive home from school, what time I would start eating dinner, like it used to be crazy. Like with time stamp. So, you know, over the years, I've gotten better at like letting that part go.\n00:08:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nyeah. Do you have a tendency towards OCD type stuff or just? No. Just in that.\n00:08:41 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, just in the journal, I wanted to be super detailed about my life. No, and no other part of my that OCD.\n00:08:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut yeah. So, to acquire that practice at age six, what was that modeled for you?\n00:08:56 - Michael Fujinaka\nNo, I was, I think when I was five or six, I started. to fear death a lot. And I started to go to my dad and mom and I was like, don't want to die. And I was you talking about? And I was like, well, at the end of this life, you know, my experience, I'm going to get shut off like a TV. And, you know, I'm going to maybe I'll go to heaven or some spiritual place. My mom's Christian, my dad's Buddhist.\n00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI was like, well, I'm going go somewhere.\n00:09:22 - Michael Fujinaka\nRight. I like, I like this. I like, you know, I like this experience. I like this life. And I'm sad. I'm going to be sad when I leave it. And then, you know, we had the talks about live one dies and, you know, you go to a better place. And I was like, I want to remember this life. And I think when I was five or six, I started the journal as a way to feel like I, I had a good life or something.\n00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt makes perfect sense.\n00:09:50 - Michael Fujinaka\nI don't know the exact like reasoning, but I was like, yeah, I might go somewhere better. Heaven or, you know, the Buddhist Nirvana or whatever. But I want to, I like, I like this. I like my family now. like everything about this. So, yeah, that's, that's kind of why I started to feel like my life was, was a life that I remember. And that's why I started writing.\n00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou're kind of special foodie.\n00:10:17 - Michael Fujinaka\nI don't know.\n00:10:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou are. You are. kid. And any time we talk to Mark, it's only been a few times. he would tell me how smart and amazing Esther is too. So. Just a whole bunch of awesome foodies. Okay, so Look at this. Okay, so what I what I would like for me, you know, specifically, and I can, where did I write it down and the notes. Oh, and I realized I had sent you a a message. I thought it. I sent it got to my desk today and was like, oh, it's in my draft. So it's the big rocks video that I watched it.\n00:11:07 - Michael Fujinaka\nwas funny watching that lady getting tortured.\n00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nShe was like, I can't fit these rocks in. And you're really like about four minutes. Yeah.\n00:11:16 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, so I watched it and it was good. But we talked about it last the first visit, the first time I talked, I think we talked.\n00:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nRight. And that visual, though, just is kind of different because she was really aggressively trying to move things around and pack it in there. And it was not possible. And that's why I just thought it was such a powerful visual is that, because he told her what it was and what those things represented. And she's like, I have to get that in there. And then just couldn't make it happen because it had already been filled up with the little things, AKA the minutiae, right? So that's real life. I mean, he came up with that analogy and that visualization because. is that is what people do. And so the reason I love, even though we had discussed it, that visual will be in your mind forever more. And it may come up as something that you can teach and give to somebody else. But I love when we can, first of all, just draw a picture in our minds. But also when we can translate that picture to someone else because that is what we remember. When we're little, that's how we think. Anyway, we don't have words. We just have kind of pictures. anyway, glad that you watched that.\n00:12:38 - Michael Fujinaka\nIt's funny, like last night, I texted Mark super late. I woke up and something you said, you were pointing out things you asked in the email. Do you have a personal chef? Do you have a personal housekeeper, do you have a personal assistant? And then I responded to that. But then I texted Mark, was like, you know, I know I need to learn better. I've had two personal assistants. One for a year, the other one for, yeah, another one for about a year and a half. And like we gave it a go to get me to let go of the minutiae and to trust the personal assistant to take care of things like scheduling, booking, and through both of those, those personal assistants, I just have the hardest time letting, like still, first of all, I didn't give them enough tasks or enough things to do because I wasn't letting go. And so I texted Mark last night, was like, you know, that I've read that from Tina, like I gotta learn how to use a personal assistant, like I see people that I respect using personal assistants, I see the benefits, like, and then you sent me this video this morning, I was like, oh my God, and you know, like I gotta learn how to do this. So I'm gonna talk to my wife and Esther and, you know, see if we can go ahead and do the personal assistant thing again because, I know, I mean, I see the visual, I know, you know, important it is to learn to let go of the minutiae, let someone else handle it, and I've just straight up failed a lot. I think I got better, like with the second one, I started to let her plan more things, she started to, you know, help me with, when I was taking Uber, she helped me figure out the times and, you know, just little things that made it easier for me, but I think there's a lot more I can offload.\n00:14:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd so, let me combine a few things real quick. First of all, did I have you read Switch?\n00:14:36 - Michael Fujinaka\nDid you read it? Yeah, I'm listening to on an audiobook, so I'm about into about chapter seven now.\n00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHave you gotten to the experiment of the where they have the baked goods?\n00:14:49 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, the cookies one. Fine, will power.\n00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nFine, will power. Okay. Remember, though, that the difference was. So I was, I was tying the willpower specifically to cognitive function and the ability to process or basically just make decisions. Now if you're having to now, okay, so now imagine all decisions are the rocks and you've got the pebble decisions and you've got the big rock decisions. If you were the one that has to make all the pebble decisions, what does that mean about the big rock decisions?\n00:15:32 - Michael Fujinaka\nTargeted.\n00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, so are you familiar with the Pareto principle, the 80-20 rule?\n00:15:39 - Michael Fujinaka\nYes.\n00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, so this is part of how I've been able to let go of things myself because I'm a Virgo perfectionist with all these things, right? Firstborn daughter, I have the odds stacked against me, if you will, for being a control freak. definitely have that tendency. But, and this is how I've also been able to talk other clients and to let you go. When you think about everything that has to get done, if 80% of the results come from 20% of what we do, if my if that 20% is optimized and leveraged, and I'm functioning at the highest level, then that 20% that somebody else does, or that even that 80% that somebody else does, isn't that big of a deal? And maybe, maybe they do it 5% less than me, less well. Maybe they do it 15% less than me, less well than me. But because my power moves, because I'm freed up to make more of them mentally, energetically, because I'm more optimized, mentally, energetically, physically, Unfortunately, all of these different nuance of our personalities that go into how effective in each of our actions are, all of that is going to be better. And so whatever may suffer, the end result is that more is benefited. And the things that matter most, let's go back to the big rocks, right? Those things are there and they're the best versions of themselves as well. So they didn't just make it into the bowl. They made it into the bowl, refined and polished. That makes sense? But it depends on what kind of things you're doing and also who you hire. There's a lot to that too. So a personal assistant needs to be again, compatible values, compatible energy. And if they were interacting with you unestra, then it needs to be compatible with your entire family. So that automatically discounts many, many people. Hiring is especially this type of person. This is the kind of thing you wanna get really good at. And so it actually might be your hiring process. That was a bigger issue rather than your ability to let go. So a lot of times when somebody gets to this point, they just want it off their plates. Yay, yay, work, let's go, right? And then the other thing is not spending enough time on the front end, teaching, empowering, communicating, making sure that we're on the same page. And so just here's a list of things, do the best you can, kind of sink or swim, or here's a list of things. Here's some training, but not necessarily that I need you to communicate like this. I need you to understand that these are my values. So that you understand how to prioritize. by filtering through my values because you are the extension of me. So if you are not using my values to make the decisions on my behalf, which I have now deputized you to do.\n00:19:17 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, that's true.\n00:19:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's what I'm doing essentially, right? Exactly. Exactly. So the first thing is you have to start with what are your values. Now, fortunately, we've been already doing groundwork for that, right? Because you have a whole document of family values. You can have the same type of document when it comes to your time and your work. Like, this is how I communicate with people. I need it to be succinct, but I need it to be thorough. So don't give me half sentence answers and don't give me 10 paragraph answers, right? Three paragraphs, very clear.\n00:19:54 - Michael Fujinaka\nAlways wants the 10 paragraph. always want like the three sentence.\n00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Okay. So. Oh, this is how you, you, you call them that, right, but, but what you do. So let's say that's text, right? So when I, one of the things I teach people to do because I'm a with my ADHD, of all trades, I study everything for way too long. But, and as going through, so Perry menopause and brain fog with women and ADHD, it's like, I've had to work much harder to maintain in my cognitive function and my ability to focus. So I want thorough communication because I want to have the conversation once, have all the information I need and be empowered to go and get to work. Because I like to work, I like to build, I like to create, I want all my Legos together, I want to know what color, what parts, I want to know everything's there, and then don't talk to me I got building to do, you know. So, so I want the 10 page thing as well, but I want you to. to bold bullet points use formatting so that my brain can skim it first, see where the important things are so that when I come back to it, I don't have to go like this. Where was that one thing one detailing? Where's that one Lego that I wanted to put on top of this thing over here? I think I keep showing my nerdiness. But anyway, Legos.\n00:21:26 - Michael Fujinaka\nAnyway, last night with Emmy.\n00:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAwesome.\n00:21:31 - Michael Fujinaka\nWere they make a block spell? Yeah, we have the bigger ones for her. Yeah, I don't know what size they're the bigger sizes.\n00:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes.\n00:21:40 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo you blow.\n00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt's called a deep blow. Oh, yeah. Okay. So that's the thing. You want to train them to and also you want to know, look, are you looking for this long term? Because honestly, it makes more sense to hire somebody who wants to be doing this long term. So they get better and better at\n00:22:00 - Michael Fujinaka\ntheir job. And the last two that I've had, you know, we knew that like the first one we had, we knew she had about five to 10 year work life. then obviously it didn't work after a year and a half. And then the second one, she was more of a, she was definitely closer to like three to five years because she knew that she wanted to go back to school and three to five. So we were only expecting three to five out of her. But yeah, that one didn't work after about a year and a half.\n00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAlso, that's okay. So like even three to five years, because if they're good enough, then you let them know you're going to hire and train your replacement.\n00:22:33 - Michael Fujinaka\nThat's right. Yeah. So they both said, okay. And then we just never got up to that. But I think yeah, that what you just brought up. I mean, we actually bought a training course, how to work with a PA and it says all like what you said. But I think now hearing it again, I'm like, yeah, we probably didn't get the hire right first of all. And then we didn't lay, we thought we laid groundwork. mean, you should see the documents we have. yeah, I think starting at values, you know, we didn't have the Size quite enough and yeah, you're right. think laying the groundwork would work a lot better if we try and also So a personal assistant is a doer. They may not be a reader so much. They might not like to read long training documents So if you're hiring somebody and you didn't ask them how do you learn best?\n00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh, yeah, I didn't do that Do I need to demonstrate things for you?\n00:23:23 - Michael Fujinaka\nDo I know your love language when you're trying to date someone or something, right?\n00:23:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, because it is a human being that you're hiring With the personality and as much as they might want to do the job exactly the way you want to Their brain works the way their brain works their energy works.\n00:23:38 - Michael Fujinaka\nI believe they they wanted to help me but I like yeah, I couldn't Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think this is something and the other thing is they're both virtual And when I straight right talk, you know, there's a lot of things that we need unloaded and I think you saw that in the documents That it would be really helpful to have a local Yes, not even like someone here, but just somewhat in our area. So yeah, I'll talk to Esther and I think we should revisit this personal system.\n00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI would be happy to answer any questions. have any chance with you and Esther. Anyway, you would like to use me. Let me know because I'm here to support you and to the point of front-ending, front-loading, which basically means just there's a lot more work in the beginning and then you kind of smooth sailing down the road. When it comes to training a personal assistant, that's how I train, how I kind of approach coaching too. Like in the beginning, there's a lot more work to do. And then it's not so much maintenance because we continue to grow and evolve, but we've gotten the groundwork in. So like anything I'm doing with Mark now, there was so much data to acquire, especially with his firm. then the program that we used to track everything was not built intelligently by any means. And so the first year we spent trying to find replacements that didn't work, there is no such thing. Then there's, you know, do we build it or do we work with what we got? And then finally came to the decision, we're going to have to do the best with what we have. But that was a whole long process, like a year and a half. And so then, well, if we have to work with what we have, I'm not doing it. Are you doing it? I'm not doing it. Are you doing it? Okay, let's go find the person who wants to do it and who enjoys doing it and who's good at doing it. And that took almost three years to find from the time that we started. But again, that's the sun rising.\n00:25:51 - Michael Fujinaka\ntakes progress.\n00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt is. But in the meantime, we doubled, almost tripled, Everything doubled, we're almost tripled the revenue that's coming in. Now we haven't improved the profit margins that much, but again, you can do all the things it wants. You get this thing and then you get it to a maintenance level where it's now up here and then you get this thing and you bring it up here and now it's all working together and then you get the compounding effect, especially financially, here after a year. So that's where we're at right now. So if you want any, either additional calls or we use our weekly call and I help you with some personal assistance stuff, we can do more emails back and forth. There's all kinds of different things. So basically use me because this is a huge lever and an assistant.\n00:26:53 - Michael Fujinaka\nI think we're alluding to that and the family goals that, you know, the comments. And I think. You know, that comment you made about, do you have a personal chef, do you have a housekeeper? I mean, those are the things that me and Esther have been like, yeah, if we had one of those two things or both, that would just make a huge difference.\n00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nso I- life-changing for me. And when I first hired somebody to clean for me, I couldn't afford it. But what happened was, and it was a lesson that has stuck with me repeatedly and is ingrained into my brain, and it was that 80, 20 rule kind of thing. was two things. There was the energy saved in doing the work. And then there was the energy boost from having it done really well and done consistently. Yeah. I never even had to think about it.\n00:27:48 - Michael Fujinaka\nBut I also- We have a housekeeper every other week. So it's that, oh, that what you just said, like Esther and I, like that boost, we're so happy when the house is clean, and like we're not spending our life life force cleaning like we've had it for like a help. We've had a housekeeper now where a house cleaner for about two years now. But I feel you on that.\n00:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nfeel you. But I would I felt guilty at first because I will you know I was poor growing up but that wasn't really the issue. It's the the sense of humility and so like I had money issues too and I think I said this in the beginning I felt like money was bad because you know that's the thing that poor people tell themselves to make themselves feel better about being where they're at is that people with money are evil and or that they think they're too good for them and I also lived in gang and violence areas and one of the things that people use crabs in a pot you know pulling each other down to keep somebody from going up is calling them a cell which was like the worst thing that you could be is you you you sold out to somebody else. else and you left your people. And I got to a point where my friends changed. And that was really difficult for me, but it wasn't because I thought that I was better than anybody else. And I wasn't ashamed of where I came from. I wasn't ashamed with who I knew. What it was was that I had to craft my environment to be conducive to the goals that I had. So, if my environment and that meant the people in it, the things that I see, the messages that I get subconsciously but visually, audibly, every single day, the things that I see here smell think. Every day are either going to support or hinder my goals. And so, making those modifications, having the clean house, and then also learning how to evaluate better. So, having a clean house is very valuable, but who doesn't? doesn't really doesn't make an impact at the end of the day.\n00:30:03 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. And I'm not totally on the same page as you she I didn't grow up that like that but Esther did and that it was a struggle when we first did it but yeah now oh yeah we're like we're all about it that's why like when you called that out on the on our goals like we could see like if we can get someone in here more of a permanent housekeeper instead of every other every other week we can imagine like how much that would help us and we can imagine how much having someone cleaning our dishes just cleaning our dishes let alone cooking the meals we can do two things right there and also as like because I was all I wanted to be Fuji was a mom that was it but to be a mom is cooking clean and nurture and soft and always present and when I got to the point where I didn't enjoy\n00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nit cooking and cleaning anymore, but it wasn't because I don't actually enjoy that or doing that for my family. It's because I really enjoy using my brain. I really enjoy the higher level ways that I serve my kids. I love learning. I was in Honors in AP English when I was in high school and I got to, I think my first Honors class and my teacher was like, okay, we're reading Jane error. I was like, I already read it. Do I have to read it again? He's like, when did you read it? I said this summer. He's like, you read it on your own time and it wasn't assigned to you. And I said, yeah, he's just like, that's weird, but okay, whatever. So my point is that like, I've always been a little bit weird too. I like deeper things and being able to do that and balance out the other or aspects of my personality, you know, and know that one isn't better or worse than the other or more important or anything like that. So frequency, definitely. The other thing is, so go to 80-20 rule, about your energy, think about how much money it costs, and then the other thing sometimes is just even having somebody present in the home when you've got kids, so you definitely want somebody who fits in kind of well and doesn't make you feel like I wish they would hurry up and get done and get out of the house. Okay, because you don't want to be like, well, I don't want the housekeeper to come today because you know, like, I just don't want to deal with her here or that type of thing. So really kind of having a conversation about the personality, so back to hiring this type of person as well. Somebody that likes kids, somebody that is energetically aware, like, oh, you need me to not chat with you today and just get to work. Or if they're having a bad day, they know to check their problems at the door.\n00:33:14 - Michael Fujinaka\nThat's a really good point.\n00:33:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. So you want somebody that but the benefit of that too is that because that person is not going to take energy away from you while you maintain them, they're only going to either balance it, right? Because if you deal with a lot of people, they're now, they might have clean the kitchen and giving you that energy, but dealing with them was so tense that you're like, I would have rather do this with myself, right?\n00:33:43 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo we're trying to figure out like, should we combine, should we try to find a combined housekeeper and cook, or should we hire two separate people? Two separate people.\n00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. I'll tell you why. First of all, if that person The person's not feeling good, on vacation, whatever. You've got two people down and out, two functions. So you don't want to do that because that's too much of an impact to you energetically. not only do you have to do the cooking, but you also have to do the cleaning, which we can go like, oh, big deal, I got a cook and I clean. It is a big deal when you have a system and you have a routine. And those things, just a mental load of trying to figure out how you fit it into the day and what are you going to eat for dinner? How long is it going to take to cook it? What do you have the ingredients? All of these things, when you're a person that makes decisions constantly, there's a thing called decision fatigue. And moms have it constantly because we are always thinking about all the things. We don't compartmentalize as well as men do the way that they think. So we're always making decisions. Sometimes ones we really. don't even have to make. We're having hypothetical conversations in our heads about conversations, making hypothetical decisions all day long and wearing ourselves out with stuff that's not even real. But we're ready in a second if it does come real because we already thought about it a hundred different ways.\n00:35:19 - Michael Fujinaka\nThat's a good explanation of what Esther does.\n00:35:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt's not just Esther. It's women and then if she happens to also have ADHD, times like a hundred.\n00:35:32 - Michael Fujinaka\nI don't know if she does. I don't think she has ADHD. I think I have it more than her, but I don't.\n00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt shows up different in women, by the way. A lot of women have been undiagnosed because it shows up so different. And the reason it shows up differently in women is because we're not allowed to behave the way men do. That's true. And it's changing, but we're still roomed differently. Esther's have a generation where that would still apply. behavior I was not as tolerated as in young women as it is in young men. They'll be like, boys will be boys. They will be like girls will be girls. No, no girl. You better get that going around to fix it. Right? So, um, yeah.\n00:36:16 - Michael Fujinaka\nreally, really, really go ahead. I think that's great. think, uh, I think that's kind of the confirmation I needed. We, we had me after we did the family goals. I did start looking for a personal chef, just kind of laying the ground work on thumbtack and then, uh, I guess the thing that worries us about the housekeeper is we are, we don't tend to have that much in our house. Like, you know, we were thinking, well, maybe we do the housekeeper once a week instead of every other week and then make us feel better. when we looked at like the daily house, because I was thinking, well, let's get a daily housekeeper and a daily chef. I don't think you need that.\n00:36:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh. Small.\n00:37:00 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay.\n00:37:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes. And grow as you need to grow.\n00:37:05 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay.\n00:37:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI see. Because what you'll find is that, because it isn't intrusive to have somebody come in your home. Yeah. And if they're doing something for you, it's disruptive at the very least. Because they're not part of the family, they won't permanently be part of the family. It is a blip in the dynamic throughout the day.\n00:37:25 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah.\n00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's what we're working. So what you're looking for is, again, back to the 80-20 role. How much is your 20-80 that you really need to be looking at?\n00:37:36 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo just going to once a week may actually be all the impact that you want. Okay. Yeah. And that wouldn't be too hard to adjust from the current. Our housekeeper has been begging to come every week. She's like, you know, if I came every week, you know, I'd be faster.\n00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nEverything would be better.\n00:37:52 - Michael Fujinaka\nYes.\n00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBecause now she gets to maintain instead of having to be clean every other week.\n00:37:59 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. She said to be cheap. for visit. And I was like, how is that possible? then, okay, I see it's maintaining and catching up or yep. All right. No, I think that's great. I think that's really simple. Thank you.\n00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI think that's really simple. We can implement that quickly. See how it feels. Exactly.\n00:38:15 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay, great. Thanks.\n00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nso now for the cooking cooking, I can tell you that one of my favorite things that I did was get a meal service. I use hungry root, but I've tried my kids are picky. I'm kind of picky with the foods that I have, but I wanted it to taste good. And I want variety. I don't think any of them have a ton of variety. So you may even like go with one week and a different one a different week. And that's not how most people do it, because they think, Oh, no, I have a service. No, you can control the frequency that you get things you can control how much you get. they'll have menus and you can get things that are pretty much pre made. All you do is to heat it up either in the pan oven or microwave.\n00:39:03 - Michael Fujinaka\ntried several. We tried, mean, we probably tried six.\n00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLike we tried the purple one. We tried HelloFresh.\n00:39:10 - Michael Fujinaka\nMore in the boxes like you're talking about. we've moved to Go Methodology and there's a couple, another one we use. But yeah, we have that already. Esther, we, Esther prefers cooked, like cooked here.\n00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes.\n00:39:27 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay. So yeah, what we have, we have two mail services like you're talking about.\n00:39:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo you can also, there are some people that will like, they'll cook at their house and then bring it to you fresh. Yeah, she wants it.\n00:39:43 - Michael Fujinaka\nMade here. Yeah. So that's, and that's, that was the big thing about like, because Go Methodology is like fantastic. very little sodium, fresh ingredients, hits all the boxes for us, very, you know. But yeah, she, she wants it. She prefer, well, the other thing is too, the cleanup. Even with go methodology, like it comes in its own packaging and stuff.\n00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nRight.\n00:40:05 - Michael Fujinaka\nYou it out of there, but she wants it on a plate, right? So we end up with plates. I think that energy of cleaning the kitchen and making it spotless, that's the part where we think if we have a personal chef, we'd expect them to do that. And so that was another reason to here. And then you clean up after yourself, you know, or something.\n00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo what if you had one three or four times a week?\n00:40:29 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay.\n00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nTo start with what I'm saying is just play with this schedule. don't have to go seven days a week. Maybe you do five, but you can. There's nothing wrong with it. What I'm saying is allow yourselves to explore. Okay. And be okay with it. And when you hire somebody, let them know, you know, like, like a 30-day connoisseurial period to see how it goes. But be really clear about what your needs are, what your goals are, and be really clear. about asking them what theirs are, because you don't want them to just say yes, so they get the job. Just tell them, I'd rather have hired the right person the first time and keep them around, but that means that you need to be wanting this job for a long time and wanting to work together for a long time, but because I'm in an exploratory kind of phase, I need to know if you're open to that.\n00:41:31 - Michael Fujinaka\nI see, okay, I rarely do that, and I think that's really the higher finding out their values and then see.\n00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThey're coming into your home, you definitely want to know a little bit about this.\n00:41:44 - Michael Fujinaka\nRight, yeah, everything you say makes sense.\n00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nFuji, you have so many things to think about all the time anyway. That's the thing. Also, I'm a lot older than you, or at least a good amount older. but you probably like 15, I don't know, how old are you?\n00:42:04 - Michael Fujinaka\nProbably 29.\n00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\n39, okay, so I'm not as much older than you, I thought. I'm 47, but still, I'm telling you those roughly 10 years, that's a huge amount of growth difference, especially after most of my children are grown, half of them are grown, ones about to be, so I'm getting there. But there is so much learning that happens in these next 10 years, and it probably continues to go like that. I guess it just depends on how much you're trying to accomplish in life. But there's a lot to it, and we're not trained on how to manage all of these things. So, you know, there's no, I mean, think about, did you just know how to be a doctor? No, and nobody just knows how to be a mom or dad. Like, you don't. Anything worth knowing or doing, and anything that... great and exceptional. We find mentors for or we really earn our stripes and do it the hard way. I prefer the mentor program.\n00:43:10 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, I mean, when Mark told me about this, you know, I obviously never had a coach. But then I started to think back to the times I did have coaches, you know, sports.\n00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's where I always had coaches.\n00:43:23 - Michael Fujinaka\nAnd I was like, oh, yeah, and I told you at the first one, I always thought, you know, if someone was going to coach me, they would have to be like, Mark, right? I see that their revenue is ridiculous. They're operations specialist like I want to be. And I always had that like, oh, that had to be my coach. But then I thought that my best coach is, you know, high school, they weren't necessarily better than me. You know, they weren't necessarily a world champion. But they knew how to get it out of me. then that's what I mean to all you. I was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. If she can make me, if she could bring that out of me, that's all I want.\n00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI have a professional extract.\n00:44:01 - Michael Fujinaka\nIt I in the right course with the spreadsheet because you were kind of saying, hey, let's dump a dump a lot of your tasks and I didn't really go that deep into it. But is am I on the right track about how I'm doing it?\n00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI hadn't left it this yet.\n00:44:22 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay. It was just it was the profit driver.\n00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. The timesheet. Yeah, this is this is really powerful when we do it. Um, let's see.\n00:44:32 - Michael Fujinaka\nI just populated like one or two in each thing, but if I'm doing it right, I'm going to go deeper, but it just. Yes. Let me make sure I'm doing it right.\n00:44:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes.\n00:44:44 - Michael Fujinaka\nThis is right.\n00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. right. Um, so the things to eliminate. Let's see. Well, because this is 12 years old, I have, but I'm kind of revisiting it and wanting to change it. You do, but don't love and they don't add value to life, I should not get any value. So daily YouTube though, the thing that I'm wondering is, does it really not add any value to your life? Do you go there intentionally or do you just kind of scroll and do you learn anything because everybody does YouTube differently?\n00:45:39 - Michael Fujinaka\nI like the dopamine hit, I don't know what you call it, but it's like I like that little satisfaction is seeing exactly something that's interesting to me. So a lot of times I go to look at jujitsu, right, like I put in here, jujitsu is all over this spreadsheet, but like I see it. So I go there to, I go to YouTube and I like look at the latest, like usually there's like a fight once a week or, you know, there's a big match or tournament. So I go to watch the fights and then after the fights, I like, I go down a rabbit hole of like the moves that I saw that I want to emulate next time I go into Jiu Jitsu.\n00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo do you really think that that's something to eliminate, that that's not valuable to you? But I don't talk about values, how valuable and how much do you value Jiu Jitsu?\n00:46:29 - Michael Fujinaka\nI value it a lot, but the YouTube and the watching doesn't really give me anything. I purchase instructional and I have like hours of instructional that I'm working through.\n00:46:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo like that's what I'm focusing on.\n00:46:43 - Michael Fujinaka\nThe YouTube pieces are literally just for dopamine. see a cool thing and I'm like, oh, I want to try that next time, but I already have like what I'm working on to get better on through my instructional that I bought. So I know that the YouTube is just for like pleasure.\n00:46:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt's purely Just like, okay, but is there no value and pleasure?\n00:47:07 - Michael Fujinaka\nNo, I mean, I think I think we all have to have fun and stuff to look forward to. It's not.\n00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWhere I'm getting it.\n00:47:15 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah.\n00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThere's a lot of things that we get from that. That's it could be ideas, could be energy, could be motivation. It could just be pleasure and it could just be dopamine. But we need dopamine. It serves a function. It's there for a reason. Now, not being a master of that dopamine process, acquiring process, that's an issue. Then you're an addict, right?\n00:47:45 - Michael Fujinaka\nThen it controls you. don't control it.\n00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo you can give yourself 10 minutes day. When 10 minutes is up, even if the video isn't over, you can save the video for the next 10 minutes if you want to, but you cut it off. And now you're in control. serve you, you don't serve it. That's all that needs to happen. Everything should be in service to us. We are not in service to it. People we can serve, but things serve us.\n00:48:14 - Michael Fujinaka\nInteresting. Okay. Yeah, I can make that switch. think I wouldn't mind doing 20 minutes a day. don't think that's terrible for me and I believe that I should have little bit. But yeah, I think maybe setting a little limit is what I'm hearing, like decide on an amount and then give myself that and not feel bad about it. Because I do feel bad when I do it, but I still do it for like, but yeah, I think if I had a time that I allocated, okay, that would probably feel good.\n00:48:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Yes. And what happens when we feel good with that's energy, right? That's energy. what do we do with the energy?\n00:48:52 - Michael Fujinaka\nWhatever we want to.\n00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut if we're purposely creating good energy.\n00:48:56 - Michael Fujinaka\nlike, I think last week, we talked a little bit about energy sandwiches just for a second. Yeah, yeah.\n00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. Something that you really like, especially if you don't get to have it as much as you want to, creates a lift and energy when you finally do get to have it. Now you get dopamine and probably little oxytocin, because you're like, I finally get it. Either way, that's something that you can use strategically to place it as a reward, because that's what dopamine is, that's the reward center of the brain, right? For having accomplished something, you didn't want to do what had to do. So instead of just having it there and doing it whenever you feel like, or doing it because it's the end of the day, put it in a place in your day where you want and need a lift and energy. And now you still get it. But again, you're using it and powerfully, it's not using\n00:50:00 - Michael Fujinaka\nWell, that's interesting to like actually schedule a time when I know there's like intense work for an hour Yeah, that is like my sandwich Let's go Okay, that's great, I'll have to look at these notes. I heard a lot of really cool things like yeah the incremental Change in our housekeeper very simple to do looking for maybe a meat like a personal chef That's not like seven days a week, but maybe just three days a week or two days a week even like an incremental improvement I really like that and then for both for fall especially the new hire for the chef is really about digging into the values Of them making sure they align with what we expect. I like I will spend more time on that. love that Yeah Because the house is probably primarily more Esther's domain\n00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd make sure that she's very active in driving that her happiness, speaking of feeding energy in that domain and that space is probably going to be more impactful than you being happy with it. Not to say that your happiness doesn't matter, but if you're not home as much, and it depends on if you're always home for dinner, then it's going to be as impactful for you too. You know what I mean, but she's the one around the preppy, and she's going to be the one around. Yeah. see what you're saying there.\n00:51:35 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. Okay. That's good.\n00:51:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. So, and also, I bring in my AI note taker to these so I can always give you summaries, has action items that has just kind of the main highlight points.\n00:51:52 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. I saw it last time and it's like, oh, that's good.\n00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. Cool. Can share that with you. So, yes, please continue to do this. And then all Also step two, um, I don't know if you saw the second tab.\n00:52:06 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo interesting.\n00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes.\n00:52:09 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, now there's a score.\n00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI see. Mm-hmm.\n00:52:12 - Michael Fujinaka\nAll right. Yeah, I'll start working on this. Oh boy. Yeah, this is uh, okay. Let's get into it.\n00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou guys are doing doing it.\n00:52:22 - Michael Fujinaka\nThat's what we'll So you want me to finish step one and step two by next, uh, but okay.\n00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, great. could do that. I think I gave you, if I didn't give you a due date, I do have one, um, next Friday. Oh, yeah. Okay. let me share these notes with you Fuji. Oui Fuji. All right. So these are my call notes, um, and, uh, let me, let me see how I want to, you know what, don't worry about it. You, you can read my notes. but really it's going to be you need to worry about what's in AI notes.\n00:53:04 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, I don't need to see your notes, okay. AI notes is fine. I saw them last time the AI notes were great.\n00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThey helped me. So I wanted to have the time sheet homework done by actually not so 726. That's next Friday, right? Yeah, by 3 p.m. because I don't want it cutting into your weekends.\n00:53:25 - Michael Fujinaka\nSure.\n00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, I'm serious and time stay up like you have to be like I'm done. Or else what happens?\n00:53:34 - Michael Fujinaka\n$90.\n00:53:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWhere are we? I'm at a massage cost. Yeah. Yep, that's right. Okay, so we're almost out of time. But this is good. Again, think about the sun rising, you know, like it just has to follow its path and all of these things are important. I really do want you to log food. Do you use like my fitness power or anything like that? I would really like you to do that. I really want to see how where your macros are at. I want to see where your proteins at, where your fat fat, what type of fats you're having. we're getting into sleep, these things matter. Okay. If we want to optimize sleep. because looking at your journal, your sleep journal, you had a few nights that were substantially different than the rest. Yeah. And I didn't see enough in your journal to figure out if there's anything in there, but for three nights to send out the way that they did. And what was it? was deep sleep was different.\n00:54:49 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, that next day was awful. After the deep sleep, it was awful. No, there was, I think it was like July. Friday, Friday night was just I think hospital.\n00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, it's the hospital that night is just terrible. Yeah.\n00:55:08 - Michael Fujinaka\nSo okay, that was just the format. Okay, just real quickly. That's how I did it. I did the iPhone sleep app on top. And then I did my or ring on the bottom.\n00:55:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, what I would like. Are you using your iPhone or your watch? Okay, I would love you to get the app called sleep watch. And then we'll compare the two data.\n00:55:35 - Michael Fujinaka\nThe problem with that one is I had to turn it on when I go to sleep. I thought, is that not right?\n00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\ndon't know. No, you have to sleep with your watch, but it automatically. Oh, okay, auto sleep. So there's two apps. I forgot that they work together. So auto sleep.\n00:55:53 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, a kid track. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, because I have the app. Oh, it does have. Okay. It does have. So it has been tracking.\n00:56:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWell, we just green shot in text to me real quick.\n00:56:04 - Michael Fujinaka\nYep.\n00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI want to see that.\n00:56:08 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, so, okay, so it has been checking. So do you want me to replace the iPhone one with this one?\n00:56:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, please.\n00:56:20 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay, so don't, so you want to see the aura because we want to compare aura. Yes. The apples native. Sleep app used sleep watch data.\n00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nCan you I actually want to see the bottom like it gets cut off and I want to see the bottom part there.\n00:56:39 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay, the pattern.\n00:56:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo like how much rust will sleep and.\n00:56:47 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, where's that? Oh, that part.\n00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. So you want to screen shot like this. Yes. Yes.\n00:56:54 - Michael Fujinaka\nOkay.\n00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nwant to see what your heart rate dip is.\n00:57:00 - Michael Fujinaka\nwant to see. see where heart rate is. Oh, wait, that's lower down.\n00:57:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou want that part? Yeah, I want to see everything.\n00:57:06 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, OK, so how do I can I?\n00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOK, so just a screenshot. Um, so if you let me let me go look at mine real quick. Really what I want to.\n00:57:22 - Michael Fujinaka\nHere's I sent you a third one. And the third one that's coming is their compilation. Is that what you want?\n00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's exactly what you're talking about. You're% dip is good. 57% rest will sleep is OK. Your heart rate. Wow. And your respiratory rate. That's good.\n00:57:46 - Michael Fujinaka\nOh, this was this was not good. This was a this was yes. This is what two nights ago or no. This is Wednesday.\n00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI can't tell I'll play around with this more now that I know that it's tracking.\n00:57:57 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah. OK, but I think this is that was when we were in the house. but when she was two nights ago, or I guess it was last night.\n00:58:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\n15 recovering well, everybody's recovering well.\n00:58:08 - Michael Fujinaka\nYeah, she's good now, and I'm just here to support her when she's done. You want me to get that picture into the Google sleep journal? Yes, please, that'd be then in addition, use the aura so we can prepare ordering.\n00:58:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, yes. Excuse me, thank you. One thing I want to know, and you don't have to answer this now, but ideally, when do you think work should be done each day, so ponder this, it will be in the AI notes. What constitutes a work window, meaning if you're on your phone and nobody's around and you're in the kitchen, can you send off an email? Can you check some stats, can you do whatever? and what constitutes it not violating family time, right? For example, maybe it's bath time, Esther's like, I don't need you, I don't want you, babies are taken care of. For the most part with two kids you'll probably be useful, but that's something to consider. constitutes a work window in the evening and what constitutes violating or not violating family time? And also my experience as a business owner and as a mom and the one who's doing all the things, my brain doesn't get to shut off because it's 5 p.m. And if I have to wait until the next day to get some of this stuff out of my head, I get frustrated. So I need a little tiny work window to get things out of my brain. But what I would like you to consider is that if you have a work window in the evening that it is very strategic only, it cannot be reactive. So there's two times of the day I don't want you to be in a reactive state which means no email, no reading email. You can originate an email, you can start an email, you can schedule an email and I don't and I only would want you to schedule if it's at night to go out the next day so it doesn't appear like you're available to talk and somebody hits you back and be like oh I we don't want it you know that's your time. So but evening time could be a good time for planning out big rocks for the next day for just kind of prioritizing so that you get or even just kind of creating problem solving, making list of things you want to research specifically. Speaking of research you should not be doing keyword research and SEO you should be hiring somebody for that. You can do that really inexpensively we can talk about that leader. you know, hiring somebody to do that 15 years ago would have been very different, but now the skill and the opportunities to hire somebody inexpensively, that really should not be what you're doing. So there are way more powerful things that that brain could be working on than keyword research. So that's part of also the time sheet homework and why I need you to do that. So I don't even remember all the things that we've said. Those are the assignments we'll give you. I know so we can gather more from there, but do consider what the evening should look like. When is the work cut-off period? Is there just a window cut-off period and then you get to work for another 30 minutes to an hour? I would not do more than an hour, 30-45 minutes of just strategic planning is probably going to help your brain to be able to just kind of unload and to get into your own world and space for a little bit maybe. well before bedtime so that it's it's got time to have a buffer and your brain can slow down so you can sleep but yeah so much to do so much to work on it takes time can't rush it can't do all the things at once so just keep at it and you're gonna look back a year from now with your two beautiful babies and just go this is good feeling better more peaceful lots more help around the house hopefully yeah let me know um you know if you guys have questions i don't know when you'll get to hiring because there's a lot of stuff going on with the baby and just recovering but feel free to use me and and i'm here to help you\n","contentPreview":"00:00:02 - Michael Fujinaka\nGood morning.
